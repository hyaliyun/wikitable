The United States also participated in the subsequent negotiations of modifications to the treaty from 1990 to 1994. The UNCLOS came into force in 1994. Although the United States now recognizes the UNCLOS as a codification of customary international law, it has not ratified it. UNCLOS, also called the Law of the Sea Convention or the Law of the Sea Treaty, defines the rights and responsibilities of nations in their use of the world's oceans; it establishes guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine natural resources. To date, 167 countries and the European Union have joined the Convention. History UNCLOS III = Sea areas in international rights (Top view) The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) was convened from June to August in Caracas, Venezuela in 1974. The most significant issues which were covered were setting limits, navigation, archipelagic status and transit regimes, exclusive economic zones (EEZs), continental shelf jurisdiction, deep seabed mining, the exploitation regime, protection of the marine environment, scientific research, and settlement of maritime boundary disputes. With more than 160 nations participating, the Conference continued until its final meeting in late 1982, at which time the final act was signed and the Convention was opened for signature. As time went on, it became clear that the United States, among other developed states, was not willing to agree to Part XI of the Convention concerning deep seabed portions and mining of potentially valuable metals.Roger Rufe, President of the Ocean Conservancy. Statement before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, October 21, 2003. The United States objected to Part XI of the Convention on several grounds, arguing that the treaty was unfavorable to American economic and security interests. The U.S. claimed that the provisions of the treaty were not free-market friendly and were designed to favor the economic systems of the Communist states. The U.S. also argued that the International Seabed Authority established by the Convention might become a bloated and expensive bureaucracy, due to a combination of large revenues and insufficient control over what the revenues could be used for. The United States accepted all but Part XI as customary international law. In March 1983 President Ronald Reagan, through Proclamation No. 5030, claimed a 200-mile exclusive economic zone. In December 1988 President Reagan, through Proclamation No. 5928, extended U.S. territorial waters from three nautical miles to twelve nautical miles for national security purposes. However a legal opinion from the Justice Department questioned the President's constitutional authority to extend sovereignty as Congress has the power to make laws concerning the territory belonging to the United States under the U.S. Constitution. In any event, Congress needs to pass laws defining if the extended waters, including oil and mineral rights, are under State or Federal control. =Revision of the UNCLOS= From 1983 to 1990, the United States attempted to establish an alternative regime for exploitation of the minerals of the deep seabed. An agreement was made with other seabed mining nations and licenses were granted to four international consortia. Concurrently, the Preparatory Commission was established to prepare for the eventual coming into force of the Convention-recognized claims by applicants, sponsored by signatories of the Convention. Overlaps between the two groups were resolved, but a decline in the demand for minerals from the seabed made the seabed regime significantly less relevant. In addition, the decline of Socialism and the fall of Communism in the late 1980s had removed much of the support for some of the more contentious Part XI provisions. In 1990, consultations were begun between signatories and non-signatories (including the United States) over the possibility of modifying the Convention to allow the industrialized countries to join the Convention. The resulting 1994 Agreement on Implementation was adopted as a binding international Convention. It mandated that key articles, including those on limitation of seabed production and mandatory technology transfer, would not be applied, that the United States, if it became a member, would be guaranteed a seat on the Council of the International Seabed Authority, and finally, that voting would be done in groups, with each group able to block decisions on substantive matters. The 1994 Agreement also established a Finance Committee that would originate the financial decisions of the Authority, to which the largest donors would automatically be members and in which decisions would be made by consensus. Thus, modifications to that provision were negotiated, and an amending agreement was finalized in July 1994. The U.S. signed the Agreement in 1994 and now recognizes the Convention as general international law, but has not ratified it at this time. UNCLOS entered into force in November 1994 with the requisite sixty ratifications. =Latest developments= On April 24, 2004 Jeane Kirkpatrick (Reagan Administration United Nations Ambassador 1981‚Äì1985), testified against United States ratification of the treaty before the Senate Armed Services Committee, in which she argued that \\"Viewed from the perspective of U.S. interests and Reagan Administration principles, it was a bad bargain,\\" and that \\"its ratification will diminish our capacity for self-government, including, ultimately, our capacity for self-defense.\\"Jeane J. Kirkpatrick. Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. April 8, 2004. On April 11, 2006, the 5-Member UNCLOS Annex VII Arbitral Tribunal, presided over by H.E. Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, rendered after two years of international judicial proceedings, the landmark Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award, which resolved the maritime boundary delimitation (in the East, Central and West sectors) to satisfaction of both Parties and committed Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago to resolve their fisheries dispute by means of concluding a new Fisheries Agreement. On May 15, 2007, U.S. President George W. Bush announced that he had urged the Senate to approve UNCLOS.President's Statement on Advancing U.S. Interests in the World's Oceans. Office of the Press Secretary. May 15, 2007. On September 20, 2007, an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under UNCLOS issued its decision on a longstanding maritime boundary dispute between Guyana and Suriname, which contained a ruling blaming both nations for violating treaty obligations.\\"Guyana/Suriname.\\" Permanent Court of Arbitration. September 2007. On October 31, 2007, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 17‚Äì4 to send the treaty to the full U.S. Senate for a vote. On January 13, 2009, speaking at her Senate confirmation hearing as nominee for U.S. secretary of state, Senator Hillary Clinton said that ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty would be a priority for her.Transcript of Hillary Clinton's Confirmation Hearing. Council on Foreign Relations. January 13, 2009. On May 23, 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and argued for the ratification of the treaty. The Law of the Sea Convention (Treaty Doc. 103-39): The U.S. National Security and Strategic Imperatives for Ratification During the same hearing, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Martin Dempsey also urged swift ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty. On June 14, 2012, The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations held the so-called \\"24 Star\\" hearing, featuring six four-star generals and admirals representing every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Each witness, including the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Chief of Naval Operations; Commandant of the Coast Guard; Commander of U.S. Transportation Command; Commander of U.S. Northern Command; and Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, testified in favor of ratifying the treaty. On June 28, 2012, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute (API), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and Verizon Communications testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that the Law of the Sea Treaty would strengthen the U.S. economy and help create American jobs. On July 16, 2012, 34 Republican Senators signed a letter to U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry pledging to vote against the treaty. Because treaty ratification in the U.S. requires 2/3 of the United States Senate to vote for approval, the 34 signatories are enough to stop treaty ratification. However, Senator Lisa Murkowski later said that the vote to deny passage in 2012 was purely political and that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce would deliver enough Republican votes for passage in the lame-duck session.Colman, Zack. \\"Republican senator says sea treaty might pass after election.\\" The Hill, 17 August 2012. Debate Jim Inhofe, against In the United States there has been vigorous debate over the ratification of the treaty, with criticism coming mainly from political conservatives who consider involvement in some international organizations and treaties as detrimental to U.S. national interests. A group of Republican senators led by Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma blocked American ratification of the Convention, claiming that it would impinge on U.S. sovereignty. Other commentators have argued that although the Bush administration, the Pentagon and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee favored ratification,Andrew C. Revkin, \\"As Polar Ice Turns to Water, Dreams of Treasure Abound.\\" NY Times. 10-10-2005, other U.S. congressional committees possessing oversight jurisdiction have yet to undertake an open, transparent and substantive public review of this most complex treaty's significant environmental regulatory and judicial enforcement provisions, their relationship to the provisions of other multilateral environmental treaties, and the need to amend U.S. federal environmental, wildlife, chemicals and offshore drilling laws and/or regulations in order to implement the international legal obligations the U.S. would assume upon ratification of UNCLOS.Lawrence A.

Accessed May 13, 2009. It stands on the east bank of the Yukon River, downstream of the town of Dawson City. The fort was established in 1874 by Fran√ßois Mercier, Jack McQuesten, and Francis Barnfield for the Alaska Commercial Company to serve as a trading post. Trading at Fort Reliance continued uninterrupted until 1877. During this time, the post became a major landmark for traders. The Fortymile River, Sixtymile River, and Seventymile River were named for their distance from the fort. In 1877, traders abandoned the fort after natives stole their goods.Webb, Melody. Yukon: The Last Frontier UBC Press, 1993. p. 65. Traders returned in 1879 and operated the fort until 1886, when it was abandoned due to a gold strike on the Stewart River. The gold strike diverted traders' attention from fur trapping, and thus the fort assumed less importance.Webb, Melody. Yukon: The Last Frontier UBC Press, 1993. p. 67.  History  Fort Reliance was originally established as a fur trading post to accommodate trade with the Native Han people. The site of the fort was chosen by Fran√ßois Mercier and it was constructed by Jack McQuesten and Francis Barnfield with the help of the Han natives. After the construction of the fort, McQuesten and Barnfield began trading with the natives. They were able to trade all of their goods for valuable furs. The first year proved the profitability of the fort. Fort Reliance would become a major trading hub in the region until it was abandoned by the traders in 1877 due to the theft of their goods by some of the Han natives. Jack McQuesten returned to the fort in 1879 in order to avoid the competition with other trading post down river. He was discouraged from going back to Fort Reliance by a chief of a neighboring tribe because, after the fort had been abandoned, some of the native women were killed by rat poison mixed with animal fat that was left behind by the traders. The chief feared for McQuesten's safety if he were to return to the fort. McQuesten decided to continue on to Fort Reliance and found that he was actually welcomed by the Han natives upon his return. They even compensated him for the previously stolen good and they did not blame the traders for the death of the women. The fort continued to be operated as a fur trading post, but eventually became a supply stop for gold prospectors on the Yukon. When gold was found on the Stewart River, a tributary of the Yukon river downstream from Fort Reliance, trade was diverted away from the fort and it was abandoned.  Buildings  Fort Reliance consisted of several buildings of various types of construction. All that remains of these buildings are ground features such as pits or post holes. After it was abandoned, many of its buildings were used as fuel by the steamboats that sailed the Yukon River. The main buildings consisted of three or four log cabins built for the traders. The largest of these cabins was described by Fran√ßois Mercier to be roughly 25 feet (7.6 m) long by 30 feet (9.1 m) wide. The remains of five pit houses are found at the site. These pits were roughly 4.5 to 5 meters square and four of the five had dug out entryways leading into them that were between 2.5 and 5 meters long. The pit houses were likely inhabited by the Han Indians that traded at the site.  Native Han occupation  The site of Fort Reliance contains signs of occupation by the Native Han Indians before the establishment of the fort and during its operation as a trade post. The remains of a Han fishing village, Nuclaco, exist on a small island near the west bank of the Yukon river, just across from the fort. The site was occupied seasonally during the king and chum salmon runs in the summer. Demographics Fort Reliance was erroneously reported on the 1880 United States Census as being located within Alaska (Yukon Division), despite being some 50 miles due east of the international boundary. It featured 83 residents, of which 1 was White and 82 were of the Tinneh tribe.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-17.pdf  References  Category:Forts in Yukon Category:1874 establishments in Canada ","title":"Fort Reliance"},{"id":"22795605","text":"In a Quiet Room II is the twelfth album released by country music artist Dan Seals and his only album on the TDC label.

He was also administratively responsible for medicine in Cairo and Damascus. Al-Dakhwar educated or influenced most of the prominent physicians of Egypt and Syria in the century, including writer Ibn Abi Usaibia and Ibn al-Nafis, the discoverer of blood circulation in the human body. Early life Al-Dakhwar was born and brought up in Damascus, the son of an oculist. Initially, he too was an oculist at the Nuri Hospital of Damascus,Mahfuz, 1935, p.16. but afterward he studied medicine with Ibn al-Matran.Meyerhof, 1968, p.9. Physician of the Ayyubids In 1208, al-Adil, the Sultan of Egypt, told his vizier al-Sahib ibn Shukur, that he was in need of another physician with the equivalent skill of the chief of medicine at the time, Abd al-Aziz al-Sulami. Al-Adil believed that al-Sulami was busy enough serving as physician of the army. Ibn Shukur recommended al-Dakhwar for the post and offered him 30 dinars a month. Al- Dakhwar turned him down, citing that al-Sulami receives 100 dinars a month and stating \\"I know my ability in this field and I will not take less!\\"Leiser and al-Khaledy, 2004, p.5. Al-Sulami died on June 7 and soon after al-Dakhwar himself came into contact with al-Adil, and the latter was greatly impressed by him. He not only appointed him as his personal physician, but also as one of his confidants. When al-Adil died, his son and successor in Damascus, al- Mu'azzam, made him chief superintendent of the Nasiri Hospital. There he wrote books and gave lectures on medicine to his students. Later, when al-Adil's other son al-Ashraf annexed Damascus after al-Mu'azzam died, al-Dakhwar was promoted as chief medical officer of the Ayyubid state.Ali, 1996, p.41.

It has a history back to the 13th century BC as a settlement with elements of an acropolis, but main preserved characteristics is from the Greek-mediterranean style urban town in the 5th or 4th century BC (Bronze Age) with stone walls and necropolis. Finds of coins of Philip II, Alexander III, Cassander, Demetrios Poliorketes and Pelagia correspond in general to the chronological span of the archaeological material discovered so far in the course of excavations and may be considered the northernmost Ancient Macedonian city. The Paeonian tribe of Agrianes dwelled in this region, the Scordisci are believed to have razed the town to the ground in 279 BC. The town had at least 3,000 inhabitants in the 4th and 3rd century.

It is an adaptation of the best-selling manga of the same name by Kazuo Koike and Ryoichi Ikegami, drawing primarily upon the \\"Portrait of a Killer\\" arc. The film was an international co-production between Canada and France, and was filmed on location in British Columbia in October 1994. Despite being heavily promoted by Viz Media on Animerica magazine and reprints of the Crying Freeman graphic novel, the film was never released in the United States. The movie eventually received a U.S. release via Amazon Prime streaming in November 2018. Plot While painting the landscape on a hill in San Francisco, a young woman named Emu O'Hara witnesses the murder of a Japanese Yakuza member. She notices that while the assassin stands emotionless in front of her, his eyes begin to shed tears. The assassin introduces himself to Emu as \\"Yo\\". Days later, after Emu returns to her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, Shido Shimazaki makes his appearance at the local police precinct, announcing a war between his clan, the Hakushin Society, and the \\"Sons of the Dragons\\" - a Chinese Triad that ordered the assassination of Shimazaki's son in San Francisco. Interpol detective Netah explains that the Sons of the Dragons are descendants of 108 Buddhist monks who rebelled against the Manchu reign in China centuries ago, and that the \\"Freeman\\" is their bringer of death. Shimazaki then tells everyone that Emu is the Freeman's next target, as she was the only witness to his son's assassination, and the assassin's code is that a person who is given Freeman's name becomes his next kill. However, shortly after their meeting is adjourned, Shimazaki and his bodyguards are ambushed outside the precinct by a masked Freeman and his assistant Koh. After dispatching the bodyguards and disabling the nearby police officers, Freeman successfully kills Shimazaki before running off. During his escape, he passes by Emu, who recognizes his eyes through his mask. As Freeman and Koh flee the scene, Emu utters Yo's name to the surprise of Detective Forge, who is assigned to protect her. Later that night, Emu is interrogated by Netah and Forge over Freeman's identity. Due to a lack of evidence, she is shortly released and escorted back to her mansion. As Netah scouts the mansion's perimeters, he discovers that Forge is knocked unconscious and he encounters Ryuji and Kimie Hanada, who are out to claim the Freeman's head and take over the Hakushin Society. Inside the mansion, Emu discovers that Yo is in her room and begins to accept her fate. However, instead of killing her, Yo makes love to her before members of Ryuji and his gang break in. Yo kills the thugs and wounds Ryuji, but Emu is shot in the process. Against his own code, Yo brings Emu to the nearest hospital. After she recovers, Emu leaves the hospital, tailed by Netah and Forge; however, their car is rammed by a tractor-trailer driven by a Yakuza, and Forge is killed in the ensuing crash and explosion. Emu travels to Japan and reunites with Yo, who tells her about his origins. Years ago, he was Yo Hinomura, a renowned pottery sculptor who stumbled upon a roll of negatives during his exhibit in New York City. Yo developed the photos in his hotel bathroom, revealing the torture and execution of a man wearing dragon tattoos similar to what he would eventually wear. Before leaving his hotel, he was drugged and abducted by the Sons of the Dragons, who implanted subliminal messages into his mind using acupuncture techniques. During his first mission, where he killed Mafia boss Antonio Rossi, he began to shed tears; hence his name Crying Freeman. Yo is notified by Koh that Ryuji's gang have attacked a soya factory in Shanghai that was protected by the Sons of the Dragons. As retribution, Yo and Koh travel to Shimazaki's funeral outside Tokyo to kill Ryuji and wipe out the clan. During the funeral, while having sex inside a closet, Kimie reveals to Netah that the Shimazakis were set up by the Hanadas to be assassinated so they could take over the clan. Yo and Koh wipe out the clan, but as Koh prepares to kill Yo for treason, Ryuji guns him down before the entire complex blows up and kills him. Yo returns to his home, where he prepares the area to self-destruct and arms himself to battle Netah and Kimie, along with her henchmen. Despite being wounded by Netah, Yo kills the henchmen and defeats Netah and Kimie - the latter by stabbing her near the heart. Kimie gives Yo her word of honor that in exchange for saving her life, he and Emu won't be pursued. While Yo and Emu leave the premises, Netah prepares to shoot them from behind, only to be killed by Kimie. Yo and Emu are last seen riding a speedboat into the sunset.

Leonard Klady of Variety wrote a favorable review of the film, citing it as \\"one of the few of the recent batch of comic-book adaptations that works, Crying Freeman has the potential to ring up the type of big numbers that would warrant a franchise. It's hoped that those involved with the first will still be aboard.\\" Jake Hamilton of Empire magazine gave the film two out of five stars, commenting: \\"Adapted from Kazuo Koike's ace comic book, Crying Freeman can claim absolute perfection with its faithfulness to the original text. The script is identical in all but speech bubbles, the acting is paper thin and the action very colourful. There's plenty of occult talk by leather-clad blokes to up the cult appeal, and the nudity should prevent the audience from nodding off, but this $15 million kung fu fantasy really should have been better.\\" Kung-Fu Cult Cinema gave the film a score of 3.5 out of 5, citing that it \\"is very well worth its weight in action.\\"Kung-Fu Cult Cinema - Crying Freeman Review Beyond Hollywood, however, commented on their review that the acting was sub- par and the film's subplot of Yo's relationship with Emu is \\"not the best story in the world.

She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Carey of Chilton Foliat and his wife Margaret Spencer. She was the great-granddaughter of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, which meant she was a third cousin to Henry VIII. She and at least one of her sisters, possibly Anne Carey, were nuns at Wilton Abbey. On 24 April 1528 the abbess, Cecily Willoughby died. At this point the convent had about fifty nuns and there had already been several rumours of scandalous happenings there. Because of this, Thomas Wolsey wished to make Isabel Jourdain the new abbess since she was reputed to be \\"ancient, wise and discreet\\". However, it was also suggested, most likely by Eleanor's brothers John and William Carey (who was married to Mary Boleyn), that Eleanor become the new abbess. Anne Boleyn also favoured Eleanor as the candidate for abbess, so the king looked into the matter. What was found out, however, quite put an end to any notion of Eleanor's promotion. She confessed to having borne ‚Äútwo children by two sundry priests‚Äù and was involved with a servant from the household of Lord Willoughby de Broke. The Careys and Boleyns then proposed Eleanor's eldest sister, Anne Carey, as a possible candidate, claiming that Isabel Jourdain had led an unchaste life when she was younger. Henry flatly refused to have either Eleanor, her sister, or Isabel made abbess, but Wolsey went ahead and gave the position to Isabel Jourdain anyway, causing the first major dispute between Henry and Wolsey.

Each individual database interaction (i.e., each SQL statement) submitted through the database connection in autocommit mode will be executed in its own transaction that is implicitly committed. A SQL statement executed in autocommit mode cannot be rolled back. Autocommit mode, in theory, incurs per-statement transaction overhead, having often undesirable performance or resource utilization impact. Nonetheless, in systems such as Microsoft SQL Server, as well as connection technologies such as ODBC and Microsoft OLE DB, autocommit mode is the default for all statements that change data, in order to ensure that individual statements will conform to the ACID (atomicity-consistency-isolation-durability) properties of transactions.Autocommit transactions. https://technet.microsoft.com/en- us/library/aa213069(v=sql.80).aspx The alternative to autocommit mode (non- autocommit) means that the SQL client application itself is responsible for issuing transaction initiation (start transaction) and termination (commit or rollback) commands. Non-autocommit mode enables grouping of multiple data manipulation SQL commands into a single atomic transaction. Most DBMS (e.g. MariaDB) force autocommit for every DDL statement, even in non-autocommit mode. In this case, before each DDL statement, previous DML statements in transaction are autocommitted.

From 1971 to 2014, the church was located in a controversial building at 16th and I Street NW. Considered a significant work of \\"Brutalist\\" church architecture by some critics, the building was considered unsatisfactory by members of the Church's congregation, which shrank over the years. In 2007, the church applied for a demolition permit for the building to permit sale and redevelopment of the site, with plans to relocate to a more suitable structure. A 1991 application for landmark status for the building, filed to forestall a demolition threat then, was subsequently approved. After a lawsuit and hearings, the District of Columbia issued a demolition permit in May 2009, and the building was demolished in 2014. In 2015, Third Church merged with First Church of Christ, Scientist. The congregation continues as First Church and conducts its activities in a portion of the new building. Early history The Christian Science denomination was founded by Mary Baker Eddy in the 1860s, and the Church of Christ, Scientist was formally established in the 1870s. Third Church of Christ, Scientist is a branch church of the Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston. Third Church was originally located in a building on Lafayette Park near the White House, shared with the National Woman's Party. In summer 1918, soon after it was established, the church relocated to the Masonic Temple on New York Avenue at 13th Street. In 1927, the church moved to a former Unitarian church building at 13th and L St that it purchased, but then in the 1950s, the church considered options for relocating closer to Lafayette Park. The site at 16th and I Street NW, owned by the Mother Church, housed the Washington offices of the Church's Committee on Publication. In the 1960s, the Church decided to demolish that building and construct a new office building to house the Committee and The Christian Science Monitor, with space available on the site to accommodate a building for Third Church of Christ, Scientist. 16th Street building First Church of Christ, Scientist In 1970, a new building opened for the church at 16th Street and I Street NW, designed in a brutalist architectural style by Araldo Cossutta, a partner in the firm I. M. Pei & Partners. Cossutta had previously designed the Christian Science Plaza in Boston. The concrete building is octagonal in shape. An adjacent office building was also constructed to house The Christian Science Monitor's Washington Bureau, with a small plaza knitting the two buildings together. Although many architecture critics admire the building, many members of the Church's congregation disliked it. The Church began to consider selling the property about 1990, which would likely have led to its demolition. In an effort to save the building, two groups independent of the Church applied in 1991 to the District of Columbia to have the building listed as a historic landmark. The congregation opposed the designation, which was not acted on at the time. The building had been costly to maintain, and was not suited to be re-purposed for another use. Structural defects include cracking in many spots. Maintenance costs included $5,000 - 8,000 for changing lightbulbs in the sanctuary, which involved erecting scaffolding. In 2007, the land itself was sold in 2007 to ICG Properties, which owns an adjacent property on K Street, and the developer leased the land back to the church. This renewed threat to the building led to reconsideration of the 1991 application for historic landmark status. In December 2007 the application was approved by a unanimous vote. After the city turned down a demolition permit request from the Church in July 2008, the Church filed a lawsuit alleging violation of the Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment along with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA). Opponents of the historic landmark designation argued that it violated the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act and subsequent laws by imposing a substantial burden on the church. On May 12, 2009, the District of Columbia approved a demolition permit for the building, citing hardships on the building's owner and the possibility of the congregation's demise if demolition were not approved. The approval was contingent upon the congregation's relocating to another facility close to that of Third Church. As of October 7, 2013, with all legal issues resolved and with local approval in hand for a planned unit development, with commercial and religious uses, the owners applied for the final demolition permit. Demolition of the church building began on February 24, 2014. The 1971 Third Church building was replaced by an office building. On July 24, 2015, Third Church merged with First Church of Christ, Scientist. First Church moved from its former location in the Adams Morgan neighborhood. First Church now meets in a portion of the building that replaced Third Church at 910 16th St. NW behind a dramatic mirrored glass entrance. =Previous history of site= This site was the location of the home of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Horace Gray.

He supported and served Texas during the struggle for Texas Independence. Early life Smith was born as the second son of John and Isabel Smith. He grew up in Ralls County, Missouri after moving from his birth state of Virginia, and received an expensive education. He married Harriet Stone in Hannibal, Missouri sometime between 1821 and 1822. They had three known children, Samuel, Mary Elizabeth and Lucinda. His first elected position was in 1822 as Sheriff of Ralls County and State and County tax Collector. He resigned from the post in 1826 to move to Texas following the birth of his third child. His wife refused to accompany him and filed for divorce. She ultimately came to Texas with her second husband. Move to San Antonio Smith moved to Mexican Texas and settled in San Antonio. In Texas, he changed his first and middle names around because \\"William\\" was difficult for Mexicans to pronounce. He was known throughout the town as \\"El Colorado\\", Spanish for \\"Redhead\\".

He was arrested with A. C. Holmes and Samuel Maverick and was saved by his wife's pleas, which enabled him to escape and guide the final assault in the Siege of Bexar.TAMU He served twice as a messenger during the Siege of the Alamo. On February 23, Smith and Sutherland were sent by Travis as scouts to assess the Mexican Army's strength and position. Upon locating the Mexican Army in strength, he immediately returned to the Alamo. That evening he was dispatched to Gonzales, Texas with a message from Travis. He returned to the Alamo from Gonzales, Texas on March 1. Before the final battle of the Alamo and its fall, William B. Travis sent Smith with a message for Washington-on-the-Brazos, allowing him to escape the fate that all Texas soldiers defending San Antonio ultimately succumbed to. After delivering the message, he returned with men to fight in the battle but heard no gunfire as their horses drank at Cibolo Creek. He was informed that the battle of the Alamo was over and headed eastward to fight at San Jacinto, where independence was won.

Before 1961 medical support at the diving section of HMAS Watson was provided by the District Medical Officer, Surgeon Lieutenant Commander Shane A.C. Watson, whose interest in diving led to research in injuries related to marine animals. Medical Director-General of the Royal Australian Navy, Surgeon Rear Admiral Lionel Lockwood, recognized the need for a specialisation in diving medicine and appointed Surgeon Lieutenant Commander Rex Gray to service in Underwater Medicine. Dr. Gray was an anaesthesiologist and accepted this commission on 20 February 1961. Dr. Gray was trained as a diver and sent to England for seven months to learn about modern diving medicine. He visited the Royal Naval Medical School at Alverstoke, the R.N. Physiological Laboratory, the Submarine Training School at HMS Dolphin, Diving School HMS Vernon, and the RN Air Medical School at Seafield Park. Following his time in England, he travelled to the United States, where he spent two weeks each in the Experimental Diving Unit, Washington Navy Yard, and with the Medical Research Laboratory, Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut, returning to Australia in July, 1962, aboard HMAS Supply. The first School of Underwater Medicine Report was issued in 1963 and outlined the need for communication with organizations with similar interests such as carbon monoxide poisoning and recompression chambers. The first eight-day Underwater Medicine course was held in May 1963, presented by Surgeon Lieutenant Commander A.A. Reid, and was followed by a thirteen-day course by Surgeon Lieutenant Commander B.M. Wadham, in June 1963.

Roosevelt appointed eight new members of the Supreme Court of the United States: Associate Justices Hugo Black, Stanley F. Reed, Felix Frankfurter, William O. Douglas, Frank Murphy, James F. Byrnes, Robert H. Jackson, and Wiley Blount Rutledge. Additionally, he elevated sitting Justice Harlan F. Stone to Chief Justice. Roosevelt's nine nominations filled eight seats on the Supreme Court because Associate Justice Byrnes resigned while Roosevelt was still in office. Roosevelt nominated Rutledge to the seat vacated by Byrnes. Hugo Black nomination One of Roosevelt's most severe political defeats during his presidency was the failure of the Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937, popularly known as the court-packing bill, which sought to stack a hostile Supreme Court in his favor by adding more associate justices.Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. . Pages 90-91. Soon after this setback, however, Roosevelt obtained his first opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court Justice when conservative Willis Van Devanter retired. Roosevelt wanted the replacement to be a \\"thumping, evangelical New Dealer\\" who was reasonably young, confirmable by the Senate, and from a region of the country unrepresented on the Court.Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. . Page 90. The three final candidates were Solicitor General Stanley Reed, Indiana Senator Sherman Minton, and Alabama Senator Hugo Black.Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. . Page 91. Roosevelt said Reed \\"had no fire,\\" and Minton didn't want the appointment at the time. Black was a candidate from the South who as a senator had voted for all twenty-four of Roosevelt's major New Deal programs, and had been an outspoken advocate of the court-packing plan. Roosevelt admired Black's use of the investigative role of the Senate to shape the American mind on reforms, his strong voting record, and his early support, which dated back to 1933.Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. . Page 92. On August 12, 1937, Roosevelt nominated Black to fill the vacancy. For the first time since 1853, the Senate departed from its tradition, which had been to confirm the appointment of a sitting Senator without debate.Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. . Page 94. Instead, it referred the nomination to the Judiciary Committee. Black was criticized by other senators and Newsweek for his presumed bigotry, his cultural roots, and later when it became public, his Klan membership,Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior.

Rumors relating to Black's involvement in the Ku Klux Klan surfaced among the senators, and Democratic Senators Royal S. Copeland and Edward R. Burke urged the Senate to defeat the nomination. However, no conclusive evidence of Black's involvement was available at the time, so after six hours of debate, the Senate voted 63‚Äì16 to confirm Black;Supreme Court Nominations, 1789-present, senate.gov. ten Republicans and six Democrats voted against Black. He resigned from the Senate and was sworn in as an Associate Justice two days later; Black would later explain that the haste in resigning was to avoid fallout from his Klan membership potentially going public.Ball, Howard. Hugo L. Black: Cold Steel Warrior. Oxford University Press. 2006. . Page 95. Stanley Reed nomination On January 5, 1938, 78-year-old Associate Justice George Sutherland announced he would retire from the Supreme Court as of January 18. On January 15, 1938, Roosevelt nominated Solicitor General Stanley F. Reed, who had been considered for the previous vacancy. Many in the nation's capital worried about the nomination fight, in light of the difficulty encountered by Hugo Black. However, Reed's nomination was swift and generated little debate in the Senate. He was confirmed on January 25, 1938 by voice vote, and seated as an Associate Justice on January 31.Wood, \\"Sutherland Quits Supreme Court,\\" New York Times, January 6, 1938; \\"Stanley Reed Goes to Supreme Court,\\" New York Times, January 16, 1938; \\"Jackson Is Named Solicitor General,\\" New York Times, January 28, 1938; \\"High Court Holds Challenge of NLRB Must Await Board Order Against Company,\\" New York Times, February 1, 1938. As of 2010, Reed was the last person to serve as a Supreme Court Justice without possessing a law degree.\\"Senate Quickly Confirms Reed Nomination,\\" New York Times, January 26, 1938. Felix Frankfurter nomination Following the death of Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo in July 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked his old friend Felix Frankfurter for recommendations of prospective candidates for the vacancy. Finding none on the list to suit his criteria, Roosevelt nominated Frankfurter himself on January 5, 1939. Frankfurter was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 17, 1939 by voice vote. William O. Douglas nomination In 1939, Justice Louis D. Brandeis resigned from the Supreme Court, and Roosevelt nominated Douglas as his replacement on March 20, 1939. Douglas later revealed that this had been a great surprise to him‚ÄîRoosevelt had summoned him to an \\"important meeting,\\" and Douglas feared that he was to be named as the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Douglas was Brandeis‚Äô personal choice as his successor. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 4 by a vote of 62 to 4. The four negative votes were cast by four Republicans: Lynn J. Frazier, Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., Gerald P. Nye, and Clyde M. Reed. Douglas was sworn into office on April 17, 1939. Frank Murphy nomination Justice Pierce Butler died in 1939, creating the next vacancy on the Court. Butler was a Catholic, and held a seat traditionally filled by a Catholic justice. On January 4, 1940, Roosevelt maintained the tradition of a Catholic seat when he nominated Frank Murphy. Murphy was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 16, 1940 by voice vote. Harlan Fiske Stone, James Byrnes, and Robert H. Jackson nominations On January 31, 1941, James Clark McReynolds, soon to be 80 years old, stepped down from the Court, followed within a few months by the retirement of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, also nearly 80. On June 12, 1941, Roosevelt nominated Associate Justice Harlan F. Stone to be Chief Justice. That same day, Roosevelt also nominated James F. Byrnes, and Robert H. Jackson to the Court, with Byrnes to succeed McReynolds and Jackson to fill the Associate Justice seat to be vacated be the elevation of Stone. Byrnes was confirmed by the United States Senate on the same day by voice vote. Stone was confirmed on June 27, 1941 and Jackson on July 7, 1941, both also by voice vote. Wiley Blount Rutledge nomination Byrnes only served on the Court for a year and a half, resigning at Roosevelt's behest to head the powerful Office of Economic Stabilization. On January 11, 1943, Roosevelt nominated Wiley Blount Rutledge to fill the vacancy. Rutledge was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 8, 1943 by voice vote.

It is a sequel to his 2008 novel Flood. Ark deals with the journey of the starship Ark One, and the continuing human struggle for survival on Earth after the catastrophic events of Flood. The series continues in three pendant stories, which are described in the plot summary below. Being hard SF, Ark contains many references to unrealised or hypothesised technology (Project Orion, the Alcubierre drive), physics (antimatter), and hypotheses about extraterrestrial life. Baxter credits several books and academic works in an afterword: See Scientific background below. Plot summary The events of Ark overlap with those of Flood: in preparation for a flood that will completely submerge the Earth's continents by 2052, the billionaire Nathan Lammockson builds Ark Three, a gigantic ship that will sail the waters of the drowned Earth. Skeptical of the project's viability, the U.S. government recruits billionaires Edward Kenzie, Patrick Groundwater and Jerzy Glemp to fund the construction of Ark One (later renamed Project Nimrod'), a generation ship capable of superluminal travel using an Alcubierre warp drive. The plan is to fly Ark One to an Earth-like exoplanet and rebuild civilisation on the new world. The nature of Ark Two is top secret. Ark One requires 80 humans, of maximum genetic diversity to prevent inbreeding among their descendants, to be trained from a young age in spaceship maintenance. These \\"Candidates\\" include: Holle Groundwater, daughter of Patrick, specialising in life support systems; Zane Glemp, son of Jerzy, specialising in warp drive physics; Kelly Kenzie, daughter of Edward, a natural leader who is named mission commander; and Wilson Argent, a pilot. They train in an Academy in Denver, Colorado, repurposed as the U.S. capital after the flooding of Washington, D.C. Progress on the Ark's construction is slow, so the military takes over the Project. Initial plans to assemble the Ark in space are scrapped in favor of a Project Orion-style nuclear drive which will send the ground-built Ark towards Jupiter. There, it will gather antimatter particles created by gravitational interactions with Io to power the warp drive; in addition, a sunshade will allow its telescopes to conduct spectroscopic analysis of exoplanets in the hopes of discovering the chemical signatures of life. Mere weeks before the launch, some Candidates are forced out to make room for \\"gatecrashers\\", whose presence on the ship was guaranteed in exchange for funding from their affluent parents. Grace Gray, protagonist of Flood, is one of them. In addition, military mutineers (nicknamed \\"Illegals\\" by the crew) force their way onto the ship. Nevertheless, the launch is successful and by 2042 they have gathered more than enough antimatter and head for a promising \\"Earth II\\" planet in the 82 Eridani system. During transit, it emerges that Zane has dissociative identity disorder due to abusive parenting and sexual molestation by his Academy tutor, while Wilson begins challenging Kelly's leader status. A pregnant Grace gives birth to a daughter, Helen, and the crew suffer deaths and damage during a fire caused by a Candidate's attempted murder of an Illegal. Kelly loses respect when she amputates the instigator as punishment, which increases Wilson's power. Nine years later, they arrive and discover that Earth II is sub-optimal: its high axial tilt creates temperature extremes on either side of its equator, making very little land livable. It is also poor in minerals, presumably exhausted by a previous civilisation which has left ruined buildings behind. The crew are of three minds over what to do next: Wilson, Holle, and Grace join a majority deciding to push on to \\"Earth III\\", which is 30 years' travel away in the constellation of Lepus. Kelly leads a group returning to Earth, while a minority colonise Earth II. Once the colonists land, the remaining passengers split up the ship's two hulls and the warp drive to go their separate ways, losing simulated gravity in the process. When Kelly's group water land on the flooded Earth, they make radio contact with scientist Thandie Jones, who discovered the cause of the flooding in Flood. She in turn contacts Edward Kenzie, who despatches a submarine to take them to Ark Two, which turns out to be an underwater habitat powered by the geothermal heat of Yellowstone. Edward berates his daughter for failing him, and Kelly learns that former Candidate Don Meisel and Ground Control commander Gordo Alonzo have both died battling angry displaced persons. She awkwardly reunites with her estranged son and her lover from her Academy days. Edward hopes to eventually colonise the world ocean with a race of genetically modified humans. Meanwhile, the situation in Holle's hull deteriorates as Wilson leads a corrupt gang with his Illegal henchmen. Kelly had kidnapped the ship's only doctor, so Zane is no longer undergoing therapy and spreads rumours that the ship is actually a virtual reality simulation. The shipborn children, having never seen Earth for themselves, believe him and start a mutiny. Hoping to reveal the ship to be a simulation, they remove a metal plate from the hull, causing an uncontrolled decompression which kills and injures many passengers. Wilson escapes in a landing shuttle, but it has been sabotaged, so he returns to the ship in a space suit while the shuttle disintegrates from the warp drive's gravitational effects. A despondent Zane later commits suicide. Holle assumes control of the ship and executes the head mutineer, but keeps Wilson alive because she needs his piloting skills to land on Earth III, a cold tidally locked planet with dense air, a dynamic atmosphere and a red dwarf sun that fortunately appears a familiar white to the human eye. Since the remaining shuttle cannot seat all the passengers, Holle encourages the passengers to reproduce copiously: since children weigh little, many will fit on the shuttle, thus increasing genetic diversity. She sends three adults to accompany them: Wilson, Helen Gray and the Illegal Jeb. Helen and Jeb, whose children are not allowed on the shuttle due to genetic proximity, resentfully board. Wilson sets them down safely on a lake and they prepare to settle on their new world. The remaining crew on the Ark plan to conduct a survey of the planetary system and beyond until they die. =Pendant stories= Three pendant stories have been published since, two in Asimov's Science Fiction: \\"Earth II\\" and \\"Earth III\\"; all later published together as \\"Landfall: Tales From the Flood/Ark Universe\\". \\"Earth II\\" is set approximately 400 years after the events in Ark and deals with the struggles of the descendants of the 15 Ark One crew members who choose to settle there, rather than continue the journey to Earth III. Since Earth II lacks many of the resources needed to build an advanced society (e.g. oil, coal, uranium, precious metals), its peoples (who have now split into warring nations and city states) have largely reverted to pre-industrial technology, reliant mostly on stone, iron and wood. \\"Earth III\\" is set approximately 1000 years after the events in Ark and deals with struggles of the Ark One crew members who choose to settle on Earth III. It is revealed that Helen Gray, Wilson Argent, and Jeb Holden fought and killed each other several years after their shuttle landed, forcing the 37 children who went with them to grow up on their own and develop their own society. Zane's quasi-religious idea of the world as a simulated reality persists; however, there is a growing movement of disbelievers. A third tale, \\"Earth I\\", followed in a collection called Universes (also published under the title \\"Landfall\\"); it is set approximately 10,000 years later and brought characters from several of the now colonised worlds together and revealed the fate of the raft‚Äìdwelling survivors on the original, flooded Earth. Critical reception Ark received critical acclaim. Writing in The Guardian, Eric Brown gave the novel a very positive review, concluding that \\"Never has Baxter presented a more thrilling and moving glimpse of a possible future: Ark could well be his masterpiece.\\"Brown, Eric (1 August 2009), \\"Ark by Stephen Baxter\\", The Guardian (London) In The Times, Lisa Tuttle also wrote approvingly, calling Ark \\"a grim but exciting tale of the ultimate in pioneering adventure, in the most unforgiving environment of all.\\"Tuttle, Lisa (5 September 2009), \\"Sci-fi / fantasy: New work by Kim Stanley Robinson, Stephen Baxter, Chris Beckett and Alexandra Sokoloff\\", The Times (London) Reviews at Strange Horizons were also very positive.

It is used to take vehicles in and out of Downtown Edmonton to the city's northern suburban neighbourhoods and to the region's main military installation, CFB Edmonton. North of Yellowhead Trail (Highway 16), it is designated as part of Highway 28. The road has existed in some form since Edmonton was a small agricultural community. At its southern terminus it connects with Jasper Avenue, early Edmonton's main street, at the location of the Shaw Conference Centre and Canada Place the main federal government offices in Alberta since 1988 and the former site of the Alberta Hotel. Proceeding north, 97 Street passes the Francis Winspear Centre for Music, and the Law Courts, as well as the Chinatown gate in Chinatown and Little Italy. Like all early roads in eastern Edmonton, Namao Avenue as it was called, ran at a slight angle to a true north-south line, being more NNW-SSE. During later development (north of 110A Avenue) it switches to a straight north-south course. The neighbourhood along the west side, between 137 and 153 Avenues, Griesbach, used to be designated for homes for the families of the base. This has since been redeveloped by the Canada Lands Company. 97 Street is still used as the Canadian Forces parade to the base upon return of duty of the troops.

Real-time recovery focuses on the most appropriate technology for restores, thus reducing the Recovery Time Objective (RTO) to minutes, Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) to within 15 minutes ago, and minimizing Test Recovery Objectives (TRO), which is the ability to test and validate that backups have occurred correctly without impacting production systems. Real-Time Recovery is a new market segment in the backup, recovery and disaster recovery market that addresses the challenges companies that have historically faced with regards to protecting, and more importantly, recovering their data. Definition A real-time recovery solution must contain (at a minimum) the following attributes: The ability to restore a server in minutes to the same, totally different or to a virtual environment to within 5 minutes ago and not require the use of any additional agents, options or modules to accomplish this. It must be able to restore files in seconds (after all, the only reason anyone backups is to be able to restore). It must perform sector level backups, every 5 minutes and have the ability to self-heal a broken incremental chain of backups should part of the image set get corrupted or deleted . It must deliver improved recoverability of data files and databases. Classification of data loss Data Loss can be classified in three broad categories: #Server Hardware Failure - Preventing a server failure is very difficult, but it is possible to take precautions to avoid total server failure through the user of Redundant Power Supplies, RAID disk sets. # Human Error - These disasters are major reasons for failure. Human error and intervention may be intentional or unintentional which can cause massive failures such as loss of entire systems or data files. This category of data loss includes accidental erasure, walkout, sabotage, burglary, virus, intrusion, etc. # Natural Disasters / Acts of terrorism ‚Äì although infrequent, companies should weigh up their risk to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. How much data loss is the business willing or able tolerate. Platforms for data servers Data servers can be either physical hosts or run as guest servers within a virtualization platform, or a combination of both. It is very common for a customer environment to have a mixture of Virtual and Physical Servers. This is where attention to detail must be given to the approach of protecting the data on these servers at regular intervals. There are distinct advantages in selecting a technology that is virtual or physical independent. This would limit the number of technologies that organizations will have to get trained on, skilled up on, purchase, deploy, manage and maintain. In an ideal world, if you can reduce the complexity of managing multiple products to protect your physical and virtual infrastructure you will reap the rewards. A technology that gets installed at the operating system level ensures consistency in an environment that is either physical or virtual and eliminates API compatibility or Disk Volume Structure limitations (e.g. Raw Mapped Devices, VMFS). Strategies Prior to selecting a real-time recovery strategy or solution, a disaster recovery planner will refer to their organization's business continuity plan for the key metrics of recovery point objective (RPO) and recovery time objective for various business processes (such as the process to run payroll, generate an order, e-mail, etc.). The metrics specified for the business processes must then be mapped to the underlying IT systems and infrastructure that support those processes. Once the recovery time objective and recovery point objective metrics have been mapped to IT infrastructure, the DR planner can determine the most suitable recovery strategy for each system. The business ultimately sets the IT budget, and therefore the RTO and RPO metrics need to fit with the available budget. While the ideal is zero data loss and zero time loss, the cost associated with that level of protection historically have made high-availability solutions impractical and unaffordable. The costs of a Real-Time Recovery solution are far less than previous tape-based backup systems.

Hogg failed to make the grade at Roker Park and moved to Morpeth Harriers of the Northern Alliance for two seasons. In May 1903, Hogg joined Sheffield United in the Football League First Division, where he made three appearances at right-half in the 1903‚Äì04 season. He then moved to the south coast to join Southern League Southampton in the summer of 1905. He made his debut for the \\"Saints\\" on 7 October 1905, in a 2‚Äì1 victory at home to Watford. Although he was often played at centre-half, he was more at home at right-half; he was primarily a \\"destructive\\" rather than \\"constructive\\" player who \\"appeared to be rather slow (although) he had an easy stride\\" and was \\"reliable and a great trier\\" but \\"tended to be over-awed in important matches\\". For the 1905‚Äì06 season, he became a regular in defence alongside England internationals Bert Lee and Kelly Houlker. In his first season at The Dell, Hogg made 24 league and 5 FA Cup appearances, scoring once, as Southampton finished as runners-up in the League. Hogg was the regular right- half for the start of the 1906‚Äì07 season before he had a bad game in an FA Cup Second Round replay at The Wednesday on 7 February 1907. In this match, Hogg was played out of position at right-back but repeatedly fluffed his clearances; his performance caused confusion in his own defence, allowing The Wednesday to win 3‚Äì1 and go on to claim the cup in the Final the following April. Hogg never appeared again in a Saints shirt, with John Robertson taking over from him. At the end of the season, Hogg was released and returned to his native north east where he joined West Stanley, playing in the North Eastern League. Family His brother, Billy, played at outside right, winning the Football League championship with Sunderland in 1901‚Äì02, before moving to Scotland where he won the Scottish League title three times with Rangers.

He graduated from Vallejo High School in 1956. Jazz remained a hobby for the next decade, while he worked as a psychiatric nurse at UCSF. He later attributed many of the interpersonal skills he employed in the music business to this experience. KJAZ owner Pat Henry's on-air invitation to prospective DJs led Parlocha to submit a tape, prompting Henry to hire him as a programmer for the station's Saturday evenings. This resulted in Parlocha's appointment as host of the \\"Dinner Jazz Show,\\" in 1978. As the show's ratings climbed, Parlocha's distinctive voice became familiar to jazz audiences throughout the Bay Area. A thoughtful programmer, articulate spokesman for jazz, and analyst of the music scene, his \\"master of ceremonies\\" style enhanced many jazz concerts and fundraisers over the subsequent years. His credits include the Gil Evans Orchestra's concert at the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, the Berkeley Jazz Festival, Oakland Arts Explosion, Jazz at the Palace, Bay Area Jazz Awards, the San Francisco International KJAZ Festival, and as KJAZ host on the SS Norway Jazz Cruises. Music director and producer He eventually became music director at KJAZ, auditioning new releases and determining which albums and cuts would air on the prominent jazz station. KJAZ was one of only a handful of jazz stations nationally reporting airplay to the prestigious \\"Radio and Records\\" publication, which influenced programming at hundreds of smaller stations and, ultimately, record sales.Radio and Records He also developed numerous specialty shows, including the Black Masters series; Latin Jazz; On The Scene (spotlighting Bay Area musicians in live performance); and What's New, reviewing album releases with a Bay Area panel of experts. Parlocha engineered the late Martha Young's album Live at Bajone's on the Carnelian label, and Sufi Dancers for pianist Steve Cohn, both in 1982. He also produced a number of albums; his first in 1985 was singer Laurie Antonioli's \\"Soul Eyes\\" on Catero Records. Syndication A decline in jazz radio audiences led KJAZ owner Ron Cowan to sell the ailing station in 1994. A leading fine arts station in Chicago, WFMT (through JSN, its satellite radio affiliate), agreed to syndicate the show Jazz with Bob Parlocha, which he recorded from his home in Alameda, California. The evening show was picked up by KUVO (Denver), WRCJ-FM (Detroit) and several other public radio stations, including Kansas and Alabama. WGBH-FM, in Boston, Massachusetts, has carried the show for decades, albeit with some glitches in their transition to \\"mostly talk\\" radio in 2009. The leading jazz station in the western United States, KKJZ (Long Beach), began airing his program in early 2007.KKJZ The show is also carried by JAZZ.FM91 in Toronto, Ontario, as well as the de facto successor to KJAZ, KCSM (FM) of the College of San Mateo in the Bay Area. Within 4 months following his death, KKJZ dropped Bob's recorded syndicated programming, with Bob's playlists on WFMT's website also disappearing in that time period.KKJZ Program grid, April 2015KKJZ Program grid, September 2015 WFMT continues to offer a Jazz overnight service with hosts Dee Alexander, John Hill, Dave Schwan, and Neil Tesser. Other activities Parlocha participated in the Jazz Journalist Association Awards and donated his time to jazz causes, especially those in support of Bay Area musicians. He also performed as a saxophonist, appearing regularly with the Bob Enos big band, Soundwave, at Rooster's Roadhouse in Alameda and in events such as at the 2008 San Jose Jazz Festival. He also enjoyed gourmet cooking as a hobby. His Cooking With Bob column appeared in the bimonthly KJAZ newsletters, and he performed numerous live remotes from Bay Area restaurants on \\"Dinner Jazz.\\" ReferencesExternal links * \\"Jazz with Bob Parlocha\\" website Category:1938 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Musicians from Vallejo, California Category:African-American musicians Category:African-American radio personalities Category:American radio DJs Category:American jazz saxophonists Category:American male saxophonists Category:American musicians of Filipino descent Category:Record producers from California Category:Jazz radio presenters Category:Radio personalities from California Category:Jazz musicians from California Category:American male jazz musicians ","title":"Bob Parlocha"},{"id":"22796895","title":"A Woman Needs Love (Just Like You Do)"},{"id":"22796958","title":"Am I Blue (George Strait song)"},{"id":"22796965","text":"Am I Blue may refer to: *Am I Blue?, a 1929 song written by Harry Akst and Grant Clarke *Am I Blue (album), a 1963 album by jazz guitarist Grant Green *Am I Blue (George Strait song), a 1987 song written by David Chamberlain *Am I Blue (play), a play written by Beth Henley ","title":"Am I Blue"},{"id":"22796975","text":"Ekmat (, meaning \\"Agreed upon\\" in Marathi) is a Marathi-language daily newspaper by \\"Indo Enterprises Pvt.

Joined by the tributary East Fork and North Fork, the main river turns south. After a few miles, the West Fork tributary joins. From there the main Elochoman River flows south and southwest. Its river valley widens into a broad flat bottomland called the Upper Elochoman Valley. Then the river passes through a short but narrow gorge, after which it meanders through the Lower Elochoman Valley. In its final reach the Elochoman River flows through the sloughs and wetlands of the Columbia River's estuary. The mouth of the river is on Elochoman Slough, a long side-channel of the Columbia River located east of Hunting Islands, northwest of Cathlamet.

The Museum tells the story of the struggle for the freedom and independence of Poland during World War II. On September 1, 1939, without declaring war, the Nazi German Army, Navy, and Air Forces invaded Poland from the north, west and south. Sixteen days later, on September 17, the Soviet Union also attacked Poland from the east. For Europe, the Nazi invasion of Poland marked the beginning of World War II; for Poland, the Soviet invasion also marked the beginning of a 50-year struggle against communism.Muzeum Armii Krajowej, Published 1998, Mid City Printing Company 773 777-5400  Dedication of the museum  The Polish Home Army Museum was dedicated on November 12, 1989. It was founded by members of the Michigan Chapter of the Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa) Association in the United States and the Detroit chapter of the Polish Resistance (AK) Foundation, with the generous support of the National Executive Committees of these organizations, and of the Polonia. Space for the Museum was provided by Monsignor Stanislaw Milewski, the Chancellor of the St. Mary‚Äôs Seminary and College in Orchard Lake, Michigan and Rev. Roman Nir, Director of Archives. The rooms were completely renovated and adapted for display purposes, including the installation of a new lighting system. The Museum Committees and a few dedicated members donated much of their time to make this ambitious project a reality. Exhibits were donated by many veterans of the Home Army and their families. The Master plan for the display of the exhibits was developed by Dr. Thaddeus Malinski, the curator and implemented under the leadership of Julius Przesmycki, former chairman of the Museum Committee.  The Poles in World War II  The Poles were beaten, but not conquered. The fight against the Germans continued, uninterrupted, for almost six years. After the war, when Poland was abandoned by her western allies and left under Soviet domination, resistance against communism continued for another 45 years. Finally, largely because of the Solidarity movement, freedom for Poland was regained in 1989. = The entrance = Facing the entrance to the museum is the symbol of ‚ÄòPolska WalczƒÖca‚Äô: Fighting Poland, as seen in the title above. It was the mark of the Armia Krajowa, emblazoned on walls throughout German occupied Poland. Symbol of resistance, sign of defiance, emblem of freedom, and declaration of unwavering intent - an important part of Polish history. Behind the ‚ÄòPolska WalczƒÖca‚Äô is displayed the standard of the Michigan chapter of the Polish Home Army (AK) Veterans Association. = The first room = The first room contains exhibits from the beginning of World War II, including the front pages of the Detroit newspapers dated September 1, 1939, with the headlines crying out: ‚ÄúWar!‚Äù. The first room also depicts the history of the secret Polish Underground State and its fighting forces, the Home Army (Armia Krajowa). The Polish Home Army organized the most effective partisan and espionage forces of any allied nation. At its peak, in 1943, the AK numbered over 380,000 men and women. All were volunteers. One of the major accomplishments of the Home Army was the capture of an entire V-2 rocket, which was disassembled and flown to Britain. Examples of the Secret underground press, which continued publishing almost until the day the Soviet Army marched into Poland, are also displayed, as are the numerous memorabilia donated by veterans of the AK and their families. All descriptions are in English. = The second room = The second room of the museum is dedicated to the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 and the suffering of the Polish people under the German and Soviet occupation of Poland. The Nazi concentration camps built by the Nazis on Polish territory were first occupied by Christian Poles, many of whom perished and later by the Jewish population, most of whom perished. The work of ‚ÄòZegota‚Äô, a secret department of the Polish Underground State, dedicated to saving thousands of Jews, especially children, from the Nazi persecution, is described.  The Warsaw Uprising  On August 1, 1944, the Home Army in Warsaw rose against the Germans as they were retreating under pressure form the Soviet offensive. The Red Army was only 15 miles away at the time. However; a few days after the uprising started, Joseph Stalin ordered his armies to stop and wait until the Germans had brutally suppressed the uprising and destroyed the city. Stalin wanted the Home Army and Polish leadership destroyed in order to make it easier for the Soviets to set up a planned puppet communist regime. After 63 days of fighting with insufficient arms against three German Divisions, including the elite Hermann G√∂ring SS Panzer Division and the German Luftwaffe, the Home Army was forced to surrender. After the surrender and evacuation of POWs, as well as the remaining civilian population, the Germans blew up or burnt whatever buildings were left standing.  Exhibits  The exhibits include several photographic displays, examples of arms and uniforms used by the Home Army, many documents and decorations, a few 1944 street plans of Warsaw showing Home Army and German positions at various stages of the battle, and many other sorts of memorabilia. There is also a display of memorabilia from POW and Nazi concentration camps. = Location = The Polish Home Army Museum in Orchard Lake, Michigan is located in the St. Mary's Preparatory Ark Building (#9), 3535 Indian Trail, Orchard Lake, MI 48324.

Gotland Round Race has its roots in a yacht race between Sandhamn and Visby in the early 1920s, called Visby Yacht Race. It was a popular race between large type metre yachts, arranged by Royal Swedish Yacht Club. The course started in Sandhamn down to Visby. After a break in Visby (for dinner and relaxation) the boats returned next day to the finishing line in Sandhamn, but without sailing round Gotland. The course is about 200 M. The last Visby Yacht Race was arranged in 1939 when Jacob Wallenberg (1892‚Äì1980) with his 10-metre class yacht Refanut, after the victory in series of races, won the last race and was then entitled to keep the Visby Yacht Race trophy forever. It was not until 1937 that the course for the first time covered a trip around Gotland.http://race.ksss.se/en/For- visitors/History/ The course was 250 M and the yachts sailed round Gotland counter clockwise (today the race is clockwise), including an extension round a checkpoint north of √ñland.

A prominent member of the M√°laga School of Painting, he is considered one of the last great history painters of the 19th century. He was a celebrated portrait painter who enjoyed the patronage of Madrid's high society. He also created genre scenes and some landscapes, vedutas and still lifes.C. Gonz√°lez Navarro, Jos√© Moreno Carbonero in: 'El siglo XIX en el Prado, 2007', pp.480-481 Moreno Carbonero was widely recognized, both nationally and internationally, during his lifetime. He received awards, among others, at the Exposition Universelle of Paris in 1889, the Budapest International Exhibition in 1890, the Universal Exhibition of Berlin in 1891 and the only medal at the World's Columbian Exposition of Chicago in 1893. His work is represented at some of the most influential museums in the world, with El Prado Museum, in Madrid, holding an important collection. Among his masterworks are The Entry of Roger de Flor in Constantinople (1888), The Prince don Carlos de Viana (1881), The Conversion of the Duke of Gand√≠a (1884) and The Founding of Buenos Aires (1910‚Äì1924). Early life and education Moreno Carbonero was born in the Perchel quarter of M√°laga, the son of a carpenter. His exact birthdate has been object of debate, frequently cited as March 1860, but the original birth certificate is conserved and states he was born on 24 March 1858. A precocious artist, in 1868 he joined the school of fine arts in his home town and also took classes in the studio of Bernardo Ferr√°ndiz. He sold his first painting at age fifteen for 2000 pesetas (an important sum at the time) and came to be known as \\"el ni√±o Moreno\\" (the Moreno child) because of his early mastery of oil painting. Bernardo Ferr√°ndiz was the leading M√°laga artist of the moment and introduced his young student to history painting. Ferr√°ndiz instilled in him his own revolutionary views which he expressed in his historical works by proclaiming a commitment to independence, freedom and nonconformity.Rodrigo Guti√©rrez Vi√±uales, Elisa Radovanovic, Moreno Carbonero, pintor de la Historia fundacional de Buenos Aires, in: Bolet√≠n de Arte, Universidad de M√°laga, 1995, N¬∫ 16, pp. 207-224 Moreno Carbonero obtained the gold medal in the Exhibition of the Lyceum of M√°laga in 1872, being only fourteen.  Career  The prince don Carlos de Viana In 1873 Moreno Carbonero visited Morocco, where he began to make African-themed paintings, influenced by Mariano Fortuny. In 1875 he traveled to Paris thanks to a scholarship granted by the local government of M√°laga. In Paris he joined the workshop of the painter Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, known for his Academic and Orientalist works. He also got to know the famous art dealer Adolphe Goupil. Goupil introduced him to the market of small genre paintings referred to in French as tableautins. In this area he achieved his first successes and he developed a virtuoso style comparable to that of Fortuny.S. B. I, Moreno Carbonero, Jos√© at the Prado website The Entry of Roger de Flor in Constantinople In 1881 Moreno Carbonero went to study in Rome as a boarder on a stipend. After he returned to Spain, he won gold medals at the national exhibitions in 1881 with his painting The prince don Carlos de Viana and in 1884 with The Conversion of the Duke of Gand√≠a, which he had painted during his stay in Rome. Almogavar Warrior. Late work (1898) based on a character from The Entry of Roger de Flor in Constantinople. As his fame grew, he received commissions from various official institutions. In 1888 the Spanish Senate commissioned from him the painting The Entry of Roger de Flor in Constantinople, which is considered one of the most spectacular artworks within the genre of historical painting and still decorate the walls of the Conference Hall in the Senate. For this large-scale painting, that depicts the Italian mercenary Roger de Flor and his troops of Almogavar warriors entering the city to relieve the Byzantine emperor from the Turkish, Moreno Carbonero extensively researched in Paris about Byzantine architecture, clothes and decoration, and he used dozens of models to recreate the complete atmosphere in the M√°laga bullfighting arena . Smaller paintings derived from this work, depicting individual Almogavar warriors, are known to exist. In 1910, the Argentine Government asked him to execute a canvas with the theme of the founding of Buenos Aires to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the revolution of Argentina. King Alfonso XIII of Spain gave this work as a gift to the city of Buenos Aires. The king visited the studio of Moreno Carbonero during the creation of the work and kept in the bedroom of the Royal Palace of Madrid a design for the portrait of Juan de Garay, the founder of Buenos Aires, who was depicted in the canvas. Moreno Carbonero was also awarded in 1888 the highest award in the Vatican Exposition and participated in the International Exhibitions in Munich and Vienna. He obtained a second medal at the Exposition Universelle of Paris in 1889, a great gold medal at the Budapest International Exhibition in 1890, an honorary diploma at the Universal Exhibition of Berlin in 1891 and the only medal at the World's Columbian Exposition of Chicago in 1893. Sancho Panza meets his donkey From 1892 he taught as professor of live drawing at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando and he was also an Academician of the same organisation. In 1924 he was made Hijo Predilecto. After his death in Madrid on 15 April 1942, his body was transferred to M√°laga, where he is buried in the San Miguel cemetery. In 1958 a monument created by Mariano Benlliure was erected in the Puerta Oscura gardens to honour the artist. Style and technique Jos√© Moreno Carbonero was principally a history painter. He was further a painter of portraits, genre scenes, some landscapes, vedutas and still lifes. His work was eclectic in style and was mainly influenced by the work of Fortuny. In his portraits he used a realistic style.Jos√© Moreno Carbonero, Cortejo ante la verja at the Museo Carmen Thyssen M√°laga As a history painter Moreno Carbonero excelled through his clear drawing and clean brushstrokes. In his history paintings he was influenced by the genre painting on small format that he practised in his early years. He showed a preference for leaving aside the grand events of history in favour of depicting the feelings and reactions of participants in events from the past. He cared a lot about the historical accuracy of his history paintings. This explains why he asked that the painting The founding of Buenos Aires be returned to him after it was delivered to the local government in Buenos Aires in 1909. He had read more about the history of the city after he had first completed the work and wanted to make substantial changes to it so it would be more historically accurate. He returned the reworked painting to the city in 1924. Portrait of Purificaci√≥n Font√°n As a portrait painter, Moreno Carbonero created elegant portraits of personnages from the high society of Madrid. These portraits were characterised by their sophisticated and sumptuous treatment of the sitters. Moreno Carbonero devoted himself in the first decades of his career to genre painting. His genre paintings took as their subject the daily life of people or scenes from the Spanish Golden Age of literature, and especially the story of Don Quixote. The collection of the Museo de Bellas Artes of M√°laga holds more than 30 works of Jos√© Moreno Carbonero.Museo de Bellas Artes de M√°laga  Gallery  File:Conversi√≥n del duque de Gand√≠a, Museo del Prado.jpgThe Conversion of the Duke of Gand√≠a File:Jos√© Moreno Carbonero - The founding of Buenos Aires (1924).jpgThe Founding of Buenos Aires File:Gladiadores despu√©s del combate, por Jos√© Moreno Carbonero.jpgGladiators after the Combat File:Water Carriers in the Outskirts of Alcal√° de Guada√≠ra.jpgWater Carriers in the Outskirts of Alcal√° de Guada√≠ra File:√Ålvaro Drake, marqu√©s de Villablanca, por Jos√© Moreno Carbonero.jpg√Ålvaro Drake, Marquis of Villablanca File:Jos√© Moreno Carbonero - Ca d'Oro.jpgCa d'Oro File:El vaso de agua, de Jos√© Moreno Carbonero (Museo del Prado).jpgA Glass of Water ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1860 births Category:1942 deaths Category:19th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:20th-century Spanish painters Category:Orientalist painters Category:People from M√°laga Category:Spanish portrait painters Category:Spanish genre painters Category:Spanish academics ","title":"Jos√© Moreno Carbonero"},{"id":"22797189","text":"Peltandra virginica is a plant of the arum family known as green arrow arum and tuckahoe.

It can be found elsewhere in North America as an introduced species and often an invasive plant. P. virginica is a hydrophytic marshland aquatic plant pollinated by a chloropid fly through providing a brood site and releasing the pollen onto them. The primary dispersal mechanisms are via water and animals.  Description  This is an emergent perennial herb growing from a large rhizome and producing many large leaves. An individual leaf may have a petiole nearly a meter long and a blade half a meter in length. The leaves are quite variable in shape and size, but they are often generally arrowhead- shaped. The inflorescence bears male and female flowers, as well as sterile flowers. The flower varies from whitish to greenish to yellow. The fruit is a brown berry containing a few seeds within a clear gelatinous pulp. Large number of seeds can accumulate in the soil of wetlands.Leck, M. A. and Graveline, K. J. (1979). The seed bank of a freshwater tidal marsh. American Journal of Botany 66: 1006‚Äì15. Peltandra virginica is a marshland aquatic plant, growing in North America bogs, ponds, and marshes. The roots and base grow into the submerged substrate, and the leaves and inflorescences project up and out of the water. The roots form a perennial rhizome. Various forms of leaf blades have been observed, both in larger ranges and smaller individual populations. Petioles range from green to green-purple to purple with a medium green blade petiole lengths between 38 and 98 centimeters and blade length being between 9 and 57 centimeters. Lateral veins also have variable thicknesses. Inflorescences are generally pale green to white, being lighter within the spathe. Lengths for the inflorescense range between 7 and 25 centimeters with the spadix being about half the size to the full length of the spathe with greenish to white flowers, producing fruits that rot within the closed spathe. Fruits are pea green to mottled green and purple and range from 6 to 16 millimeters. In most of its range, it blooms from spring to late summer and fall and in warmer regions, it will bloom into the winter. It generally thrives in low salinity environments.  Taxonomy  Arrow arum, Peltandra virginica, is a member of the arum family, Araceae, and is known by the names tuckahoe, green arrow arum, and peltandre. It was originally described as Arum virginicum by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and has also been placed in the genera Alocasia, Caladium, Calla, Lecontia, and Rensselaeria. Other synonyms include Peltandra luteospadix and P. tharpii. In the eastern United States and Canada where Peltandra virginica resides, one other Peltandra species exists, P. sagittifolia. P. virginica can be distinguished from the other extant taxon of Peltandra by the variation in leaf form, average greater size in non-reproductive structures, and the difference in color of the fruit. The fruit of P. sagittifolia is red with a white spathe, and the fruit of P. virginica are green to purple with a green to yellow green spathe.  Distribution and habitat  Peltandra virginica is a native to North America; its range spans the entire eastern coast of the United States and goes as far west as Texas. It is also naturalized in areas of California up to Oregon and is present in eastern regions of Canada. It mostly inhabits the wetlands and swamps, including marshes and bogs.  Conservation  Based on the Red List of Threatened Species 2016, P. virginica is a taxon of Least Concern, this is because of its broad range in eastern and central North America. In some areas within the range of P. virginica the populations are diminishing. It has also been found in California. While common in most of its range, P. virginica is listed as Endangered in Iowa.  Pollination biology  In the pistillate stage the spadix of P. virginica is entirely covered by the spathe, not allowing insects to pollinate female flowers. Pollination is achieved by the plant's utilizing brood-site-based pollination. The chloropid fly Elachiptera formosa forms a symbiotic relationship with the inflorescence. The flies are attracted to the odor of the male flowers in an inflorescence's staminate stage where they feed on pollen and mate then find oviposition sites, followed by the development of the larvae and maturity of the flies.  Ethnobotany  The plant contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it unpalatable. Indigenous peoples of the Americas used most parts of the plant for food, however, cooking it for hours first to make it safe to eat.Plant of the Week Historical accounts suggest that Native Americans may have used Peltandra virginica as a food source. They may have eaten the seeds and fruits as well as the leaves and roots. The section of P. virginicas range where its populations are highest, from Pennsylvania to coastal Virginia, are where it was most likely used for food. In other times and places, it has been used as an ornamental plant and to stabilize sediments in small bodies of water.  Wildlife  Peltandra virginica is considered a low percentage of various animals' food sources. Peltandra virginica makes up 5-10% of the diet of small mammals that reside within its range and makes up 10-25% of the diet of water birds that share its range. Peltandra virginica makes up 5-10% of the diet of water birds that share its range.  Toxicity  The non-reproductive structures of Peltandra virginica are known to contain calcium oxalate crystals, that can irritate the gastrointestinal system of animals and people and has been linked to the development of kidney stones.

Two special-build HX Kingswood variants emerged later in production. A Kingswood Silver Anniversary model was released in November 1976 to celebrate 50 years of General Motors in Australia and a Kingswood Deluxe sedan and wagon was also introduced during the HX model life in September 1977 with a 4.2 litre V8 as standard.

Plans to produce sedan and wagon versions of the Holden WB reached an advanced stage but ultimately were not pursued.Tony Davis, Ewan Kennedy & Alisator Kennedy, The Holden Heritage, Eighth Edition, 1998, page 59 These variants would have supplemented the new Holden Commodore models in the family car market. = Statesman = The Statesman WB range of long-wheelbase luxury sedans, developed by General Motors-Holden‚Äôs in parallel with the Holden WB series, was released in May 1980. Like their Statesman HZ predecessors, the two models in the Statesman WB range, the de Ville and the Caprice, were marketed as \\"Statesman\\" rather than as \\"Holden\\".Tony Davis and John Wright, Spotlight on Holden Commodore 1978-1988, (Including HSV and Statesman WB), 1994, page 9 File:1982 Holden WB utility (2015-06-18) 02.jpgHolden WB utility File:1980-85 WB One Tonner Bamboo.JPGHolden One Tonner (WB), early with circular headlights File:1982 Holden WB panel van (23151570612).jpgHolden WB panel van File:Holden WB Kingswood Sedan prototype (1979).jpg1979 Holden Kingswood (WB) sedan (prototype)  Powertrain  A 3.3-litre inline six cylinder engine was standard equipment and a 4.2-litre V8 was offered as an option.

History Public vending In 1950, Joseph Jeger, a Swiss employee working in Basel, went on a business trip to the United States and saw his first vending machines in factories there. He thought it would be a great idea to put similar vending machines in the factory of the company he worked for. Spending all his savings, he ordered five machines from the US producer and was allowed to install them in the factory. Joseph Jeger's employer is still a client of Selecta. Factory workers used Jeger's machines day in and day out. The American machines were produced with American fittings making them expensive to maintain. To overcome this, Jeger rented a garage in his home town of Murten, hired his first employee and produced the first vending machine made in Switzerland. This vending machine was the first to carry the name Selecta in 1957. =Milestones= * 1957 - Selecta founded in Switzerland. * 1985 - Selecta joins the Valora Group. * 1997 - Selecta floats on the Swiss Stock Exchange at CHF 515 million. * 2001 - Compass Group acquires Selecta for CHF 1.35 billion. * 2007 - Selecta is purchased by Allianz Capital Partners for CHF 1.80 billion. * 2012 - Selecta partners with Starbucks to launch Starbucks Office Coffee. * 2015 - Selecta is purchased by KKR for CHF 3.7bn. * 2017 - Selecta acquires Pelican Rouge, a company with operations in eight European countries.

Osmond won the annual Carnegie Medal, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. In more than seventy years only a handful of nonfiction books have been so honoured. Description Ten full- colour double-page paintings and numerous black-and-white drawings combine with a simple, fluent text to tell the story of the changes in a valley's landscape and its gradual settlement from prehistoric to Victorian times. \\"[A]n uninhabited stretch of forest ... [becomes] a hillside, a swamp, a village and eventually the bustling Victorian town of Dungate.\\" The same bend in the river, rounding a hill, appears throughout, as on the cover. Origins Edward Osmond, a well known illustrator, was asked to help students with learning difficulties: \\"I illustrated on a blackboard my lectures by means of an imaginary village which, together, we created 'from scratch'.\\" The educational effectiveness of the concept in seizing the imagination led to the idea for a picture book. The text was always secondary.

Additionally, with his failed nomination of John J. Parker, Hoover became the first president since Grover Cleveland to have a Supreme Court nomination rejected by the United States Senate. Charles Evans Hughes nomination Chief Justice William Howard Taft retired on February 3, 1930, and the same day Hoover nominated former Associate Justice Charles Evans Hughes to fill the vacancy. Hughes was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 13, 1930 by a vote of 52-26.Supreme Court Nominations, 1789-present, senate.gov. Hughes had served as Governor of New York, law professor at Cornell, and an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. He ran for President in 1916 and was Secretary of State from 1921 to 1925. Hughes' nomination was opposed by progressives and Southern Democrats, and also due to his age. At 67, Hughes was the oldest man ever nominated as Chief Justice. He survived the contentious confirmation process, accepted by a vote of 52 to 26. For all of its eleven years, the Hughes Court had to wrestle with the economic problems of the Great Depression. Hughes was prolific, producing 283 opinions during his tenure. He was considered a judicial activist with regard to civil liberties. On economic issues he generally supported limits on the regulatory powers of the federal government and states (judicial activism) until 1937, and accepted federal legislation (judicial restraint) from then on. Owen Roberts nomination Associate Justice Edward T. Sanford died on March 8, 1930. On March 21, 1930, Hoover nominated John J. Parker to fill the vacancy. Parker's nomination came under fire from organized labor and the NAACP, and was rejected by the United States Senate on May 7, 1930 by a vote of 39-41. Hoover moved quickly to name a replacement and nominated Philadelphia attorney Owen Roberts on May 9, 1930. Roberts garnered widespread support due to his role in prosecuting the Teapot Dome scandal, and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 20, 1930 by a voice vote. Benjamin Cardozo nomination In 1932, Justice Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes retired from the Court. Hoover was immediately pressured on a number of fronts to appoint highly esteemed New York judge Benjamin N. Cardozo to the vacancy. Support came from the entire faculty of the University of Chicago Law School, as well as the deans of the law schools at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia. Justice Harlan F. Stone also strongly urged Hoover to name Cardozo, even offering to resign to make room for him if Hoover had his heart set on someone else (Stone had in fact suggested to Calvin Coolidge that he should nominate Cardozo rather than himself back in 1925).Milton C. Handler, \\"Clerking for Justice Harlan Fiske Stone\\", Journal of Supreme Court History (December 1995). Hoover, however, originally demurred: there were already two justices from New York, and a Jew on the court; in addition, Justice James McReynolds was a notorious anti-Semite. When the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William E. Borah of Idaho, added his strong support for Cardozo, however, Hoover finally bowed to the pressure, and nominated Cardozo on February 15, 1932. The New York Times said of Cardozo's appointment that \\"seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended.\\" Democratic Cardozo's appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee's contribution to law. However, Hoover was running for re-election, eventually against Franklin D. Roosevelt, so a larger political calculation may have been operating. Cardozo was confirmed by a unanimous voice vote in the Senate on February 24, 1932.(New York Times, February 25, 1932, p. 1) On a radio broadcast on March 1, 1932, the day of Cardozo's confirmation, Clarence C. Dill, Democratic Senator for Washington, called Hoover's appointment of Cardozo \\"the finest act of his career as President\\".(New York Times, March 2, 1932, p. 13) Names mentioned Following is a list of individuals who were mentioned in various news accounts and books as having been considered by Hoover for a Supreme Court appointment: =United States Supreme Court (elevation to Chief Justice)= * Harlan Fiske Stone (1872-1946) =United States Courts of Appeals= Courts of Appeals * Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit **John J.

High-grade dysplasia, here called high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) D. Squamous cell carcinoma, infiltrating the stroma (middle and left in image), and HSIL (right in image) Epithelial dysplasia, a term becoming increasingly referred to as intraepithelial neoplasia, is the sum of various disturbances of epithelial proliferation and differentiation as seen microscopically. Individual cellular features of dysplasia are called epithelial atypia. Examples of epithelial dysplasia include cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ‚Äì a disorder commonly detected by an abnormal pap smear) consisting of an increased population of immature (basal-like) cells which are restricted to the mucosal surface, and have not invaded through the basement membrane to the deeper soft tissues. Analogous conditions include vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Metanephric dysplastic hematoma of the sacral region is a dysplastic overgrowth observed in infants.  Screening  Some tests which detect cancer could be called \\"screening for epithelial dysplasia\\". The principle behind these tests is that physicians expect dysplasia to occur at the same rate in a typical individual as it would in many other people. Because of this, researchers design screening recommendations which assume that if a physician can find no dysplasia at certain time, then doing testing before waiting until new dysplasia could potentially develop would be a waste of medical resources for the patient and the healthcare provider because the chances of detecting anything is extremely low. Some examples of this in practice are that if a patient whose endoscopy did not detect dysplasia on biopsy during screening for Barrett's esophagus, then research shows that there is little chance of any test detecting dysplasia for that patient within three years. Individuals at average-risk for colorectal cancer should have another screening after ten years if they get a normal result and after five years if they have only one or two adenomatous polyps removed. Microscopic changes Dysplasia is characterised by four major pathological microscopic changes: # Anisocytosis (cells of unequal size) # Poikilocytosis (abnormally shaped cells) # Hyperchromatism (excessive pigmentation) # Presence of mitotic figures (an unusual number of cells which are currently dividing). Other changes that occur in epithelial dysplasia include: * Drop-shaped rete processes * Basal cell hyperplasia * Irregular epithelial stratification * Increased nuclear- cytoplasmic ratio * Increased normal and abnormal mitosis * Enlarged nucleoli * Individual cell keratinization * Loss or reduction of cellular cohesion * Cellular pleomorphism * Loss of basal cell polarity * Koilocytosis Epithelial cell dysplasia is divided into three categories of severity: mild, moderate, and severe. Epithelial dysplasia becomes microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma once the tumor begins to invade nearby tissue. Dysplasia vs. carcinoma in situ vs. invasive carcinoma Cervical dysplasia illustrations showing CIN pathology These terms are related since they represent three stages in the progression of many malignant tumors of the epithelium. The likelihood of the development to cancer is related to the degree of dysplasia.Ridge JA, Glisson BS, Lango MN, et al. \\"Head and Neck Tumors\\" in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (eds.) Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach. 11th ed. 2008. * Dysplasia is the earliest form of precancerous lesion which pathologists can recognize in a pap smear or in a biopsy. Dysplasia can be low grade or high grade. The risk of low-grade dysplasia transforming into high- grade dysplasia, and eventually cancer, is low. Treatment is usually straightforward. High-grade dysplasia represents a more advanced progression towards malignant transformation. * Carcinoma in situ, meaning \\"cancer in place\\", represents the transformation of a neoplastic lesion to one in which cells undergo essentially no maturation, thus may be considered cancer-like. In this state, epithelial cells have lost their tissue identity and have reverted to a primitive cell form that grows rapidly and with abnormal regulation for the tissue type. However, this form of cancer remains localized, and has not invaded past the basement membrane into tissues below the surface. * Invasive carcinoma is the final step in this sequence. It is a cancer which has invaded beyond the basement membrane and has potential to spread to other parts of the body. Invasive carcinoma can usually be treated, but not always successfully. However, if it is left untreated, it is almost always fatal.

Spreading over an area of 800 hectares (8 million square meters), the arrangement of the city is inspired by the traditional carpets of Middle East. Once completed, the project will contain studio and one bedroom apartments and accommodate over 60,000 residents. Dubai International City is located in the Al Warsan region of Dubai, opposite to the Dubai Central Fruit and Vegetable Market. It is composed of 485 buildings embraces the residential districts of Central Business District (CBD), Persia, Greece, Spain, Morocco, England, France, Italy, Russia, China and Emirates. Apart from these districts that were initially planned for Dubai International City namely Lake District and Forbidden City are now on put on hold due to the effects of the Global Financial Recession. Attractions in the city include the Dragon Mart, which is the world's biggest machinery and equipment market.  Projects Residential districts= The Residential District of Dubai international city is expected to have numerous country-specific and themed residential developments and retail outlets. The plans include ten country- specific districts: *China District at one end of the residential district. *England Precinct, mirroring traditional London architecture. *France District featuring two-, three- and four-storey residential blocks characterized by long French windows, red and gray bricks, and pilasters or half-columns. * Persia District, situated in the heart of the residential district. *Greece District, at the edge of the residential district. *Russia District *Spain District. Its three- and four-storey buildings are designed according to traditional stucco exterior finish. *Morocco District. The precinct's three- and four-storey residential buildings are decorated with green tiles, natural terra-cottas, stucco walls and wide-arched windows. *Italy District. Two- to four-storey residential blocks. *Emirates District. The 10th precinct in the Residential District lies at the northeast end. = The Central District= This is the most luxurious and stylish residences in Dubai International city. With building security, pools, private parking, gyms and park it is a family paradise. There are many shops and restaurants in the area. =The Forbidden City= It will encompass an area of 240,000 square metres with parking facilities for 2,000 cars, the city is the replica of Forbidden City of Beijing, China. Its construction has been halted for a long time due to lack of financial funding. Right now there is a pond with contaminated water and fish = The Lake District = The Lake District surrounds the Al Warsan Lake. The lake is off-limits to public. = Dragon Mart = DragonMart, developed by Nakheel, is a large mall for wholesale purchase of Chinese products. The large size of this mall makes it a gateway for customers making purchase runs throughout the Middle Eastern and north African markets, and is a platform for Chinese traders and manufacturers seeking regional market entry. The mall has been a commercial success and construction has started on a second mall adjacent to Dragon Mart that will have 175,000 square metres of space and 4,500 parking spaces. The project was completed in December 2015.\\"Schumpeter: Mall of the masses: The traders in Dubai‚Äôs Dragon Mart are kitting out the emerging world‚Äôs new middle class\\", The Economist, dated 14 April 2012. =Warsan Village= Launched in 2013, Warsan Village is located at the periphery of International City. This enclave within International City features 942 townhouses and 250 apartments. Construction was finished in Q3 2019. Past Issues from 2008 to till date There was an issue in 2008: Nakheel's International City Development has been questioned by news articles with controversies and issues. These articles claim International City has struggled with a poor reputation and negative press reports stemming from various issues including problems with its own sewage systems and the nearby sewage facility, access to the site, and a perceived lack of amenities. A follow-up poll from Emirates 24-7 revealed that a huge percentage ‚Äì 91 percent ‚Äì of readers showed ‚Äúa marked aversion to investing in International City units.‚Äù A considerable 67 percent said they ‚Äúwould not touch the place.‚Äù This issue has been solved by 2012 =Sewage plant proximity= Due to its proximity to the Sewage Treatment Plant, and constant overflow, certain clusters like Morocco, Emirates & China are subjected to the odor of sewage when the wind direction changes at night. =Traffic= Entering has been quite easy with multiple entries and exit from E311 and E611 to and from the city. During rush hour can require you to spend 10‚Äì20 minutes gridlocked only in 1 exit that is serving 311, but Al Awir and academic city exits are quite free. RTA has proposed a huge road development for Dragon mart 2 and International city to further easy the traffic. =Law and order= While Nakheel's noble intentions were to make low and medium-cost housing available to the masses (who were suffering due to the real-estate boom up until mid 2008 and before the GFC) by providing medium and low-income earners with legal and decent housing instead of resorting to illegitimate Villa Sharing, Dubai was badly hit by the Global Financial Crisis. This led to an instant devaluation or rentals by 75% ‚Äì 80% of its value in 2008. Due to this sudden drop in prices, even the extremely lowest income group (laborers, truck drivers, taxi drivers) identified this area as a potential upgrade to their existing Labor camps. Coupled with Nakheel's financial downfall, controls and checks over the city's security, compliance to regulations and maintenance of infrastructure were dropped beginning in January 2009 by the developer who used to control and maintain this earlier.

Following ordination he served as curate at St Wilfrid, Hulme until 1910, when he was loaned to the Diocese of Newport. Returning to the Salford Diocese in 1911, he was appointed to St Thomas of Canterbury, Higher Broughton, where he remained until 1922, when he was appointed to Collyhurst, tasked with founding the new parish of St Malachy. In 1934 he was appointed Parish Priest at St Wilfrid, Longridge and then in 1935 at St Anne's Church, Ancoats. In 1935, Marshall was made Vicar General of the Diocese and in 1937 was elevated to the Cathedral Chapter. Upon the death of Bishop Thomas Henshaw, he was appointed as Vicar Capitular and on 5 August 1939 was appointed as the new Bishop, being consecrated on 21 September 1939 on the eve of the Second World War.http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/30th- september-1939/17/consecration-of-the-bishop-of-salford-mgr-henry-vi This was a difficult time for the Bishop and his diocese, with mobilisation, conscription, evacuation, war work, war-time shortages and the Blitz placing grave pressures on families and parishes. Several churches and schools were bombed. Marshall was privately opposed to further evacuations of Catholic children to areas where they would not be near the Catholic Church, arguing that he would \\"rather see children killed than that they should lose their precious gift of faith, purity, and piety\\", even though 347 children aged under five were killed in the bombing raids.Blood, Sweat, and Toil: Remaking the British Working Class, 1939-1945, Geoffrey G.

Marshall created a \\"School Emergency Fund\\" which still levies parishes today. Post war slum clearance and the creation of overspill estates added to his burdens. However, new parishes and schools, primary and secondary, were opened. In 1954 the diocese was legally registered as a charity. Such was the bishop's leadership and grasp of detail that the diocese was humorously described as being under \\"Martial Law\\". Marshall died on 14 April 1955, age 70.

Hindu king Samrat Vikramaditya Hemu reconstructed the temple and brought back the temple from ruins.

History Entrance gate from outside the Yogmaya temple In 12th-century Jain scriptures, Mehrauli place is also mentioned as Yoginipura, after the temple. The temple is believed to be built by the Pandavas, at the end of Mahabharata war. Mehrauli is one of the seven ancient cities that make up the present state of Delhi. The temple has its association with Mughal Emperor Akbar II (1806‚Äì37) by Lala Sethmal. The temple lies 260 yards from the Iron Pillar in the Qutb complex, and within the Lal Kot walls, the first fortress citadel of Delhi, constructed by the Tomar/Tanwar King Anangpal I around AD 731 and expanded by King AnangPal II in the 11th century who also constructed Lal Kot. Structure Entry into the temple precincts The temple rebuilt in 1827 is a simple but contemporary structure with an entrance hall and a sanctum sanctorum that houses the main Idol of Yogmaya made of black stone placed in a marble well of width and depth. The sanctum is square with a flat roof over which a truncated shikara (tower) is built. Apart from this tower, a dome is the other feature seen in the temple (pictured). The idol is covered in sequins and cloth. Two small pankhas (fans) of the same materials are seen suspended over the Idol from the roof. The walled enclosure around the temple is square, with towers at the four corners. Twenty two towers were built within the precincts of the temple at the orders of the Sood Mal, the builder. The floor of the temple was originally made of red stone but since then has been replaced by marble. The main tower above the sanctum is high and has copper plated shikara or pinnacle. The flowers and sweet meats offered by the Devotees to the goddess are placed over a marble table of 18 inches square and 9 inches height set in front of the idol in the sanctum floor. Bells, otherwise a part of Hindu temples, are not tolled during the worship of the goddess. Wine and meat are forbidden to be offered at the temple and goddess Yoga Maya is stated to be austere and exacting. An interesting display at the temple premises in the past (but now in an open wall panel) was an iron cage of square and in height in which two stone tigers are exhibited. A passage, between the temple and the wall panel has flat roof which is covered with the planks overlaid by bricks and mortar and fixed with bells. Goddess Bells at the entry door It is believed that the main idol in the temple was that of Yogamaya ( daughter of Yashoda), an incarnation of Durga, born as the sister of Krishna. Kansa, cousin of Devaki (mother of Krishna) and uncle of Yogamaya and Kansa attempted to kill Yogamaya on Krishna Janmastami day when Krishna was born. But Yogamaya, who was cleverly substituted for Krishna, vanished after predicting Kansa's death at the hands of her brother Krishna. Folk legends Another folk legend is that of Mughal Emperor Akbar II's (r. 1806-1837) association with the temple. His wife was distraught at the incarceration and exile of her son Mirza Jehangir who had fired from a Red Fort window at the then British Resident that had resulted in the killing of the bodyguard. Yogamaya had appeared in her dream and the Queen praying for her son's safe return had vowed to place Punkah made of flowers at the Yogmaya temple and in the nearby Muslim shrine of Qutbuddin Bhaktiar Khaki. This practice set since then is continued to this day in the name of Phool Walon Ki Sair, a festival held for three days during October every year. Another important fact about this ancient temple is that for more than 5000 years {i.e. the times when the said temple was built}, the people who live around this ancient temple have been taking care of the yogamaya temple. It is said and believed that all these people who are now more than 200 in number had one common ancestor at point in time who, hundreds of years ago started the practice of taking care of the temple by offering prayers to the goddess which includes doing the shringar of the goddess yogamaya twice a day, cleaning the temple, making and distributing prasad to the devotees visiting the temple and other related things. These 200 odd people who now take care of the temple carrying forward the customs and traditions of their forefathers do it voluntarily and amicably. Phoolwalon- ki-sair Festival One of two punkah suspended in the sanctum above the idol of Yogmaya: one inscribed Delhi and the other inscribed Haryana, during Phool Walon Ki Sair, a syncretic festival of Hindus and Muslims held in October every year in Mehrauli The annual Phoolwalon-ki-sair Festival (Festival of flower-sellers), which commences from the dargah of Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki also in Mehrauli, every autumn (Oct-Nov). First started in 1812, the festival has today, become an important inter-faith festivals of Delhi, and includes offering a floral punkah to the deity at the Yogmaya temple.'Phoolwalon Ki Sair' begins in Delhi The Times of India, 2 November 2006.

Life He was the second son of Patrick Forbes of Corse Castle, bishop of Aberdeen, by his marriage to Lucretia, a daughter of David Spens of Wormiston, Fife. He entered King's College, Aberdeen, in 1607. In 1612 he visited his exiled uncle John Forbes at Middelburg, and then went to the university of Heidelberg. There he studied theology under David Pareus. In 1615 he moved to Sedan, and continued his studies under his kinsman Andrew Melville. After some time at other universities, he was ordained at Middelburg in April 1619, by his uncle John Forbes and other presbyters.:s:Forbes, John (1593-1648) (DNB00) He married about this time a Middelburg lady, Soete Roosboom, and returned the same year to Aberdeen, of which his father was by then bishop. In 1620 he was appointed by the synod professor of divinity in King's College. His first publication, Irenicum Amatoribus Veritatis et Pacis in Ecclesia Scoticana, Aberdeen, 1629, was commended by James Ussher. In this work he defended with moderation the lawfulness of episcopacy, and of the innovations in worship allowed by the synod of Perth in 1618. On his father's death in 1635 he succeeded to the Corse Castle estate, his elder brother Patrick having predeceased him. He contributed a Latin sermon, a Dissertatio de Visione Beatifica, and Latin verses to the bishop's 'Funerals,' and probably supervised the whole collection. When at Aberdeen he sought recreation in the game of golf. In February 1637 he took some part in furthering John Durie's plans for uniting the reformed and Lutheran churches. Forbes, though he deplored Charles I's measures for remodelling the church of Scotland, considered the National Covenant an unlawful bond, and in April 1638 he published a tract against it entitled A Peaceable Warning to the Subjects in Scotland. In July 1638 the Earl of Montrose, Alexander Henderson, and other covenanting leaders visited Aberdeen to make converts to their cause. Forbes and five other doctors of divinity put into their hands a paper containing queries concerning the covenant, and a debate followed, which was conducted in writing. The doctors argued against the covenant as unlawful in itself, and as abjuring episcopacy and Perth articles, to which they had sworn obedience at their ordination. In 1639 subscription was made compulsory. Efforts were made to induce Forbes to sign, and the covenanters acknowledged his orthodoxy; they delayed proceedings in his case in the hope of his submission. His final answer was that he could not profess what his conscience condemned, and he was thereupon deprived of his chair, and forced to leave the official residence, which he had himself given to the university. The synod of Aberdeen petitioned the general assembly to allow him to continue his professorial duties without taking the covenant, but this was refused. He made no separation from the church, now presbyterian, but attended its services and received the communion as formerly. In 1643 the solemn league and covenant was sanctioned by the assembly and parliament, and all adults were ordered to swear it on pain of confiscation, and of being declared enemies to God, king, and country. For Forbes, who thought the solemn league more objectionable than the national covenant, obedience was out of the question, and to escape prosecution he sailed for Veere 5 April 1644, with his surviving son George; his wife had died in 1640. He visited towns in the Netherlands, and at Amsterdam prepared his major theological work.Instructiones Historico-Theologicae de Doctrina Christiana, et vario rerum statu, ortisque erroribus et controversiis, jam inde a temporibus Apostolicis ad tempora usque seculi decimi-septimi priora, Amsterdam, 1645. Forbes preached frequently in the Scots and English churches, and often joined in the Dutch and French services. He returned to Aberdeen in July 1646, and spent the remainder of his life in seclusion at Corse. He died there on 29 April 1648 and was buried in the churchyard of Leochel. His son George married a daughter of Kennedy of Kermuck. A second edition of his Instructiones was published at Geneva in 1680, and in 1702-3 all of his works in Latin were printed at Amsterdam in two folio volumes. This edition contains a translation into Latin of his diary, treatises on moral theology, and the Pastoral Care, and his previously printed works, with additions and corrections from his manuscripts.

At the end of the 1980s, Onoue for a short time handled astronomical sums of investment capital, becoming one of the people symbolizing the Japanese bubble economy. In the last stages of the bubble the financing of her stock purchases turned sour and she was arrested, tried and convicted of fraud involving financial institutions.  Investment Fraud  Onoue's restaurant flourished when she earned a reputation of accurately predicting stock market trends and horse racing outcomes for her customers. With the advent of the bubble her predictions became uncanny, and many customers from security financing and banks visited her restaurant as she became better known as a fortune teller than a restaurant owner. Before long, she personally took large loans from banks and started trading stocks. During the bubble's climax in 1988, she had received loans from financial institutions of 227 billion yen, held close to 40 billion yen in timed deposits, had made a profit of 4.8 billion yen from stocks, purchased 28.8 billion yen worth of warik≈ç discounted bonds, and paid 5.5 billion yen in interest rates. By the climax of the economic bubble, Onoue had become the largest single investor in all of Japan, as well as one of the world's wealthiest people, with her portfolio having accumulated a worth of $4.4 billion. When the gloom of the bubble became visible, however, her investments suddenly worsened and she acquired astronomical debt. At that point she escalated a fraudulent behaviour that she had been involved in previously: her scam consisted of having bank managers of her acquaintance working at T≈çy≈ç Shinyo Kinko bank to issue fake certificates of deposit in her name, which she would present as proof to other financial institutions of her credit worthiness, against which other banks would in turn release securities against which she traded stocks and bonds. \\"Court sentences Onoue to 12 years for fraud,\\" The Japan Times, March 2, 1998.Japan: Beyond the End of History by David Williams, 2002 Until her arrest, she fraudulently acquired 342 billion yen from 12 financial institutions, including non-commercial banks. Before long this forgery of securities was discovered, which led to her arrest for fraud on August 13, 1991. The money she borrowed from financial institutions amounted to a total of 2 trillion 773.6 billion yen, \\"Court sentences Onoue to 12 years for fraud,\\" The Japan Times, March 2, 1998. with returned payments amounted to a total of 2 trillion 306 billion yen. The bankruptcy proceedings which began after her detention set her total debt at 430 billion yen, the highest ever accumulated by an individual in Japan. In court, Onoue's lawyers hoped to argue that she held no responsibility as she had absolutely no knowledge of stocks and was being manipulated by her surroundings; the defense strategy failed and she was sentenced to 12 years in prison. \\"Court sentences Onoue to 12 years for fraud,\\" The Japan Times, March 2, 1998. As a direct result of the fraud, neither of the two banks that handled huge amounts of Onoue's financing exist today. The Industrial Bank of Japan was consumed in a merger with Fuji Bank that created Mizuho Corporate Bank, and the financially failed T≈çy≈ç Shinyo Kinko bank partially merged with a number of prefectural credit unions.  Religion  In the end of 1970, according to former high school principal Hiraoka Shizuto, Onoue became a nun at Mount K≈çya's Kong≈çbuji H≈çon'in temple and adapted the name of Junk≈ç. Being closely acquainted with the Hiraoka family, she participated on an enlightenment tour to a Buddhist temple in India (Gyume temple), organized by the family. At that time, Onoue donated 20 million yen to the Gyume temple, but the Hiraoka family stresses that they made the donation. On the same tour, Onoue and Hiraoka together met the Dalai Lama.

Theory of semigroups  In the theory of semigroups, a weak inverse of an element x in a semigroup is an element y such that . If every element has a weak inverse, the semigroup is called an E-inversive or E-dense semigroup. An E-inversive semigroup may equivalently be defined by requiring that for every element , there exists such that and are idempotents. preprint An element x of S for which there is an element y of S such that is called regular. A regular semigroup is a semigroup in which every element is regular. This is a stronger notion than weak inverse. Every regular semigroup is E-inversive, but not vice versa. If every element x in S has a unique inverse y in S in the sense that and then S is called an inverse semigroup.  Category theory  In category theory, a weak inverse of an object A in a monoidal category C with monoidal product ‚äó and unit object I is an object B such that both and are isomorphic to the unit object I of C.

The majority are not ethnically Arab but numerous groups who include Arabs, Kurds, Copts, Druze, Maronites, Assyrians, Berbers, Turkmens and others. The majority are Christian by faith with minorities being Muslim, Druze, Yazidi and other faiths. Overview Arab Australians generally share a common cultural heritage, which originates in the Arabic-speaking countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). According to the AHRC, most Egyptian (69%), Lebanese (61%) and Syrian (46%) emigrants to Australia settled before 1986. Other MENA populations mainly arrived later during the 1990s, such as Iraqis, Somalis and Sudanese. Although the countries of origin of Arab Australians are all primarily Islamic (>70%), emigrants to Australia from these states belonged to various religious orders not proportional to their home countries' religious demographics. Most Egypt-born and Lebanon-born Australians were Christian Copts (84%) and Maronites (55%), respectively. The majority of Arab Australians are overwhelmingly Lebanese, and collectively, Christian Arab Australians (including Lebanese Christian Australians together with other Christian Arab Australians) comprise a majority of Arab Australians. The proportion of Muslims was highest among immigrants from Somalia (97% of Somali Australians are Muslim) and Jordan (40% of Jordanian Australians are Muslim), followed by Syria (34% of Syrian Australians are Muslim) and Iraq (31% of Iraqi Australians are Muslim). Arab Australians are mainly concentrated in Victoria and New South Wales. Smaller groups also reside in Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia, with fewer in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Demographics In the 2001 census, 248,807 Australian residents reported Arab ancestry. Additionally, 209,372 Australians indicated that they spoke Arabic at home. 162,283 Australian residents were born in one of the 22 Arab League nations, a proportion which represented 0.8% of Australia's population. 120,000 Australians also had a parent who was born in an Arab state. The most common countries of origin for Arab Australians were Lebanon (71,349), Egypt (33,432) and Iraq (24,832). Of these, a further 89,021 had a Lebanese-born parent and 10,296 had an Egyptian-born parent. Additionally, Australia is a major tourist destination for people from the United Arab Emirates, with 14,000 Emiratis entering the country each year. There is also an Emirati international student community of between 1,200 and 2,000 pupils. According to the AHRC, most Australian residents born in Arab nations are citizens of Australia. The citizenship take-up rate is highest among the earlier settlers, who have been established longer. 91.6% of Egypt-born residents were Australian citizens, followed by immigrants born in Lebanon (91.3%), Syria (86.2%), Somalia (70.1%), and Iraq (68.1%).

She is chiefly noted as one of the early leaders of the Women's Police Volunteers. Allen repeatedly sought to challenge or modernise the existing systems of the time, ensuring the Women's Police Service could become an auxiliary force after women were admitted into certain British police forces. She stood once for the House of Commons as an Independent Liberal, turning over her Women's Auxiliary Service to breaking the General Strike of 1926. Thereafter she met and talked with European fascists and anti-communist brigades, entailing frequent trips abroad and publicly joining the British Union of Fascists in 1939. In retirement Allen was an activist for animal rights. Early years Allen was born to a well- to-do family in Cardiff in 1878, one of the ten children of Thomas Isaac Allen, Chief Superintendent of the Great Western Railway. Mary was close to her sisters, all of whom had a tendency to religious mysticism. She was educated at home and later at Princess Helena College. She left home at the age of thirty in 1908 after a disagreement with her father about women's suffrage (not going back home until he died in December 1911). Allen joined Emmeline Pankhurst's Women's Social and Political Union, becoming an organiser in the South West, and later in Edinburgh. She was imprisoned three times in 1909 for smashing windows, including at the Inland Revenue and Liberal Club in Bristol and at the Home Office, twice went on hunger-strike, and was force-fed on the last occasion, for which she was awarded a Hunger Strike Medal ' for Valour' by Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. Whilst in prison she, with others were sewing prison shirts secretly embroidered messages such as 'Votes for Women' in the shirt tails. First World War Mary Sophia Allen (right) and Margaret Damer Dawson, World War I.At the outbreak of the First World War, militant suffragist activities ceased. Allen turned down an offer of work with a needlework guild (see for example Queen Mother's Clothing Guild) and looked around for a more active occupation. She heard that a number of women were trying to set up a women's police force and, in 1914, she joined Nina Boyle's Women Police Volunteers. This was taken over by Margaret Damer Dawson in 1915 and renamed the Women Police Service (WPS), with Allen as second-in-command. They designed their own uniform and opened training schools in London and Bristol. They saw their role as mainly dealing with women and children and rescuing women from \\"vice\\" (prostitution) and 'white slavery'. Allen served at Grantham and Kingston upon Hull, overseeing the morals of women in the vicinity of army barracks. She went on to police munitions factories which employed large numbers of women. She also worked in London, where 'khaki fever' was perceived as a problem. Child welfare work led the WPS to set up a benevolent department and a home for mothers and babies. Allen was awarded the OBE for services during the War. Allen and Margaret Damer Dawson cropped their hair and assumed a severe military appearance, and Allen wore her police uniform in public for the rest of her life. In 1915 Dawson made a will which left everything to Allen; when Dawson died unexpectedly in 1920, Allen assumed the role of WPS Commandant.Hastings Press biography states that Allen became Commandant when Dawson retired in 1919; it also states that Dawson died in 1921 After the War, the WPS was expected to disband: the authorities saw no further need of that organisation. The Metropolitan Police (the Met) set up its own women's division and accused the WPS of masquerading as Metropolitan policewomen. Allen was even arrested in 1921 for wearing a Metropolitan Police uniform before it was decided that her activities, which included producing dossiers on left-wing activists, were harmless and she should be allowed to continue wearing it.Martin Pugh, \\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\\" Fascists and Fascism in Britain Between the War, Pimlico, 2006, p. 102 The WPS changed their name to the Women's Auxiliary Service (WAS) and, with minor modifications to their uniform, carried on as before, setting up a further training school in Edinburgh. The Government appointed the Baird Committee to investigate the activities of the WAS. Despite no longer being recognised by the authorities, Allen was invited by the Government to travel to Germany and advise on the policing of the British Army of the Rhine. This semi-acceptance encouraged her to represent herself overseas as chief of the British women police. She travelled in uniform and was welcomed by police authorities in Europe and in South and North America. Politics In November 1922 Allen stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as a candidate for Westminster St George's. During the General Strike of 1926 Allen was involved with the Organisation for the Maintenance of Supplies and turned her Women's Auxiliary Service over to the strike-breaking movement. Allen learned to fly. She attended international police congresses in Austria and Germany. She also visited the Netherlands, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Turkey and Brazil, advising on the training of police women. She travelled to Egypt in 1936 on holiday (wearing her uniform), but was received as if sent by the police authorities in Britain. Her interest in combatting prostitution continued to be a preoccupation, and she attended the League of Nations conference in Geneva on the traffic in women. Wherever she went, she was perceived by many as the leading British policewoman. She did nothing to discourage the impression, and made contact with police chiefs and political leaders all over Europe.Mary Allen in 1922.The Home Office began to take an interest in Allen's activities in 1927. She was becoming an embarrassment and a nuisance to the Government, partly because of her acceptance abroad as representing the British authorities, and partly because she was mistaken for a Metropolitan police officer at home. Home Office records covering the period 1927‚Äì1934 reveal that she kept dossiers on people she suspected of activities connected with vice and white slavery. She was also suspected of fascist activities, and articles by or about her in national newspapers increased the Home Office surveillance. Allen met a number of fascist leaders abroad, including Eoin O'Duffy in Ireland, Franco in Spain, Mussolini in Italy, and Hitler and G√∂ring in Germany. Although her links to Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists were unofficial until 1939, she engaged in various militant activities, including the formation of the Women's Reserve in 1933, which was intended to serve the country in the event of subversive forces taking over. The publicity for the Women's Reserve reveals her fascist sympathies, and her fear of communism. She met Hitler in 1934 and discussed women police with him. She was captivated by Hitler and expressed her admiration for him in public. Once she had joined the British Union of Fascists, she wrote numerous articles for its newspapers and openly declared herself to be a fascist. A Suspension Order under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 was made against her when suspicions arose about her contacts with Germany. Her home was searched, and internment was considered, but not implemented. She was suspected of making flights to Germany, and acting as a spy for the Nazis, but this was never proved. Following the outbreak of the Second World War Allen joined the Women's Voluntary Service but also became a regular speaker at BUF peace rallies. Outrage followed with Daily Herald, Daily Mirror and News Chronicle stories calling for Allen's removal from the WVS, particularly after comments in which she refused to condemn Hitler were published.Pugh, \\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\\", p. 297 Due to her close connections to Mosley and Barry Domvile, Special Branch regarded Allen with some suspicion. There were also questions in the House of Commons from the Labour MP Glenvil Hall in June 1940 as to whether Allen's continued nominal presence on the Advisory Council of the Women's Voluntary Service represented a security risk. After a review of her activities and a study of her personality and associates, the government declined to detain her under Defence Regulation 18B. The final report was dismissive, describing her as a \\"crank...trailing round in a ridiculous uniform\\".Pugh, \\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\\", p. 305 Eventually however she was placed under a lesser form of detention as a precaution, being restricted to within a five-mile radius of her Cornwall home and banned from using cars, bicycles, telephones and the wireless.Pugh, \\"Hurrah For the Blackshirts!\\", p. 306 Personal life Allen was known as 'Robert' by her close circle of female friends, and she was called 'Sir' by her officers. Her friends included Margaret Damer Dawson, Isobel Goldingham and Helen Bourn Tagart, all of whom she met in her policing days. She wrote three volumes of autobiography: The Pioneer Policewoman (1925), A Woman at the Cross Roads (1934), and Lady in Blue (1936). A Woman at the Cross Roads reveals aspects of her life and philosophy but is reticent about her private life. It was written at the time when Allen met Hitler, and her political views are made plain: she was at a crossroads in her life because she was looking at fascism as a solution to the world problems that she perceived. She also wrote numerous articles for newspapers and magazines, and founded The Policewomen‚Äôs Review, which ran from 1927 to 1937, to which she was a major contributor. Few details of Allen's personal life are available after the Second World War. She continued to be associated with Mosley and other fascists, including Norah Elam with whom she had shared a lifelong friendship. Both had been members of the WSPU, and as militant suffragettes had undergone force feeding. They both turned to animal activism after the demise of the Mosley movement, being staunch anti-vivisectionists and members of the London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society. She always had a strong interest in religion, without any particular affiliation. She converted to Roman Catholicism in 1953,Vito, V. (2004-09-23). Allen, Mary Sophia (1878‚Äì1964), police officer.

Some of the insects commonly infected by iflaviruses include aphids, leafhoppers, flies, bees, ants, silkworms and wasps. The name \\"Ifla\\" is derived from the name \\"Infectious flacherie virus\\", for the type species. There is only one genus (Iflavirus) and 15 species in this family, including the type species Infectious flacherie virus. Structure Structure of the family Iflaviridae slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV) virion and the icosahedral asymmetric unit. Members of this family are insect-infecting viruses that consist of positive single-strand RNA genomes translated into a single polyprotein of ~3000 amino acids long. It encodes helicase, protease and RNA- dependent RNA polymerase enzymes and four structural proteins (VP1‚Äì4). The non-enveloped capsid has an icosahedral T=pseudo3 symmetry and is around 30 nm in diameter. VP1, VP2 and VP3 form the outer portion, with VP4 located internally. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 8.8-9.7kb in length. Life cycle Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by ribosomal skipping. Insects serve as the natural host. Pathogenicity Several viruses in this family are economically important because they are highly pathogenic to their honeybee and silkworm hosts, while others (including Dinocampus coccinellae paralysis virus, Nasonia vitripennis virus and Venturia canescens picorna-like virus) appear to cause little or no symptoms.

Early life He was born at Warfield Park, near Bracknell in Berkshire, the only son of Sir John Walsh, 1st Baronet, and Margaret Benn. His mother and father were named Benn but had assumed the surname of Walsh in lieu of his patronymic in 1795, in accordance with the will of his wife's uncle Sir John Walsh (1726-1795), who left him a fortune made in India, including estates in Berkshire and Radnorshire, and also large holdings in Ireland, mainly in Cork and Kerry. Under the terms of the will the Walsh fortune was to be managed by his parents until he came of age. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating in 1816. He inherited the Radnorshire from his mother on attaining his majority in 1819 and also inherited his father's Cumbria estates on his death in 1825. By 1874 his total acreage in Radnorshire had reached 12,500. He also visited his Irish estates regularly over 40 years, and made great efforts to increase the profits. He had the reputation in Ireland of being a harsh and exacting landlord, but his diary shows that he saw himself as a benevolent overseer of his tenants, whom he rewarded for hard work, while ruthlessly evicting those who would not work. Political career He served as High Sheriff of Berkshire and High Sheriff of Radnorshire for 1823. He then sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Sudbury between 1830 and 1835 and 1838 and 1840 and for Radnorshire between 1840 and 1868. He also served as Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of Radnorshire from 1842 to 1875. In 1868 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Ormathwaite, of Ormathwaite in the County of Cumberland. He issued numerous pamphlets, amongst which were: * The Poor Laws in Ireland (1830) * Observations on the Ministerial Plan of Reform (1831) * On the Present Balance of Parties in the State (1832) * Chapters of Contemporary History (1836) * Political Back-Games (1871) * Astronomy and Geology Compared (1872) * Lessons of the French Revolution, 1789-1872 (1873).

It has several trails for walking, running and cycling. The sanctuary functions as a fieldwork site for researchers studying native ecology.  Geography  The area consists of woodland, open grassland and a large dam surrounded by a fox-proof fence. Despite being freehold and then leasehold grazing land prior to becoming a reserve, Mulligans Flat has been subjected to less overall farming pressure than other areas at similar proximity to human activity.Shorthouse D, 2012, The 'making of' the Mulligans Flat - Goorooyarroo restoration project, Ecological Management and Restoration Vol 13 No 1, Ecological Society of Australia As a result, the uniquely intact habitat was given protected status as crucial habitat for threatened wildlife including the golden sun moth, the striped legless lizard and numerous other plant and animal species.July 2015, Extension to the Mulligans Flat and Goorooyarroo Nature Reserves: Offset Management Plan, Territory Municipal Services Directorate Approximately 150 species of wild flowers are found in the sanctuary under stands of 6 different species of gum tree, including threatened Blakely's Red Gum (Eucalyptus blakelyi) and Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora), which are valuable nest trees for the vulnerable Superb Parrot. Mulligans Flat is a sister sanctuary of Zealandia Wildlife Sanctuary. Its chief managing authority is the ACT Government with support from the Woodlands and Wetlands Trust with parallel arrangements for Jerrabomberra Wetlands.  History  Aboriginal heritage = Mulligans Flat is situated on Ngunnawal land. There has been disagreement in the past over traditional ownership in the Canberra region, including the tablelands where Mulligans Flat is located.August 2012, Our Kin, Our Country: Australian Government Genealogy Report, ACT Government Report Old Coach Road, situated in the valley where Mulligans Flat meets Goorooyarroo, is the site of a Ngunnawal Songline. Stone artefacts and tree scarring have been found throughout the reserve and nearby Throsby Offsets.Kelly C, 2013, Reconstructing the Australian story: learning and teaching for reconciliation, thesis, RMIT University Prior to the heavy clearing and farming practices of the nineteenth century, the area had a permanent water supply which is thought to have existed in the form of ponds connected by inconsistent channels. This landscape would have provided food and other resources in the form of a diverse biome of flora and fauna sufficient to support a local community. A volcanic ridge exists along the east of the sanctuary, and to the west, a geological fault line caused a quartz ridge to develop which can be observed via satellite imagery. These quarry sites provided materials for making tools which were used and traded by locals and travelers. Some contemporary methods used by Aboriginal peoples in caring for country on Mulligans Flat include land management, advocacy and working with groups such as the ACT Parks and Conservation Service's Aboriginal Ranger Program. The Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation (TOAC) occasionally runs educational sessions using Mulligans Flat as a teaching location. A welcome to county is included in a self-guided walking tour App. = Sanctuary history = In 1992, seven environmental groups submitted a proposal to the Minister for the Environment for a nature reserve to protect Mulligans Flat from urban development. The area had already been observed as providing habitat for threatened plant and animal species, including six out of seven rare woodland bird species recorded by the community-based Canberra Ornithologist's Group. Mulligans Flat Nature Reserve was subsequently established as part of the Canberra Nature Park in 1994. Protection was extended to include Goorooyarroo Nature Reserve following its establishment in 2004, and to the Throsby Offsets in 2014.Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary Concept Plan, September 2016 Further community participation was encouraged through the establishing of the Friends of Mulligans Flat in 2011 which allows members to take part in ongoing conservation activities such as weed control. The Mulligans Flat-Goorooyarroo Woodland Experiment was established through a partnership between the ACT Government, CSIRO, and the Australian National University (ANU). Ongoing collaboration between these and the sanctuary's management board has enabled restoration projects to take place. Some examples are the reintroduction of several species, habitat recovery, and the monitoring of impacts of a range of management practices.  Conservation  The sanctuary is described in promotional material as an 'outdoor laboratory',ACT Government & ACT Parks and Conservation, Mulligans Flat and Goorooyarroo Nature Reserves brochure, and seeks to achieve ecosystem recovery and restoration through increasing species diversity and available habitat. It is estimated that 30% remains of the site's original eucalyptus woodland. Despite this, Mulligans Flat and Goorooyarroo together provide the country's largest remaining contiguous area of White Box-Yellow Box-Blakely's Red Gum grassy woodland and derived native grassland, which is listed as critically endangered under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as endangered in the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act 1990. In 2011, Mulligans Flat received classification as an IUCN Category IV protected area.TRC Tourism, Proposed West Belconnen Conservation Area June 2014 289x289px = Fox-proof fence = Construction began in 2008 and was completed in 2009 on an 11.5 kilometre fox-proof fence to protect 485 hectares. This was followed by the removal of introduced competitors and predators including rabbits, cats and red foxes, in preparation for reintroducing native species. Mulligans Flat was the first Australian woodland reserve to successfully eradicate foxes and then rabbits. In 2018, the fence was expanded and the protected area nearly tripled to 1253 hectares. Other fences assisting with species management include the kangaroo and bettong exclosures, which provide information to researchers studying restoration processes in the sanctuary. = Reintroduced species = Reintroductions at Mulligans Flat have taken place primarily through partnership with the ANU Fenner School.Portas, Timothy & Evans, Maldwyn & Spratt, David & Vaz, Paola & Devlin, Joanne & Barbosa, Amanda & Wilson, Belinda & Rypalski, Annette & Wimpenny, Claire & Fletcher, Don & Gordon, Iain & Newport, Jenny & Manning, Adrian. (2020). Baseline health and disease assessment of founder eastern quolls (Dasyurus viverrinus) during a conservation translocation to mainland Australia. Journal of wildlife diseases. 10.7589/2019-05-120. The first species to be successfully reintroduced in Mulligans Flat was the eastern bettong (bettongia giamardi) in 2012. Thirty-five individuals were released into the sanctuary following the translocation of Tasmanian bettongs into nearby Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve. This species had been locally extinct on the Australian mainland for 80 years, and its return allowed researchers from the ANU Fenner School of Environment and Society, who led the project, to study the results of re-establishing an ecosystem engineer in an environment concurrent with other restoration practices. This research resulted in a transformational paper in reintroduction biology on 'Translocation Tactics' which informed all subsequent reintroductions. Bush-stone curlews (burhinus grallarius) were reintroduced in 2014 after being absent from the ACT for 40 years. Twelve individuals were placed in a soft-release aviary within Mulligans Flat before being released into the wider sanctuary. This initial release faced some setbacks as several of the birds flew over the fence and were predated by foxes. Over the following two years, 21 more individuals were released using a similar soft-release method, although their flight feathers were clipped before being allowed out of the aviary. As a result, the birds had more time to adjust to their surroundings, and by the time their flight feathers grew back in they had settled in to Mulligans Flat as their permanent home. In 2016, eastern quolls (dasyurus viverrinus), another locally extinct species, were reintroduced to Mulligans Flat. Half of the 16 individuals were sourced from Tasmania and the other half from a captive breeding program in Mt Rothwell, Victoria. This initial reintroduction was successful despite several individuals climbing over the fox-proof fence and being promptly eaten by foxes. The remaining female quoll population all produced pouch young, resulting in as estimated 25 to 30 additions to the population. This marked the first breeding of the species in Canberra in an estimated 80 years. A second translocation was carried out in 2017 and had a higher rate of survival at 92%. These individuals settled immediately into their new territory. They benefited from other restoration processes taking place in the sanctuary, in particular the addition of wood debris which increased the invertebrate population, and by extension the quoll's food source. The presence of quolls from the previous translocation was considered a contributing factor in the lower number of attempted escapes, as the area was proven suitable habitat. Other species that have re-introduced or re-established within Mulligans Flat include the New Holland Mouse and the vulnerable Brown Tree-creeper. The New Holland mouse, like the eastern bettong, was locally extinct and has a captive bred population at ANU.

Venation is prominent, the net veins more obvious under the leaf. Flowers are creamy green, flowering in November to January in Australia. The fruit is a samara, often forming in threes. Ailanthus triphysa leaves with larva of Eligma narcissus moth. Young larvae skeletonise leaflets, while older larvae are defoliators. Stem: Bark greyish, lenticellate; blaze yellow with red speckles. Leaves: Leaf bearing twigs 1 cm or more in diameter. Stipules very small Leaflet blades falcate, about 5-12 x 0.9‚Äì2 cm, very unequal-sided particularly at the base. Lateral veins forming loops well inside the blade margin. Midrib raised in a depression on the upper surface of the leaflet blade. Numerous, closely spaced oil dots visible with a lens. Flowers: These are polygamous with greenish yellow in color . Inflorescence axillary, branched panicle, about 10‚Äì20 cm long. Sepals are about 0.5-0.8 mm long. Petals are about 3.5-4.5 x 2 mm in dimensions, Stamen are about 3‚Äì4 mm long in male flowers, and carpels are 2-4mm usually 3mm long. Ovules 1 per carpel Flowering season in India are from the month of December to May. Fruit: Fruits green to greenish brown, papery in texture. Samaras about 5-6 x 1‚Äì2 cm. Main vascular bundle to the seed connected to an intramarginal vein on the samara. Habitat On the island of Yamdena, eastern Indonesia, the tree occurs in Dense Dry Deciduous Forest, growing in the understorey, taller than 4m with a dbh less than 30cm. The canopy of these forests is dominated by Ebenaceae (particularly Diospyros) and Fabaceae. On Coronation Island, off the coast of the Kimberley, Western Australia, the tree grows in vine thickets (monsoon rainforest pockets). Because of the limited and isolated nature of the Western Australian populations, they have conservation significance.  Uses  The wood is yellowish and brittle, but as well as making excellent charcoal, the timber may be used for matchwood and plywood. When the bark is cut, a sticky resin is exuded, which becomes brittle on drying; this resin may be used for medicinal purposes, and particularly, because of its aromatic nature, it may be burned as incense, either directly, or as an ingredient in incense sticks. In India. the incense resin is named halmaddi, after the local name for the tree itself. Due to crude extraction methods which resulted in trees dying, by the 1990s the Forest Department in India had banned resin extraction; this forced up the price of halmaddi, so its usage in incense making declined. In Cambodia, the resin is also used as incense, whereas the bark is used in local folk medicine against dysentery and intestinal ≈ìdema. The wood contain various alkaloids and quassinoids, including beta-carboline, and has been used for the treatment of dyspepsia, bronchitis, ophthalmia and snake bite. Names As well as its botanical names, this tree has common, or vernacular, names. These include: halmaddi, but, in India; ho√´m th√¥m (Khmer, =\\"severe ≈ìdema\\"); thanh th√¢t (Vietnam); white bean, ferntop ash (Australia).

It was granted a licence in August 1995, and started service accepting subscribers on 23 October 1995. The company was a subsidiary of Telsim Group in Turkey, part of the Uzan Group. When Telsim was taken over by the Vodafone Group on 23 August 2006, it became a subsidiary of the global Vodafone Group. The company still operates under the brand KKTC Telsim in Northern Cyprus, although in Turkey Telsim has been rebranded Vodafone. This is due to Vodafone Group having a partnership agreement with the Cytamobile-Vodafone network in Southern Cyprus. The exclusive agreement on the use of the Vodafone brandname covers the entire territory claimed by Republic of Cyprus, thus including Northern Cyprus so the use of the Vodafone brand by a company other than Cytamobile is not allowed on the entire island of Cyprus.  Subscribers  KKTC Telsim has approx. 150,000 subscribers. KKTC Telsim competes with KKTC Turkcell, a subsidiary of the Turkcell network in Turkey. Although Turkcell arrived some 4 years later, it quickly overtook KKTC Telsim to take a larger market share. As of June 2008 Turkcell has approx. 200,000 subscribers in Northern Cyprus. KKTC Telsim suffers due to a poor brand image. During the first 4 years of operation Telsim abused its monopolistic position, building a poor reputation for the brand. Turkcell was able to capitalise on this, combining better customer service and marketing to quickly overtake them. Vodafone not rebranding KKTC Telsim has left it as a stale brand. It is widely believed that should Vodafone rebrand KKTC Telsim and make it part of the Vodafone Passport group of countries, it would quickly gain popularity among the many thousands of expatriate British residents and 100,000s of tourists that visit North Cyprus from UK every year.

Plot summary In Paris, France in 1482, a play written by Pierre Gringoire is being performed at the Palace of Justice. The audience however, is not very receptive, particularly Jehan, the brother of Notre Dame Cathedral's archdeacon, Claude Frollo. As a diversion, the people decide to elect a Pope of Fools. Quasimodo, the physically deformed bell ringer of Notre Dame, is chosen, despite Frollo's objections. Robin Poussepain calls the remaining attention to a gypsy girl named La Esmeralda, who is dancing in the square. As Gringoire follows Esmeralda, Quasimodo and Frollo attempt to kidnap the gypsy. They are stopped by Phoebus de Chateaupers, who arrests Quasimodo and enchants Esmeralda. Gringoire is captured by beggars and put on trial by their king, Clopin Trouillefou. His life is offered to be spared if someone will marry him, and Esmeralda ends up doing so, though only out of pity. The next day, Quasimodo is on trial for his crime of kidnapping. Jehan and Robin discuss the deaf auditor, Master Florain, and mock him. They are also on trial for causing a riot with their fellow students. Jehan, encouraged by Robin, takes the opportunity to be Quasimodo's lawyer, explaining how he, as the brother of the archdeacon, is given the benefit of the doubt. Quasimodo is sentenced to a flogging. Gringoire attempts to appeal to Florian, saying that Quasimodo's deafness renders the case unproven. He is instead sentenced to two hours in the pillory. While Quasimodo is being flogged, Frollo approaches the pillory, but leaves Quasimodo to suffer. Quasimodo begs for water, but is mocked by the people, until Esmeralda gives him some from her canteen. This causes Quasimodo to fall in love with her. In his cell, Frollo is practicing alchemy. Jehan enters, begging for money, and explains to his brother all about the \\"squalid melodrama\\" revolving around Esmeralda. He reveals how Phoebus and Esmeralda will be together that night. Frollo confronts Phoebus, who allows the mad priest to watch him and Esmeralda have their way with one another. Esmeralda attempts to convince Phoebus that she must remain chaste. While Phoebus is making his move, Frollo bursts out from his hiding place and stabs Phoebus. Esmeralda is convicted of the crime. Esmeralda is on trial for the murder of Phoebus. She denies all of the accusations brought forth by the witnesses and by Charmalou the prosecutor. Under torture, she confesses and is sentenced to die. Frollo visits her while she is imprisoned. He offers her safety in exchange for her becoming submissive to him. She rejects him. Esmeralda is being prepared for execution. Gringoire appeals to Frollo, begging that \\"She is innocent,\\" but Frollo ignores these claims. Esmeralda sees Phoebus with Fleur de Lys and rejoices. Esmeralda tells Frollo that she should be free, seeing as how she is condemned for a crime never committed. Charmalou callously says that \\"People have come to see a hanging, not to debate the ethics of our judicial system.\\" and brings Esmeralda to the scaffold. Quasimodo rushes from the cathedral doors. He ascends the scaffold and throws the executioner into the crowd. He carries Esmeralda into the safety of the cathedral, shouting \\"Sanctuary,\\" in the process. Esmeralda later wakes up and finds herself inside Notre Dame. Quasimodo brings her food (\\"Eat!\\" \\"Drink!\\") and finds Djali for her, lamenting how he wishes he were only a beast like her. While Quasimodo explains to Esmeralda that he will jump off the building when she wants him to, Esmeralda spots Phoebus in the square and asks Quasimodo to bring him to her. Quasimodo, although heartbroken, follows her command and leaves to find Phoebus. Quasimodo, on Esmeralda's orders, approaches Phoebus. Phoebus kicks Quasimodo to the ground. When he returns to Esmeralda empty-handed, she is enraged, continuously striking the hunchback, crying \\"I hate you!\\". Quasimodo merely thanks her and leaves. Quasimodo, sobbing, rings the bells of Notre Dame. Frollo ascends to the tower and attempts to rape Esmeralda. Quasimodo stops him, but upon recognizing Frollo, he begs to be killed. Frollo promises that \\"No one shall have her!\\" That night, Clopin leads the beggars from the court of miracles to Notre Dame. Not realising that they have come to rescue Esmeralda, Quasimodo throws timbers and stones, killing many vagabonds. Gringoire and Frollo bring Esmeralda out of Notre Dame. When the three of them reach the end of their destination, Gringoire leaves, pathetically apologizing for saving himself. Frollo gives Esmeralda to the hangman after being rejected for the final time, while the cavaliers arrive at Notre Dame, killing many vagabonds, including Jehan. Frollo walks up to the cathedral balcony. Quasimodo begs his master to save Esmeralda from execution. Frollo proclaims that Quasimodo is \\"Beyond salvation\\" and strikes him down. Esmeralda is hanged. Frollo smiles at this, resulting in Quasimodo tossing him off of the cathedral. While the bodies of the recent dead are removed, Phoebus, Fleur de Lys and the entire nobility dance, in honor of their recent marriage.

Taxonomy DTV closely resembles Powassan virus (to which it has 84% nucleotide sequence identity and 94% amino acid sequence identity). Due to their close similarities, DTV is also called Powassan virus lineage II. The DTV lineage is presumed to be maintained between Ixodes scapularis, or deer ticks, and the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus). Phylogram indicating the relationship of deer tick virus to other tick-borne encephalitis group viruses. TBE, tick-borne encephalitis; TSE, Turkish sheep encephalitis; GGE, Greek goat encephalitis; LI, louping ill virus; SSE, Spanish sheep encephalitis; KFD, Kyasanur Forest disease virus; TYU, Tyuleniy virus; SRE, Saumarez Reef virus. Values above branches indicate bootstrapped confidence values. Branch lengths are proportional to percent similarity in sequence. Epidemiology DTV has a strong prevalence in the northeastern and north central part of the United States, although little to no human infections have been reported. Only about 1 to 3% of I. scapularis ticks in the northern United States are possibly infected with DTV. This infers that the virus is not seriously pathogenic or it does not easily infect humans. Human incidence might be severely underestimated. History In 1997, it was isolated from I. scapularis ticks collected in Massachusetts and Connecticut. A fatal case of DTV encephalitis occurred at a New York hospital when a 62-year-old man with a meningoencephalitis syndrome, fever, weaknesses in the right arm and leg, and maculopapular rash succumbed to the virus. After an autopsy, his tissues were found to have DTV on a PCR assay. The patient had no history of travel in the days before his admission to the hospital, which implies that the virus might be active in the New York area. He spent times outdoors in woodland areas and had frequent contacts with horses. Lyme disease was commonly reported in the patient's area of residence, showing that tick activity was prevalent in the patient's area (at the time of admission). In 2017, another fatal case of DTV was documented when a 72-year-old woman was admitted to a hospital in Maine with a fever, low blood pressure, and urination problems. A month before her admission, an I. scapularis tick was removed from her left breast. Another embedded I. scapularis tick was removed from her left scapula only three weeks after the first tick had been removed. She later developed muscle aches, chills, and a rash that is often seen in the early stages of Lyme disease in the same area the tick was removed from. She developed several other concerning symptoms towards the end of her admission at the hospital, which ranged from joint pains to thrombocytopenia. She was given doses of doxycycline and antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem), which provided no relief to her illness. She later died and a limited autopsy was performed. A severe loss of anterior horn cells within the spinal cord and meningoencephalitis of the brain were discovered. A considerable loss of Purkinje cells was evident in the patient.

Translation The TRM Leipzig aims to accelerate the translation of laboratory research in therapeutics and diagnostics into the clinic. The centre introduces an organisational process to assure the effective implementation of therapy- oriented gateway research. The foundation of this concept consists of an award system in which three main gates are conceived. Passing the gates precedes the conceptual, preclinical, and clinical working phases each new diagnostic or therapeutic concept has to go through. This enables the TRM Leipzig to ensure an effective translation in conjunction with a comprehensive support and coordination of research projects. Research The acting director of TRM Leipzig is Professor Frank Emmrich. The scientific work of TRM Leipzig is guided by two boards. The Executive Board provides the strategic direction of research at the TRM. Expertise and scientific support is given by the Internal Advisory Board which includes experts of science, senior scientists, researchers and entrepreneurs. TRM Leipzig promotes application-oriented and interdisciplinary research projects in four areas: *Tissue Engineering und Materials Science (TEMAT) *Cell Therapies for Repair and Replacement (CELLT) *Regulatory Molecules and Delivery Systems (REMOD) *Imaging, Modelling and Monitoring of Regeneration (IMONIT) The research areas of the TRM Leipzig are supported by three core units: *Quality Management Core Unit (QMCU) *Translational Surgery Core Unit (TSCU) *Computational Microscopy Core Unit (CMCU) Awards The TRM Leipzig selects and funds investigator-initiated translational awards that supports young researchers pursuing their own therapy-oriented concepts and extending their innovation potential. Awards can be requested by individual researchers, scientific groups or tandem research teams consisting of clinicians and researchers. Applications for the awards can be submitted anytime.

This reaction was discovered by the German chemist Thomas Kauffmann and is related to the better known Tebbe olefination or Wittig reaction.  Formation of the reagent  The reagent was generated in situ by conversion of different halogenides of molybdenum or tungsten with methyllithium at low temperatures (‚àí78 ¬∞C). 600px During the warm-up process the formation of the active reagent occurs. NMR- experiments have shown that the active reagent is not a Schrock carbene (e.g. Tebbe-reagent).  Mechanism  Mechanism experiments shows that the olefination process is a sequence of cycloaddition and cycloelimination steps. 600px  Applications  For a long time this reaction had no applications in the synthetic organic chemistry. In 2002 it was used in a total synthesis of the terpene gleenol as a mild and non-basic reagent. A one-pot-protocol with an olefin metathesis step with Grubbs catalyst is also available.

Summary Claude Frollo is attempting alchemy, but cannot concentrate due to his thoughts of Esmeralda, the gypsy dancer. He informs Quasimodo, his hunchbacked and deaf servant, that he needs him to assist in kidnapping Esmeralda. In the Paris streets is the poet Gringoire, who also pines for Esmeralda, and laments his dilemma through poetry. Esmeralda herself passes by, and Quasimodo tries to kidnap her under Frollo's orders. Gringoire tries to save her, but is knocked to the ground instead. Esmeralda is successfully rescued by Captain Phoebus, who has the hunchback arrested, while Frollo escapes. Esmeralda takes a liking to Phoebus, and remarks on the beauty of his name when he leaves. Gringoire is chased by faux cripples into the Court of Miracles, the den of beggars and thieves. Clopin, the king of the Gypsies, decides to hang Gringoire. Gringoire, to avoid death, has to perform a test, which he quickly fails. He is then offered to women to avoid hanging. Esmeralda marries him, but only out of pity. The next day, the archbishop visits Frollo in his cell and informs him that Quasimodo has been arrested. Frollo refuses to testify at the trial, using the false excuse of not wanting to disgrace the church. At the Palis de Justice, the deaf judge assumes he is being mocked, as Quasimodo is unable to properly answer the judge's questions, and sentences him to a flogging. Quasimodo is whipped, and mocked by the people around him. He begs for water, and Esmeralda gives him some. She performs tricks with her goat Djali, but stops in order to pursue Phoebus. Later, at the inn, Esmeralda is reunited with Phoebus, but only a short while after this, he is stabbed by Frollo. Esmeralda is blamed and arrested. At her trial, she is accused of sorcery. Charmalou manages to have Djali perform a trick, which is used as damning evidence against her. She is sentenced to burn at the stake. Frollo offers her to come with him into the cathedral so he can have the responsibility of cleansing her soul. Esmeralda sees through this lie and says that she \\"would prefer to die\\" than be with him; plus, she sees an alive Phoebus who is passing near the crowd but does not react, therefore she is persuaded that Phoebus does not love her, and prefers to die. Before the execution can proceed, Quasimodo swoops down, snatches Esmeralda, and saves her, crying \\"sanctuary\\" over and over. Frollo curses both Esmeralda and \\"the deformed monster (he) adopted and raised all of these years\\". Quasimodo pours his heart out to Esmeralda, and she begins to pity him, apologizing for \\"judging (him) ugly because of (his) face\\". The next day, Frollo visits Esmeralda when she is alone. He offers himself to her once more, but Esmeralda rejects his advances. Frollo pulls out a dagger, with the intent of killing Esmeralda. Quasimodo stops him, and Frollo leaves, saying that if he can't have Esmeralda than no other man will. Enraged townspeople then attack the cathedral, wanting to hang Esmeralda, but Quasimodo defends her and the church. Frollo grabs Esmeralda, trying to push her off the roof: Quasimodo runs to her aid, and throws Frollo off the roof to his death. Down below, Phoebus makes his way through the crowd: the people are amazed to see that he is alive, he proves Esmeralda's innocence, saying that it was Frollo who had stabbed him and the gypsy \\"has commuted no sin in her entire life, except to be born beautiful\\". Esmeralda says that Quasimodo is \\"the most beautiful and innocent man who was ever born\\", so that a touched Quasimodo walks off to a gargoyle, looking into the sunset.

According to author Raymond Williams, it is reported that when Sadguru Gopal Anand Swami installed the idol of Hanuman, he touched it with a rod and the idol came alive and moved. This story has become a charter for the healing ritual performed at this temple. The idol of Hanuman here is a stout figure with a handlebar moustache, crushing a female demon under his foot and baring his teeth, standing among sculpted foliage full of fruit bearing monkey attendants. In 1899, Kothari Gordhandas of Vadtal appointed Shastri Yagnapurushdas to manage the affairs of the mandir; during his tenure, Shastri Yagnapurushdas renovated the site, built the adjacent bungalow, and acquired more land for the complex to bring it to its current state. Following The image of this temple is said to be so powerful that a mere look at it will drive the evil spirits out of the people affected by them. Saturday is the designated day for a special ritual (as Saturday is dedicated to Hanuman) for those affected by mental illnesses and other disorders. They are brought to the temple to be touched by the rod used by Sadguru Gopalanand Swami during the installation ceremony of the image. This rod has now been covered in silver. The temple administration has hired a brahmin householder to act as a priest at the temple and conduct this ritual. After this, the person affected is instructed to circumambulate the shrine and repeat this after doing darshan a number of times. Some people take a special vow to do this a certain number of times or to chant the Swaminarayan Mahamantra while doing this.

One hundred and fifteen were ordered in 1956, but cancelled in 1957. Design and development The Potez 75 was developed by the reformed Potez Company which had originally been formed by Henry Potez in 1919. The type was designed to meet the requirement for a launching platform for Nord SS.10 wire-guided anti-tank missiles. It was of all-metal construction, with a pusher engine. The twin fins and tailplane were carried on two booms extending from the lower rear fuselage and it was fitted with a fixed tricycle undercarriage. The missile operator sat in the nose, behind which was a small upper cabin accommodating the pilot. Initially the operator's cabin had windows and the pilot's position was open, but later modifications enclosed the latter and provided the operator with better visibility by full glazing. Operational history The aircraft first flew on 10 June 1953 with experimental registration F-ZWSA, but later as F-WGVK and finally as the military F-MAFY. It had four 7.5 mm guns in the lower nose and could carry eight under-wing rockets. It was tested by the French military and found unsatisfactory as a missile platform. It was modified to light ground attack configuration and tested in the Algerian War, excelling in this role and orders were placed for 15 pre-production and 100 production machines in 1956. This order was cancelled the following year as part of defence budget cuts. Exhibited at the May 1957 Paris Air Show, the prototype was subsequently used as a liaison aircraft and scrapped after crash landing on 16 September 1958.

The domesticated form of the plant is only cultivated in Ethiopia, where it provides the staple food for approximately 20 million people. The name Ensete ventricosum was first published in 1948 in the Kew Bulletin, 1947, p. 101\\\\. Its synonyms include Musa arnoldiana De Wild., Musa ventricosa Welw. and Musa ensete J.F.Gmel.Wikipedia DE In its wild form, it is native to the eastern edge of the Great African Plateau, extending northwards from South Africa through Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to Ethiopia, and west to the Congo, being found in high rainfall forests on mountains, and along forested ravines and streams.  Description  Like bananas, Ensete ventricosum is a large non-woody plant‚Äîa gigantic monocarpic evergreen perennial herb (not a tree)‚Äîup to tall. It has a stout pseudostem of tightly overlapping leaf bases, and large banana-like leaf blades of up to tall by wide, with a salmon-pink midrib. The flowers, which only occur once from the centre of the plant at the end of that plant's life, are in massive pendant thyrses covered by large pink bracts. Though the roots are an important foodstuff, the fruits are inedible (insipid, flavorless) and have hard, black, rounded seeds. After flowering, the plant dies. The Latin specific epithet ventricosum means ‚Äúwith a swelling on the side, like a belly‚Äù.  Use as a foodcrop  Kambaata woman extracting the edible part of an enset with a traditional tool (SNNPR, Ethiopia) Enset is a very important local food source especially in Ethiopia. The Food and Agriculture Organization reports that \\"enset provides more amount of foodstuff per unit area than most cereals. It is estimated that 40 to 60 enset plants occupying 250-375 sq. meters can provide enough food for a family of 5 to 6 people.\\"Country Information Brief, FAO June 1995. Enset (E. ventricosum) is Ethiopia's most important root crop, a traditional staple in the densely populated south and southwestern parts of Ethiopia.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 194. Pankhurst uses the taxononym Musa ensete. Its importance to the diet and economy of the Gurage and Sidama peoples was first recorded by Jer√≥nimo Lobo in the seventeenth century.Jer√≥nimo Lobo, The Itiner√°rio of Jer√≥nimo Lobo, translated by Donald M. Lockhart (London: Hakluyt Society, 1984), pp. 245f Each plant takes four to five years to mature, at which time a single root will yield about 40 kg of food. Because of the long period of time from planting to harvest, plantings need to be staggered over time, to ensure that there is enset available for harvest in every season. Enset will tolerate drought better than most cereal crops. Wild enset plants are produced from seeds, while most domesticated plants are propagated from suckers. Up to 400 suckers can be produced from just one mother plant. In 1994 3,000 km2 of enset were grown in Ethiopia, with a harvest estimated to be almost 10 tonnes per hectare. Enset is often intercropped with sorghum, although the practice amongst the Gedeo people is to intercrop it with coffee.Kippie Kanshie, T. \\"Five thousand years of sustainability? A case study on Gedeo land use\\" (PhD dissertation: May 2002), p. 38 The young and tender tissues in the centre or heart of the plant (the growing point) are cooked and eaten, being tasty and nutritious and very like the core of palms and cycads. In Ethiopia, more than 150 000 ha are cultivated for the starchy staple food prepared from the pulverised trunk and inflorescence stalk. Fermenting these pulverised parts results in a food called kocho. Bulla is made from the liquid squeezed out of the mixture and sometimes eaten as a porridge, while the remaining solids are suitable for consumption after a settling period of some days. Mixed kocho and bulla can be kneaded into dough, then flattened and baked over a fire. Kocho is in places regarded as a delicacy, suitable for serving at feasts and ceremonies such as weddings, when wheat flour is added. The fresh corm is cooked like potatoes before eating. Dry kocho and bulla are energy-rich and produce from 1400 to 2000kJ per 100 g. It is a major crop, although often supplemented with cereal crops.Kippie Kanshie, T. \\"Five thousand years\\", p. 19 However its value as a famine food has fallen for a number of reasons, as detailed in the April 2003 issue of the UN-OCHA Ethiopia unit's Focus on Ethiopia: > Apart from an enset plant disease epidemic in 1984‚Äì85 which wiped out large > parts of the plantations and created the green famine, in the past 10 years > major factors were recurrent drought and food shortage together with acute > land shortage that forced farmers more and more into consumption of immature > plants.

History  In 1769, the celebrated Scottish traveller James Bruce first sent a description and quite accurate drawings of a plant common in the marshes around Gondar in Abyssinia, confidently pronounced it to be \\"no species of Musa\\" and wrote that its local name was \\"ensete\\". In 1853 the British Consul at Mussowah sent some seeds to Kew Gardens, mentioning that their native name was ansett. Kew, quite understandably, did not make the connection, especially as they had never before seen such seeds. However, when the seeds had germinated and the plants had rapidly gained size, their relationship to the true banana became obvious. Bruce also discussed the plant's place in the mythology of Egypt and pointed out that some Egyptian statue carvings depict the goddess Isis sitting among the leaves of what was thought to be a banana plant, a plant native to Southeast Asia and not known in Ancient Egypt.Curtis's Botanical Magazine vol. 87 (1861)  Pests and diseases  A major issue with the cultivation of enset is its vulnerability to several pests and diseases. = Pests = The most common pest that threatens enset is caused by the Cataenococcus enset which is a root mealybug. The Cataenococcus enset feeds on the roots and corm of the enset plant which leads to slower growth and easier uprooting. Even though enset can be infested at all age stages, the highest risk is between the second or fourth growth year. The dispersion of the mealybug occurs through different vectors: First, the larvae can crawl short distances as adults mealybugs tend to move only after being disturbed. Second, mealybugs-ant symbiotic relationships can be linked to enset infestation and protect and even transport the mealybug over short distances. In return, they feed on the mealybug honeydew. Third, flooding events can transport the mealybug over longer distances and reach enset plants. However, the main transport vectors are unclean working tools and the usage of already infected suckers. This means that the best way to get rid of the bug and to limit its propagation is to uproot the plant and burn it. In addition, the fields can be kept free of plant growth for a month since the mealybug can only survive up to three weeks without plant material. Other pests include nematodes, spider mites, aphids, mole rats, porcupines and wild pigs. The latter erode the corm and pseudostem. As for the nematodes, there are two predominant species: there are the root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus goodeyi) and the root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne sp.) and their appearance stand in connection with bacterial wilt. Pratylenchus goodeyi create lesions on the corm and roots, which can lead to cavities up to and characteristic purple colouring around the cavities. The nematode infestation leads to the easy uprooting of the affected plants. Crop rotation can counteract high nematode infestations. = Diseases = Black Sigatoka leaf streak The enset plant can be subject to multiple diseases that threaten its use in agriculture. The most well known of them is the infection by the bacteria Xanthomonas campestris pathovar Musacerum which creates bacterial wilt, also known as borijje and wol‚Äôa by the Kore people. The first observation of this disease was reported by Yirgou and Bradbury in 1968. The manifestation of the bacterial wilt is taking place in the apical leaves that will wilt then dry and finally lead to the drying of the whole plant. The only way to avoid the spreading of the disease is in uprooting, burning and burying plants as well as in applying strict control of the knives and tools used to harvest and treat the plants. Other diseases have been observed such as Okka and Woqa which occur respectively in case of severe drought and in situations of too much water in the soil which causes the proliferation of bacteria. These problems can be solved by either watering the field when drought is present or by draining the soil to avoid too much water. Another disease can strike enset even though it has been more observed on Banana plants (Musacea). This disease is caused by Mycospharella spp. and is commonly called black Sigatoka leaf streaks. The symptoms are basically dark/brown lesions surrounded by yellow on the leaves.Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MoRA). (2009). Crop variety register issueNo. 12. pp. 157‚Äì159. This disease happens to be favoured by high rainfall and lower temperature.  Socio-cultural importance of enset in Ethiopia  Enset cultivation in Ethiopia is reported to be 10,000 years old, though there is little emprical evidence to support this.Brandt, S. A., Spring, A., Hiebsch, C., McCabe, J. T., Tabogie, E., Diro, M., ‚Ä¶ Tesfaye, S. (1997). The ‚ÄúTree Against Hunger,‚Äù 66. It has major economic, social, cultural and environmental functions related to trade, medicine, cultural identity, rituals or settlement patterns. Enset-planting complex is one of the four farming systems of Ethiopia together with pastoralism, shifting cultivation and the seed-farming complex. It is widely used by around 20 million people which represent 20-25% of the population. They mainly live in the densely populated highlands of south, southwest Ethiopia. The plant is very important for food security because it is quite resistant to droughts (growth only stops for a short time) and it can be harvested at any development stage. Nevertheless, in recent years, the population growth has put an important pressure on enset cultivation systems. This is mainly because of a decrease of fertilization through manure and an increase in demand, especially during droughts. At such times, enset becomes the only resource available. = The role of gender in enset cultivation = Gender roles in enset cultivation are of high importance, as a strong division of work exists: generally men are responsible for the propagation, cultivation, and transplanting of enset, while women are in charge of manuring, hand-weeding, thinning and landrace selection. Additionally, women process enset plants, which is a tedious work (transformation of the plant into useful material, principally food and fibres) for which they generally gather together. Men are banned from the field during this process. As women are responsible to provide sufficient food to their family, they are the ones who choose when and which plant to harvest and which quantity to sell. Different studies state the importance of women's knowledge on the different crop varieties. Women are more likely to precisely recognize the different varieties of the plant than men. Nevertheless, women's work is often neglected or considered of lesser importance than men's by researchers and farmers and women are less likely to get access to extension services and quality services than men. Another important aspect in which gender plays a role is in the classification of enset varieties. Indeed, they differentiate \\"male\\" varieties from \\"female\\" varieties, according to the preferences of men and women who harvest them. Whereas men prefer late maturing genotypes resistant to diseases, women prefer varieties that are good for cooking and can be harvested for consumption at an earlier stage. In general, households tend to have slightly more ‚Äúfemale‚Äù genotypes than \\"male\\" ones. = Enset biodiversity and socio-cultural and -economic groups = In Ethiopia, over 300 enset varieties have been recorded which is important for agro- and biodiversity. The farmers‚Äô main interest for maintaining biodiversity is the different beneficial characteristics of each varietiy. This means that Ethiopian farmers spread important characteristics over many enset varieties instead of combining a number of desired characteristics in one single genotype This is a significant difference between Ethiopian subsistence farmers‚Äô and plant breeders‚Äô approaches. More than 11 ethnic groups with different cultures, traditions and agricultural systems inhabit the enset-growing regions. This contributes to the high number of varieties. Over centuries, the different ethnic groups have applied their specific indigenous knowledge of farming systems in order to sustain production in various ways. A dying out of enset varieties would hence also make disappear a part of cultural practices and linguistic terms in Ethiopia (Negash et al., 2004). Enset biodiversity is preserved not only due to the presence of different ethnic groups but also due to different households‚Äô wealth status. Richer farmers can generally afford to maintain a higher level of farm biodiversity because they have more resources such as land, labour and livestock. Therefore, they can cultivate more varieties with differing specific characteristics. However, also poorer households try to maintain as many clones as possible by selecting the disease-resistant first.

As a player for Hampshire County Cricket Club (1968‚Äì1972) Holder was a brisk right arm medium pace bowler. In the 1970 season, Holder took 55 wickets at 23.27 runs. His best bowling figures were 6 for 49 and 7 for 79 against Gloucestershire in 1972. In 1972, Holder also took a hat-trick against Kent. His career average as a bowler saw him take 139 first-class wickets at 24.56. Holder stood as umpire in eleven Test matches and nineteen One Day Internationals. Holder became a first-class umpire in 1983 and was promoted to officiate his first test-match in 1988. Holder was appointed by the International Cricket Council as one of five worldwide regional umpires' performance managers and is responsible for monitoring and improving the performances of umpires in Europe, the Caribbean, America and Canada. He co- authored the book You Are The Umpire with the illustrator Paul Trevillion. The book was based on a comic strip that was included in the sports section of the British newspaper The Observer and bears similarities with You Are The Ref as both highlight unusual or difficult decisions that have to be made by sporting officials. Holder is credited, along with Don Oslear, with the idea of a 'bowl-out' to decide a drawn match after the Tilcon Trophy final had been washed out by rain. The organisers had ordered them to think of another way of settling the match rather than the traditional and sometimes unpopular means of the toss of a coin. This idea was subsequently adopted into all England and Wales Cricket Board competitions. In 2000, Holder was consultant on the film The Laws of Cricket, 2000 Code which was shot in Barbados. The film featured an interview with Holder and Sir Garfield Sobers, and was directed by award- winning British film director Marcus Dillistone.

The deity's cult is further exalted by the worship it receives from the Chowta royal family of Moodabidri. The Royal House of Chowta worships Jumadi at a shrine inside the Chowtara Aramane Palace. The deity's association with the ruling class among the Tulu people gives it the epithet \\"Rajan-Daiva\\" (Deity of the Rulers). The myths pertaining to Jumadi are oral in nature and are recorded in distinctive Tulu folk songs called paddanas. The paddanas record the various adventures and legends of the deity. They also record the various forms and names of the deity such as Kanteri Jumadi (Jumadi worshipped by the Bunt Feudal Lords, Kantanna Adhikari and Devu Poonja), Marlu Jumadi (the wild form of the princely Jumadi), and Sarala Jumadi (Jumadi worshipped by a thousand households).

Biography He was born in Castel Guelfo. His first teacher was his father, Lelio Andrea Basoli. His education was motivated by an insatiable and constant interest in classic art, classic and contemporary literature, and the works, decorations and inscriptions of Piranesi. He often worked alongside his brothers, Francesco and Luigi Basoli. In 1803 till his death he became docent of ornamentation and the next year, professor at the Accademia delle Arti di Bologna until 1826.http://www.artnet.com/artist/668132/antonio-basoli.html During his time at the Accademia he developed a close friendship with fellow pupils Domenico Corsini and Pelagio Palagi. He worked for a time in the studio of Petronio Fancelli. Works In 1801‚Äì1803, he painted frescoes at a few sites in the Friuli, including casa Muratori in Triesti and a palace in Spilimbergo.

Sadly most of his works survive only through references to them such as detailed production sketches, watercolors and engravings, among which the aquatints from Collezione di varie scene teatrali, started in 1821. In addition to his decorations at these theaters he also decorated the Palazzo Rosselli del Turco, Palazzo Sanguinetti and Palazzo Hercolani. Basoli was also offered commissions for scenography from theaters in Rome in 1815, and from Naples, by request of Gioacchino Rossini, in 1818 both of which he refused. However, in 1818 he did decide to take a trip to Milan, where he visited the sala Sanquirico the studio of the most important scenic designer of la Scala from which Basoli found inspiration for the set design for the opera Semiramide in 1820, the set for a production of Oedipus Rex at the Theater Contavalli in 1822, and lastly, the background paintings for the scenes at the Theater of Cavalieri dell‚ÄôUnione in Santarcangelo di Romagna in 1822. During this same period he produced, amongst others, important works at the villa Marescalchi, and the Palazzo Baciocchi. Among his exhibitions at the Academy of Bologna were a collections of Romantic canvases with exotic themes. For example, in 1842, he exhibited a series of 16 oil paintings pi√π affascinanti e immaginifici (very fascinating and imaginative), depicting: the four Colossi of Memnon in Egypt; the port of Rhodes (likely including the colossus); Nebuchadnezzar's Babylon (likely including hanging gardens), the famous Equestrian Statue of Domitian in Rome (destroyed in antiquity during his damnatio memorie). Paintings depicted four parts of the globe: Europe, Asia, Africa, and America; and five famous ancient temples: including Osiris and Isis in Egypt, Foo temple in China, Zeus in Olympia, Diana in Ephesus. They also depicted a city of Peg√π, now Burma, an Arab Tomb, the great hall of Charlemagne, and the magic palace of the sorceress Alcina. Typical of his designs, merging art and erudition, he later created 26 vignette compositions, depicting an archeologic alphabet in form of watercolors, called his Alfabeto pittorico.Memoria di Bologna short biography by Roberto Martorelli.

Featuring traditional Welsh music and song, with costumed performers and choreography, the programme went out on early Sunday evenings. The series, starring Welsh baritone Ivor Emmanuel and supporting cast, expressed a set of ‚Äòfeel-good‚Äô values that were wholesome, folksy, rustic, fun-loving and family-oriented. With a solid foundation of musical excellence and a respect for a Welsh musical tradition that held significance for an entire generation, the show caught a mood and struck a chord as it aimed to celebrate Wales within Wales and beyond. Broadcast in Welsh (but with bilingual captions on screen and bilingual voiced-over links), Land of Song was made in Cardiff by Television Wales and the West (TWW) and then distributed or ‚Äònetworked‚Äô to ITV stations serving many parts of the country, thus reaching a nationwide audience which, in the early 1960s, peaked at around ten million viewers.  ITV‚Äôs answer to the Mitchell Minstrels  Independent television had been on air in the UK for less than three years when the new TWW company won the franchise to broadcast to Wales and the West of England, beginning its transmissions on 14 January 1958. TWW formed a commitment to broadcasting some programmes in Welsh, and another of its main aims was to provide popular entertainment that could compete with anything produced by the BBC. Gwlad y Gan / Land of Song was conceived to meet both objectives. When Land of Song began in 1958, its only direct rival in providing musical variety on TV was the BBC's The Black and White Minstrel Show. The Mitchell Minstrels had gained instant popularity from their first appearance in a one-off special in 1957, going on to become perennial favourites well into the 1970s. But unlike the BBC programme, TWW's Land of Song ignored the Broadway‚ÄìWest End canon of ‚Äòsongs from the shows‚Äô and sought instead to specifically showcase the traditional music of its region of origin. It drew on folk tunes, traditional songs, ballads, and Welsh hymns, performed by a children's choir and an adult chorus, together with a select group of soloists. So well did this formula work that, by the early 1960s, many of them had become household names and faces.  The star  Welsh baritone Ivor Emmanuel (1927‚Äì2007) was \\"one of Britain's most popular singing stars of the 1950s and 1960s\\" and is widely remembered for his role leading the ‚ÄòMen of Harlech‚Äô battle hymn on the barricades in the 1964 film Zulu. Born in Margam but raised in Pontrhydyfen near Port Talbot, he began his singing career in the theatres of South Wales in the late 40s. In 1950 he won a part in the musical Oklahoma! in London's West End, and also joined the D‚ÄôOyly Carte Opera Company chorus, appearing in a number of Savoy productions. Through the 1950s he added to his success on the West End stage with appearances in South Pacific (1951‚Äì53) at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, The King and I and Plain and Fancy (1956), also at Drury Lane, and Damn Yankees (1957) at the Coliseum. He came to the attention of ITV producer Chris Mercer and musical director Norman Whitehead and, after a successful appearance in the Welsh language musical TV programme Dewch i Mewn, he was cast as the singing lead of Gwlad Y Gan / Land of Song.  The chorus  Producer Chris Mercer and Music Director Norman Whitehead (who had worked in London with bandleader Jack Hylton and was known as an excellent arranger of music) settled on the idea of using a local children's choir to accompany Ivor Emmanuel in a variety of musical settings. They turned for help to Clifford Bunford, a talented tenor in his own right and a founder member of the BBC Octet (also known as the BBC Welsh Singers). Then Music Master at Cathays High School in Cardiff, Bunford was well known for his energetic work with youth and adult choirs.Clifford Bunford is the founder and President of the Cardiff Bach Choir; see http://www.cardiffbachoir.org.uk/cliffordbunford.htm Through him, a dozen boys were selected from the Cathays school choir and the group was supplemented by schoolgirls chosen from elsewhere in Cardiff, including a handful of the best from the choir at Canton High School and a few from the Llandaff Cathedral Parish Choir. The young chorus became known as the ‚ÄòPontcanna Children‚Äôs Choir‚Äô, named after the TWW studios at Pontcanna in Cardiff where Land of Song was staged for broadcast. In addition, around five members of the BBC Octet (\\"BBC Welsh Singers\\") were drafted in to provide a disciplined musical core. Cliff Bunford, himself a talented tenor, was one of them, as was his fellow octet tenor Denis Griffiths. Along with them came baritone Bryn Williams and sopranos Esme Lewis and Ann Davies. This group was supplemented by additional altos, one of whom was Madelaine Rees, and some extra tenors, including Maldwyn Phillips. Whitehead added basses John Williams and a ‚Äòrough-looking‚Äô singer from the Rhondda called Harry Price whose big bass voice and ‚Äòworking class‚Äô looks made him ideal for drinking and tavern scenes and other light-hearted scenarios. Altogether, the adult chorus was sixteen strong, consisting of eight male and eight female voices. Bunford had the additional role of training the children's chorus and helping Norman Whitehead choose and arrange music from the range of Welsh songs, hymns and traditional tunes that were to provide the show's main content.  Supporting cast  For many of the set-piece scenes, Ivor Emmanuel was accompanied by a quartet of male singers drawn from the adult chorus. Most often these were tenor Denis Griffiths, baritone Bryn Williams, and basses John Williams and Harry Price. This line-up grew into a favourite grouping that producer Chris Mercer was happy to repeat over and over again. Regular solo spots were also given to Sian Hopkins, a member of the Canton contingent in the Children's Chorus. Aged about 13 or 14 in 1958, and with a clear sweet soprano voice, Hopkins quickly became a favourite young soloist on Land of Song. She was also paired in duets with Denis Griffiths, who was himself an occasional soloist. Other featured Welsh singers included the soprano Marion Davies.Marion Davies appears, singing an Osborne Roberts song of lost love, in the ten minutes of Land of Song footage that survives in the TWW archive now owned by HTV. Although the orchestral musicians, dancers and choreographers who worked on the show, were full-time professionals brought in from London, the singers were all local, Welsh, semi-professional performers, most having other regular jobs. The show was, therefore, a big commitment for them. There were weekly rehearsals in the weeks when there was no broadcast and then, in the week leading up to the monthly broadcast, rehearsals were held on several weekday evenings, again all day on the Saturday for the dress rehearsal, and then again all day on the Sunday, culminating in the live broadcast that same evening.  On air  Land of Song was broadcast monthly, initially for forty minutes, at 6.15pm on a Sunday evenings. Later it was extended to an hour. It opened with its signature tune, the traditional Welsh folk-melody Llwyn Onn (‚ÄòThe Ash Grove‚Äô).The surviving HTV archive footage, a single ten-minute opening sequence, preserves this. Each show had a loose theme: for example, the countryside or the seaside. A sequence of musical scenes then unfolded, requiring a whole range of costume changes. There were farmyard scenes, hunting scenes, seaside scenes, barber shop scenes, tavern scenes, scenes on board a ship and so on. The singers dressed up as fishermen, clowns, sailors, farm labourers or whatever was required. Many of the farming scenes featured live animals ‚Äì horses, sheep, cows, ducks, chickens, etc. Ivor Emmanuel led the big set-pieces, and in between were scenes for other soloists, duets or quintets. The music performed encompassed the full range of the rich musical tradition of Wales, from roistering choral numbers to gentle folk ballads, from humorous songs to stirring anthems. Each programme normally ended with a Welsh hymn tune.  Popularity  Viewers‚Äô reaction to Land of Song was enthusiastic from the very beginning. Its screening nationally, on every fourth Sunday throughout the year without a break, gave it a wide currency, and helped to build those audiences approaching ten million in its heyday. The measure of the popularity of Land of Song and that of its lead singer, was underlined in 1960 by Ivor Emmanuel's appearance, along with members of the children's chorus, on the 31st Royal Variety Performance at London's Victoria Palace Theatre, the first to be televised (by ATV), being broadcast live, nationally, at 8pm on Sunday 22 May 1960. The star-studded cast which entertained HM Queen Elizabeth II and HRH Prince Philip and television viewers around the UK and abroad included Max Bygraves, Alma Cogan, Nat King Cole, Russ Conway, Billy Cotton and his Band, Sammy Davis Jr., Lonnie Donegan, Diana Dors, Charlie Drake, Jimmy Edwards, Adam Faith, Bruce Forsyth, Benny Hill, Frankie Howerd, Hattie Jacques, Teddy Johnson & Pearl Carr, Liberace, Vera Lynn, Millicent Martin, Bob Monkhouse, Cliff Richard, Anne Shelton, the Tiller Girls, Norman Wisdom, Harry Worth, and band-leader Jack Hylton. In the midst of that galaxy ‚Äì something of a Who's Who of TV entertainment at the time ‚Äì Ivor Emmanuel sang with a \\"Welsh Children‚Äôs Choir\\". Also in 1960 the Land of Song cast was invited to make a record by pianist and record producer Isabella Wallich (1916‚Äì2001) who was then fast making a reputation for herself as an enthusiastic sponsor of Welsh music. The niece of recording pioneer Fred Gaisberg, then the force behind EMI and the Abbey Road studios, Wallich was Britain's first woman record producer, having launched her own independent record label, Delys√©, in July 1954. In her memoir, Recording My Life (2001), she writes of having become aware of the success of Land of Song and the show's star Ivor Emmanuel whom she recalls as \\"one of the most popular singers of the day\\". Wallich was particularly keen on the dimension provided by the children's choir, and she duly brought the Land of Song cast to London where recording sessions took place at the Conway Hall in Red Lion Square in Bloomsbury, a venue that Wallich and her recording engineer Allen Stagg had favoured for several earlier recordings. Spurred by the popularity of the TV show, the Land of Song EP (Delys√© EDP 209) sold well immediately on release. From the same recording session a second EP, also called Land of Song (Delys√© EDP 210 ‚Äì \\"volume two\\"), was issued in July 1960. The original sleeve note of EDP 209 read: \\"Each month, early on a Sunday evening, millions of independent television viewers switch on to enjoy ‚ÄòLAND OF SONG‚Äô, a Welsh programme of music and song. On this record are some of the most popular numbers specially selected and arranged from the many shows presented.\\" The numbers featured on the two EPs are as follows:- EDP.209: Yr Hogen Goch Trad ‚Äì Ivor & chorus; Clychau Aberdyfi (‚ÄòBells of Aberdovey‚Äô) Trad ‚Äì BBC Octet; Dafydd y Garreg Wen (‚ÄòDavid of the White Rock‚Äô) Trad. ‚Äì Ivor solo; Codiad yr Hedydd (‚ÄòThe Rising of the Lark‚Äô) Trad. ‚Äì Chorus; Three Welsh Nursery Rhymes (Dacw Mam Yn Dwad ‚Äì children's choir; Deryn y Bwn o‚Äôr Banna ‚Äì children's choir; and Ble‚Äôr ei Di? ‚Äì Sian Hopkins solo); Y Broga Bach (‚ÄòThe Little Frog‚Äô) Trad. ‚Äì Ivor & children's choir; Bws Bach i‚Äôr Dre (‚ÄòThe Song of the Bus‚Äô) Gerallt Richards ‚Äì Ivor & children's choir. EDP.210: Can y Melinydd (‚ÄòThe Miller‚Äôs Song‚Äô) Trad. ‚Äì Ivor & chorus; Dodd y Law (‚ÄòGive me your Hand‚Äô) Trad. ‚Äì Ivor solo; Hyfrydol Welsh hymn ‚Äì Children's choir; Aberystwyth Welsh Hymn ‚Äì Ivor & chorus; Dan yr Ymbarel (‚ÄòUnder the Umbrella‚Äô) Gerallt Richards ‚Äì Ivor & children's choir; Yr Ehedydd (‚ÄòThe Skylark‚Äô) W.

One of the Land of Song EPs entered the popular music charts ‚Äì then called the ‚ÄòHit Parade‚Äô ‚Äì reaching a high-water mark in 1961 at number thirteen in the EP chart.Chart information from British Chart Hits of the Sixties Aside from a single ten-minute sample opening sequence of VT footage that survives in the TWW archive,The short surviving footage of Land of Song, now in the HTV archive, opens with an outdoor scene shot on a real farm and moves into a studio farmyard where a number of Ivor and ensemble numbers are sung, before Marion Davies sings of lost love in a hay-loft. the Delys√© recordings represent the most significant remnant of Land of Song.  The end of Land of Song  And then, in 1960-1, Land of Song was beset by a row over pay. The local Welsh singers came to realize that their fees were very small compared to the fees being paid to the orchestral musicians and dancers brought in from London. TWW had not regarded the Welsh singers as full-time professional musicians and their rates were therefore much lower, despite the main burden of work falling so heavily upon them. The Musician's Union (MU) stepped in and, after negotiation, TWW agreed to offer the local singers professional rates. But this in turn put a heavier burden on the show's budget, and the producers seized the crisis as an opportunity to review and ‚Äòrefresh‚Äô the show. All the local Welsh singers were required to re-audition for their places in the show. Some were successful, others were not. The show's original star, Ivor Emmanuel, who had initially walked out in sympathy with his fellow Welsh singers, returned once the MU settlement had been reached. Emmanuel was no longer featured in every subsequent edition, however. He led the Welsh language editions, as before, but in between, for shows where there was now to be less emphasis on traditional Welsh material, other entertainers (e.g. Johnny Stewart, Johnny Tudor) were brought in to lead in his place. So the show continued, but something fundamental had changed. More ‚Äòsongs from the shows‚Äô were now introduced into the musical mix and more singers were brought in from the London stage to sing them. The essentially Welsh character became diluted as attempts were made to appeal more directly to the wider UK audience.Esme Lewis, one of the Land of Song singers, mentioned this new leaning towards \\"showbiz songs\\" in a BBC Wales TV broadcast in the series Pictures from the Attic in which she and Johnny Tudor looked back to Welsh TV entertainment of the early 1960s. By that time, she said, she herself had assumed a partial production role in helping to choose music and songs for the show. Other alterations were also made. Between 1958-62 the show was performed wholly live from the Pontcanna studios, but during the 1962-4 period some pre-recorded sequences began to be included. Sequences, for example, were recorded outdoors at a beach or at \\"Ivor‚Äôs farm\\", or at other rural and seaside locations near Cardiff. Perhaps in this way something of the spontaneity of the original was dissipated. After the \\"bust up\\" of 1962, Land of Song continued for another year or eighteen months and finally came to an end in 1964. Its impact was not forgotten however. On 3 March 1968, as the Wales and the West of England independent television franchise was about to pass, controversially, to Harlech Television (HTV), the final show broadcast by the outgoing TWW (All Good Things‚Ä¶ i.e. come to an end) featured Bernard Braden, Morecambe and Wise, Clifford Evans, Anita Harris, Manfred Mann, Gwyn Thomas, Stan Stennett, Wyn Calvin, Stanley Unwin, the Pendyrus Male Voice Choir and ‚Äì in homage to the nationwide success that Land of Song had brought to the company between 1958 and 1964 ‚Äì Ivor Emmanuel.BFI Film & TV database: http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/20810.

Korean Chinese are one of the recognized ethnic minorities in China, comprising about 2.7 million citizens. Korean Chinese are spread throughout the country, and their group situation is consequently invisible to other Chinese, though many have difficulties integrating into society. Televised folklore celebrations and popular Korean foods such as the world-famous kimchi serve as one of the few common reminders of Korean Chinese culture for other Chinese.

Engraving by an unknown artist in the Skilling-Magazin, 1 August 1891. Olaf Skavlan (25 January 1838 ‚Äì 30 May 1891) was a Norwegian literary historian and playwright. Personal life He was born as Ole Skavlan in Stranda as a son of vicar and politician Aage Schavland (1806‚Äì1876) and his wife Gerhardine Pauline Bergh (1817‚Äì1884). He was a brother of Sigvald Skavlan, Einar Skavlan, Sr., Aage Skavlan and Harald Skavlan. In August 1879 in Stavanger he married Dagmar Kielland (1855‚Äì1931). Through this marriage he was a son-in-law of Jens Zetlitz Kielland, a brother-in-law of Ludvig Daae, Elling Holst, Kitty Lange Kielland, Alexander Kielland, Jacob Kielland and Tycho Kielland. He was the father of Einar Skavlan, father-in-law of Arnstein Arneberg and grandfather of Merete Skavlan. Career He debuted as a fiction writer as a student. In 1871 he took the doctorate on the thesis Holberg som Komedieforfatter, about Ludvig Holberg as a comedy writer. In the periodical Nyt norsk Tidsskrift he published a study of Henrik Wergeland's work Skabelsen, Mennesket og Messias. This contributed to an understanding of Wergeland as a liberal political figure, not following the politically conservative tradition that branded Wergelenad as an apolitical wordsmith. Skavlan was appointed as a professor at the Royal Frederick University in 1877. He also co-founded and edited the satirical magazine Vikingen, and published the periodical Nyt tidsskrift, between 1882 and 1887 and together with Ernst Sars.

It is a terminal station serving domestic and international traffic on several rail lines, and is situated in a city centre and waterfront location on the south side of Lake Lucerne. History The first station was opened on edge of Lake Lucerne in 1856 at the end of the Schweizerische Centralbahn main line from Olten and Basel where it connected with the French and German railways. The route of the railway‚Äînow the course of Pilatusstrasse (Pilatus Street)‚Äîwas still undeveloped. The terminal station led directly to the pier for boat services on the lake and to the gates of the city of Lucerne. As a result, the area at the lake shore developed into an important railway junction. In the 19th century it rapidly developed into a hub with the introduction of steam navigation on the lake and the construction of several railway lines: the Gotthard railway, the line to Bern via Wolhusen, the line to Zug and Z√ºrich and the metre-gauge Br√ºnig railway. The first station was made of wood. A new station was opened in 1896 with a large new building with a distinctive cupola. It was turned at almost 90¬∞ to the original station with its end to the north towards the bridge to central Lucerne, requiring a significantly changed approach line. The new approach had no level crossings of streets unlike the original route, but instead ran on embankments or in cuttings. The Br√ºnig railway was also integrated into the new station. The tracks were electrified in 1922 along with the line from Olten. By 1910 the new station was nearing its capacity limits and an expansion plan was developed. However, the start of World War I prevented any work being carried out. On the morning of 5 February 1971 fire broke out in the staff quarters of station. The building burnt fiercely, and within an hour the cupola had collapsed, destroying the station frontage and concourse. The service was restored with temporary buildings, allowing operations to be recommenced. In 1980 a partnership of the Swiss Federal Railways, Swiss Post, the city and canton of Lucerne launched an architecture competition for a comprehensive redevelopment of the station. This also considered the future development of the rail approaches to Lucerne. However, a through station with a tunnel under Lake Lucerne was ruled out. A new station was eventually built, and opened on 5 February 1991, exactly 20 years after its predecessor was destroyed. The new station was planned by the architectural firm of Ammann and Baumann, and their then employee, Santiago Calatrava, designed the concourse of the new station. This is said to be the \\"heart of the new station, ... a multi-storey, generous sized public space that links the various functions of the city center with the railway\\". Its platforms are longer than those of the old station, and the underground shopping arcade is much larger. In late 2012, a new tunnel route was opened on the Br√ºnig line, between Kriens Mattenhof station and the approaches to Lucerne station. The tunnel replaces a less direct surface alignment, allowing the removal of several congested level crossings and the provision of double track, but terminal platforms used by Br√ºnig line trains remain unchanged. Operation The station is a terminal station serving domestic and international traffic on several rail lines. The lines from the east (Z√ºrich‚ÄìLucerne and the Gotthard lines) pass to the north of Lucerne and then join the lines from the north (Olten‚ÄìLucerne line) and the west (Bern‚ÄìWolhusen‚ÄìLucerne line) and pass to the west of Lucerne before turning to approach the station from the south. The metre-gauge Br√ºnig railway from the south and Interlaken also terminates at the station. Bahnhofplatz occupies the area between the front of the station and the lakefront, and is heavily used by the local buses. The landing stages used by the passenger ships of the Schifffahrtsgesellschaft des Vierwaldst√§ttersees (SGV) occupy the lakeside of Bahnhofplatz, providing interchange between rail and water transport. An underground shopping mall lies below both the concourse of the railway station and Bahnhofplatz.

Future proposals In 2009 a study was initiated into the building of a new underground through station next to the current terminus, and after studying some 30 variants, the chosen variant was announced in July 2013. This involves the construction of a new tunnel from Ebikon station, on the Z√ºrich to Lucerne line, under the end of Lake Lucerne to an interim underground terminal station immediately to the east of the existing station. A second phase will add a second, , tunnel to join the standard gauge approach to the existing station at Heimbach, thus converting the underground station into a through station. If executed, this will significantly increase capacity on the Z√ºrich to Lucerne line, by avoiding a single-track section of the existing line, and avoiding conflicts with the other standard gauge lines into the station. However, before the line can be built, the line must be funded. The first phase alone is estimated to cost CHF2.4 billion, and will be the subject of legislation and a national referendum, probably in 2014.

Burmese authorities asserted that Yettaw's visits were instigated by opposition groups as part of efforts to pressure and embarrass the Burmese government. The incident effectively meant that she was unable to participate in the 2010 elections. 2008 visit In May 2008, Yettaw and his teenage son took a lengthy trip to Asia. His son did not return home until school started again in September. Yettaw then travelled to Mae Sot, Thailand, where he took up residence in a hotel, bought a motorcycle and developed a friendship with a Thai resident. He developed a deep interest in Aung San Suu Kyi and told people that he had to bring international attention to her situation. He tried unsuccessfully to get work at Thai NGOs. In October, after having a vision that he was a defender of the oppressed, he left Mae Sot without paying any of his bills. On 27 October in Bangkok, Thailand, he obtained his Burma visa. On 7 November he flew to Yangon. On 30 November, he reached Aung San Suu Kyi's home by swimming across Lake Inya. He entered the property via a culvert on University Avenue Road and Inya Myaing Road. He then made his way over a small fence behind the house, which was a restricted zone and was without communication devices. Burmese authorities had forbidden Aung San Suu Kyi from having contact with outsiders. His trek was successful despite her residence being surrounded by over a dozen security guards 24 hours a day, and despite the presence of police boats that frequently patrolled local waters. Yettaw was prevented by the house staff from communicating with Aung San Suu Kyi, but he stayed there for a period of longer than two days. During this initial visit, Yettaw gave her at least six books, including The Book of Mormon, along with a letter written by Yettaw's daughter. This letter was later ripped up by Aung San Suu Kyi. She reported Yettaw's visit to her doctor who alerted authorities. Authorities took no action. He left the property via the same route he arrived. According to Yettaw, upon his departure from her house, police officers apprehended him, aimed guns at him, asked \\"What are you doing here?\\", but then let him go. Unable to fly out of Bangkok, Thailand due to political protests involving the seizure of Suvarnabhumi International Airport, Yettaw laid over at the Highland Hotel in Mae Sot, Thailand for over a month. There he spoke openly to several people about his failed attempt to see Aung San Suu Kyi and his plans to try again. During this time he frequently visited refugee schools and met the children. He was often seen with a Thai woman. He also visited the Mae Tao Clinic nearly a dozen times, where he communicated with Bo Kyi of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. As of May 2009, Yettaw was still paying off the travel cost of his 2008 visit. 2009 visit and arrest  In mid-April 2009, Yettaw travelled from Missouri to California to see an ex- wife. He informed her that he needed to go to Asia to obtain details on a paper he was writing about forgiveness. On 20 April, Yettaw flew to Bangkok, leaving his children with various friends. He told his family that he was working on a book and searching for US soldiers missing in action from the Vietnam War. According to Yettaw's wife, he wanted to interview Aung San Suu Kyi about forgiveness and resilience. Soon thereafter, Yettaw visited exiled Burmese groups in Thailand and told them about a faith-based book he was writing on heroism. Yettaw spent a week in Bangkok waiting for his Burma visa to clear. On the evening of 3 May 2009, Yettaw swam a distance across Lake Inya in Yangon to the house where Aung San Suu Kyi was held under house arrest by Burmese authorities. He planned his route across the lake using Google Earth. Some policemen saw him during his swim and threw rocks at him. Using the same route he used during the 2008 visit, via the culvert, and over a small fence, Yettaw successfully evaded the government security guards and entered her residence at 5 am on 4 May. He entered the house by climbing up a drain. Inside, he came upon two female assistants, Khin Khin Win and Win Ma Ma, a mother and daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi's sole sanctioned companions. He informed them that he was tired, hungry and suffered from diabetes. The women fed him. He asked Aung San Suu Kyi if he could stay at the house for a few days. She refused, and her caretakers threatened to turn him in to the authorities, but Aung San Suu Kyi agreed to let him stay on the ground floor after he began to complain about leg cramps. During his stay, they provided him with rehydration salts and meals. Some of his time there he devoted to prayer. The Burmese government requires all non-family overnight visitors to be registered and forbids overnight stays by foreigners. According to Aung San Suu Kyi and her assistants, he stayed there as an uninvited, unwelcomed guest. Yettaw's family later stated that he was \\"well-intentioned\\" and \\"unaware of the possible consequences.\\" Yettaw left the house just before midnight (11:45 pm) on 4 May, the same day he arrived, although some accounts allege he left on 5 May. He then swam towards the home of the US Counselor, which shares a fence with Kanthaya Hospital. According to Burmese officials, Yettaw left behind \\"two black chadors, two black scarves, two long skirts, one red torch light, six color pencils in a plastic bag, three pairs of sunglasses, two signal lights, a pair of swimming glasses, one two-pin plug, two pieces of circuit wire, one recharger, a black bag with a zip in it that was used to keep the apparatuses, a plastic bag with a zip in it, two pairs of gray stockings, five parts of an English book, and a bag with pieces of torn paper sheets in it.\\" At 5 AM on 5 May Yettaw was apprehended by police near the International Business Center on the lake's west bank, less than 100 feet from the US counselor's home. = Arrest and fallout = Originally scheduled to return to the United States 24 June, Yettaw was arrested 6 May and taken to Insein prison; on 14 May he was charged with illegally entering a restricted zone, illegal swimming and breaking immigration laws. Illegal entry carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison; immigration violations carry up to one year in jail. Yettaw shared his cell with two Burmese prisoners. He refused to eat food, hoping to induce another vision. Upon his arrest he was carrying two empty five-litre plastic bottles, two small bags, his US passport, a flashlight, a camera protected by plastic wrap, a pair of pliers, a screw driver, a pair of folding pliers with laser, six memory cards, a torch light with dry cells, 28 separate dry cells, a hat, a white shirt with long sleeves, a pair of trousers, seven paper sheets with written English words, two paper sheets with printed words, two envelopes, two $100 bills, two $10 bills, one $50 bill, ninety-three 1000-kyat notes, and 10 visiting cards. Pictures on his camera included photographs of Aung San, a fighting peacock and a bookshelf. As a result of the 2009 visit, the authorities declared that Aung San Suu Kyi breached the conditions of her house arrest. She was charged under the country's Law Safeguarding the State from the Dangers of Subversive Elements, which carried a three-to-five-year jail term. She and her two caretakers, Khin Khin Win and Win Ma Ma, were removed to the Insein prison, where they stayed for the duration of the trial. According to Police Brigadier General Myint Thein, prior to the Yettaw visit, authorities had considered letting Aung San Suu Kyi go free, but the incident \\"infringed on existing law and we unavoidably and regretfully had to take legal action against her.\\" Aung San Suu Kyi's followers insisted that the government used this incident to continue her detention until after the 2010 general elections. Other supporters have raised suspicions that the incident was constructed by the government. The Burmese government alleges that Yettaw's visit involved a conspiracy of \\"internal and external anti-government elements\\" meant \\"to intensify international pressure\\" to release her. Her lawyer Kyi Win said on 14 May: \\"Everyone is irritated with this American. All of these problems are his fault. He is a fool. Suu Kyi begged him to go back, but he said he was too tired. He slept overnight on the first floor.\\" However, two weeks later her defence lawyer Nyan Win stated that \\"Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said she bore no grudge against Mr. Yettaw or his family.\\" Authorities closely investigated security lapses involving Yettaw's visits. It was announced on 7 August that after questioning sixty-one security members of the police battalion in question, one police lieutenant colonel was demoted, an undisclosed number of personnel were given three- to six-month prison terms for dereliction of duty, and over twenty others received actions against them under a Police Disciplinary Rule. Tin Myo Win, Suu Kyi's physician, was under investigation as a conspirator but was released before the trial began.  Trial  The criminal case, #47/2009, levied against Yettaw, Aung San Suu Kyi, Khin Khin Win and Win Ma Ma, began 18 May 2009 in the Yangon North District Court. Suu Kyi and Yettaw each pleaded not guilty to their charges. On the first day a US consular officer was present to observe. Khin Maung Oo represented Yettaw. Yettaw faced charges relating to, according to the United States State Department, \\"immigration, trespassing into a restricted zone, and violating a law that protects the state from those desiring to cause subversive acts.\\" The first day's witnesses included the two police officers who apprehended Yettaw in Inya Lake after he swam away from Aung San Suu Kyi's house. The officers initially thought Yettaw was a thief. When they discovered he was a foreigner, they turned him over to the Special Branch, which usually handles political cases. On 20 May, police major Tin Zaw Htun was called by the prosecution to testify. He provided details of items Yettaw left at her home, including three pair of sunglasses and two abaya-like dresses. The dresses and sunglasses were modelled for the court by two women. The Burmese government alleged that Yettaw used these garments to disguise himself. When questioned about these and other items left behind, Aung San Suu Kyi explained that Yettaw had left them for her as presents. Police captain Sa Kyaw Win was also called by the prosecution. He testified that on 6 May he seized sixty-one items from Yettaw's room on the fifth floor of the Beauty Land Hotel in Yangon. Confiscated items included: a camcorder and charger, a pair of night glasses, a vocal translator, a mobile phone and charger, a battery charger, a USB memory stick, a pair of scissors, a map published by Myanmar Tourism Service, and money hidden in a phone book. On 21 May, prosecutors submitted for evidence a video Yettaw created with the intent of uploading it onto YouTube. The video began with a shot of a photograph of Aung San and then a shot of Yettaw beside the photograph. Yettaw's voice-over explained that he was at Suu Kyi's home, that he asked her if he could film her, but she declined. \\"She looked nervous,\\" Yettaw's narration explains, \\"and I am sorry for that.\\" On 26 May, Aung San Suu Kyi took the stand to defend herself. When asked about Yettaw's visit, she testified that she and her assistants urged him to leave, and let him rest there for the day, but that he left her home before midnight. In response to questions about items Yettaw left behind, she said \\"I don‚Äôt know if Mr. Yettaw had forgotten to take them or left them. Only Mr. Yettaw will know.\\" Later that day Burmese authorities officially lifted her house arrest, but continued to detain her in prison, although another government official stated that her house arrest did not expire for another six months. On 27 May, the court heard testimony from Yettaw and Suu Kyi's two caretakers, Khin Khin Win and Win Ma Ma. Her caretakers testified for 30 minutes each, and Yettaw testified for nearly three hours. He stated repeatedly that he was sent on this journey by God to protect Aung San Suu Kyi from a terrorist group trying to assassinate her. He stated that he was seen by policemen as he swam across the lake, and that they did not fire guns at him, but threw rocks instead. He also stated that he had tried to enter Suu Kyi's previously, that police apprehended him, questioned him briefly and then let him go. On the same day, Aung San Suu Kyi released a statement alleging that Burmese authorities were to blame for Yettaw's security breach. She had reported Yettaw's unwelcomed 2008 visit to authorities, but no action was ever taken. On 28 May, the defence's only witness, Kyi Win, took the stand. He stated that Yettaw entered Aung San Suu Kyi's restricted residence twice and each time security guards allowed it, and therefore they had also violated the law. Furthermore, because no action was taken by the security guards, then Yettaw, Aung San Suu Kyi and her assistants were not guilty of the charges. Through further questioning by Yettaw's lawyer, Khin Maung Oo, U Kyi Win added that the property Yettaw entered did not belong to Aung San Suu Kyi but instead belonged to the State because the government had official security guards around it. He also made the argument that the charges against her fall under parts of the law that were based on the now abolished 1974 constitution, and therefore are invalid. Yettaw then took the stand. Yettaw stated that, on his own accord, he entered the property on the morning of 4 May, that he left the property about midnight on 5 May. Under cross-examination, Yettaw stated that in November 2008 and May 2009 he applied for Visas to visit Yangon, during which time he signed an agreement that he would respect Burma's laws and visa rules. He acknowledged that he entered the property secretly and without permission, that he knew the property was guarded. He also stated that he did not mean to break any immigration laws. In the afternoon authorities brought Yettaw to University Avenue Road and had him explain how he crossed Inya Lake. Yettaw explained how he entered the lake through a small drain on University Avenue Road and Than Lwin Street. University Avenue Road was closed off for an hour and a half during his explanation. The court then announced that the original verdict date of 29 May was to be postponed, and that final arguments would be made 1 June. Of the eight days of proceedings, only two were open to journalists and diplomats. Also, Aung San Suu Kyi's lawyers were barred from discussions with her and authorities allowed none of them time to prepare her testimony. The trial judge originally accepted only one of the four witnesses offered by the defence, while accepting fourteen of the twenty-three government witnesses, but on 3 June Yangon's Divisional Court agreed to hear an appeal from the defence to re-admit three witnesses: Win Tin, Tin Oo and Khin Moe Moe, all members of the National League for Democracy. The appeal was set for 5 June, but not until 9 June did the Divisional Court agree to allow Khin Moe Moe's testimony. Her lawyers then sent an appeal to the High Court to allow the other two witnesses. The appeal was accepted by the Court and scheduled for 17 June. Closing arguments were rescheduled for 12 June, but her lawyers requested and had granted an adjournment until 26 June to allow Khin Moe Moe to testify at the trial. Khin Moe Moe needed time to travel from Shan State and to prepare. On 11 June 2009, Suu Kyi wrote a letter to the court explaining that after asking Yettaw to leave, she allowed him to stay overnight in order that he might avoid arrest and on the excuse of his health condition. On 24 June, the Burmese Supreme Court heard arguments from her lawyers for allowing two more defence witnesses to testify. Judges argued that, because Tin Oo was under house arrest and because Win Tin said things in interviews with the Democratic Voice of Burma that were critical of the Burmese government, they should not be allowed to testify. Five days later the Court officially rejected the two witnesses. On 26 June, the Court set Khin Moe Moe's appearance for 3 July. On the same day United Nations envoy Ibrahim Gambari arrived in Naypyidaw and met with foreign minister Nyan Win. He was not able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi, but did request that Burma free its political prisoners. The expressed purpose of Gambari's visit was to open the door for a visit by U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon. Ban arrived in Naypyitaw on 3 July, but after two days of talks with General Than Shwe, Ban was unable to negotiate a visit with Aung San Suu Kyi and left without any progress. On 3 July, the Court announced the adjournment was extended for another week. Defense witness Khin Moe Moe took the stand 10 July, testifying for six hours (from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm with an hour lunch at noon). Khin Moe Moe and the defence team argued that the law under which Aung San Suu Kyi was being tried, Section 22, which protects the government from people planning subversive acts, was created under the 1974 Constitution, which was abolished by the current Burmese government in 1988. He was the last witness of the trial. Final arguments were set by the Court for 24 July. On 24 July, her defence gave a 30-page closing statement. British, German, Norwegian, French and Italian diplomats were present, marking only the third time during the trial Burmese officials had allowed such access. The trial was then adjourned over the weekend until 27 July, providing the prosecution more time to prepare. On 27 July, the defence team submitted an application to the court to call an additional witness, Nyunt Maung Shein, a Burmese foreign ministry official. Final arguments were presented for Yettaw, Khin Khin Win and Win Ma Ma. The morning session was attended by diplomats from Australia, Japan, Singapore, the United States, the Philippines and Malaysia, while in the afternoon only US Consul Colin Furst was in attendance. The final defence arguments, including a 15-minute statement from Yettaw, concluded 28 July. Again, diplomats from the US, Japan, Singapore and Thailand were present. The Court announced the verdicts would be made 31 July. Officials then notified shops in the vicinity to be closed 31 July. Two police battalions also arrived to support the already existing security forces. However, on 31 July judges Thaung Nyunt and Nyi Nyi Soe, citing an undisclosed problem with the legal procedures, adjourned the trial until 11 August, three days after the anniversary of the 8888 Uprising. After the announcement, Yettaw moved about the courtroom and said \\"I love you\\" to the defence team. The verdict came on 11 August. Yettaw was condemned to a total of seven years: three for violating Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest, three hard labour for breaking immigration laws, and one hard labour for trespassing. Aung San Suu Kyi was initially sentenced to three years of hard labour, but after a five-minute recess, Than Shwe reduced it to eighteen months of house arrest. Khin Khin Win and Win Ma Ma were also sentenced to eighteen months. = Health issues during the trial= On 8 May, Yettaw began to decline food, claiming religious reasons, and accepted only water. On 9 July, he was removed to Insein Prison hospital because he was still refusing food. There authorities began feeding him intravenously. On 3 August, Yettaw was taken from Insein prison and admitted to Yangon General Hospital after having seizures. He was isolated in intensive care in a heavily guarded separate room and treated by neurological specialists. Previous to this incident, Yettaw had been held in the prison's hospital where he received regular treatment for his seizures and diabetic and heart conditions. Two days later, Yettaw was visited by US Embassy official Colin Furst. The same day, defence lawyer Nyan Win expressed concern that Yettaw's condition may further delay the trial because \\"The court normally doesn't make judgment in the absence of the accused.\\" Yettaw remained in intensive care throughout the week. On 7 August, he suffered three more fits, according to Police Brigadier General Khin Yi. Yettaw was discharged 10 August. Release from Burma On 12 August 2009, US Senator Jim Webb negotiated Yettaw's release on humanitarian grounds because of Yettaw's health. Burmese authorities commuted Yettaw's sentence in half, suspending the remaining three-and-a-half years upon Yettaw's deportation. On 14 August, Senator Webb flew with Yettaw to Thailand. Yettaw had to be helped off the plane. He gave reporters an \\"I love you\\" sign, but did not respond to any questions. He was immediately placed in an undisclosed Bangkok hospital. The next day he underwent medical examination. According to Senator Webb and Yettaw's family members, Yettaw was not in good health. On 19 August, Yettaw made a near 24-hour trip from Bangkok to the United States, landing first in Chicago and then flying on to Springfield, Missouri. While transferring planes in O'Hare International Airport, he was in a wheelchair and wore a surgical mask. He said to reporters there \\"If I had to do it again, I would do it a hundred times, a hundred times, to save her life\\", also adding \\"That they locked her up; it just breaks my heart.\\" He refused a later question by saying \\"I wish I could talk more. I can't.\\" He then made a zipper motion over his lips. Upon his arrival at Springfield-Branson National Airport, at the request of his family, Yettaw was escorted out the side of the airport to avoid the media.  Biography of Yettaw  Yettaw was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1955. Yettaw lived with relatives in California for a time until he was able to join the United States Army. He served for just over a year before being discharged, spending a majority of that time in Germany according to his military records. His family has said that Yettaw told them that he has served stints in the US military in several countries of Southeast Asia. Yettaw was diagnosed around 1999 with post-traumatic stress disorder related to his military service. At age 20, Yettaw married for the first time in southern California, later converting to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). In southern California, Yettaw had been licensed as a general contractor. As of 2009, Yettaw lived in Missouri, and was in custody of four minor-aged children from a subsequent marriage. Yettaw graduated from Drury University in 1997 cum laude, where he earned degrees in multiple majors. More recently, he was enrolled in a doctoral program at the Forest Institute's School of Professional Psychology (Springfield, Missouri campus), leaving the program in 2007.

Two were built but development ended in 1945. Design and development The Cornelius XFG-1, developed under the project designation MX-416 was an aerodynamically unusual aircraft intended for an unusual military role. George Cornelius had been experimenting with aircraft featuring differentially variable incidence since the 1920s. His first two machines were otherwise conventional but the third, the Cornelius Mallard from 1943 was not, being without a horizontal tailplane and having low aspect ratio and strongly forward swept wings. Though very different in detail, the XFG-1 built on the Mallard experience. A 1/4 scale model of the XFG-1 was built for wind tunnel tests. The FG in its designation stood for fuel glider and its role was as a fuel transport. It was to be towed behind another aircraft rather like contemporary troop carrying gliders, but its two fuselage tanks held of avgas. Unlike other troop carrying gliders, e.g. Waco CG-4, the XFG-1 could be towed by modern bombers or transports at a cruise speed of . Proposals seem to have included a piloted tow version behind a large transport, the glider landing loaded on skids having jettisoned its wheels after takeoff; or a pilot-less version towed behind a B-29 bomber, disconnected and abandoned after fuel transfer was completed; the intent of the scheme being for the glider to act, essentially, as a giant, winged drop tank for extending the range of the towing aircraft. The XFG-1 was a high-wing monoplane, its wing set far back towards its vertical stabilizer. The wing was quite high aspect ratio and of modest forward sweep. Though the earlier Cornelius aircraft had wings that had their incidence variable in the air, the incidence on the XFG-1 could only be adjusted on the ground, with two settings of 3Àö and 7Àö. There was no horizontal tail. It had a simple fixed tricycle undercarriage and a conventional single seat cockpit; two examples of the type were built. Operational history Two prototypes were built (44-28059 and 44-28060) and 32 flights were made between them in 1944‚Äì45, although the first was lost to a spin, killing the pilot. On many of the flights, but not the fatal one, the pilot was Alfred Reitherman. The fuel glider concept was abandoned at the end of World War II.

Biography  The son of Dr. Thomas Bond (1580‚Äì1662), by his marriage to Catherine, daughter of John Osbaldeston, Bond was born about 1620 at Peckham. The exact dates of his birth, death and marriage are unknown. On 9 October 1658, before the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Bond was created by King Charles II a Baronet in the Baronetage of England. He also became Comptroller of the household of Queen Henrietta Maria, the mother of Charles II, an appointment which it was suggested he had obtained by the payment of one thousand pistoles, a very large sum, to Henry Jermyn, a favourite of the Queen who had recently been created Earl of St Albans. After the Restoration, Bond had a house in Pall Mall, assessed for Hearth Tax in 1674 as having 20 hearths, and a country estate in Peckham and Camberwell. He also owned land in Yorkshire, at Kirkby Malham, Malham Dale, and Fountains Fell. He bought a large estate from his brother-in-law Sir Thomas Crymes (or Grimes), Baronet, and Westminster's Bond Street is named after one of his developments. He built a new manor house at Peckham, long since demolished and now the site of Peckham Hill Street. After his death, his estate was plundered by \\"a fanatic Whig mob.\\" Sir Thomas Bond was buried on 3 June 1685, in Saint Giles Church, Camberwell.  Marriage  Bond married a French woman, Marie de la Garde (died 1696), a daughter of Charles Peliot, Sieur de la Garde, of Paris, one of the maids of the Queen Mother's privy chamber. They had two sons, Henry (died childless 1721) and Thomas (died 1732), who respectively succeeded in the baronetcy, and a daughter, Mary Charlotte (c. 1656‚Äì1708), who married Sir William Gage, 2nd Baronet of Hengrave Hall in Suffolk.  Arms and motto  The arms of the Bond family (argent, on a chevron sable three bezants) and their crest (a winged demi-horse ensigned with six stars), with the motto Orbis non sufficit (\\"The world is not enough\\"), were emblazoned in a window of the church of St Giles, Camberwell, destroyed by a fire in the 19th century.  Mention in Pepys  Bond is mentioned in the diary of Samuel Pepys, in the entry for 26 December, Boxing Day, 1660, some months after the Restoration. :\\"In the morning to Alderman Backwell's for the candlesticks for Mr. Coventry, but they being not done I went away, and so by coach to Mr. Crew's, and there took some money of Mr. Moore's for my Lord, and so to my Lord's, where I found Sir Thomas Bond (whom I never saw before) with a message from the Queen about vessells for the carrying over of her goods ...\\"  Legacy  Bond Street, Westminster, is named after Bond. However, he may be best known today as the supposed ancestor of the fictional spy James Bond. His family motto Orbis non sufficit is shown as Bond's family motto in the film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and also became the title for the Bond film The World Is Not Enough. This motto was used previously by Philip II of Spain. A medal struck in 1583 bore the inscriptions PHILIPP II HISP ET NOVI ORBIS REX (\\"Philip II, King of Spain and the New World\\") and NON SUFFICIT ORBIS (\\"The world is not enough\\").Cremades, Checa.

The function depends on three parameters, the input x, the \\"left edge\\" and the \\"right edge\\", with the left edge being assumed smaller than the right edge. The function receives a real number x as an argument and returns 0 if x is less than or equal to the left edge, 1 if x is greater than or equal to the right edge, and smoothly interpolates, using a Hermite polynomial, between 0 and 1 otherwise. The gradient of the smoothstep function is zero at both edges. This is convenient for creating a sequence of transitions using smoothstep to interpolate each segment as an alternative to using more sophisticated or expensive interpolation techniques. In HLSL and GLSL, smoothstep implements the \\\\operatorname{S}_1(x), the cubic Hermite interpolation after clamping: : \\\\operatorname{smoothstep}(x) = S_1(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & x \\\\le 0  3x^2 - 2x^3 & 0 \\\\le x \\\\le 1  1 & 1 \\\\le x  \\\\end{cases} Assuming that the left edge is 0, the right edge is 1, with the transition between edges taking place where 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 1.

The population of the parish at the 2001 census was 215, Office For National Statistics Parish Headcounts Office For National Statistics (2004). Retrieved 28 March 2012. decreasing to 209 at the 2011 Census. History of DunstallPopulation= The population of Dunstall has fluctuated in the past, but not very dramatically. In 1801 it was reported that the population was 177, in 1817 it was 157, in 1821 it was 184 and in 1831 it was 204 showing that the population has always fluctuated in this once registered township. In 1870‚Äì72, John Marius Wilson described Dunstall as \\"a town-ship chapelry\\" with a population of just 240 residents living in 51 houses however while the population has decreased the number of houses has gradually increased with 1950 seeing more than 90 houses and the 2001 census reporting a population of 215.Dunstall Staffordshire A Vision Of Britain Through Time . Retrieved March 2012 Of the population of 215 reported in 2001, 37 are aged between 0 and 15, 19 are aged between 16 and 24, 51 are aged between 25 and 44 and the largest age group within the population of Dunstall is 45 to 64 with 71 people fitting between this age bracket and just 29 are aged 65 and over. Therefore, the dependant population is smaller than the economically active population, showing Dunstall does not have a large problem with an ageing population unlike the majority of other places within the United Kingdom.  Population change in Dunstall  alt= A Line graph to show how the population of Dunstall has changed between 1880 and 1960. This line graph shows the pattern in the population change of Dunstall dating from 1880 to 1960. The rate of change has fluctuated in Dunstall with the highest amount of change happening between 1900 and 1920, reflecting times of war with possibly people migrating to be in the army and possibly dying during the First World War. There were also high rates of emigration from the United Kingdom to places such as Canada shown in the Canadian census of 1901 where 12.7% of the population were foreign born migrants. The increase in the population is evident and is perhaps a direct result of the decline in infant mortality that was present in the United Kingdom in the late 19th century along with a decrease in fertility rates combined with a higher life expectancy contributing to the age structure of Dunstall as well as the whole of the United Kingdom. However, overall the population of Dunstall seems to be declining but not rapidly. =Employment and Revenue= alt= A Pie Chart to Show the Employment Structure for Males Living in Dunstall in 1881 alt= A Pie Chart to Show the Employment Structure for Females Living in Dunstall in 1881 Dunstall historically had a mainly charity based revenue, centred on the church: The common lands were controlled by church wardens in the 1860s who annually sold the grazing's produced and reinvested the money into various community projects, shown in 1907 where Dunstall's income was registered as charity based with allotments being granted to young apprentice's for ¬£5-¬£10, and these became so popular that rent on these allotments steadily rose from ¬£30 in 1907 to ¬£45 by 1970 to over ¬£350 in the 1990s. Historical records show that Dunstall was predominately an agricultural area with 32 males and 2 females being employed in agriculture, the largest number of people employed in any occupation in 1881. The pie charts show the employment structures of both male and female residents in 1881. It is reported that out of the occupations that are known for women, the largest sector was in domestic service or office, reflecting the role and place for women at the time. In the 2001 census, Dunstall was reported to have 111 economically active residents with 75 of those people being employed in services and 39 being employed in manufacturing and extractive industries. This therefore shows that people are now employed in more service based industries rather than the primary sector, reflecting the development of the United Kingdom and the move away from primary industries. =Boundary changes= The area known as Dunstall has been adjusted by the boundaries of the parish being changed in line with population fluctuations and therefore land allocations changing due to population demands. 4 changes are known to have taken place and been mapped in response to the changing population and land allocations.

The vessel previously operated for DFDS Seaways between Paldiski and Kapellsk√§r, as well as between Esbjerg and Harwich. Between 2015 and 2020, the vessel operated as Baie de Seine for Brittany Ferries on a variety of different routes between Portsmouth, France, and Spain. History Dana Sirena sailing into Harwich on 29 June 2010 Initially christened MS Golfo Dei Delfini, Baie de Seine was acquired by DFDS Seaways before entering service. She was rebuilt with extra passenger accommodations to be operated on the Harwich to Esbjerg route. The hull is constructed of steel with an aluminum alloy superstructure. As Sirena Seaways, the ship had space for 623 passengers and 423 cars. Her sister the is operated by DFDS subsidiary Lisco Lines. She was serviced and repainted in February 2013. During this time the ship was rebranded as Sirena Seaways. On 22 June 2013, the ship collided with the dock at Parkeston Quay, which resulted in puncture holes in the hull below the water line. Although passengers were stranded on board the ship for two hours, the leak was brought under control, and there were no serious injuries. The Harwich to Esbjerg route ceased on 29 September 2014 due to loss of passenger traffic. DFDS Seaways closed the route to cut operating costs in order to make the company more competitive. As a result, Sirena Seaways was deployed elsewhere on the DFDS Seaways network. Later, DFDS Seaways reported that Sirena Seaways was to be moved to other routes such as the Paldiski - Kapellsk√§r route between Estonia and Sweden. It began being used on this route on 6 October 2014. Sirena Seaways was laid-up in Gda≈Ñsk during the winter of 2014/15. She received new gas-filters to meet new European regulations covering sulphur emissions. After the fitting of new gas filters, Sirena Seaways briefly entered service between Klaipeda and Karlshamn.

During the charter to Brittany Ferries, Baie de Seine operated between Portsmouth and Le Havre, whilst also operating some services between Portsmouth and Spain (Bilbao and Santander). In 2017, Brittany Ferries announced that Baie de Seine would return to DFDS Seaways in 2020. Baie de Seine will be replaced by a newer vessel on order called Galicia (on order from China), with routes covered by another vessel called Connemara, whilst Brittany Ferries wait for to Galicia arrive. In March 2020, Baie de Seine left Brittany Ferries and returned to DFDS Seaways.

It was first described to science by William Stimson in 1857. The type specimen was collected on a sandy bottom, deep, near the mouth of San Francisco Bay. Description leftThe pink sea star has five thick arms and a large central disc. It is one of the largest sea stars in the world. While typically having a diameter of , monsters up to have been found. The largest animals may weigh . The upper, arboral, surface of this star is generally pink, sometimes with shadings of gray. The radius of the arms is 2.8 to 5.0 times the radius of the central disc. The central disc contains an obvious madreporite on its upper surface. This structure filters water used by the animal. The mouth of the animal is found on the underside of the central disc. There are short, spines on the upper surface of the star. While a row of spines generally runs along the top of each arm, they are otherwise scattered across the animal in no particular pattern singly or in clumps of two or three. Both the upper surface and lower surfaces contain tiny pincers, pedicellariae, which likely are used to get rid of encrusting organisms which would otherwise grow on the star. On the lower, or oral side of the star, deep grooves radiate from the mouth which contain four rows of tube feet. The star uses these to move around, and to capture its prey. The tube feet around the mouth are particularly long, at least equal to the radius of the central disc, to aid in digging prey from the sea bottom.  Distribution and habitat  This sea star occurs along the coast of North America from Sitka, Alaska to La Jolla, California. It is found in Puget Sound. The pink sea star is found in relatively shallow water from the lower intertidal zone to deep. The animal does not tolerate being out of water very well, so it is generally found on the beach only during very low tides. It prefers quiet waters such as bays and harbors rather than the open ocean coast. It lives on the sea bed, preferring sandy and muddy bottoms where its main prey is found. It can, however, sometimes be found on rocky bottoms or pilings. It avoids areas of low salinity. Reproduction and life cycle Pink sea stars are primarily gonochoric, which is to say that individuals are either male or female. Each arm contains two gonads. These stars lift their central discs off the bottom to spawn, releasing their microscopic gametes into the water. Their eggs are in diameter. It is thought that groups of stars use environmental signals to coordinate spawning to increase the chances of fertilization. Once fertilization has occurred, the zygote develops into a planktonic larva which feeds on small algae. The larva proceeds through several developmental phases. It becomes a gastrula in 2 to 3 days, a bipinnaria in 5 days, and finally a brachiolaria. Towards the end of the last stage the larva develops a large sack like structure, a primordium, and begins searching for a suitable surface on which to settle. After settling to the bottom, the larva developss into a juvenile sea star.  Feeding behavior  The pink sea star is a carnivore and scavenger. Its main prey is bivalves. It hunts, captures, and eats cockles, including Nuttall's cockle, butter clams, jackknife clams, horse clams, littleneck clams, and geoduck clams. How it locates buried clams in unknown, but once it finds a buried clam it will dig down to it by using its tube feet to push bits of sediment from near its mouth to the ends of its arms. Holes as deep as have been observed. It is a slow-motion hunter; it may take it several days to dig its prey from the sediment, latch on to it with its tube feet, and pull the valves open. At this point, the star everts its stomach through its mouth and forces it into the shell. The star can push its stomach as far as from its mouth. The pink sea star secretes digestive fluids and eats the bivalve inside its own shell. This star is opportunistic in its feeding and will eat other animals besides bivalves when available. It will eat sand dollars, snails, including Kellet's whelk, barnacles, polychaete worms, and small Dungeness crabs. It feeds on carrion, including dead fish and squid. It is competitive with sunflower stars and will fight with them over prey items.  Predators  Sea otters have been observed to rip off an arm of this sea star to eat the gonads inside. Gulls will attempt to consume a pink sea star exposed at low tide. They are also preyed upon by other sea stars, such as the morning sun star. Sheep crabs also eat these sea stars. It is likely that the largest animals escape predation simply because of their size.

Woolley was also an ethnographer and an ardent collector, and the Woolley Collections of photographs, diaries and other artefacts, bequeathed to the State Government of Sabah, formed the nucleus of Sabah Museum when it was founded in 1965.http://www.borneo-online.com.my/museum.htm Life Woolley was born in Tyn-y-Celyn near Ruthin in North Wales.Wrexham Advertiser, 30 December 1876, page 4, \\"Births\\" Woolley was the son of a clergyman, Rev. George Herbert Woolley the curate of St Matthew‚Äôs, Upper Clapton, Hackney in London, and his wife Sarah Woolley. He had seven sisters and three brothers, including the famous archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley and Rev. Geoffrey Harold Woolley, the first Territorial Army officer to be awarded the Victoria Cross. Woolley was educated at Merchant Taylors School and Queen‚Äôs College, Oxford, graduating in 1899.Biographical Appendix in Bornean Diaries 1938-1942: I. H. N. Evans,ed. A.V. M. Horton, Borneo Research Council Monograph Series No 6 In 1901 he joined the Land Office of the North Borneo Chartered Company at Labuan, and he served in this office in various locations in North Borneo for many years. As part of his duties as Land Commissioner, he had to travel extensively in North Borneo to carry out land surveys and to solve land disputes. During these travels he developed a keen interest in the native people and their customs, especially the Muruts of the Interior. Over his lifetime he amassed a sizeable collection of artefacts, including a comprehensive collection of native weapons including Malay krises (also spelled as kerises). Woolley bequeathed some of these weapons to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, England, some of which were later acquired by Sabah Museum. Woolley‚Äôs tenure as District Officer for Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu), Beaufort, and later on as Resident of the Interior Division deepened his knowledge of local customs and traditions. In the 1930s Woolley was employed by the North Borneo Government to investigate causes for indigenous depopulation, especially among Muruts and Kadazandusuns, to determine what could be done to reverse the trend. He retired in 1932, and briefly went back to England, but decided to return to North Borneo in 1934, and it was noted that he \\"constantly and readily\\" gave his services to work in the interests of the State. He was awarded the North Borneo General Service Medal in 1940. In the pre-war period of his retirement he wrote many articles on local traditional customs, or adat. These were particularly important as they were the first time these adats had been formalised in writing and thereafter served as standard references for the tribes. In 1941 he rejoined Government service as Acting Protector of Labour and Secretary for Chinese Affairs. From 1942 until September 1945 Woolley was interned, along with other Allied European civilians in the Japanese internment camp at Batu Lintang, in Kuching, Sarawak. Despite his age, Woolley received severe beatings and other harsh treatment, including 30 days in the guard room on a diet of rice and water. After the war, when the guards who had mis-treated him were on trial as war criminals, Woolley refused to give evidence against them, saying to do so would only perpetuate bitterness among men.Michael P. O'Connor, 1954, The More Fool I, 186 He lived in England briefly after the war, but returned again to North Borneo in March 1947. He died on 6 December 1947, and was buried at the old Anglican cemetery at Jesselton. Legacy Woolley‚Äôs collection formed the basis of the Sabah Museum when it was founded in the 1960s. Along with the native artefacts, it comprised his papers and a large photographic collection. Woolley bequeathed 2,843 photographs, filling 17 albums, that he took during his service in North Borneo. There are also 1,797 glass negatives that cover the period between 1909 and 1920. The subjects of the photographs include the different tribes of North Borneo, town scenes and some European officials. Woolley's diaries cover the period from his arrival in Sabah in 1901 to 1926. The Woolley Collections Room for materials on local history at the Sabah State Library in Kota Kinabalu was named in his honour. An exhibition of Woolley‚Äôs photographs was held at Sabah Museum from 2‚Äì27 February 2009. Among the items that had been bequeathed to the Sabah Museum were the diaries of G. C. Woolley. Together with reproductions of hitherto unpublished photos of his collection, the Museum started to publish an annotated version of his diaries, divided into four volumes. The first volume was published in 2015, second in 2016, while the third and fourth volume are scheduled for publication in July 2015. Publications * 1922 Introductory note to N. B.

Fragments of a mosaic floor have been found. The synagogue was apparently destroyed by the catastrophic 749 earthquake. In the Mamluk period, part of the standing ruin was roofed and used as a mosque. After a brief period, this use and the village itself were abandoned until 1967. =Description= The synagogue had two rows of four columns each. The building was two stories tall with rows of windows at the top of the walls. The roof was built of wooden beams covered with ceramic tiles. In the southern wall, which faces Jerusalem, two massive stone steps lead to a raised stone platform (bimah). It is thought that a wooden Torah ark would have stood here. Under the bimah there is a long, stone-paved space thought to have served as a geniza (storage space for sacred texts no longer in use). The walls were plastered and painted white, with the lower walls decorated with red geometric motifs.

History The tea room itself was founded by two young English ladies who arrived in Rome in 1893. They were Isabel Cargill, daughter of Captain Cargill, founder of the city of Dunedin in New Zealand and Anna Maria Babington, descendant of Antony Babington who was hanged in 1586 for conspiring against Elizabeth I. The two young women decided to invest their savings (100 pounds) by opening a tearoom and reading room in the capital for the Anglo-Saxon. The company at the time involved considerable risks, above all because in Italy it was not common to drink tea, which was sold only in pharmacies. The Babingtons tearoom was an immediate success both because Italy was the destination of the Grand Tour for the English and because it was part of a Rome that celebrated the Jubilee and the silver wedding of the royals Umberto and Margherita. Originally the tea room was on Via dei Due Macelli, a sideroad of the Piazza di Spagna, but the establishment's success encouraged the owners to relocate to the Piazza di Spagna 23. It is located on the ground floor of an 18th-century building from which one can see the Spanish Steps, the staircase of the Trinit√† dei Monti church. This building are the original stables of the 18th century palazzo designed by Francesco De Sanctis, architect of the Spanish Steps. The new Tea Room on the Piazza di Spagna were furnished elegantly and became, according to the English language Roman Herald a favoured meeting place ‚Äúwhere ladies or gentlemen, hard at work sightseeing could go to refresh themselves with a comforting cup of tea. During the first world Rome society plunged into depression but the Tea Room survived because Isabel's sister Annie who invested her life's savings to give the Tea Room a complete renovation. Anna Maria Babington moved to Switzerland hoping because of her failing health, but died of a sudden heart attack in 1929. Meanwhile, Isabels daughter Dorothy married Count Attilio Bedini Jacobini. Despite the anti-English policy of Mussolini, throughout the fascist period and even during the second world war, Babingtons remained always open, with its very clear English sign and the solid bronze characters on a Roman travertine plaque. During the 1950s and 1960s, with the success of Cinecitt√†, film stars and other celebrities frequented the Tea Rooms, some even as regulars. Richard Burton and Liz Taylor, Charlton Heston, Robert Taylor, Peter Ustinov, Audrey Hepburn and filmmaker Federico Fellini could be spotted at Babingtons.https://cosmopolis.ch/babingtons-tea-rooms-in-rome/ Babingtons serves Victoria Afternoon Tea still in uniform.

The play contains a number of contemporary cultural references including Terry Wogan as a prime time interviewer (Michael Parkinson in the 1980 original script); Russell Harty; Richard Clayderman; Margaret Thatcher's tax policy (1985 version only); The Jewel in the Crown (1985 version only); the 'video nasties' controversy.

It was considered a \\"Begegnungsschule\\" where the students graduate with the German Abitur and the Lebanese Baccalaureate. It was first located in Jal el Bahr near the Riviera Hotel. The Lebanese authorities granted licenses for elementary classes in 1955 and secondary classes in 1961. In 1964 the school was relocated to Doha until 1977. The Doha campus opened in 1966. Due to the Lebanese Civil War, classes were suspended in 1977. Over the period of three years, from 1977 till 1980, the school relocated three times, due to the Civil War in Lebanon. In 1977 the school moved to Besan√ßon, in 1978 to the ACS, and finally to Manara in the year 1980 where it remains till now. In 1980 classes resumed in a temporary location in Manara, Beirut. However the German teachers, making up 90% of the school's instructional staff, left after kidnappings of German citizens in the city occurred in 1985. In 1985 the German Abitur was no longer offered, and the Lebanese Brevet was the main degree that the students could acquire.The enrollment plummeted to 30 in 1989. War activity destroyed the school's Beirut campus that year. Damages also occurred at the Doha campus, which was renovated in 1995; at that time classes resumed at that campus.

He plays as a scrum-half and as a fly-half for Shining Arcs. Laidlaw holds the record for most caps as captain, 39, of the Scottish national team. He also represented the British and Irish Lions in 2017. Although Laidlaw is a scrum half, he is often used as the first-choice goal kicker by his teams. Laidlaw has scored over 700 points for Scotland in his career and is one of the highest points scorers in rugby union history. Personal life A nephew of Scotland scrum half Roy Laidlaw, he joined Edinburgh in the summer of 2006. His first-team opportunities were limited at first behind Scotland scrum half Mike Blair, but in 2010 he signed a new two-year contract. His earlier representative rugby included games for Borders under-16 and under-18 as well as Scotland under-18. After stints with the Scotland sevens and under-21 sides, he made his full Scotland debut against New Zealand at Murrayfield in November 2010. In January 2011, he was called up to Scotland's Six Nations squad and, although he did not get any game time, he was retained in Andy Robinson's 40-man squad ahead of the World Cup. He captained Scotland A to wins over the Ireland Wolfhounds and Italy A in early 2011, and then skippered Edinburgh in the Celtic League. Club career On 4 March 2014 it was announced that Laidlaw would depart Murrayfield at the end of the season and join English Premiership side Gloucester. After spending three seasons with English Premiership side Gloucester, Laidlaw would depart Kingsholm at the end of 2016‚Äì17 season and join French Top 14 side Clermont Auvergne on a three- year deal. He joined Japanese side Shining Arcs ahead of the 2020‚Äì21 Top League season. International careerScotland= He became a regular part of the Scotland team during the 2012 Six Nations, following Dan Parks' sudden retirement after the first round of the tournament. He took on the kicking duties, and in his first start against Wales he scored all of Scotland's 13 points, including a try. He remained at fly-half throughout the rest of 2012 at both international and club level, and captained Edinburgh to a semi-final appearance in that year's Heineken Cup. The 2013 Six Nations saw Ruaridh Jackson recalled to the national side, so Laidlaw was shifted back to scrum-half while still taking Scotland's kicks. He was second-leading scorer of the season with 61 points, behind Wales' Leigh Halfpenny. He was left out of the 2013 Lions squad, instead heading to the South African Quadrangular Tournament with Scotland. He kicked a last-minute conversion against Italy to salvage something from an underwhelming tournament, giving Scotland a 30‚Äì29 victory. He continued to captain Edinburgh throughout the 2013‚Äì14 season, missing out on a place in the Amlin Challenge Cup on points difference. Laidlaw was also named as the captain of Scotland internationally in 2013, and has since captained the country 39 times, the most of any Scottish player. Laidlaw missed the 2017 Six Nations Championship due to injury, with flanker John Barclay standing in as captain during Laidlaw's absence. Laidlaw returned to Scotland for the 2018 Six Nations Championship, retaining his place as a regular starter under new coach Gregor Townsend. With injury to John Barclay, Laidlaw was re-instated as the Scottish Captain during the 2018 end-of-year rugby union internationals. After 7 years playing for and captaining the national side Laidlaw retired from international rugby in December 2019. Laidlaw's 714 points in 76 test matches places him second on the Scotland all- time points list behind Chris Paterson. =British and Irish Lions= On 6 May 2017, Laidlaw was called up to 2017 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand as England international Ben Youngs withdrew from the tour party due to family reasons. =Barbarians= In 2018, Greig Laidlaw was capped with the Barbarians against England during the mid-year rugby tests. He scored a conversion and a try, helping his team beat England 45‚Äì63 at Twickenham. With this game he became (with his teammate Finn Russell) not only one of the few Scottish players to beat England at home in modern rugby, but also one of the even fewer Scotsmen to beat England twice the same year.

There is also a Hindu Pilgrimage centre here.  History  Centuries ago the tribals Boyas and Yelikas lived in the forest area around the hillock. They stood up and resented the repressive and automatic rule of the Nawabs. They retaliated against the Muslim soldiers and chased them. The Golconda Nawab rushed additional troops to crush the revolt. Boya tribals could not withstand the onslaught of the Muslim army and fled into the forest and prostrated near the hillock and prayed Almighty to save them. The spirit of the Goddess Shakti descended from the hillock, shielded the tribals and crushed the Nawab's army. Local people say that the Shakti has tied the heads of soldiers to banyan tree branches. In the event of victory Boyas built the Gangamma temple, which saved them against evil forces and became famous for centuries. Legend It is believed that the Goddess who gives her blessings to the devotees was discovered by the ancient local people here called as Boiya's and since then they are offering their devotion and prayers to the goddess. Temple The temple of Goddess Gangamma is one of the many ancient temples located on top of a mountain. The word \\"Baikonda\\" pronounced as \\"Baa-ee-kon-da\\" means mountain which has a well. The Goddess resides right besides this well and is believed to be very powerful. This goddess is known to destroy all evil and those who sincerely worship her are bound to succeed. Her temple is dedicated to the sister of Venkateswara. Devotees come here and make their wishes and once the wish comes true they come back to make an offering to the Goddess Gangamma which they would have agreed upon once their wish became true. The water from the well is believed to cure many skin ailments. Local people believe that the Pushkarini water is very powerful, and sprinkling it in the field will yield good crop. Devotees can test whether their wishes will be fulfilled by placing a flower on the head of the deity. Locals believe that if the flower falls on the right side it is positive and negative if it falls on the left. Devotees who come here should take the \\"theertha\\", the holy water in the well that is believed to cure and ward off evil. The offering for the Goddess is generally a hen or a sheep which will be sacrificed to the Goddess and the meat will be cooked at the same place and shall be eaten by all the family members who would have come along. Once a year the temple Navartri festival brings in lakhs of people from all over India, particularly the south. Management The Gangamma temple was taken over by Endowments Department of Andhra Pradesh in 1990. Since then an Executive officer is in charge of administration of the temple and efforts were made to develop the temple and facilities were created for devotees.

He was commonly regarded as the leader of one of the two court factions at the time ‚Äî the faction later known as the Niu Faction ‚Äî during the Niu-Li Factional Struggles.  Background  Assuming that Niu Sengru died in the Wuchen year of the Dazhong era (847-859) of Emperor XuƒÅnzong as asserted in the commemorative text written by Li Jue, Niu was born in 780, during the reign of Emperor Dezong. He was a descendant of the prominent Sui Dynasty official Niu Hong ().New Book of Tang, vol. 174. His grandfather Niu Shao () served as a consultant at the ministry of worship, while his father Niu Youwen () served as a county magistrate.New Book of Tang, vol. 75 His father died when he was young, and he tended a farm at Xiadu (‰∏ãÊùú, near the capital Chang'an) that his family had previously been bestowed to make a living. He was capable in writing, and eventually passed the imperial examinations in 805, in the same year as eventual colleague and ally Li Zongmin.Old Book of Tang, vol. 176.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  Niu Sengru eventually did serve as the magistrate of Yijue County (‰ºäÈóï, in modern Luoyang, Henan).Old Book of Tang, vol. 172. In 808, when Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong held a special imperial examination for the examinees to give honest criticism of government, the officials in charge of the examination, Wei Guanzhi and Yang Yuling (), selected three examinees who gave blunt criticism ‚Äî Niu, Huangfu Shi (), and Li Zongmin ‚Äî for top marks. However, the chancellor Li Jifu were stung by the criticism that they gave and viewed these as personal attacks against him. Li Jifu tearfully complained to Emperor Xianzong that the reviewers of the scores that Wei and Yang gave ‚Äî the imperial scholars Pei Ji and Wang Ya ‚Äî had conflicts of interest, as Huangfu was Wang's nephew. As a result of Li Jifu's accusations, Pei, Wang, Yang, and Wei were all demoted, with Wei initially demoted to be the prefect of Guo Prefecture (ÊûúÂ∑û, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan), and then further moved to be the prefect of Ba Prefecture (Â∑¥Â∑û, in modern Bazhong, Sichuan). Niu, Huangfu, and Li Zongmin were not exiled, but they were said in the Zizhi Tongjian to be effectively stalled in their careers, forcing them to find governmental positions themselves under regional governors.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. However, the other traditional accounts of Niu's own career did not indicate that he served under a regional governor at all; rather, he continued to serve as the magistrate of Yijue, and then the magistrate of Henan County (Ê≤≥Âçó, one of the two counties making up the eastern capital Luoyang). He later served as an imperial censor with the title Jiancha Yushi (), then Kaogong Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, Libu), as well as an imperial scholar at Jixian Hall ().  During Emperor Muzong's reign  After Emperor Xianzong died in 820 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong, Niu Sengru was promoted to Kubu Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of defense (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Bingbu), and was put in charge of drafting imperial edicts. Later that year, he was made deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). At that time, there was a backlog of criminal cases in the prefectures, causing many people to be unduly detained while waiting adjudication. Niu worked to unclog the backlog, and indicted many responsible officials, causing the popular sentiment to respect him. In 821, when Li Zhichen () the prefect of Su Prefecture (ÂÆøÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Anhui) was accused of corruption and sentenced to death, powerful eunuchs received Li Zhichen's bribes and spoke on his behalf. Emperor Muzong thus commented to Niu, \\"Li Zhichen is talented, and should be pitied.\\" Niu responded, in advocating for Li Zhichen's death:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242. Emperor Muzong agreed with Niu and accepted his suggestion. Emperor Muzong thereafter greatly respected Niu. Meanwhile, in 823, the former chancellor and major general Han Hong died, shortly after Han Hong's son Han Gongwu () had died. Han Hong had served as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) for a long time and amassed great wealth.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. After Han Hong had offered to stay at the capital Chang'an in 819,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. he, at Han Gongwu's suggestion, offered many bribes to other officials in Chang'an such that his deeds at Xuanwu would not be further looked into. After both Han Hong and Han Gongwu died, there was a dispute involving the property that Han Hong left his young grandson Han Shaozong (). Emperor Muzong, pitying Han Shaozong's situation, ordered that Han Hong's property registries be given to the emperor personally for him to review. While Emperor Muzong was reviewing Han Hong's records, he discovered the bribes that Han Hong had been giving other official, and he reached an entry indicating that a bribe had been offered to Niu but Niu rejected it. Emperor Muzong was very pleased and showed the entry to his attendants, stating, \\"I did not make a mistake judging him.\\" He therefore made Niu Zhongshu Shilang (), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), and chancellor de facto with the title Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). At that time, both Niu and Li Jifu's son Li Deyu were considered serious candidates for chancellorship, but while Niu was indeed made chancellor, Li Deyu was made the governor of Zhexi Circuit (ÊµôË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and stuck there for eight years without movement. Li Deyu therefore came to believe that the chancellor Li Fengji had endorsed Niu and squeezed him out of the picture. The rivalry between Niu and Li Deyu, already precipitated by Li Jifu's earlier taking offense at Niu's examination answers, therefore grew more bitter.  During Emperor Jingzong's reign  Emperor Muzong died in 824 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Jingzong. Upon enthronement, Emperor Jingzong conferred the honorary title of Yinqing Guanglu Daifu () on Niu Sengru, and also created him the Viscount of Qizhang. Late in the year, Emperor Jingzong upgraded his honorary title to Jinzi Guanglu Daifu and created him the Duke of Qizhang ‚Äî a title that his ancestor Niu Hong had carried. Emperor Jingzong also put him in charge of editing the imperial history. By 825, Niu had come to the conclusion that Emperor Jingzong was frivolous and not diligent, and that wicked people around Emperor Jingzong wielded actual power. He did not dare to speak on the issue in fear of bringing disaster on himself, so he repeatedly offered to resign and take a regional governor post. In spring 825, Emperor Jingzong converted Eyue Circuit (ÈÑÇÂ≤≥, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei) to Wuchang Circuit and made Niu the military governor (Jiedushi) of Wuchang, continuing to carry the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title. (When he went through Xiangyang, the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered at Xiangyang), Liu Gongchuo (), in order to show respect to the central government, as Niu was recently chancellor, paid respect to Niu, over his staff's objection, even though they had the same rank as military governor and Shannan East was considered a circuit with higher precedence than Wuchang.) Due to the humidity at Wuchang's capital city Jiangxia (), the city walls were often crumbling, and each year required repair with green soil. The labor levies of each year were heavy, and the bureaucrats took the opportunity to be corrupt as well. Once Niu arrived at Wuchang, he began a project to repair the walls with bricks instead, and it was said that after completion of the project, the Jiangxia walls no longer suffered from damage due to humidity. Because one of the prefectures of Wuchang, Mian Prefecture (Ê≤îÂ∑û, in modern Xiantao, Hubei), was just across the Yangtze River from Wuchang's capital prefecture E Prefecture (), Niu requested that Mian Prefecture be merged into E Prefecture, to reduce administrative burdens on the people.  During Emperor Wenzong's reign  In 830, by which time Emperor Jingzong's younger brother Emperor Wenzong was emperor, Li Zongmin was a chancellor. When, in spring 830, Niu Sengru went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Wenzong, Li Zongmin argued to Emperor Wenzong that Niu was capable and should be kept at the central government. Emperor Wenzong thus again made Niu a chancellor with the title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi, as well as the minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 244. It was said that, with Niu and Li Zongmin in power, they spent much effort in expelling Li Deyu's partisans out of the central government. In 831, Li Zaiyi the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) ‚Äî who had ruled Lulong largely independently from the imperial government but which had been respectful to the imperial government and following many of its orders, including in a recent campaign against the warlord Li Tongjie ‚Äî was overthrown and expelled from Lulong by his officer Yang Zhicheng. When Emperor Wenzong contemplated how to react to the situation, Niu pointed out that Lulong had not actually belonged to the imperial government for decades and that a campaign against Yang would be futile. Under his suggestion, Yang was allowed to keep the command of Lulong, while Emperor Wenzong, due to Li Zaiyi's previous accomplishments, made him the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). (Niu's advocacy for taking no actions against Yang drew a sharply-worded criticism from the Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian.) Also in 831, Niu's chancellor colleague Song Shenxi was accused of plotting to overthrow Emperor Wenzong and to replace him with his brother Li Cou the Prince of Zhang. (The accusations against Song had come about because Emperor Wenzong and Song were planning to massacre the powerful eunuchs, and the eunuchs reacted by manufacturing evidence of Song's alleged treason.) Emperor Wenzong initially believed the accusations and was set to execute Song, but Niu, along with a large number of other officials, spoke on the implausibility that Song, already a chancellor, would plot treason. Instead, Li Cou was demoted in his rank, and Song was exiled, but both were spared. Late in 831, Li Deyu, then the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), reported that Xidamou (), the Tufan officer in charge of Wei Prefecture (Á∂≠Â∑û, in modern Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan), surrendered Wei Prefecture, which Tufan had captured from Tang decades earlier, to him. Li Deyu advocated accepting the surrender and using Wei Prefecture as a launch pad for a major campaign against Tufan. Niu opposed, arguing that this was a violation of the peace treaty between Tang and Tufan and that, should a war start, Tufan forces could reach Chang'an easily. Emperor Wenzong accepted his argument and ordered that Li Deyu return Wei Prefecture, as well as Xidamou and his soldiers, to Tufan. Tufan had Xidamou and his soldiers massacred. The massacre brought much popular sentiment against Niu, and was commonly viewed at the time to be the result of the conflict between Niu/Li Zongmin and Li Deyu. With Emperor Wenzong regretting the decision, Niu repeatedly offered to resign ‚Äî particularly given that Emperor Wenzong was repeatedly inquisitive of the chancellors as to when true peace would come to the realm, and Niu seeing true peace as impossible to achieve within a short time and viewing Emperor Wenzong as overly eager. Around the new year 833, Emperor Wenzong made Niu the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), having him keep the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title. In 837, Niu was given the honorary acting Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) title and made the defender of Luoyang as well as the head of the Luoyang branch office of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). It was said that Niu did not care about the relative lack of power he had, and spent his days entertaining guests and collecting rare woods and rocks. In 838, Emperor Wenzong summoned him back to Chang'an to serve as Zuo Pushe (), one of the heads of the executive bureau. At that time, Emperor Wenzong's son and crown prince Li Yong had recently died after having been severely rebuked by Emperor Wenzong (and the suspicions were that Li Yong was actually killed either on Emperor Wenzong's own orders or with his acquiescence)Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 59 [838]. and, when Niu met Emperor Wenzong, he spoke about the proper ways of father-son relationships, causing Emperor Wenzong to weep. Subsequently, Niu claimed a foot illness and did not meet Emperor Wenzong at the palace again, and Emperor Wenzong excused Niu from his presence. In 839, Emperor Wenzong made Niu the military governor of Shannan East Circuit and the prefect of its capital prefecture Xiang Prefecture (), and having him keep the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi and Sikong titles as honorary titles. He also awarded Niu many rare ancient vessels and informed Niu that he did not need to rush to report to Shannan East Circuit. Niu, pointing out that Shannan East had just suffered major natural disasters and needed to be tended to immediately, left for Shannan East immediately despite Emperor Wenzong's words.  During Emperor Wuzong's reign  In 840, Emperor Wenzong died and was succeeded by his younger brother Emperor Wuzong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 246. Emperor Wuzong conferred the honorary title of acting Situ (Âè∏Âæí, also one of the Three Excellencies) on Niu Sengru. However, soon after Emperor Wuzong's enthronement, Li Deyu became chancellor and the leading figure in the imperial government. In 841, when a major flood on the Han River destroyed the civilians' houses at Xiang Prefecture, Li Deyu blamed Niu, removed him from his command, and had him made senior advisor to the Crown Prince.As there was no crown prince at the time, the post was entirely honorary. In 842, Niu was again made the defender of Luoyang. In 843, Li Deyu had the matter of Xidamou's surrender reexamined and submitted an accusation against Niu and Li Zongmin. Emperor Wuzong posthumously honored Xidamou, but did not take further actions against Niu or Li Zongmin at that time.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 247. (This was commonly viewed as part of a plan for Li Deyu to take vengeance against Niu and Li Zongmin, abandoned only after Li Deyu found a more powerful way to attack them directly).See, e.g., Zhu Gui's commentary, collected in Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 59 [843]. Later in 843, Liu Congjian the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi). Emperor Wuzong, under Li Deyu's advice, refused to allow Liu Congjian's designated heir, Liu Congjian's nephew Liu Zhen (whom Liu Congjian had adopted as a son), to inherit the circuit and further ordered a general campaign against Liu Zhen. After the imperial forces destroyed Liu Zhen in 844, Li Deyu accused Niu and Li Zongmin, then the prefect of Hu Prefecture (ÊπñÂ∑û, in modern Huzhou, Zhejiang), of having been complicit in Liu Congjian's ruling Zhaoyi effectively independently while they served as chancellors. He also had Liu Zhen's mansion thoroughly searched for any evidence of communications that Niu and Li Zongmin had with Liu Congjian or Liu Zhen, and, after finding none, induced Liu Congjian's secretary Zheng Qing () to report that Liu Congjian had received many letters from Niu and Li Zongmin but had burned them all. The imperial censors Li Hui () and Zheng Ya () concurred in the report. Further, L√º Shu () the deputy mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region), submitted a report that stated that Niu sighed when the news of Liu Zhen's defeat arrived. Emperor Wuzong, in anger, immediately stripped Niu of his responsibility as defender of Luoyang and demoted him to be an advisor of the Crown Prince and moved Li Zongmin farther from Chang'an, to Zhang Prefecture (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian). Soon thereafter, Emperor Wuzong further demoted Niu to be the prefect of Ting Prefecture (Ê±ÄÂ∑û, in modern Longyan, Fujian) and Li Zongmin to be the secretary general of Zhang Prefecture. Shortly thereafter, Niu was further demoted to be the secretary general of Xun Prefecture (Âæ™Â∑û, in modern Huizhou, Guangdong), and Li Zongmin was stripped of all titles and exiled to Feng Prefecture (Â∞ÅÂ∑û, in modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248.  During Emperor XuƒÅnzong's reign  In 846, Emperor Wuzong died and was succeeded by his uncle Emperor XuƒÅnzong. Emperor XuƒÅanzong, who had disliked Li Deyu's hold on power, deposed Li Deyu from his post as chancellor, and shortly after began moving the five former chancellors that Emperor Wuzong had exiled ‚Äî Niu Sengru, Li Zongmin, Cui Gong, Yang Sifu, and Li Jue ‚Äî closer to the capital, and Niu was moved to be the military advisor to the prefect of Heng Prefecture (Hengyang, Hunan). He was later moved to Ru Prefecture (Ê±ùÂ∑û, in modern Pingdingshan, Henan), before being recalled to Chang'an to again be advisor to the Crown Prince. He died in 849 and was given posthumous honors.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 172. * New Book of Tang, vol. 174. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 237, 242, 243, 244, 246, 248.

From the square, the Oudekerksbrug bridge crosses the Oudezijds Voorburgwal canal and continues eastwards, through the Oudekennissteeg and Molensteeg alleys, towards the Oudezijds Achterburgwal and Zeedijk. Originally the Oudekerksplein was a graveyard. In 1655, the graveyard was cleared and moved to a new location beyond the city limits, creating the present square. The Oudekerksplein lies at the heart of the red-light district of De Wallen. Along the square are some 35 windows from behind which prostitutes offer their services. As part of the so-called Project 1012 (first presented in 2007), the Amsterdam city government is trying to reduce the number of prostitutes on Oudekerksplein. The city wants to remove all brothels from the square and replace them with restaurants, shops, artists' workshops, and such. As part of the plans, the cannabis coffee shop on Oudekerksplein would also be closed.\\"Moddergevecht om ramen Oudekerksplein\\", Het Parool, March 18, 2009 (Dutch)\\"Quality for the heart of Amsterdam\\", I Amsterdam, January 1, 2008 \\"Als het maar niet oubollig wordt\\", Trouw, April 30, 2009 (Dutch) In March 2019, it was announced that the city is to ban guided tours of the red-light district from January 2020. There are reported to be over 1,000 such tours passing through Oudekerksplein each week. A statue titled \\"Belle\\", honouring the prostitutes of the world, was placed on the square in 2007. The plaque on this statue reads (in English): \\"Respect sex workers all over the world\\". The street also has a bronze relief of a hand caressing a female breast. The sculpture was set in the cobblestone in February 1993 by an anonymous artist. The 1968 Dutch documentary film Rondom het Oudekerksplein (\\"Around the Oudekerksplein\\") gave an impression of what life in the red-light district was like in the 1960s.

Director Vladimir Peri≈°iƒá tells the story of a soldier faced with mission of executing prisoners in an unspecified place and time. It is Peri≈°iƒá's first feature film. The film has won several awards from various film festivals. Plot The film follows a hot summer day in the life of Dzoni (Relja Popoviƒá), a twenty-year-old recruit, who is sent to an abandoned farm on an unknown mission. The soldiers wait to battle unnamed terrorists, but instead, a bus full of prisoners arrives at the barracks. The commander orders the soldiers to execute the prisoners. At first, Dzoni is shocked by the cruel killings, but as more prisoners arrive, he begins to enjoy the executions. Cast *Relja Popoviƒá as Dzoni *Boris Isakoviƒá as Kouki *Miroslav Stevanoviƒá as Ivan *Miroslav Isakoviƒá as Micha Release The film was released on 26 August 2009 in France. =Film Festivals= The film was featured in the 2009 Sarajevo Film Festival where it won the Heart of Sarajevo Award for Best Film. Relja Popoviƒá won the Best Actor award. The film also won the Cineuropa Prize for Best European film in the Miami International Film Festival in 2010. The film received a special mention in the 2010 Trieste Film Festival. The film was shown in the 2009 International Critics' Week in Cannes, France. Themes The film deals with the banality of violence. The soldiers are ordered to kill the prisoners, but they are never given a reason. They become used to the killings, losing their morality and conscience. The juxtaposition of the idyllic countryside setting and the senseless murders give the movie a sense of absurdity. The jury from the 2009 Sarajevo Film Festival emphasized \\"the universal pattern of abuse of male youth through the military structure\\". Development The director lived in Belgrade during the Yugoslav Wars, where \\"the violence was omnipresent in our lives but indirectly\\". The film, however, does not directly state the setting, leaving the audience to decide where the film takes place. Peri≈°iƒá stated that the film portrays how brutal acts, like those in the Yugoslav Wars, were not committed by \\"monsters\\" but rather \\"ordinary men\\". The director describes the film as \\"some kind of laboratory experiment\\". The film did not hire professional actors, and the script was written as the filming occurred. Filming took place in order, which is unusual for most movies. Reception Critics praise the film for its minimalism, contrasting it with the film's brutal themes. The film has been compared to Albert Camus existentialist novels.

Written by Jacques Akchoti and Marina de Van, the film is about a wife and mother of two children who suddenly notices changes to the way the family home is arranged and feels that her body is transforming without anyone around her noticing it. While others believe her perceptions are due to fatigue and stress, she is sure that something more profound is happening, and her search to understand these mysterious perceptions prompts her to track down a woman in Italy who holds the key to the mystery. Plot Jeanne, a married woman with two young children, starts to notice small changes taking place in the arrangement of objects in her family's home‚Äîfurniture, pictures, rooms‚Äîas well as in her physical appearance. She seems to be the only one noticing these changes, but still she is absolutely certain that her perceptions are a result of something profound, and are not caused by stress or fatigue, as everyone else seems to think. Feeling increasingly out of sorts, ever more distant, and even psychologically cut off from her husband and children, who are baffled by her behavior, Jeanne goes to her mother in the hope that she, at least, will provide for her some clarification or otherwise soothing solution. At her mother's home, Jeanne comes across a photograph of what she believes, or has been led to believe, is herself as a young girl, her mother, and another woman. What she sees in that photograph moves her to travel to Italy in order to track down the woman in the photograph. In Italy, Jeanne finds the woman, and in a way, discovers herself as well. She begins to solve the mystery behind her changes, and comes to learn the truth about herself.

After the Italian invasion of Libya, in 1911, Sharif had believed that the Italians were invincible, and this led to a long-term disagreement with his old friend Omar Mukhtar. His role in the next twenty years was to be a mediator between the resistance leaders and the Italian government in Libya. Sharif El Gariani was demeaned in the film Lion of the Desert. Sharif was portrayed as a traitor offering his services to the occupying Italians, and who was ready to give any information that would lead to Mukhtar's capture.

Little is known about ancient relations between China and the African continent, though there is some evidence of early trade connections. Highlights of medieval contacts were the 14th-century journey of Ibn Battuta, the Moroccan scholar and traveller, to parts of China; the 14th-century visit of Sa'id of Mogadishu, the Somali scholar and explorer, to China;Between the Middle Ages and modernity: individual and community in the early By Charles H. Parker, Jerry H. Bentley pg 160 and the 15th-century Ming dynasty voyages of Chinese admiral Zheng He and his fleet, which rounded the coast of Somalia, passing the Ajuran Sultanate, and followed the coast down to the Mozambique Channel. Modern political and economic relations commenced in the era of Mao Zedong, following the victory of the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War. Starting in the 21st century, the modern state of the People's Republic of China has built increasingly strong economic ties with Africa. There are an estimated one million Chinese citizens residing in Africa. Additionally, it has been estimated that 200,000 Africans are working in China. As of , Eswatini and the self-declared Republic of Somaliland (recognised as part of Somalia) are the two African states to have relations with the Republic of China. https://www.voanews.com/africa/taiwan-china-diplomatic-competition-comes- somaliland?amp Trade between China (PRC) and Africa increased by 700% during the 1990s,China's trade safari in Africa - Le Monde Diplomatique, May 2005 and China is currently Africa's largest trading partner. The Forum on China‚ÄìAfrica Cooperation (FOCAC) was established in October 2000 as an official forum to greatly strengthen the relationship. A few Western countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, have become concerned over the significant political, economic and military roles China is playing in the African continent. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasises China's developmental engagements with Africa while also stating that China and Africa are making \\"joint efforts to maintain the lawful rights of developing countries and push forward the creation of a new, fair and just political and economic order in the world\\".\\"China-Africa Relations\\", Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, 25 April 2002  Historical relations  A giraffe brought from Somalia in the twelfth year of Yongle (AD 1415). China and Africa have a history of trade relations, sometimes through third parties, dating back as far as 202 BC and AD 220.Snow 1988, p 2 Ptolemy, writing in Roman Egypt in the 2nd century, knew of China by two separate routes: the silk road and the Indian Ocean trade. He thus identified two Chinese peoples: the Seres or silk people and the Sinai of the southern trade, whose name probably derives from the Qin dynasty.J. Lennart Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds.), Ptolemy's Geography: An Annotated Translation of the Theoretical Chapters (Princeton University Press, 2000), p. 176. The first mention of Africa in Chinese sources was in the Yu-yang-tsa-tsu by Tuan Ch'eng-shih (died 863), a compendium of general knowledge where he wrote about the land of Po-pa-li (Berbera). In 1071, an embassy arrived from an unidentified East African kingdom. Since it was a formal tribute mission (in the eyes of the Chinese), it is described in the official History of the Song Dynasty. The name of the kingdom was Ts'eng t'an and it was said to lie inland and mint its own coin. This name is probably derived from the Pesian Zangistan, and the title of its ruler, a-mei-lo a-mei-lan is probably derived from the Persian amir-i-amiran (emir of emirs).Paul Wheatley (1964), \\"The land of Zanj: Exegetical Notes on Chinese Knowledge of East Africa prior to A. D. 1500\\", in R. W. Steel and R. M. Prothero (eds.), Geographers and the Tropics: Liverpool Essays (London: Longmans, Green and Co.), pp. 139‚Äì188, at 156‚Äì157. Archaeological excavations at Mogadishu in Ajuran Empire and Kilwa, Tanzania have recovered many coins from China. The majority of the Chinese coins date to the Song Dynasty, although the Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty are also represented, according to Richard Pankhurst., p. 268 In 1226 Chao Jukua, commissioner of foreign trade at Quanzhou in the Fujian province of China, completed his Chu-fan-chih (Description of Barbarous Peoples) which discusses Zanzibar (Ts'ong-pa) and Somalia (Pi-P'a-Lo).Freeman-Grenville 1975 In addition, giraffes, zebras and incense were exported to the Ming Empire of China, making Somali merchants leaders in the commerce between Asia and Africa.East Africa and its Invaders pg.37 and influencing the Chinese language on Somali in the process. In the 14th century, Moroccan traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta made a long journey to Africa and Asia. He reached China in April 1345 after a stay in India before serving as an envoy of Sultan Muhammad Tughlaq of the Indian Tughlaq dynasty to China. He wrote: > China is the safest, best regulated of countries for a traveler. A man may > go by himself on a nine-month journey, carrying with him a large sum of > money, without any fear. Silk is used for clothing even by poor monks and > beggars. Its porcelains are the finest of all makes of pottery and its hens > are bigger than geese in our country. The Ming Dynasty voyages of Chinese admiral Zheng He and his fleet, which rounded the coast of Somalia and followed the coast down to the Mozambique Channel. The goal of those expeditions was to spread Chinese culture and signal Chinese strength. Zheng brought gifts and granted titles from the Ming emperor to the local rulers, with the aim of establishing a large number of tributary states. In October 1415, Chinese explorer and admiral Zheng He reached the eastern coast of Africa and sent the first of two giraffes as gifts to the Chinese Yongle Emperor.Snow 1998, p. 23 There are some other accounts that mention Chinese ships sinking near Lamu Island in Kenya in 1415. Survivors are said to have settled in the island and married local women. Archaeologists have found Chinese porcelains made during the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) in Kenyan villages; however, these were believed to have been brought over by Zheng He during his 15th century ocean voyages. On Lamu Island off the Kenyan coast, local oral tradition maintains that 20 shipwrecked Chinese sailors, possibly part of Zheng's fleet, washed up on shore there hundreds of years ago. Given permission to settle by local tribes after having killed a dangerous python, they converted to Islam and married local women. Now, they are believed to have just six descendants left there; in 2002, DNA tests conducted on one of the women confirmed that she was of Chinese descent. Her daughter, Mwamaka Sharifu, later received a PRC government scholarship to study traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in China.Brautigam, Deborah (2009). \\"The Dragon's Gift: The Real Story of China in Africa\\". Oxford University Press. p. 28. . National Geographic also published an article by Frank Viviano in July 2005, he visited Pate Island during the time he stayed on Lamu, ceramic fragments had been found around Lamu which the administrative officer of the local Swahili history museum claimed were of Chinese origin, specifically from Zheng He's voyage to east Africa. The eyes of the Pate people resembled Chinese and Famao and Wei were some of the names among them which were speculated to be of Chinese origin. Their ancestors were said to be from indigenous women who intermarried with Chinese Ming sailors when they were shipwrecked. Two places on Pate were called \\"Old Shanga\\", and \\"New Shanga\\", which the Chinese sailors had named. A local guide who claimed descent from the Chinese showed Frank a graveyard made out of coral on the island, indicating that they were the graves of the Chinese sailors, which the author described as \\"virtually identical\\", to Chinese Ming dynasty tombs, complete with \\"half-moon domes\\" and \\"terraced entries\\". According to Melanie Yap and Daniel Leong Man in their book \\"Colour, Confusions and Concessions: the History of Chinese in South Africa\\", Chu Ssu-pen, a Chinese mapmaker, in 1320 had southern Africa drawn on one of his maps. Ceramics found in Zimbabwe and South Africa dated back to Song dynasty China. Some tribes to Cape Town's north claimed descent from Chinese sailors during the 13th century, their physical appearance is similar to Chinese with paler skin and a Mandarin sounding tonal language. Their name for themselves is \\"abandoned people\\", Awatwa in their language.  Contemporary relations  In the 1960s, the People's Republic of China established diplomatic relationships with a host of African countries in quick succession. Pictured is Premier Zhou Enlai meeting with Emperor Haile Selassie on a visit to Ethiopia in 1964. The establishment of modern Sino-African relations began in the late 1950s, when China signed bilateral trade agreements with Algeria, Egypt, Guinea, Somalia, Morocco and Sudan. Zhou Enlai made a ten-country tour to Africa between December 1963 and January 1964. Zhou Enlai visited Ghana and established close relations with Kwame Nkrumah, who desired a united Africa. Relations at that time were often reflective of China's foreign policy in general: China \\"began to cultivate ties and offer ... economic, technical and military support to African countries and liberation movements in an effort to encourage wars of national liberation and revolution as part of an international united front against both superpowers\\".Muekalia 2004, p.6 China had also supported Africa during its struggle against European colonialism. = Diplomacy = FOCAC China's permanent seat in the UN in Africa and the diplomatic game of \\"two Chinas\\" in Africa Early modern bilateral relations were mainly affected by the Cold War and the communist ideology. China originally had close ties with the anti- apartheid and liberation movement, African National Congress (ANC), in South Africa, but as China's relations with the Soviet Union worsened and the ANC moved closer to the Soviet Union, China shifted away from the ANC towards the Pan-Africanist Congress.Taylor 2000, p. 93 The Soviet supported Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union, and supplied them with arms; Robert Mugabe's attempts to gain Soviet support for his Zimbabwe African National Union were rebuffed, leading him to enter into relations with China.Blair, David (2002).

Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. . p. 20. China adopted several principles, among them supporting the independence of African countries while investing in infrastructure projects. In 1970s the expulsion of the Soviet military advisers from Egypt and Sudan was welcomed and arms supplies by China.Sudan, Civil War, and Terrorism, 1956-99. By Edgar O'Ballance. New York: St Martin's Press, and London: Macmillan Press, 2000. p.111 China and Zaire (and Safari Club) shared a common goal in Africa, namely doing everything in their power to halt Soviet gains in the area. Accordingly, both Zaire and China covertly funneled aid to the FNLA (and later, UNITA) in order to prevent the MPLA, who were supported and augmented by Cuban, from coming to power.The Oxford Handbook of the Cold War. Front Cover. Richard H. Immerman, Petra Goedde. Oxford University Press, 2013 p.276 China and Safari Club sent assistance to support the Mobutu regime during the Shaba I conflict, 1977.A Little Help from His Friends Time, 25 April 1977, Vol. 109 Issue 17, p.57 The Somali Democratic Republic established good relations with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War era. When Somalia sought to create a Greater Somalia, it declared war on Ethiopia and took the Ogaden region in three months with the help of Soviet aid, but when the Soviet Union shifted its support from Somalia to Ethiopia the latter retook the Ogaden. This angered Siad Barre, and expelled all Soviets advisors and citizens from Somalia, China and Safari Club supported Somalia diplomatically and with token military aid. The question of Taiwan has been a key political issue for the People's Republic of China (PRC). In 1971, the support of African nations was crucial in the PRC joining the United Nations (UN), taking over the seat of the ROC on Taiwan. Many African countries, such as Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Zambia have stressed their support to \\"one-China policy\\". Only one African country, Swaziland, still maintains relations with Taipei. For the quest of a permanent UN seat for Africa, Nigeria, the largest African country, relies on Chinese support while Egypt looks to U.S. backing. Since 1997, around 40 African heads of state have visited the PRC. The ministerial meeting, Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), held in Beijing in October 2000 was the first collective dialogue between the PRC and African nations. In July 2019, UN ambassadors of 37 countries, including Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, Congo, DRC, Egypt, Eritrea, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and other African states, have signed a joint letter to the UNHRC defending China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang region. = Economic = In 1980, the total Sino-African trade volume was US$1 billion. In 1999, it was US$6.5 billion and in 2000, US$10 billion. By 2005, the total Sino-African trade had reached US$39.7 billion before it jumped to US$55 billion in 2006, making China the second largest trading partner of Africa after the United States, which had trade worth US$91 billion with African nations. The PRC also passed the traditional African economic partner and former colonial power France, which had trade worth US$47 billion. In 2010, trade between Africa and China was worth US$114 billion and in 2011, US$166.3 billion. In the first 10 months of 2012 it was US$163.9 billion. There are an estimated 800 Chinese corporations doing business in Africa, most of which are private companies investing in the infrastructure, energy and banking sectors Investments from Chinese entrepreneurial migration have culminated in positive (indirect jobs) and negative (displacing local traders) effects in local African societies Unconditional and low-rate credit lines (rates at 1.5% over 15 years to 20 years) have taken the place of the more restricted and conditional Western loans Since 2000, more than $10bn in debt owed by African nations to the PRC has been canceled. One-third of China's oil supplies comes from the African continent, mainly from Angola. Investments of Chinese companies in the energy sector have reached high levels in recent years. In some cases, like in Nigeria and Angola, oil and gas exploration and production deals reached more than $2 billion. Many of those investments are mixed packages of aid and loan in exchange for infrastructure building and trade deals. In agriculture, Benin and the Sahel countries of Burkina Faso and Mali supply up to 20% of China's cotton needs. While C√¥te d'Ivoire supplies China with cocoa,from US$39,7 million in 2001 to $113,5 million in 2005 (source:intracen.org) large shipments of coffee are imported from Kenya. As for fish products, Namibia remains one of the main providers. During the year 2011, trade between Africa and China increased a staggering 33% from the previous year to US$166 billion. This included Chinese imports from Africa equalling US$93 billion, consisting largely of mineral ores, petroleum, and agricultural products and Chinese exports to Africa totalling $93 billion, consisting largely of manufactured goods. Outlining the rapidly expanding trade between the African continent and China, trade between these two areas of the world increased further by over 22% year-over-year to US$80.5 billion during the first five months of the year 2012. Imports from Africa were up 25.5% to $49.6 billion during these first five months of 2012 and exports of Chinese-made products, such as machinery, electrical and consumer goods and clothing/footwear increased 17.5% to reach $30.9 billion. China remained Africa's largest trading partner during 2011 for the fourth consecutive year (starting in 2008). The need to protect China's increased investments in Africa have driven a shift away from China's traditional non-interference in the internal matters of other countries to new diplomatic and military initiatives to try to resolve unrest in South Sudan and Mali. To protect its investment and cement its geopolitical rise, China has opened its first military base in Djibouti in the horn of Africa. Political scientists are of the view that this move marks a new phase in Sino- Africa relations: \\"The opening of the first Chinese military base in Africa in the summer of 2017 heralded a new era for Chinese foreign policy. As China‚Äôs economic and political ambitions continue to grow, the Djibouti base is expected to help in the maintenance of continental peace and security where necessary. This would enhance Beijing‚Äôs continued growth around the world, Africa in particular, where China has become the continent‚Äôs largest trading partner.\\" During the December 2015 FOCAC meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, China's paramount leader Xi Jinping pledged $60 billion over a three- year deal in loans and assistance to the African continent. China's effort is to support factories manufacturing goods for export. Along with roads and ports, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari showed his desire to finish stalled railway projects along the coastline, specifically a 1400 km railway from Lagos to Calabar representing approximately 200,000 jobs. = Aid = China strongly supported African Independence Movements and gave aid to newly independent African nations in the 1960s and 1970s. Among the most notable early projects was the 1,860 km TAZARA Railway, linking Zambia and Tanzania, which China helped to finance and build from 1970 to 1975.Brautigam 2010: 40‚Äì41 Some 50,000 Chinese engineers and workers sent to the continent to complete the project. By 1978, China was giving aid to more African countries than the United States.Brautigam 2010: 42 Since China is becoming a major donor for Africa, there is need for African governments to formulate appropriate mechanisms in order to make use of it towards advancing African economies.Paul Kipchumba, Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy, Nairobi: Kipchumba Foundation, 2017 The African Union headquarters was built and fully funded by the Chinese government. = Health care = China has been engaged in a kind of \\"health diplomacy\\" towards Africa since the 1960s. Health care development and medical assistance have been one of the main successful areas of cooperation. Between the early 1960s and 2005, more than 15,000 Chinese doctors traveled to Africa to help treat patients in more than 47 countries. The medical teams, known as yiliaodui, have treated more than 170 million patients during the same period. In 2001, the member nations of G8, formed the United Nations-backed Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria with an initial budget of $10 billion. In 2007, another additional $1.1 billion was approved in Kunming, China, of which 66% was dedicated to Africa. In September of the same year, China promised the Democratic Republic of the Congo to build 31 hospital units and 145 smaller health care centers, a project due to be completed in March 2010. = Military = Military cooperation goes back to the Cold War period when China was keen to help African liberation movements. Apart from some traditional allies such as Somalia and Tanzania, China also had military ties with non-aligned countries such as Egypt. Military equipment worth $142 million was sold to African countries between 1955 and 1977. Two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union, military relations are now based on business interests rather than ideology.China's Energy Strategy: The Impact on Beijing's Maritime Policies ed. by Gabriel B. Collins, Andrew S. Erickson, Lyle J. Goldstein, and William S. Murray. Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2008. p.44 . More recently, China has sent troops to the continent to participate in peacekeeping. In 2004, China deployed around 1,500 military personnel under the UN umbrella, dispatched between Liberia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, though only since 2011 has it sent infantry troops describable (arguably) as 'combat' forces. In July 2007, China support of the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 1769 and contributes troops to UN-AU hybrid peacekeeping force(UNAMID). China also has 14 attach√©s in 14 different African countries as of 2007, while there are 18 African countries who maintain their attach√©s in Beijing. Apart from peacemaking, China provides military training and equipment to a few countries, though this does not require military forces to be deployed. During the December 2015 FOCAC meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, Chinese leader Xi Jinping restated \\"China strongly believes Africa belongs to the African people and African problems should be handled by the African people.\\" China's latest military efforts are to combat terrorist radicalism, and not the local African conflicts. Chinese Drones have proliferated across the Africa, executing hundreds of deadly attacks in Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Nigeria. An increasing number of African countries have shifted their source of supply from traditional providers such as Russia to China due in part to the competitive prices offered by Chinese suppliers. Arms sales by China to some African states have troubled Western critics who point out some buyers like Sudan are accused of war crimes. In contrast to critics, Carter Ham, a former US Army General in charge of U.S. Africa Command, spoke in favor of the benefits and potential cooperation between China and the US in the African military sphere, offering as examples Chinese supplied patrol boats to the DRC military and building by Chinese contractors of a military institute in Tanzania as Chinese hardware that could be combined with US training to form joint assistance for African militaries. Former U.S. military contractor Erik Prince's Frontier Services Group has close ties to the Chinese state-owned CITIC Group and provides security, training services to Chinese firms operating in Africa. In July 2017, China set up its first overseas military base at Djibouti in Africa. = Culture = Foreign students at Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan Africa is a host of three Chinese cultural centers. The first overseas Chinese center was opened in Mauritius in 1988. Two other followed in Egypt and Benin. The Confucius Institute, which focuses on the promotion of the Chinese language and culture, has 20 centers distributed around 13 African countries. Historically, little is known about early African immigration to China. As economic and political ties have strengthened, many Africans have relocated to China seeking better economic opportunities. Places dubbed 'Little Africa' and 'Chocolate City' are increasingly receiving new immigrants, mostly Nigerians. Most of the African immigrants are concentrated in the area of Guangzhou with an estimated number of 20,000. It is estimated that there are around 10,000 illegal African immigrants in China and police crackdowns have intensified since early 2009. In contrast, early Chinese immigration to the African continent is slightly better documented. In 1724, a few Chinese convicts were brought as labourers to South Africa from the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) by the colonial Dutch Empire. In the early 19th century, another wave of immigrants came to South Africa as workers brought by the British to work in agriculture, infrastructure building and mining. In recent years, there has been an increasing presence of Chinese in Africa with one estimate numbering Chinese nationals at one million.  Criticism  There are a variety of critical perspectives scrutinizing the Chinese role in the relationship focused on the balance of the power relationship and human rights. Increasingly, concerns have been raised by Africans as well as outside observers that China's relationship with Africa is neocolonialist in nature. As a response to such criticism, China issued the Nine Principles to Encourage and Standardise Enterprises' Overseas Investment, a charter and guide of conduct to Chinese companies operating abroad. The China-Zimbabwe relationship drew the attention of such critics. China was accused of supplying Zimbabwe with jet fighters, vehicles and other military equipment. China declared in 2007 that it was dropping all kinds of assistance and limiting assistance to humanitarian aid. In July 2008, the Chinese diplomacy asked Mugabe \\"to behave\\" though critics see that as a way for China to protect its own interests in this country should a regime change. Another high-profile event involving critics of China in Africa was in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Human rights groups criticized China for its supportive relationship with the government of Sudan, which is accused of mass killings in Darfur. China is Sudan's largest economic partner, with a 40% share in their oil, and also sells Sudan small arms. China has threatened to veto UN Security Council actions to combat the Darfur crisis, and has argued that, \\"As the Darfur issue is not an internal affair of China, nor was it caused by China, to link the two together is utterly unreasonable, irresponsible and unfair.\\"  See also  * Reserve currency * Internationalization of the renminbi * List of People's Republic of China diplomatic missions *List of diplomatic missions of the Republic of China *Sino-Third World relations * Caribbean‚ÄìPeople's Republic of China relations * Sino-Pacific relations * AU Conference Center and Office Complex * Debt-trap diplomacy  References  Further reading       * Calabrese, Linda (ed.)

Overview of Pavlopetri. The city of Pavlopetri (), underwater off the coast of southern Laconia in Peloponnese, Greece, is about 5,000 years old, making it one of the oldest submerged lost cities, as well as the oldest in the Mediterranean sea. Name Pavlopetri (or Paulopetri) literally translates to Paul's Stone and is a direct reference to St. Paul, the Christian apostle and martyr who traveled far and wide to spread Christianity. Discovery Discovered in 1967 by Nicholas Flemming and mapped in 1968 by a team of archaeologists from Cambridge, Pavlopetri is located between the Pavlopetri islet across the Elafonisos village and the Pounta coast. The coast, the archeological site as well as the islet and the surrounding sea area are within the region of the Elafonisos Municipality, the old \\"Onou Gnathos\\" peninsula (according to Pausanias). It is unique in having an almost complete town plan, including streets, buildings, and tombs. Origins Originally, the ruins were dated to the Mycenaean period, 1600‚Äì1100 BC but later studies showed an older occupation date starting no later than 2800 BC, so it also includes early Bronze Age middle Minoan and transitional material. It is now believed that the town was submerged around 1000 BC by the first of three earthquakes that the area suffered.Leadbetter, Russell. In praise of... underwater archaeology. The Herald 11 Oct 2011 The area never re-emerged, so it was neither built-over nor disrupted by agriculture. Although eroded over the centuries, the town layout is as it was thousands of years ago. The site is under threat of damage by boats dragging anchors, as well as by tourists and souvenir hunters. Exploration The fieldwork of 2009 was largely to map the site. It is the first submerged town digitally surveyed in three dimensions. Sonar mapping techniques developed by military and oil prospecting organizations have aided recent work.BBC News \\"Sea gives up secrets to experts\\", 16 October 2009; accessed 16 October 2009.BBC News \\"Pavlopetri: A window on to Bronze Age suburban life\\", 8 October 2011 The city has at least 15 buildings submerged in of water. The newest discoveries in 2009 alone cover . Four more fieldwork sessions were planned in October 2009, in collaboration with the Greek government as a joint project aimed at excavations. Also working alongside the archaeologists (from the University of Nottingham) are a team from the Australian Centre for Field Robotics, who aim to take underwater archaeology into the 21st century. Several unique robots have been developed to survey the site in various ways. One of the results of the survey was to establish that the town was the centre of a thriving textile industry (from the many loom weights found in the site). Also many large pitharis pots (pottery jars) from Crete were excavated, indicating a major trading port. Documentary The work of the British- Australian archaeological team was assembled in an hour-long BBC documentary video, \\"City Beneath the Waves: Pavlopetri\\", broadcast by BBC Two in 2011.\\"City Beneath the Waves: Pavlopetri\\" UNESCO site The city of Pavlopetri is part of the underwater cultural heritage as defined by the UNESCO in the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. All traces of human existence underwater which are one hundred years old or more are protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This convention aims at preventing the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information and looting.

Background  Snow Knight was bred by J. A. Claude Lilley, a textile manufacturer and the proprietor of Quarry Stud on Duffield Bank in Makeney, Derbyshire. Lilley had owned and raced Pretendre, sire of the 1971 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, Canonero II. Snow Knight's dam was Snow Blossom, a daughter of Flush Royal, winner of England's Great Yorkshire Stakes and the Prix Noailles in France. His sire was the speedy runner Firestreak who had been owned by Canadian lawyer Neil F. Phillips, whose wife Sharon purchased Snow Knight at auction as a yearling for ¬£5,200.  Racing career  Europe = Trained by Peter Nelson, at the age of two Snow Knight made five starts, winning two and finishing second twice. At three, in the trial races for the Epsom Derby, he finished second in the Ladbrokes Classic Trial Stakes at Sandown Park and third in the Lingfield Derby Trial. Small injuries slowed him but he would fight back. Always a fractious colt, in the paddock at Epsom Downs Racecourse, Snow Knight threw jockey Brian Taylor and at the starting gate was still fighting his handlers. Sent off at odds of 50:1, he ran in the middle of the pack until the field made the turn at Tattenham Corner, when he sped to the lead and won by two lengths. = North America = In the fall of 1974, Snow Knight was sold for a reported C$1 million to Canada's leading horseman, E. P. Taylor, and sent to Taylor's Windfields Farm in Ontario. For new trainer Jim Bentley, Snow Knight made three starts at Toronto's Woodbine Racetrack but performed poorly. For the 1975 racing season, Snow Knight was sent to race in the United States, where MacKenzie Miller was entrusted with his race conditioning. Miller, known for his patience, spent months working with the high-strung colt. His diligence paid off when Snow Knight won the important Manhattan Handicap and Man o' War Handicap. Sent back to Woodbine Racetrack for the prestigious Canadian International Championship, he defeated an international field on the turf.  Honours and awards  On 23 January 1977, Snow Knight was elected to the Aiken Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame. He was voted American Champion Male Turf Horse in the Eclipse Awards for 1975. Retired to stud duty at Windfields Farm, in 1986 Snow Knight was sent to stand in Australia. Although he met with limited success as a sire, Snow Knight did sire the outstanding racemare Awaasif who won the Yorkshire Oaks and the Gran Premio del Jockey Club and finished third in the 1982 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

This is idea that the employer is not liable for injuries caused by one employee to another in the course of their employment. The rule was removed in its entirety in the United Kingdom by the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948. Despite this, there was no allegation by the plaintiff in this case \\"about the act of any fellow servant or indeed any suggestion that the duty sought to be put on the employer was other than a primary duty to ensure that the van was a safe conveyance.\\"F.H. Newark, Elegantia Juris (Belfast: Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly, 1973), p. 145. Facts On 30 May 1835 Charles Priestley,Two individuals surnamed Priestley had previously litigated related issues. Underhill v. Priestley (1781) reported a claim against one Thomas Priestley for negligently driving a loaded cart, while Priestley v. Watson, 3 C. & M. 691, 149 Eng. Rep. 938 (Ex. 1834), recounted the suit by a Joseph Priestley challenging Brotherton township's Poor Law assessments against the Aire & Calder Navigation Company. The former opinion may be found in James Oldham, 2 The Mansfield Manuscripts and the growth of english law in the eighteenth century 1137 (1992). The latter case was determined in the Court of Exchequer one term before Lord Abinger was appointed Chief Baron. a servant of butcher Thomas Fowler of Market Deeping, was ordered to deliver mutton to market. The meat was placed in a wagon driven by William Beeton, another of Fowler's employees.None of the accounts make clear who loaded the wagon with the \\"peds\\" (i.e., hampers) of mutton. Priestley was to accompany the cart only as far as Buckden, some twenty miles from Peterborough, where he was to sell some quantity of the loaded provisions. Beeton would then continue on to London to vend the remainder. The four-horse team could not move the van and \\"jibbed,\\" meaning that they stopped in their tracks and would not move forward. Turning to the nearby Fowler, Beeton protested that \\"he ought to be ashamed of himself for sending such a dangerous load.\\" Fowler responded by calling Beeton \\"a damned fool for saying anything of the sort.\\" Although present during the exchange, Priestley held his peace.Diverging from the other four accounts, Murphy & Hurlstone reported that the \\"plaintiff remonstrated, on account of the cart being overloaded, and too weak to bear the load, and it being dangerous to go by it.\\" Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 305. Although arguments before the Court of Exchequer would later make heavy weather over Priestley's acquiescent riding in the van, the discrepancy over the complaint's source is immaterial. Whether Priestley or Beeton, Priestley either was of the opinion, had confirmed his opinion, or was given notice of Beeton's opinion, that the van was overloaded. Relying on the Murphy & Hurlstone report, Ingman's account in Rise and Fall was rightly taken to task as \\"incorrect\\" by Simpson. SIMPSON, supra note 2, at 107 n.28; see Ingman, Rise and Fall, supra note 7. Kostal was likewise mistaken. See KOSTAL, supra note 8, at 260. Following this ominous start, the wagon soon embarked on its journey, propelled into motion by some of Fowler's other employees.Simpson intimated that the cart might have been loaded by unidentified mutton suppliers. See SIMPSON, supra note 2, at 103. Nearing Peterborough, Beeton and Priestley heard a cracking noise as the cart rolled over some stones. Consequently, they had the van inspected by Gideon Lucas, owner of the King's Head Inn. The perusal, conducted by lantern light because they had departed Market Deeping at nine thirty at night, revealed nothing amiss with the cart. Nevertheless, while traversing the mile south from Peterborough towards Norman Cross, the wagon's front axle cracked along a third of its length and gave way, overturning the vehicle. Beeton was pulled ahead of the van's collapse by the horses, escaping substantial harm. Priestley was less fortunate: some four hundredweight worth of mutton fell on him, resulting in a broken thigh, a dislocated shoulder, and various other injuries. As was customary upon the occurrence of such accidents,This is demonstrated, among other cases, by Tomlinson v. Bentall, 5 B. & C. 738, 108 Eng. Rep. 274 (K.B. 1826), and Lamb v. Bunce, 4 M. & S. 274, 105 Eng. Rep. 836 (K.B. 1815). Priestley was taken to the closest public lodging, in this case the King's Head Inn from which he and Beeton had recently departed. Lying \\"in a very precarious state,\\" Priestley remained at the inn for nineteen weeks, during the course of which he was treated by two surgeons. Exactly what happened during this convalescence period remains open to conjecture, but the total cost of Priestley's care and treatment, a hefty ¬£50,A considerable amount, especially when compared to the annual ¬£80 medical budget of the parish union that presented the charge to Priestley. See SIMPSON, supra, at 126. was paid by his father, Brown Priestley. Judgment During the Lincoln Summer Assizes of 1836, Charles Priestley (as a minor through his father) sued his master Fowler for compensation relating to his accident.\\"The present action was brought to recover the amount of the expenses for which the father had been put in consequence of this lamentable occurrence.\\" NORTHAMPTON MERCURY, July 23, 2016. On 18 July 1836 the action was tried before Park, J.,In relating the events of trial, Kostal inadvertently identified the jurist as Parke, B. rather than Park, J., possibly because Bartrip and Burman identified the jurist as \\"Parke, J.\\" P.W.J. BARTRIP & S.B. BURMAN, THE WOUNDED SOLDIERS OF INDUSTRY 104 (1983); KOSTAL, supra note 8, at 262, 262 n.45. The error is significant because Park, J. in both the Priestley assize case and the Court of Common Pleas case of Vaughan v. Menlove, 3 Bing. (N.C.) 468, 132 Eng. Rep. 490 (C.P. 1837), fostered master/servant liability. As will be seen below, Parke, B. took the opposite approach. See infra notes 115-116 and accompanying text. who by all accounts was a sound judge, although given to occasional losses of temper.See E. Foss, a biographical dictionary of the judges of England 1066-1870, at 496-97 (1870) (describing Park, J.'s \\"only drawback\\" as \\"a certain irritability about trifles, which too frequently excited the jocularity of the bar\\"); 15 Dictionary of national biography 216 (Oxford University Press CD-ROM, version 1.0, 1995) (\\"as a judge, though not eminent, he was sound, fair, and sensible, a little irascible, but highly esteemed\\"). A popular yarn represented Park, J. as the illegitimate son of George III, to whom he bore a resemblance. See Michael Gilbert, the Oxford book of legal anecdotes 234 (1986). Serjeant Edward Coronet and Lieutenant in the Royal Horse Guards, and Tory M.P. for Leicester during the course of Priestley. See 7 Dictionary of national biography, supra note 25, at 283. Simpson mistakenly reported Goulbourne's legislative career as \\"M.P. for Ipswich.\\" SIMPSON, supra note 2, at 102 n.8. Although not egregious, the oversight is relevant. Had Goulbourne successfully contested representation for Ipswich in 1832, he would have been a colleague of Sir James Scarlett (later Abinger, C.B.), who was returned for Norwich in that same election. See 17 Dictionary of national biography, supra note 25, at 890. and Mr. Nathaniel Clarke Afterward a county court judge. See SIMPSON, supra note 2, at 102 n.9. represented Priestley, while Serjeant John Adams Also the author of a legal text. See J. Adams, a treatise on the principles and practice of the action of ejectment and the resulting action for mense profits (2d ed. 1818). and Mr. Andrew Amos A respected lecturer on jurisprudence, Amos would become the first Professor of Law at the University of London (later University College), then the Downing Professor at Cambridge University from 1849 to 1860. See 1 Dictionary of national biography 366-67, supra note 25. acted as counsel for Fowler.No evidence exists of how such expensive legal talent was retained, although Simpson surmised that a contingency fee may have been arranged for Priestley. SIMPSON, supra note 2, at 102. Kostal concurred, adding that \\"the number of lawyers in towns like Lincoln was on the rise in this period,\\" thereby \\"increasing the chance that one of their number would become interested in Priestley's predicament.\\" KOSTAL, supra note 8, at 261 n.34. This raises the question of how Fowler, as a defendant unable to proceed under a contingency fee, could have afforded his counsel, and raises the conjecture that those costs contributed to his subsequent bankruptcy. See Priestley v. Fowler, 3 Murph. & H. 305, 305 (Ex. 1837); Lincolnshire Chron. & Gen. Advertiser, Jan. 24, 1837. =Pleadings= Priestley pleaded two grounds in support of his claim against his master, a latent defect and the van's overloading. The declaration stated that when Fowler had \\"directed\\" the plaintiff to accompany the mutton to market \\"in\\" the van, Fowler was under a duty \\"to use due and proper care that said van should be in a proper state of repair\\" and \\"not be overloaded, and that the plaintiff should be safely and securely carried thereby.\\" As a result of Fowler having breached this duty, the van had broken down and the plaintiff was harmed. No allegation was made as to negligent actions or omissions, nor of the existence or violation of a duty towards Charles Priestley by anyone in Fowler's employ.See Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 305. =Trial= Throughout the trial, Serjeant Goulbourne emphasised the over-loading claim, with contrary evidence presented by the parties as to the weight both properly and actually borne by the wagon. Evidence was also given as to the extent of the axle's defect prior to the accident. In putting Priestley's case to the jury, Goulbourne played to their sympathies, remonstrating the unprincipled behaviour of the \\"wealthy butcher\\" defendant towards the plaintiff who \\"was one of a large family,\\" and asking for not only reimbursement of medical expenses, but also recompense for Priestley's pain and suffering:That a very opulent tradesman, a man in a very large way of business like the defendant, should have driven this poor lad into court, for he would say that not only justice, but also in common humanity, he ought to pay the pecuniary damages his client had sustained, and also some remuneration for the suffering he had undergone, and the deprivation under which he was now labouring and would labour for the rest of his days.Lincolnshire Chron. & Gen. Advertiser, July 22, 1836. Opposing the claim, Serjeant Adams denied that the cart had been overloaded, noting that Priestley had continued on the journey after first witnessing Beeton's protest, and then hearing the cart crack near Peterborough. Nor could Fowler be held liable, Adams continued, as he was only bound to use \\"such ordinary care and diligence as he would use over himself,\\" and the defendant had been satisfied as to the state of his property.See id. In any event, Serjeant Adams asserted that as a legal matter, Fowler as a master was not liable to his servant Priestley. This was because there was \\"no such case in the books,\\"See id. and for good reason: \\"If the defendant was responsible in this case, every master was liable to any accident that might occur to his servant about his work.\\"Lincoln, Boston & Newark Tuesday's Gazette, July 19, 1836. No evidence reveals the possible negligence of Priestley's fellow servants ever being raised or at issue during the trial. =Judge rulings and jury verdict= Without identifying a related judgment, Park, J. disagreed with Adams's contention \\"that there is no such case on the books,\\" and refused to nonsuit the plaintiff, opining that \\"the defendant is liable.\\"Lincolnshire Chron. & Gen. Advertiser, July 22, 1836. At the same time, he pointed out that the jury could consider Priestley's acquiescence in light of the wagon's condition, and granted Adams permission to move the full court in Westminster should the jury enter a verdict against his client.See id. Next, instructing the jury, Park, J. stated that Fowler could not be held liable for a hidden defect in the wagon. Instead the only question here was,-- and it was one of fact‚Äîwas the van shamelessly overladen; was it laden unsafely and to a dangerous degree; and, if so, was the master acquainted with the fact? . . . if the jury were of opinion that the accident was occasioned by the 'pigheadedness' of the defendant in over-loading the van they would find for the plaintiff.See id. After deliberating for less than half an hour, the jury awarded Charles Priestley a sizeable ¬£100.Id. Subtracting the medical expenses of ¬£50, Priestley received ¬£50 in damages. While no evidence exists as to Priestley's yearly wages, it was probably not more than the few pounds earned annually by domestic servants, thus equating the damages to as many as ten years' pay. See Ann Kussmaul, Servants in husbandry in early modern England 35-39 (1981). =Exchequer Chamber= During the following Michaelmas Term of 1836, Serjeant Adams obtained a rule to arrest the judgment on the ground \\"that there was nothing in the declaration to throw any liability on the master.\\"Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 305. In the Law Journal account, Adams moved \\"on the ground that the declaration did not allege that it was the duty of the plaintiff to go in the van.\\" See Priestley v. Fowler, 7 L.J. Ex. 43 (1837). Adams also moved for a new trial, but this part of the rule was abandoned when Fowler became bankrupt.Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 305. The latter part of the motion is not addressed by other law reports. As a result, the arguments presented on 16 January 1837 before the full Court of Exchequer In addition to Abinger, C.B., were Parke, Bolland, Alderson, and Gurney, B.B. See E. Foss, 9 the judges of England: with sketches of their lives 62 (1864). were confined solely to the motion in arrest of judgment.At this point the four reports diverge in their treatment of counsel's arguments. Murphy & Hurlstone and Meeson & Welby offer significantly similar and detailed accounts, the Law Journal an abbreviated version, and the Jurist none at all. Showing cause, Serjeant Goulbourne began by conceding that a probable issue Bolstering the Law Journal report that plaintiff's counsel showed cause at an earlier time. See Priestley, 7 L.J. Ex. at 43. was whether Priestley had been required to ride in the van, or had been at liberty to walk alongside it. Such concern was vitiated when the Court of Exchequer intimated the sufficiency of the declaration on this subject.Priestley v. Fowler, 3 M. & W. 1, 2, 150 Eng. Rep. 1030, 1031 (1837). Next, after acknowledging that the suit was \\"a case of the first impression\\" without \\"precedent exactly in point,\\" Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 305. Goulbourne declared that the action was \\"maintainable on general principles of law,\\" Priestley, 3 M. & W. at 2, 150 Eng. Rep. at 1031. analogising Priestley's situation to that of \\"an ordinary coach passenger.\\" Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 305-06. To this, Abinger, C.B. raised the distinction that a coach passenger had no means of knowing the coach's condition, whereas a servant could make his own inspection.Moreover, :a master, knowing a room to be infectious, puts a servant to sleep there, and the servant incurs a disease, the master would be clearly liable; but it would be otherwise if he had put him in a room where the windows were broken, and the place otherwise so obviously ruinous, as that he himself could actually see its condition; in the latter case you would hardly say that the master would be liable for an injury that resulted to the servant. Id. Serjeant Goulbourne averred that as in the coach/passenger situation, the master/servant relationship was contractual.The reports are distorted on this point. In Meeson & Welsby and the Law Journal, Abinger, C.B. made this contractual analogy while in Murphy & Hurlstone it is raised by Serjeant Goulbourne in response to Abinger, C.B.'s query. See Priestley, 3 M. & W. at 3, 150 Eng. Rep. at 1031; Priestley, 7 L.J. Ex. at 43; Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 306. The servant paid consideration with his labour, and the master was in turn duty bound \\"not to expose him to risk in performing these services.\\" Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 306. Meeson & Welby reported that Goulbourne further extended the coach/passenger comparison by positing whether recovery would be affected for a coach passenger who noticed that \\"the coachman was intoxicated or the horses unruly.\\" Parke, B. responded that under those circumstances the duty to carry the passenger safely would only extend as far as the conditions known to the passenger, i.e., that of a drunken driver with a rambunctious horse. Abinger, C.B. added that a \\"stage-coachman\\" who knowingly drove a recalcitrant horse would also be barred from recovery. Priestley, 3 M. & W. at 3, 150 Eng. Rep. at 1031. Because the jury had found for the plaintiff, two inferences had to be \\"intended,\\" or drawn. First, that \\"it was the master's duty to provide a proper vehicle,\\" and second, \\"that the master knew the van was overloaded.\\" See Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 306. Meeson & Welby offered a different version wherein Goulbourne admitted that \\"it does not appear on the face of the declaration, that the plaintiff knew the van was overloaded, and it cannot be intended after verdict: on the other hand, it does not appear that the defendant knew it.\\" Priestley, 3 M. & W. at 3, 150 Eng. Rep. at 1031. Relying upon this report of the case, Haines castigated Goulbourne for sloppy lawyering. See B.W. Haines, English Labour Law and the Separation From Contract, 1 J. Legal Hist. 262, 284 (1980). Using the Murphy & Hurlstone version, Kostal agreed. See KOSTAL, supra note 8, at 262. Plaintiff's counsel concluded his averments by arguing that even if brought in assumpsit, the action would have alleged the same basis for recovery because the law implied a promise \\"co-extensive\\" to the violations of duty alleged under case in the declaration. In response, the Chief Baron opined that liability would exist in those circumstances if either the master had \\"maliciously designed\\" to injure his servant, or he had \\"positively guaranteed\\" his safety. Seizing upon this opening, Serjeant Goulbourne stated that after the verdict \\"it will be intended that the master was aware of the danger, and that he denied to the servant that there was any danger.\\" Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 305. Parke, B. then posed a hypothetical: \\"Suppose I send my servant on the roof, to clear away the snow; if the roof gives way am I liable?\\" Serjeant Goulbourne replied that the present case differed because \\"it is not a mere state of insufficiency; for the overloading of the cart is a positive act, which occasions the accident.\\" Id At no point during the repartee did either Serjeant Goulbourne or the Exchequer Barons touch on the likelihood of Priestley's injury originating from the oversight of a fellow servant. In arrest of the judgment, Serjeant Adams contended that the plaintiff had improperly framed his action in case rather than in assumpsit.Because the action alleged was \\"in the nature of a contract,\\" it should have been brought in assumpsit. Instead, the plaintiff had sought relief in case, which as a tort required common-law liability to exist between master and servant. Id. This error was dispositive, for in order to maintain an action, five circumstances had to exist: First, that the van was overloaded, by defendant's order. Second, that plaintiff was ignorant of its being overloaded. Third, there must be an order by the defendant, to plaintiff, to go on the van. Fourth, that it was necessary for the plaintiff to do so, in order to perform his duty in respect of the goods. And, fifth, that the order shall be a lawful command which the servant is bound to obey.Id. at 305-07. The action having raised three of Adams's prerequisites to liability, the Barons of the Exchequer engaged defendant's counsel in a protracted discussion of whether Priestley was required to ride in the wagon or could have walked alongside it, then intended that the declaration was sufficient on this point.That Serjeant Adams raised this issue after the Court of Exchequer had already disposed of it during Serjeant Goulbourne's appeal lends additional support to the Law Journal report that Goulbourne had spoken on a previous occasion. See Priestley, 7 L.J. Ex. at 43. Serjeant Adams concluded his advocacy by proclaiming that \\"there is nothing in the declaration which shews that this was anything more than a mere accident; and for a mere accident which happens in a master's service, the master is not responsible.\\" Id. As with the arguments presented by his opposing counsel, Adams never raised the prospect of vitiating his client's liability due to the intervening act of a fellow servant. Instead of rendering a decision on the day of argument, the Court of Exchequer reserved judgment, presenting its opinion on 23 November 1837.The ten-month delay, according to Simpson, \\"suggests some difficulty in achieving unanimity.\\" SIMPSON, supra note 2, at 107; see also Lincoln, Rutland & Stamford Mercury, Jan. 20, 1837 (\\"the Court would take time to look into the case, as it was a nice one, and involved some important consequences\\"). For the Court,Whose constituency had not been altered in the interval. FOSS, supra note 42, at 62. Abinger, C.B. delivered a rambling opinion arresting the judgment.With one minor exception, the opinion is related verbatim in all the reported versions. The Chief Baron began by dismissing as a matter of law the assertion that Fowler's knowledge of overloading could be intended after verdict.In so doing, Abinger, C.B. \\"was not evaluating evidence, but determining as a matter of law whether knowledge could be 'intended' after verdict.\\" SIMPSON, supra note 2, at 107 n.28. Kostal and Ingman nevertheless took Abinger, C.B. to task for ignoring evidence submitted at trial. See KOSTAL, supra note 8, at 263; Ingman, Rise and Fall, supra note 7, at 108-09. The only issue to be decided was both narrow and clear: whether \\"the mere relation of master and servant\\" implied a common-law duty \\"on the part of the master, to cause the servant to be safely and securely carried.\\" Lacking \\"precedent for the present action,\\" the Court was at \\"liberty to look at the consequences of a decision the one way or the other.\\" Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 307. Deciding \\"the question upon general principles,\\" Abinger, C.B. cautioned that if legal culpability was upheld under these circumstances \\"the principle of that liability will be found to carry us to an alarming extent.\\" Id. at 308. He then put forward a number of examples in dicta illustrating the magnitude to which such a rule would cause principals to be responsible to their \\"inferior agents\\": If the owner of the carriage, therefore, is responsible for the sufficiency of his carriage to his servant, he is responsible for the negligence of his coach-maker, or his harness-maker, or his coachman. The footman, therefore, who stands behind the carriage, may have an action against his master for a defect in the carriage, owing to the negligence of the coach-maker, or for a defect in the harness arising from the negligence of the harness-maker, or for the drunkenness, neglect, or want of skill in the coachman.Id. Even more distressing to Lord Abinger was that the rationale of the case could be broadened further, allowing, for example, a master to \\"be liable to the servant, for the negligence of the chambermaid, in putting him into a damp bed.\\" In addition, Abinger, C.B. anticipated that :the master would also be liable for the acts of the upholsterer for sending in a crazy bedstead, whereby the servant was made to fall down, while asleep, and injure himself; for the negligence of the cook in not properly cleansing the copper vessels used in the kitchen; of the butcher in supplying the family with meat of a quality injurious to health; of the builder for a defect in the foundation of the house, whereby it fell and injured both the master and servant in ruins. Id. In other words, Abinger, C.B. clearly foresaw that permitting Priestley to recover directly against his master in this novel action would open the floodgates to vicarious liability, entitling servants injured by their peers to recover against their common masters. Because the consequences of such an extension would engender both \\"inconvenience\\" and \\"absurdity,\\" general principles provided \\"a sufficient argument\\" against liability.Id. Acknowledging that the master/servant relationship bound the master directly to \\"provide for the safety of his servant . . . to the best of his judgment, information, and belief,\\" the Chief Baron emphasised that it could \\"never\\" imply an obligation for the master \\"to take more care of the servant than he may reasonably be expected to do of himself.\\" At the same time, the servant was \\"not bound to risk his safety in the service of his master\\" and was free to \\"decline any service in which he reasonably apprehended injury to himself.\\"Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 307. In the Law Journal report, Abinger, C.B. cited the irrelevant case of Levinson v. Kirk, 1 Lane 65, 145 Eng. Rep. 303 (Ex. 1610), a suit by a merchant against a servant for not paying customs duty on his consignment of goods. Priestley, 7 L.J. Ex. at 43. This was because servants were in as good, if not better positions, than their masters to appreciate possible hazards.See Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 308. Thus \\"the plaintiff must have known, as well as his master, and probably better, whether the van was sufficient, whether it was overloaded, and whether it was likely to carry him safely.\\" Id. Haines explained this passage by stating that :the reasoning of the court seems to be that the master was not liable because, had he got into the van instead of his servant he could not have brought an action, as it was possible for him to see the van was overloaded and therefore the servant could have seen it also, and both could have refused to ride. Haines, supra note 52, at 282. More accurately, the Court of Exchequer meant that (1) even if Fowler did not agree with his judgment, Priestley did not have to ride in the van if he thought it overloaded, and (2) when Priestley (and of course, not Fowler) heard the axle crack near Peterborough, he should not have continued riding. Lord Abinger concluded with a last policy argument against upholding the jury's verdict. Allowing this action \\"would be an encouragement to the servant to omit that diligence and caution which he is in duty bound to exercise on behalf of his master,\\" and which offers much better protection against injuries \\"than any recourse against his master for damages could possibly afford.\\" Priestley, 3 Murph. & H. at 308.

Henry Eckford was a small passenger-cargo steamboat built in New York in 1824. She is notable for being the first steam vessel in the world to be installed with a compound engine, almost fifty years before the technology would become widely adopted for marine use. Construction Henry Eckford, named in honor of the renowned New York shipbuilder of the era, was built for Mowatt Brothers & Co. by Lawrence & Sneden of Manhattan, New York, in 1824. The machinery for the vessel was subcontracted to the Allaire Iron Works of James P. Allaire, who installed a compound engine (commonly known at the time as a \\"Woolf double cylinder\\" engine). Although the compound engine with its greater efficiencyCompound engines of this era could typically reduce fuel consumption by about a third. was already a well established technology, having been patented by British inventor Arthur Woolf almost twenty years earlier, such an engine had never before been used to power a ship. Henry Eckford's compound engine was of the vertical crosshead type.Marine Engineering, p. 7. It had two cylinders‚Äîa high-pressure cylinder 12 inches in diameter and a 24 inch low- pressure cylinder‚Äîand a stroke of 4 feet.Morrison, p. 48. The engine operated at a pressure of about , well above the common to marine steam engines of the period. While the higher pressure was necessary for the compound engine to fully utilize its greater efficiency, it may account for the fact that this type of engine remained unpopular in marine applications long after its invention, as boiler explosions were not uncommon on early steamboats and higher pressures made for more violent explosions. After Henry Eckford, Allaire would go on to install several more steamboats with compound engines, decades before the technology was to achieve widespread acceptance in marine applications. Service history Henry Eckford was initially employed as a passenger-and-freight steamer, running on the Hudson River between Rector St., North River, New York City and Albany, New York. Advertised as a \\"very fast\\" boat, the steamer had a speed of around , and could complete a one-way trip in about 14 hours. The price of a full ticket was $3, with intermediate stops charged in proportion to distance travelled.Dwight, p. 191. In 1825, the Mowatts decided to try using the boat to tow barges. Since no steamboat had previously been utilized in such a role, the proposal was widely greeted with scepticism, but in the first attempt, Henry Eckford pulled two barges from New York to Albany in 24 hours, a commercially viable time.Haswell, Chapter VIII. The principle having been established, other steamboat owners quickly followed suit, and steam towboats soon became a commonplace. Henry Eckford herself would thereafter spend much of her career as a towboat. However, she also continued to carry passengers, and in 1826 the steamer's cabin was converted to passenger accommodation. By this time, the fare from New York to Albany had dropped to a dollar.The Repository, 1826 (scan). In the 1830s, Henry Eckford was placed on the route between New York and Norwich, Connecticut.Morrison, p. 327. Eventually superseded by newer, faster steamboats, Henry Eckford spent her later years as a towboat in New York Harbor.Munsell, p. 39. =Boiler explosion= On April 27, 1841, while getting up steam in dock at the foot of Cedar St., New York, to tow a canal boat, Henry Eckford suffered a boiler explosion.Jones, p. 7. The two x 30 inch (5.8 by 0.76 m) wrought-iron boilers, with an aggregate weight of about 4 tons, were thrown toward the stern, wrecking the engine in their path, parts of which were thrown an additional twenty feet.Jones, pp. 11-12. The ship's engineer and firemen were hurled from the vessel by the force of the blast but escaped serious injury; however, a worker on board the canal boat, which was in the process of being secured to the steamer, was killed by a piece of flying metal.Jones, pp. 7-8. In the subsequent inquest, no blame was attributed to any party, though a tardy government inspection was considered a possible contributing factor.Jones, p. 11. The boiler had reached only about when the blast occurred, well below its normal operating pressure. Cause of the explosion was determined to be extreme internal corrosion, which in some places had reduced the boiler plates to a fraction of their original thickness.Jones, p. 14-15. The boilers had been installed 11 years prior and had an expected lifespan of approximately 15 years.Jones, p. 9. After the explosion, Henry Eckford's wrecked machinery was removed and the hull was converted into a coal barge, which was still in service as late as 1851. The barge was eventually broken up.

Through her daughter, Anne Mortimer, she was the great- grandmother of the Yorkist kings Edward IV and Richard III. She was governess to Richard II's wife, Isabella of Valois. Family Alianore Holland was born 13 October 1370. in Upholland, Lancashire, the eldest child of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, and Lady Alice FitzAlan, the daughter of Richard de Arundel, 10th Earl of Arundel, and his second wife, Eleanor of Lancaster, daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, grandson of King Henry III.; . Her paternal grandparents were Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, and Joan of Kent, mother of King Richard II by her third marriage to Edward, the Black Prince. As such, Alianore's father was a maternal half-brother to King Richard II. Alianore had four brothers and six sisters:. *Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey, who married Joan Stafford, daughter of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford *John Holland (born 2 November 1374) *Richard Holland (3 April 1376 ‚Äì 21 May 1396) *Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent, who was reportedly betrothed to Constance of York, widow of Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester, and who married Lucy Visconti, youngest daughter of Bernab√≤ Visconti *Joan Holland, who married firstly, Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York; secondly, William Willoughby, 5th Lord Willoughby; thirdly, Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham; and fourthly, Henry Bromflete, Baron Vescy. *Eleanor Holland (the second of that name), who married Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury *Margaret Holland, who married firstly, John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, and secondly, Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence *Elizabeth Holland, who married Sir John Neville of Sutton (in Gualtres), Yorkshire *Anne Holland (b. 4 December 1389) *Bridget (a nun) Marriages and issue Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, had died in 1381, leaving a 6-year-old son, Roger Mortimer, as heir to the vast Mortimer estates. According to Davies, the wardship of such an important heir was an 'issue of political moment in the years 1382‚Äì4', and eventually Mortimer's lands were granted to a consortium for ¬£4000 per annum, and the guardianship of his person was initially granted to Richard Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel. However at the behest of King Richard's mother, Joan of Kent, in August 1384 Mortimer's wardship and marriage were granted, for 6000 marks,. to Joan's son, Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, and on or about 7 October 1388 Kent married Mortimer to his daughter, Alianore. Roger Mortimer had a claim to the crown through his mother, Philippa Plantagenet, daughter of Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, and granddaughter of King Edward III. Since Richard II had no issue, Roger Mortimer, as his nephew and a lineal descendant of Edward III, was next in line to the throne. Cokayne states that in October 1385 Mortimer was proclaimed by the King as heir presumptive. This was disputed by Davies who declared that the story that Richard publicly proclaimed Mortimer as heir presumptive in Parliament in October 1385 is baseless, although even Davies admitted the claim was openly discussed at the time.. The matter was cleared up in 2006 when it was observed that the declaration took place in the parliament of 1386, not that of 1385, and had been dislodged by an interpolation in the Eulogium chronicle, and is supported by a reference in the Westminster Chronicle (see Ian Mortimer, 'Richard II and the Succession to the Crown', History, vol. 91 (2006), pp. 320‚Äì36). Alianore and Roger Mortimer had two sons and two daughters:; *Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March *Roger (23 April 1393 ‚Äì c. 1413); Although some sources state that Roger died c.1409, Pugh states that he was made a Knight of the Bath by Henry V on the eve of his coronation on 9 April 1413. *Anne, who married Richard, Earl of Cambridge (executed 1415) *Eleanor, who married Sir Edward de Courtenay (d.1418), and had no issue On 20 July 1398, at the age of 24, Roger Mortimer was slain in a skirmish with 'O'Brien's men' at Kells.Davies gives the place name as Kellinstown. The Wigmore chronicler says that he was riding in front of his army, unattended and wearing Irish garb, and that those who slew him did not know who he was. He was interred at Wigmore Abbey.; The King went to Ireland in the following year to avenge Mortimer's death.. The Wigmore chronicler, while criticising Mortimer for lust and remissness in his duty to God, extols him as 'of approved honesty, active in knightly exercises, glorious in pleasantry, affable and merry in conversation, excelling his contemporaries in beauty of appearance, sumptuous in his feasting, and liberal in his gifts'.. Alianore and Roger Mortimer's young son, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, succeeded his father in the title and claim to the throne, and he and his brother, Roger, were kept in custody by King Henry IV until the end of his reign. However Alianore and Roger Mortimer's two daughters, Anne and Eleanor, were in their mother's care until her death in 1405.. According to Griffiths, they were not well treated by the King, and were described as 'destitute' after her death in 1405.. Before 19 June 1399 Alianore married, as her second husband, the 'Welsh marcher lord', Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Cherleton (1371‚Äì1421), by whom she had two daughters:; . *Joan, who married John Grey, 1st Earl of Tankerville, brother of Sir Thomas Grey, executed for his part in the Southampton Plot which aimed to replace King Henry V with Alianore's son, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. Joan and her sister, Joyce, were co-heiresses in 1425 to their stepbrother, Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March. *Joyce, whom married John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft. Death Eleanor died in childbirth in October 1405.; ; ; ; Richardson gives two conflicting dates; on p. 427 he states that Alianore died on 23 October 1405, while on p. 195 he states that she died on 6 or 18 October. She was buried in Bisham Priory, Bisham. Her descendants through her daughter, Anne, include the Yorkist Kings Edward IV and Richard III.

This woody aloe is indigenous to southern Africa. It is one of several Aloe species used to make bitter aloes, a purgative medication, and also yields a non-bitter gel that can be used in cosmetics. Description Typical inflorescence of the bitter aloe, with up to eight erect, cylindrical, symmetrical racemes. Spines on the inner side of a leaf Large bitter aloe in flower. Aloe ferox is a tall, single-stemmed aloe, that can grow to in height. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, arranged in rosettes, and have reddish-brown spines on the margins with smaller spines on the upper and lower surfaces. The leaf surfaces of young plants are covered in spines; however, as they get taller and less vulnerable to grazing, the leaves begin to lose most of their spines except for those along the leaf margins. Plants in the western part of its natural range tend to keep more of their leaf surface spines. Its flowers are a uniform orange or red, and stand between above the leaves, in multi-branched inflorescences. It is a variable species, and plants may differ physically from area to area, due to local conditions. This aloe is frequently confused with the related Aloe excelsa species, to the north, and they do look very similar when fully grown. However the flowers are different, with the racemes of Aloe excelsa being far shorter and slightly curved. Altogether, the bitter aloe can be distinguished from its closest relatives: by its more compact, erect leaves with 6mm reddish-brown teeth on the margins and also on the keel of the leaf near the leaf tip; by their erect candelabra inflorescences, which bear up to eight very dense, cylindrical, symmetrical, 50‚Äì80 cm racemes; and by their un-curved, tubular flowers with brown inner segment tips. Distribution and habitat Its large natural range forms a near-continuous band across the southern Cape, from Swellendam and the Overberg District in the west, throughout almost the whole extent of the Eastern Cape Province, eastwards as far as southern KwaZulu-Natal, and northwards into the southern parts of the Free State and Lesotho. Within this range it can usually be found in rocky areas - on hills, in grassy fynbos and on the edges of the Karoo. Cultivation Aloe ferox is known by several names - most commonly as the bitter aloe, but also as the Cape aloe, red aloe and tap aloe. Aloe ferox plants are propagated mainly from seed and head cuttings, with plants sowed with approximately one meter separations. From seed, it takes about 4 to 5 years for the plants to reach the first harvest. At the time of harvest, each leaf weighs about 1.5 kg to 2 kg. Aloe ferox prefers dry-tropical climates, open areas, sandy-loamy soils, full sun, and moderate watering with a good drainage system.

Stafford (May 7, 1915 ‚Äì June 16, 1995) was a commissioner and for a time chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and also served as a longtime congressional aide and Republican Party official. Stafford was born in Valley Falls, Kansas, where he was educated. After a brief stint in Kansas state government, he served in the U.S. Army during World War II, where he was wounded and decorated. After the war, he involved himself in Republican politics in Kansas. He became executive secretary to Governor Frank Carlson, and when the governor became a senator, followed him to Washington. After seventeen years as Carlson's administrative assistant, Stafford was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the ICC in 1967. President Richard Nixon reappointed him in 1970, and then appointed him chairman later that year. Stafford remained as chairman until 1977, and as commissioner until 1980, when President Jimmy Carter did not reappoint him, and he retired. Stafford was an opponent of the deregulation proposals of the transportation industries. This advocacy led President Gerald Ford to try to replace him as chairman, and eventually led to the end of his tenure on the I.C.C. After his retirement, Stafford lived in Bethesda, Maryland until his death from kidney failure in Washington, D.C., in 1995. Early life and career Stafford was born May 7, 1915 in Valley Falls, Kansas, where he grew up and graduated from high school. After high school, he attended a business college in Topeka, Kansas (fee for article) Stafford then served as deputy director of the Kansas Sales Tax Department from 1939-42. 50 After the U.S. entered World War II, Stafford joined the U.S. Army. He rose to the rank of captain, was severely wounded fighting in the Philippines and received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Political career Upon his return from his war service, Stafford became executive secretary to Kansas Governor Frank Carlson. Carlson was elected to the Senate in 1950, and took office later that year. Stafford accompanied him, and became Carlson's administrative assistant. Interstate Commerce Commission In 1967, President Johnson appointed Stafford to the ICC. He was elected vice-chairman in 1969. Since its 1887 founding, the ICC chairman had traditionally been a senior member of the Commission, elected by commissioners usually on a rotating basis. Due to a Nixon proposal, adopted as Reorganizational Plan No. 1, President Nixon became the first president to appoint an ICC chairman. After appointing Stafford to a new, ten-year term on the Commission, he appointed him as chairman as well. Stafford was a staunch opponent of deregulation. After the Ford Administration brought in proposals to deregulate the trucking, airline, and railroad industries, President Ford found himself balked due to opposition on the ICC, led by Stafford. With Congress unwilling to implement reform without ICC support, Ford sought to use his appointment power to change the composition of the ICC. He was able to replace two commissioners, but his appointment of Warren Rudman to replace Stafford as chairman was not acted upon by the Senate before it adjourned before the 1976 elections. President Carter also sought to replace Stafford, and his appointment of A. Daniel O'Neal met with Senate confirmation in 1977. Though Stafford was no longer chairman, he was still a commissioner. Carter was able to erode the anti-reform majority on the Commission by allowing terms to expire and not replacing or reappointing the commissioners. By 1979, there was a reform majority on the Commission, Carter finally named two pro-reform commissioners, and legislation was finally enacted. When Stafford's term expired in 1980, Carter did not reappoint him. Later life Having lived in the Washington area since 1950, Stafford retired to his home in Bethesda. He died of kidney failure at Sibley Memorial Hospital on June 16, 1995.

The company develops products such as IDL, ENVI and IAS which are used in a variety of industries, including remote sensing, engineering, geology, aerospace, defense and intelligence, and medical imaging. History When a group of scientists who developed the Mariner Mars space probes in 1977, David Stern, who was working at the University of Colorado developed a programming language called Mariner Mars Spectral Editor, which later evolved to IDL, Interactive Data Language, in order to supplement FORTRAN, specifically for data analysis and visualization at that time. As his vision developed, Stern left the university and started working in his attic to improve the programming language. He incorporated Research Systems Inc. (RSI) and released IDL as a proprietary programming language for visualizing data. NASA Goddard Space Center and Ball Aerospace were among the company's early customers. In 1994, the software package ENVI was released. Written in IDL, ENVI enhanced the text-based IDL and enabled a suite of graphical user interfaces specialized in remote sensing imagery analysis. RSI was acquired by Eastman Kodak as a wholly owned subsidiary in 2000. Four years later, RSI along with the Remote Sensing Systems division of Eastman Kodak, were sold to ITT Corporation and were renamed ITT Visual Information Solutions. In 2011, ITT Corporation was divided into three standalone companies, and ITT Visual Information Solutions became part of Exelis Inc. along with ITT Defense and Information Solutions. ITT Visual Information Solutions was renamed again to the current Exelis Visual Information Solutions. In 2015 Exelis Visual Information Solutions was purchased by the Harris Corporation, becoming Harris Geospatial Solutions.

However, amongst the Nordic Countries, it is by no means the weakest, as it is a more recent introduction to Finland, and has no presence in the other three nations. A major problem though, is the climate, which means that many pitches may be under snow for large parts of the year. Serious interest in the game began in the 1960s. For many years, Oslo RFC was the most northerly rugby club in the world.. Stavanger Rugby Club was formed in 1978 and played Oslo in the Autumn of that year, presenting Oslo with a trophy, a rockbit, in 1979, a return match was played in Stavanger; Oslo won both matches.. During the mid-1980s, Oslo RFC's nearest opposition in Norway was Stavanger, a round trip of 685 miles. Their nearest club was Karlstad RFC in Sweden a round trip of 310 miles. Rugby has a much longer standing in neighbouring Sweden and Denmark, which have a combined figure of around 10,000 registered players, and it has been introduced there. Rugby union is also played in neighbouring Shetland, and visitors from there have toured Norway, including people from the British military bases and ships there. Norway played its first international against Latvia who beat them 44-6. At the time, the Welsh fly- half Huw Howells was the driving force in trying to promote the game.

As with many other countries in Europe, the Second World War nearly finished off the game. Sweden was neutral in this conflict, meaning that the game did not suffer the war casualties that it did in other countries. By 1960, the number of active clubs had declined to fewer than ten. This was remedied in the 60s and 70s by an intensive development programme, which helped to bring that figure up to at least 55 clubs in the mid 90s. A persistent problem for Swedish rugby has been the climate, which means that many pitches may be under snow for large parts of the year. For this reason rugby is a summer sport in Sweden, the season running from late April to the middle of October. Notable players include: * Kari Tapper, a Number 8, who played for the Barbarians * Kanogo Njuru, an Outside centre, who played for the Barbarians. Club Rugby The Allsvenskan is the highest tier of the national rugby union competition in Sweden. The first Swedish championship took place in 1943 and the current champions (2016) is Stockholm Exiles. Under the Allsvenskan is two levels of regional competition. New for the 2010 season is a national rugby sevens series that will be played over multiple weekends. This initiative comes from the decision by the IOC to include rugby sevens in the Olympics.

Governing body Polish Rugby Union (Polski ZwiƒÖzek Rugby)http://pzrugby.pl/ was founded in 1957, and joined the International Rugby Football Board in 1988.Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p72 The official supplier of equipment to the PRU is the Polish company Gonga. An earlier Polish Rugby Union was set up in the early 1920s, but was disbanded in 1928. History In 1921, Louis Amblard, a Frenchman, set up the very first Polish rugby club called White Eagles (Bia≈Çe Or≈Çy). The first match was in 1922, and the first club international in 1924 against a Romanian side. The game became established in the Warsaw Military Academy in the early 1930s. The tragic events of World War II and the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact meant that the growth of Polish rugby was retarded until the 1950s. During World War II, there were occasional games between allied POWs in German camps in Poland.Cotton, p20 For example, a game was held between a Scottish and a Welsh XV, in ten inches of snow. No conversions were allowed, as the ball would have gone over the camp fence, and the game was twenty minutes each way. Players wore army boots, trousers, prison shirts and balaclavas. Polish rugby arguably achieved its greatest success in the late 1970s when the national team beat Italy, Spain and the USSR, and also held Romania to a 37‚Äì21 win in 1977. :\\"Much to everyone's surprise, Eastern Bloc countries are among the game's vigorous participants, seemingly oblivious to rugby's capitalist class-ridden origins. Russia emerged from behind the Iron Curtain and came under international scrutiny when they played France in Toulouse in November 1978. Rumania, Poland and Czechoslovakia are members of the Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur, the governing body for those countries not in the IB.\\"Hopkins, John (ed) Rugby (1979 ), p8 In 1983, Poland failed to play in the FIRA Championships, and told FIRA that two of their players had died.Cotton, p29 It is not known where the other died, but one had died near Bucharest. The Cold War frequently intruded ‚Äì for example in the 1984 FIRA Championships, in the game against France, Poland demanded the removal of the French players Didier Camberabero, Henri Sanz and the Brive RFC centre Yves Fouget, because as members of the French armed forces, they were considered to be a security risk. Because of high Polish emigration, particularly to France, and English speaking nations, the Polish team actually has a fairly large pool of potential players. In addition, a number of Poles returning from jobs in the British Isles and France, have carried the game back with them. There are currently three divisions in Poland. The second division was relaunched in 2009 using some of the major teams providing 2nd XVs, along with some newly formed sides. The top division has 8 teams while the second division has 6 teams. retrieved, 7 November 2009 Prior to that in 2008/2009 there were 10 teams in the top division and only 4 in the second. retrieved, 7 November 2009 This led to some very uneven contests between the top teams and those at the bottom of the league. There is now also a regional league played in the centre of Poland (around Lodz and Warsaw) in which some smaller clubs have entered teams and second teams from some of the top clubs nationally compete. Polish rugby development, however, has tended to concentrate on rugby sevens as a means of introducing the sport to people. retrieved, 7 November 2009 The PRU organises regular one day sevens tournaments over the spring/summer with teams travelling from all over the country.

The earliest recorded match in Switzerland was in 1869, and Lausanne RFC can claim to be as old as Blackheath. However, Swiss rugby continued at a very low key for over a hundred years. The World Wars and other global upheavals hindered the game, and it was really the presence of a number of ex-patriates working in the banking industry, or as tax exiles, who helped keep the game going. In 1974, a side from Basel toured France and were on the end of record breaking defeats. They lost 127-0 to Grenoble, 104-3 to Thonon and 116-0 to Annecy.Cotton, p47 The captain of the Basel team, Pierre Langlois said, \\"We conceded 73 tries, I think. We even had a penalty try given against us when we were losing by 100 points.\\"Cotton, p47 Swiss rugby continued in a haphazard manner during the 1970s and 80s, for example, when was due to play Bellinzona RFC in Italy, two of their players were delayed by a landslide.Cotton, p86 In order to make up numbers, a journalist and their coach driver were added to the squad. They did so well in the game that they were invited to subsequent training sessions.Cotton, p86 The Swiss Federation undertook an intensive development program in the 1980s, under Evelyne Oberson, and managed to gain a number of new native players.. Ms Oberson, working often alone in Lausanne as a volunteer, was in every way a key element to Swiss rugby as, through her high level of personal organisation and admin skills, for the most part managed the (then) small Federation almost single-handedly. She was essential to Swiss rugby holding together from the 80s until its current format. In 1989, Chris Thau claimed that Switzerland had around 1,000 players (a number which has increased somewhat since then).Thau, p75 There are at least thirty Swiss clubs at present. Swiss rugby is now dominated by home grown players, and for some the bright lights of French and Italian rugby might be a draw.

It has been claimed that it was being played even earlier by European sailors (as in Mainland China, and Japan). Unlike the PRC, rugby union has an unbroken history in Taiwan, but the Chinese Civil War and souring of relations with the mainland has meant it was effectively cut off. The game has a long presence in this part of Asia, especially Japan and Hong Kong. Rugby was also played in Shanghai at an early date, and is played to a high degree in South Korea. Right now, Taiwan is no. 4 in Asia, behind Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Not unlike South Korea, Taiwanese rugby has grown with the local economy, and has been tied up with corporate interests. Growing economic links with Japan, a major rugby playing nation, have helped the game in Taiwan from the 1960s to the present. Another thing that Taiwan has in common with South Korea is that it has always performed better at rugby sevens than the fifteen a side game. During the 70s and 80s, Taiwanese rugby underwent a big development programme, addressing issues such as the shortage of pitches. However, Taiwanese rugby is not short of other resources, and administrators such as Lin Chang Tang have been a great boon. Traditionally, Taiwan has suffered from a shortage of pitches. Taiwan is considered to be the fourth rugby nation of East Asia, after Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong respectively, although developments in the PRC and Malaysia may change that position. Notable Taiwanese players include - * Chae Wei-Che * Chang Chyi-Ming * Tseng Chi-Ming =The Chinese Question= Because Taiwan's relationship with the People's Republic of China is an incredibly complex one, it competes under the name Chung Hua Taipei or \\"Chinese Taipei\\", rather than as either Taiwan or the Republic of China. Because of political issues, with some commentators trying to work out how the entry of the PRC into international rugby would affect Taiwan's position. When the PRC joined the UN, it resulted in the expulsion of Taiwan.

This independent service area was capable of reacting more flexibly to market demand. The intention was for Lufthansa Consulting to offer services to the transportation industry in general. Based on this decision a cooperation with a railway company and other transportation and aviation companies were planned. In the 1990s with an increased market orientation the consulting portfolio was extended to include Air Traffic Control and infrastructure development services. The rising demand for services which included implementation caused a shift in the product development focus. Lufthansa Consulting established aviation restructuring and privatization services. During this period international projects included the privatization of Carrasco International Airport in Uruguay and the turnaround of Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n in Mexico and the restructuring of Philippine Airlines. From 2000 Lufthansa Consulting focused on management consultancy services for the aviation industry. Notable projects have included the restructuring of Air Madagascar, the development of Ouagadougou International Airport, flight operations and safety improvements at Petrobras and upgrading operational processes for Kenya Airways. As the market has become more competitive businesses have been finding it necessary to adopt new strategies and tools to remain viable.http://www.arabianaerospace.aero/article.php?section=technology&article;=new- consulting-dream-team-to-support-the-aviation-industry In 2012 Dr. Andreas Jahnke took over the position as Managing Director of Lufthansa Consulting. New management structures and reorganized responsibilities were established. The company focuses primarily on regional markets in Europe, Russia, CIS, Middle East, Asia, Africa and South America. Solution Groups focuses on operations, commercial, finance and \\"transformation topics\\". The new Inter- Branch services is active in non-aviation industries like transport and logistics companies, railways and bus line operators. Recent projects have included the restructuring of Saudia, the optimization of pricing and revenue management processes at EgyptAir and network planning for Estonian Air. An expansion plan for Air Astana and a master plan concept for the strategic development for Almaty International Airport were established. More projects have included a pricing and revenue check-up at SriLankan Airlines, the design of a cargo growth strategy for jetBlue and the development of an operations assessment to increase efficiency and productivity at Air Mauritius.

The Second World War interrupted the development of the sport, but its adoption by the Thai military and police ensured its survival. Thai rugby still has a strong ex-pat connection - one of the most famous players for Thailand is best known for being Will Carling's brother. The Southerners Sports Club (Bangkok), and the Old Bangkok Bangers Rugby Club are Thailand's main ex-pat rugby clubs, fielding sides in the local Thailand Rugby Union competition, and in local and international 7s and 10s tournaments.

The Zambia national rugby union team is currently ranked 67th by World Rugby.https://www.world.rugby/rankings/mru The Zambia Rugby Football Union has 9880 registered players and three formally organised clubs.IRB Zambia page retrieved 5 July 2009 The governing body is the Zambia Rugby Football Union, which was founded in 1965, and affiliated to the IRFB in 1995.Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) p79 History Not unlike other neighbouring African countries, Zambian rugby has been a legacy of British colonialism. Traditionally rugby in Zambia was seen as an expatriate sport, however, over the last 20 years it has become a truly Zambian sport with the majority of its players coming up through the schools and local club system. Fifteens (XVs) rugby in Zambia is played at a basic level compared to the major rugby playing nations. Zambia has over the last seven years built its own highly respected 7s tournament in the form of the Lusaka Mosi International Sevens. Past winners include the Springbok under-23s and the British Army. Zambia has beaten a number of South African Super 14 teams who have participated. It should be remembered that Northern Rhodesia played jointly with Southern Rhodesia as RHODESIA wearing the famous Green and White hooped jersey as their international strip. In 1924 a British side would played against the Rhodesias. On 14 July 1928, Rhodesia played in Bulawayo against New Zealand, losing 8 to 44. During their 1938 tour to South Africa, the British Lions played two matches against the Rhodesias. The first, taking place on 20 July saw the British win 25 to 11; three days later the British won again, 45 to 11; these matches were played in Salisbury and Bulawayo. The 1949 Rhodesian Rugby team, led by John Morkel, famously beat a touring All Blacks side led by Fred Allen in Bulawayo 10-8 on 27 July 1949. Three days later they drew with the mighty All Blacks in Salisbury 3-3. Thus the Rhodesias not only became and remain the only none test side country in the world to beat the All Blacks but also to be the only side in the world to be unbeaten in series rugby against them too. The Northern Rhodesians who played in the games were: flanker C Jones (Nchanga), scrum half W Viljoen (Copperbelt), Fly half E.U. Karg (Mufulira) and inside centre W.E. Brune (Mufulira) In 1960, New Zealand returned to play a match on 2 July at Glamis Park, with Rhodesia losing 14 to 29, though gave the All Blacks a scare yet again, with the game being tied 6 all by half time. The 1962 tour of South Africa by the British Lions had Rhodesia as the opening fixture on the tour. The opening game of the Lions tour saw the visitors win in Bulawayo, beating Rhodesia 38 to 9 on 26 May. The next tour, in 1962, the Lions won in Salisbury, beating the side 32 to 6. The famous Andy McDonald who played for the Springboks farmed just outside Livingstone. He once had shot at a lion which was attacking his cattle, but the lion turned on him and Andy fought against it bare fisted. The lion later pulled away and died of exhaustion! Colin Meades the All Blacks captain and known as a fearsome if not slightly unruly player said that McDonald was the strongest player he had ever played against, and for good reason. Other players from that era were Ronnie Hill and Des van Jaarsveld who started their rugby careers in Northern Rhodesia before moving south Van Jaarsveld went on to captain the Springboks just the once against Scoltand and became the first Springbok captain who could not speak a word of Afrikaans! Northern Rhodesia played against Southern Rhodesia in the Clarke Cup which Northern Rhodesia won more times than Southern Rhodesia. This was largely due to the number of excellent rugby players (Springboks amongst them) working on the Copperbelt at the time. The Northern Rhodesians played in a Royal Blue Jersey with two stripes (white and gold) whilst the Southerners played in Green with white trim. The Green/White hooped jersey was originally used by the joint Rhodesian side for international games.  National teams  Sevens rugby has become a strong point. The Zambia national rugby sevens team has beaten Italy and Canada, and came within 30 seconds of upsetting Australia, in the end narrowly losing 11-12. Zambia has appeared on the international stage, both at the South Africa Sevens and the Dubai Sevens. Zambia also competes in the Africa Cup. Club Competition Zambia has an active league that has recently been amended to consist of a Super 8 format with a second league comprising smaller clubs and second teams from the Super 8. The season runs from March to October and consists of a period of time for league matches, a break for sevens rugby. Most clubs start training in the middle of January ready for the season to begin in March. League matches are played up until the start of June when a break is taken to allow concentration on sevens events. During the months break there are a number of local 7s events including the Rhino Sevens in Ndola, the Mufulira Sevens (the first sevens tournament held in Zambia) and the Mosi Sevens in Lusaka. The league continues again in July and generally runs through to October when the knock out cup competition takes place. In Lusaka there are four active rugby clubs. Lusaka Rugby Club, Nkwazi rugby team , Green Buffaloes (the army team) and Red Arrows (the air force team) all play within Lusaka Showgrounds (see map on the Lusaka Rugby Club page) and both Lusaka Rugby Club and Red Arrows have an active club house with a number of facilities available for members and signed-in guests. On the Great North Road between Lusaka and the Copperbelt is the town of Kabwe, home of Green Eagles Rugby Club. In the Copperbelt, rugby is most popular, near or surpassing football. Towns all have their own rugby teams with a varying degree of facilities available at each club. Diggers Rugby Club in Kitwe has over the past few years been the most successful of the Copperbelt clubs and is the most active in terms of the number of players and of social activities happening at the club. They even have another team, Diggers B, active in the B-League. Nchanga Rugby Club are in Chingola, Roan Rugby Club are in Luanshya, Konkola Rugby Club is in Chilalabombwe and Mufulira popularly known as 'Reggae Boys', Ndola 'Killer Bees' and Chibuluma each have their own rugby club. Other teams are Kanshanshi in Solwezi, Prison Leopards in Kabwe while Kitwe Playing Fields and Chambeshi have clubs in their respective towns. The Roan Antelope Club in Luanshya formerly held the record for highest goal posts in the world, and were recognised by the Guinness Book of Records - they were 110 ft, 6 inches high.Cotton, p107 Youth Rugby is becoming increasingly popular with it being very active in schools such as Mpelembe Secondary School, Kitwe Boys, David Kaunda Technical School, Icengelo and Lechwe, both of the latter are Trust Schools. Two annual tournaments sponsored First Quantum Minerals (FQM) are hosted, one for Fifteens and the other for Sevens. Mpelembe and Icengelo have been the two most successful. Mpelembe went on to get sponsorship from mobile service providing giant, MTN, which was recently withdrawn.

The service is integrated into Stockholm's public transport system, as route 82, and accepts all the relevant tickets of Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL). It is operated on behalf of SL by Waxholmsbolaget and its sub-contractors, Djurg√•rdens F√§rjetrafik.

Operation From Skeppsholmen, ferry service is available upon request only Depending on the time of day and day of the week, the ferries operate three, four or six times per hour. Two ferries are normally required to operate services, with an extra ferry required for the six services per hour frequency. The service carries some 2.2 million passengers a year. Not all trips stop at Skeppsholmen, and a journey to or from there may require a passenger to travel via Slussen or Djurg√•rden. Skeppsholmen is a request stop and passengers wishing to disembark there must inform a crew member on boarding. Passengers wishing to join the ferry are required to summon the ferry by pressing a button at the stop. History Ferry traffic in Stockholm's harbour dates to the 18th century, when rowing boats were stationed at different locations. During the 19th century steam ferries took over traffic to be followed by modern motor-powered ferries. However road and rail routes increasingly took over, and the Djurg√•rden ferry is one of the few of the harbour ferries to have survived. Waxholmsbolaget took over the Djurg√•rden ferry in 1970. In 2014 the responsibility for the ferry service was transferred to Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL), and it was fully integrated into that body's ticketing system.

First unified coat of arms of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia, used from 1624 Josip Jelaƒçiƒá Royal Bans Standard, First tricolor standard with the unified coat of arms of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia used from 1848 until 1859 The Triune Kingdom () or Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia () was the concept‚Äîadvocated by the leaders of the 19th-century Croatian national revival‚Äîof a united kingdom between Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, which were already within the Austrian Empire under one king, who was also the Emperor of Austria, but were politically and administratively separate entities. This concept had roots in the high medieval period, as a successor to the historical Kingdom of Croatia which was made up of those regions. After 1867, Croatia and Slavonia were within the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary and were united in 1868 as the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, where the name Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia became official. However, Dalmatia, being located in the Austrian half, still remained de facto separate. Until the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, several Croatian political parties and groups sought recognition of the Triune Kingdom and the incorporation of Dalmatia into Croatia-Slavonia. The Croatian intelligentsia, especially lawyers and historians, played a key role in interpreting historical sources so as to legitimize the demand for the Triune Kingdom. History The unification among the three Kingdoms started gaining popularity in the 14th century and was originally used in the title of the Ban of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia in the medieval Croatian Kingdom. The first usage of the term Triune Kingdom was in 1527 by the Habsburgs, to make the title of the Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia seem grander, this can be seen in titles given to Krsto Frankopan, as well as other examples from 1527.Bojniƒçiƒá, Ivan, Armorial of the Kingdom of Slavonia, 1895, Zagreb, p-20 The Croatian Sabor was in 1681 officially named the Congregatio Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae Later In the 18th century, Maria Theresa founded the Royal Council for the Kingdom of Croatia, Dalmatia and Slavonia. However, only in the early 19th century, in parallel with the demands for the unification of the three Croatian Kingdoms and modern nation building, did the use of the name \\"Triune Kingdom\\" intensify. Prior to 1848, the Croatians had claimed territories which had been contested by both the Hungarians and the Vienna Court War Council within the Austrian Empire, and also by the Ottoman Empire. During the Revolutions of 1848, Croatian nationalists in the Sabor proposed the unification of the Triune Kingdom, which would be an autonomous Croatian cultural and political union within the Habsburg Empire. Political representatives of Croatia advocated the notion to the Emperor, and demanded the unification of the three Croatian kingdoms. During the revolutions, Dalmatia was temporarily under the control of Ban Josip Jelaƒçiƒá of Croatia. However, the Italian-speaking elite dominating the Diet of Dalmatia urged autonomy for the Kingdom as an Austrian crown land against the Croatian national revival movement's demand for a Triune Kingdom. Following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement of 1868, the Hungarian claims on Slavonia and the Austrian claims on the Military Frontier were formally relinquished. Croatia and Slavonia were unified into the autonomous Kingdom of Croatia- Slavonia. However, a unification with Dalmatia was denied and while Croatia- Slavonia was incorporated into the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen (Hungarian half), Dalmatia remained a crown land of the Cislethanian (Austrian) half of the Dual Monarchy. Croatia-Slavonia nevertheless formally called itself the \\"Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia\\", pressing its claims on Dalmatia. Sections of the Croatian-Hungarian Settlement of 1868 became contentious issues, as the Croatian version defined the territory of the \\"Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen\\" as \\"a state union of the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdoms of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia\\". The Hungarian version of the same settlement meanwhile, referred to it as Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia, withholding the word \\"Kingdom\\" and changing the order of the countries names. Documents issued by Austria put the order as \\"Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia\\", after instructions from Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust to distinguish Dalmatia from Croatia and Slavonia in order to empathize its membership of the Austrian half of the Empire. During the Croatian National Revival and the second half of the 19th century, Croatian intelligentsia, especially lawyers and historians, in the struggle for a united Triune Kingdom, were involved in interpreting historical sources seeking to legitimize and politically argue the full meaning of the name of the Triune Kingdom. By the end of the 19th century, recognition of the Triune Kingdom was the primary goal of the Independent People's Party,Charles Jelavich, Barbara Jelavich, The Establishment of the Balkan National States, 1804‚Äì1920, University of Washington Press, 1977, p. 253 as well as the People's Party of Dalmatia.Barbara Jelavich, History of the Balkans: Twentieth century, 1999 edition, p.57, \\"The National Party [in Dalmatia] wished to be united with Croatia to form the reconstituted Triune Kingdom.\\" In 1874, Ivan Kukuljeviƒá Sakcinski published various findings from archival collections‚Äîin his work Codex Diplomaticus,Kukuljevic-Sakcinski, Ivan von [Hrsg.]. ‚Äì Zagreb (1874), Codex diplomaticus regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae Codex diplomaticus regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae, Volumes 1‚Äì2, Tiskom D.

The Shared Values Initiative was a public relations campaign created by the U.S. State Department and directed by Charlotte Beers, a former Madison Avenue advertising executive, to persuade viewers to be more aware, open and accepting of America by dispelling myths about the treatment of Muslims.Fullerton, J. & Kendrick, A. (2006). Advertising's war on terrorism. Spokane, WA: Marquette Books. The propaganda campaign was launched soon after September 11, 2001 and was intended to sell a ‚Äúnew‚Äù America to Muslims around the world by showing that American Muslims were living happily and freely in America without persecution. Although initially thought to be a success by the U.S. Government and Charlotte Beers‚Äô team, the $15 million initiative was regarded as a failure.  Phases of the Shared Values Initiative  The campaign was divided in phases; the first of which consisted of five mini- documentaries for television, radio, and print with shared values messages for key Muslim countries. The videos feature ‚ÄúReal Muslim Americans,‚Äù participating in their daily activities. $5 million of commercial airtime was purchased with the consent of the government in carefully considered Middle Eastern and Asian countries during Ramadan. Other phases of the Shared Values Initiative included speaking tours throughout Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan, and Indonesia. Although speaking tours were allowed in these countries, government-run television channels in Egypt, Lebanon, and Jordan refused to run the ads. The campaign also created a promotional website, www.opendialogue.com, that claimed to feature genuine thoughts and stories from Muslim Americans living as immigrants. The website encouraged users to share their own stories with an entry form, although it appears no user- generated stories were ever shared.  CAMU (Council of American Muslims for Understanding)  Each video in the Shared Values Initiative ended with the tag line ‚ÄúPresented by the Council of American Muslims for Understanding‚Ä¶ and the American people,‚Äù however, very few Americans knew anything about the campaign: CAMU was a ‚Äúthird party authenticity‚Äù‚Äîa public relations front group funded by the U.S. State Department specifically for this initiative. It was created in April 2002 by Malik Hasan, chairman of CAMU, who admits that the idea came from the State Department.  Failure of the Shared Values Initiative  The campaign's failure can be attributed to many different factors. In \\"The semantics and ethics of propaganda\\" Jay Black argues that the Shared Values Initiative was a failure because ‚Äúpersuasive media that [is] propagandistic [‚Ä¶] would seem to be less likely to attract and convince open- minded media consumer than to reinforce the biases of the closed-minded true believers.‚Äù The campaign's strategies were unsuccessful first and foremost due to an unreceptive audience. Christopher Simpson attributed the campaign's failure to Beers' lack of PR experience: \\"selling a product is simply not the same as promoting a belief.\\" Beers was an advertising executive before working in Public Relations, and thus had little experience dealing with changing fundamental beliefs. Others simply said that because the Shared Values Initiative was the first of its kind, it ‚Äúfailed‚Äù because there were no past efforts with which to compare it, or measure its success. Jami Fullerton and Alice Kendrick conducted a study to evaluate the changed perceptions of viewers after watching videos from the SVI campaign, and subsequently determine the success of the SVI campaign. The sample was more than 500 non American college students, only 5.8% of whom were Muslim. The second sample was taken with 17% of those interviewed being Muslim. The data reported that after watching the videos, those interviewed were more likely to think that Muslims in America were treated fairly and able to live their lives how they want. Students also had more positive attitudes toward the U.S. government and its people.  Charlotte Beers' resignation  Less than a month after the release of the Shared Values Initiative, the State Department abruptly discontinued it. Two weeks before the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Charlotte Beers resigned. Inside Magazine commented thus: ‚ÄúShe couldn‚Äôt do for Uncle Sam‚Äôs what she did for Uncle Ben's rice and so, after just 17 months on the job, and on the eve of war, the advertising whiz who became undersecretary of state for public diplomacy has quit, reportedly for health reasons‚Ä¶‚Äù  References  Category:Political campaigns Category:Propaganda in the United States ","title":"Shared Values Initiative"},{"id":"22800277","text":"Baykal () is a village in Bolotninsky District of Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia.

It was written by Elizabeth Hall, wife of Island of the Blue Dolphins author, Scott O'Dell. Plot Granite is born on a snowy April day in Alaska. For the first weeks of his life, he lives in the kennels, playing with his siblings Digger, Cricket, and Nugget. Even though their mother Seppala gets sick, life is good there. His owners, Tim and Kate, take good care of him. Granite differs from the other pups. He is not eager to train to be a sled dog. One day, when the pups are ten-weeks-old, a man shows up to buy Granite and his sister Cricket. Even though Cricket is bought and does not mind going to a new home, Granite does not want to leave his mother and runs away from where he grew up. He runs away into the Alaskan wilderness. After days wandering alone, hungry and injured, the Siberian husky puppy meets a wolf pack, led by a black wolf named Ebony and his mate, Snowdrift the white wolf, whose pups were kidnapped weeks before. She takes Granite in. Snowdrift raises the dog as a foster son and teaches him to hunt mice. That seems to help her get over some pain in losing her pups. It is mentioned that her pups were stolen by humans who wanted to breed young wolves to huskies, for wolfdogs are worth a lot of money. Even though he protects Granite, Ebony does not like him, and neither do Strider (Ebony's brother, Granite's chief tormentor), Roamer (Ebony and Snowdrift's two-year-old son), and Breeze (a female wolf who came to them from a pack in the west). The other wolf who likes Granite is Snowdrift's yearling son, Climber. Granite and Climber become fast friends. Granite is less afraid of Climber because the young wolf had a \\"husky face\\", and Climber was pleased to have a younger member (so his rank rises) regardless of Granite being a dog. Another reason the pair play together is that Climber is still young, and was a pup not a long time ago. Ebony pretends the dog is not there, and Breeze feeds Granite only to humor Ebony. Roamer and Strider feed him just to show Snowdrift. When she is not there, they take back what they fed Granite. Strider, later on, pretends to give Granite a lesson and lures the young dog into attacking a porcupine. Granite got tricked and a face full of quills. Granite hopes to please Ebony by trying to catch a fox but nearly loses his life. He nearly runs into a trap, but Breeze stops him just in time. He is, again, scorned by the others for his lousiness. However, later on, Climber is killed during a moose hunt, and Granite must try to earn his place in the pack, while dodging Roamer and Strider and other dangers of the Alaskan wilderness. Granite then runs away, overwhelmed by the torments from Roamer and Strider. Granite proves to be no longer a puppy who cannot fill his own stomach. He does fine save for the dark cloud of loneliness that grows bigger each day. He meets another pack of wolves when he intrudes into their territory. They welcome the dog with slashing teeth. Granite returns to Ebony's country, and the black wolf, though angry, lets him rejoin the pack. Meanwhile, Snowdrift attempts to search for her lost pups but is shot by hunters. The rest of the pack finds her, though she is blind and wounded. While Snowdrift recovers, Breeze is almost kind to the dog and teaches him how to hunt salmon. In the fall, Granite kills a marmot, but Roamer tries to take it away. Granite fights the young black wolf and wins, and Roamer dares not to challenge him again. In the end, Granite saves Snowdrift's life. Ebony lets the dog hunt alongside him, making Granite's dream come true. Even Strider is friendly and no longer challenges the dog. Granite, now more than two years old, realizes that he is home. Characters *Granite: The protagonist. As a puppy, he was bought along with his sister by a strange man, but had escaped and fled into the Alaskan wilderness. He was adopted by a bereaved Snowdrift and welcomed with great reluctance into the pack by the other wolves. *Digger, Nugget, and Cricket: Granite's younger siblings. Digger is the biggest puppy in the litter, and a close playmate of Granite's. Unlike his mother and siblings, he is black instead of gray. In the fifth chapter, Tim had stated that he was going to be kept while the others were sold. Nugget is the runt of the litter and not one for fighting, choosing instead to play with a water pan instead of with a coil of rope. Cricket is the only female pup in Seppala's litter who was purchased by the stranger in the fifth chapter. *Seppala: Granite's mother. Early in the book, she became sick, but by the end of the fourth chapter, she has gotten well. She is last seen comforting Granite before he is sold to a strange man. *Tim and Kate: The couple who owns Seppala and several other huskies. At the start of the fifth chapter, Tim was mistakenly called \\"Tom.\\" *Snowdrift: A white wolf; Ebony's mate and the alpha female of the wolf pack Granite joins. She is the mother of Roamer, Climber, and five wolf pups who were kidnapped by two men seeking for wolves to breed with dogs. During a search for her pups when Granite is older, Snowdrift is blinded by a hunter shooting from a plane. *Ebony: A black wolf; the alpha male of the wolf pack Granite joins. *Strider: Described as a large gray wolf with a white chest, Strider is Ebony's brother and Granite's chief tormentor. He is also the oldest son. *Roamer: Ebony and Snowdrift's son. Like Strider, Roamer also tormented Granite, but the dog eventually stood up to him, and he never bothered him again. *Climber: A yearling wolf and the second son of Snowdrift and Ebony. He was the only other wolf aside from Snowdrift who was kind to Granite. He was killed during a moose hunt.

Cucurbitacin is any of a class of biochemical compounds that some plants ‚Äî notably members of the pumpkin and gourd family, Cucurbitaceae ‚Äî produce and which function as a defence against herbivores. Cucurbitacins are chemically classified as triterpenes, formally derived from cucurbitane, a triterpene hydrocarbon ‚Äì specifically, from the unsaturated variant cucurbit-5-ene, or 19(10‚Üí9Œ≤)-abeo-10Œ±-lanost-5-ene. They often occur as glycosides. They and their derivatives have been found in many plant families (including Brassicaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Begoniaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Datiscaceae, Desfontainiaceae, Polemoniaceae, Primulaceae, Rubiaceae, Sterculiaceae, Rosaceae, and Thymelaeaceae), in some mushrooms (including Russula and Hebeloma) and even in some marine mollusks. Cucurbitacins may be a taste deterrent in plants foraged by some animals and in some edible plants preferred by humans, like cucumbers and zucchinis. In laboratory research, cucurbitacins have cytotoxic properties and are under study for their potential biological activities.  Biosynthesis  The biosynthesis of cucurbitacin C has been described. Zhang et al. (2014) identified nine cucumber genes in the pathway for biosynthesis of cucurbitacin C and elucidated four catalytic steps. These authors also discovered the transcription factors Bl (Bitter leaf) and Bt (Bitter fruit) that regulate this pathway in leaves and fruits, respectively. The Bi gene confers bitterness to the entire plant and is genetically associated with an operon- like gene cluster, similar to the gene cluster involved in thalianol biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Fruit bitterness requires both Bi and the dominant Bt (Bitter fruit) gene. Nonbitterness of cultivated cucumber fruit is conferred by bt, an allele selected during domestication. Bi is a member of the oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) gene family. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Bi is the ortholog of cucurbitadienol synthase gene CPQ in squash (Cucurbita pepo)  Variants  The cucurbitacins include: = Cucurbitacin A = Cucurbitacin A * Cucurbitacin A found in some species of Cucumis ** Pentanorcucurbitacin A, or 22-hydroxy-23,24,25,26,27-pentanorcucurbit-5-en-3-one , white powder =Cucurbitacin B= Cucurbitacin B * Cucurbitacin B from Hemsleya endecaphylla (62 mg/72 g) and other plants (e.g. Cucurbita andreana); anti- inflammatory, any-hepatotoxic ** Cucurbitacin B 2-O-glucoside, from Begonia heracleifolia ** 23,24-Dihydrocucurbitacin B from Hemsleya endecaphylla, 49 mg/72 g ** 23,24-Dihydrocucurbitacin B 2-O-glucoside from roots of Picrorhiza kurrooa ** Deacetoxycucurbitacin B 2-O-glucoside from roots of Picrorhiza kurrooa ** Isocucurbitacin B, from Echinocystis fabacea ** 23,24-Dihydroisocucurbitacin B 3-glucoside from Wilbrandia ebracteata ** 23,24-Dihydro-3-epi-isocucurbitacin B, from Bryonia verrucosa ** Pentanorcucurbitacin B or 3,7-dioxo-23,24,25,26,27-pentanorcucurbit-5-en-22-oic acid, , white powder =Cucurbitacin C= * Cucurbitacin C, from Cucumis sativus (Cucumber) =Cucurbitacin D= Cucurbitacin D * Cucurbitacin D, from Trichosanthes kirilowii and many other plants (e.g. Cucurbita andreana) ** 3-Epi- isocucurbitacin D, from species of Physocarpus and Phormium tenax ** 22-Deoxocucurbitacin D from Hemsleya endecaphylla, 14 mg/72 g ** 23,24-Dihydrocucurbitacin D from Trichosanthes kirilowii also from H. endecaphylla, 80 mg/72 g ** 23,24-Dihydro-epi-isocucurbitacin D, from Acanthosicyos horridus ** 22-Deoxocucurbitacin D from Wilbrandia ebracteata ** Anhydro-22-deoxo-3-epi-isocucurbitacin D from Ecballium elaterium ** 25-O-Acetyl-2-deoxycucurbitacin D (amarinin) from Luffa amara ** 2-Deoxycucurbitacin D, from Sloanea zuliaensis =Cucurbitacin E= * Cucurbitacin E (Œ±-Elaterin), from roots of Wilbrandia ebracteata.

Occurrence and bitter taste Ecballium elaterium, also called the squirting cucumber or exploding cucumber containing cucurbitacin B Constituents of the colocynth fruit and leaves (Citrullus colocynthis) include cucurbitacins. The 2-O-Œ≤-D-glucopyranosides of cucurbitacins K and L can be extracted with ethanol from fruits of Cucurbita pepo cv dayangua. Pentanorcucurbitacins A and B can be extracted with methanol from the stems of Momordica charantia. Cucurbitacins B and I, and derivatives of cucurbitacins B, D and E, can be extracted with methanol from dried tubers of Hemsleya endecaphylla. Cucurbitacins impart a bitter taste in plant foods such as cucumber, zucchini, melon and pumpkin. Research and toxicity Cucurbitacins are under basic research for their biological properties, including toxicity and potential pharmacological uses in development of drugs for inflammation, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, among others. The toxicity associated with consumption of foods high in cucurbitacins is sometimes referred to as \\"toxic squash syndrome\\". In France in 2018, two women who ate soup made from bitter pumpkins became sick, involving nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and had hair loss weeks later. Another French study of poisoning from bitter squash consumption found similar acute illnesses and no deaths. The high concentration of toxin in the plants could result from cross-pollination with wild cucurbitaceae species, or from plant growth stress due to high temperature and drought.

CareerMinistox= Tandy started his racing career unusually in short oval Ministox machinery in 1994. However, by the end of 1998, Tandy had won 45 races, with 60 other podium placings as he became both British and World Ministox champion, as well as being a three-time East Anglian Ministox champion. He continued in this level of motorsport in 1999, winning another 28 races to become British champion for the second time. =Mini Sevens= After a year off in 2000, Tandy took up circuit racing by moving into the Mini Seven Challenge in 2001. He competed in four seasons in the championship, picking up ten podiums, including three wins, all coming in 2004. He also won the Walter Hayes Memorial Trophy towards the end of the season. He also forayed into the TVR Tuscan Challenge by the end of 2004. =Formula Palmer Audi= After finishing college and completing an engineering apprenticeship, Tandy began working as a technician for Jonathan Palmer's Palmersport corporate driving days concern. His engineering acumen elevated him to chief mechanic by the age of 22, while his racing career continued to go from strength to strength. This allowed him to test a Formula Palmer Audi car at Palmer's Bedford Autodrome, where he set a new lap record of 1:04.2 for the 1.8-mile West Circuit, breaking Justin Wilson's long established record from 1998. This gave him an incentive to sell his 70 bhp Mini and move up into the 350 bhp single-seaters. Tandy had an impressive season in the championship, eventually winning the title on countback ahead of David Epton. Tandy and Epton had both finished on 284 points, but Tandy won the title thanks to six wins compared to Epton's four. This championship- winning campaign earned him one of the six nominations for the McLaren Autosport BRDC Award. =Joe Tandy Racing= Tandy's racing career somewhat stalled after that, before creating Joe Tandy Racing in mid-2006. Brother Nick had been struggling with his Ray car lacking upgrades, but Joe decided to buy a similar chassis and run Nick for the rest of the campaign. The success was immediate, as Nick won first time out at Thruxton, and added another win at the championship finale at Castle Combe, as he finished runner-up in the championship standings. An on-the-road win at the 2006 Formula Ford Festival would have capped an amazing year for JTR, however Nick was penalised for a safety car misdemeanour, dropping him to fifth. The Tandys then expanded the team to three cars in 2007, with Nick, Freddie Hunt (son of Formula One world champion James Hunt) and Daniel Murray driving the Ray machines. Nick won six races en route to third in the championship, twelve points behind runner-up James Nash. After their Formula Ford Festival win was taken away the year before, Nick won the race in 2007, after Callum MacLeod was given a two-second time penalty for braking severely while leading under the safety car. To aid with his brother's rise through the motorsport ranks, Joe bought a Mygale Formula Three chassis for a campaign in the British Formula Three Championship. He also moved his Formula Ford team onto the French company's chassis. Tandy managed to turn the Mygale into a regular frontrunner, railing against the established Dallara hordes with a small operation and a meagre budget. Despite missing the rounds in Bucharest, Nick managed to finish ninth overall in the championship, with three podiums coming at Spa, Silverstone and Donington. In Formula Ford, despite not achieving any wins, Matt Hamilton finished as JTR's best driver with sixth overall. 2009 saw new chassis again for both the Formula Three team and the Formula Ford team, as JTR became the de facto lead team for Mygale in both series, as Ultimate Motorsport pulled out of Formula Three before the start of the 2009 season. Nick started in fine form with a double podium at the season-opening rounds at Oulton Park, and just eighteen days after his brother's death, took the team's first win at Rockingham. Meanwhile, in Formula Fords, Josef Newgarden and Liroy Stuart were signed to campaign the cars, with Newgarden winning the third round of the championship, again at Oulton Park. The team will continue running, in spite of Tandy's death. Death Tandy was travelling with his fianc√©e Sophie Temple's brother, Luke Temple, in his BMW 5 Series towards Bedford, when a collision between the BMW and a box van occurred at around 12:25 local time, at the junction of the A428 and the A5134 roads just outside Bromham. Tandy died at the scene, while Temple was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where he later died due to serious head injuries sustained in the crash. The van driver suffered minor injuries in the accident. The van driver was cleared of all charges at court and it was found that Tandy had been driving a car with a faulty braking system at nearly twice the speed limit for that stretch of road, while nearly two times over the drink drive limit. Tandy's former boss Jonathan Palmer described him as \\"an extraordinary person who had achieved an enormous amount in his tragically short life. I have no doubt he was destined to go on to do increasingly great things in motorsport and could quite likely have been running one of the leading Formula One teams in the years ahead.\\" SRO, which runs the British Formula Three Championship and also the British GT Championship also released a statement describing Tandy as \\"an extremely popular guy and the paddock will be a poorer place without him and his great sense of humour. He was a credit to his family, his team and to motorsport in general and they have all lost a very fine young man.\\" Sam Roach, director of the British Formula Ford Championship, added: \\"Joe was a talented, winning racer himself before he started JTR, and his enthusiasm and passion for the sport shone through everything he did.

A combined school, St Catherine's consists of a pre-school,a preparatory school and a senior school and is the oldest school in Germiston. History The front of St. Catherine's School The Quad at St Catherine's School St Catherine's School was founded in 1908 by the Dominican Sisters of St. Catherine of Siena, Newcastle, Natal in order to meet the increasing demand for education in the then 22-year old mining town of Germiston (a product of the Witwatersrand Gold Rush of the late 1880s). The original school building was located on Hardach Street in central Germiston, and was built on land bought from the Simmer and Jack gold mining company. It was the first convent on the East Rand and the first high school in Germiston. By the 1940s, the school's environs in the Germiston CBD were undergoing rapid industrialisation, concurrent with a general shift from north to south of much of Germiston's population, and in 1948 St Catherine's School relocated to the then newly developed suburb of Parkhill Gardens. Here there was also more space for sporting facilities. Toward the end of 1968 the school decided, in conjunction with its sister school St Dominic's in Boksburg, to cater for primary school pupils only: girls up to standard 5 (grade 7) and boys up to standard 1 (grade 3). Additionally, in 1970 the Transvaal Education Department recognised and registered the St Catherine's pre-primary school. The first reported ghost sighting at St Catherine's occurred on 17 August 1972, when a janitor cleaning the school hall after hours claimed to have been chased into the quad by an amorphous grey apparition or \\"spook\\" with \\"glowing red eyes\\". From the beginning of 1977, a wave of sightings followed of a \\"grey, hooded figure swaddled in flowing robes\\", often accompanied by a \\"'wailing' sound\\". The 'ghost', said to haunt the school hall, the chapel, the basement and a number of classrooms in the eastern wing, was soon dubbed 'Patrick', after one of the school's houses, St Patrick's. After 1977, ghost sightings at St Catherine's mostly ceased, although stories of paranormal happenings at the school persist to the present. In 1985, the school extended its education of boys to standard 5 again. This was followed in 1991 by the Sisters of St Catherine's moving into a private house, opening up more room in the school for classrooms. In 2001 the Board of Governors approved the re-opening of the high school, and that year saw the first intake of grade 8 pupils since 1968. At the same time the school buildings were expanded, with the construction of a new wing that was completed and fully occupied by 2007. Mrs J. Crosby, formerly of Boksburg High School, stepped in as high school principal in June 2007. In 2008 the school celebrated its centenary with a centennial mass, held under a marquee on the main soccer field which was attended by more than 800 pupils, parents, staff, past pupils and past teachers. In December 2015, Mrs V. Johnson took charge as the Head of School to focus on whole school development. The new Preparatory School Principal, Mrs S. Rodrigues, began her term in January 2016. With the retirement of the Pre-school Principal, Mrs T. Henry (who served the school for 35 years) the new Pre-school Principal, Mrs C. Stewart, began her term in January 2016. In May 2016, the Head of School, Mrs Johnson, announced that she would be retiring in December of the same year. She was succeeded by Mr Dennis Maritz in January 2017 as Head of School.Mr. Maritz has extensive experience in independent education. He was the Founding Head of Uplands College in White River and also served as Headmaster of St Martin's School in Johannesburg.He held the post of Headmaster of Cornwall Hill College in Pretoria prior to joining St Catherine's School as Head of School. The primary school is now known as the preparatory school and the high school is now known as the senior school. Concurrent with this restructuring, an expansion programme has been undertaken which has seen a marked increase in enrolment. St. Catherine's entered a new phase of its development in 2019 with the construction of the Aelred O'Donovan wing which was completed at the end of 2018. The wing consists of six state-of-the-art classrooms which were built to accommodate pupils in Grades one and two. The need for the wing became apparent in 2018 with the growth in enrolment which the school was experiencing. The wing bears the name of Sister Aelred O'Donovan who was the last Newcastle Dominican Sister to hold the post of Head of School.

Activities may differ between school grades and phases. Sports St Catherine's senior school athletes warm up ahead of an inter-school competition. St Catherine's pupils also participate in a wide variety of sports. Sports at the school include soccer, cricket, tennis, netball, athletics and swimming. There are both male and female soccer teams representing the school with the girls' soccer team being a new addition, nicknamed the 'Saint's Soccer Team'. St Catherine's has also, since 2007, been competing in the Germiston inter-high swimming gala, where it has been somewhat successful.

The company services customers in the energy services sector including production, transmission and storage, refining, power generation, petrochemical, pulp and paper, and mining industries. John Crane is the largest division of Smiths Group plc, a global technology business listed on the London Stock Exchange. John Crane has end-user customers in process industries, including large oil companies, national oil companies (NOCs), and refiners. The company also serves original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers engaged in the design and manufacture of pumps and turbines. John Crane also provides artificial lift products and services for the upstream oil and gas industry.  History  Old John Crane Headquarters John Crane was founded in 1917 as Crane Packing Company. Before founding his company, engineer John Crane patented a flexible, lubricated metallic packing (#956,042) in 1910. John Crane In 1915, Crane patented the manufacturing method for flexible metallic packing (#1,151,344). He discovered that wrapping his flax packing in metallic foil increased its longevity and kept the cylinders‚Äô surface smooth and uniform. Frank Payne, a sales representative for the Warren Packing Company, recognized the potential of Crane‚Äôs innovation., John Crane History Crane Packing Company initially manufactured packing and gasketing, which is still offered today. Prior to World War II, Crane Packing sold its England-based operations to Tube Investments, known today as TI Group PLC. Condenser Tube Packing was introduced in 1922 and in 1928, Metallic water pump packing were used on Chevrolet and Ford cars. An estimated 25 million motors were using Crane Packing materials by the mid-1930s. By 1938, all Chrysler cars used Crane Packing mechanical seals John Crane on their water pumps . Ethanol Producer In 1939, the company invented the first automotive mechanical seal. Pumps & Systems In the early 1940s, John Crane developed and introduced patented end face shaft seals and an elastomer bellows seal. The U.S. Navy relied on packing solutions from Crane Packing for a host of applications, including expansion joints, stern tube service, cargo pumps, rotary steam and air compressors, water-tight closures, metallic condenser packing and pipe fittings. In recognition for its service, Crane Packing received a U.S. Navy ‚ÄúE‚Äù Award. From the years 1941 to 1949, Crane Packing applied for and received 24 patents, the majority of which were for mechanical seals Pumps & Systems designed to handle high-pressure and corrosive applications. In 1948, Crane Packing developed its own seal face lapping machines and processes, which evolved into Crane Packing‚Äôs Lapmaster division. Another advancement of sealing and packing technology during this period was the commercial availability of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), marketed by its creator DuPont as Teflon. Crane Packing introduced its ‚ÄúCHEMLON‚Äù line of Teflon-based packing material for use on pumps, valves, hydraulic fittings and cylinders, coaxial cables, and gaskets in 1948. Old John Crane Advertisement In 1950, Crane Packing purchased of land in Morton Grove, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Construction began on the new company offices the next year and continued until the main office, laboratory, and cafeteria were completed in 1956. John Crane‚Äôs Morton Grove facility comprises five manufacturing buildings totaling . In the 1980s, John Crane introduced the Type 28 non- contacting, gas lubricated gas seal,\\\\- another breakthrough in sealing technology.In 1987, through a series of acquisitions and divestitures, the company in the United States and the company in the United Kingdom were reunited, this time under the name John Crane. Beginning in the 1990s, John Crane applied non-contacting technology to pumps handling liquids that are hazardous to the environment. Applying this technology to a standard American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or American Petroleum Institute (API) pump allows users to meet or exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) stringent regulations for hazardous emissions. In 2007, the company acquired CDI Energy Services, CDI Oilfield Services, Fiberod and Global Energy Products. This branch of the company specializes in artificial lift equipment and services for upstream oil and gas production. In a reorganization of John Crane's parent firm, Smiths Group, the artificial lift business was divested in 2016. John Crane still offers the mechanical packing and gasket products upon which the Crane Packing Company built its success. Each year, the company manufactures some 238,900 miles of braided packing- almost enough to reach the moon- along with flat gaskets and live-load packing for valves. LitigationAsbestos= John Crane Group filed lawsuits against Simon Greenstone Panatier and Shein Law Center in 2016 in federal court in Illinois. The suit alleged that Shein withheld evidence in violation of the RICO Act in cases brought against John Crane by sufferers of mesothelioma. Specifically, the suits allege that the law firms failed to disclose during discovery that their clients had been exposed to products containing asbestos made by other companies and intentionally delayed filing claims against those companies' bankruptcy trusts. John Crane said that it would have avoided judgements and \\"substantial defense costs\\" if it had known this information.

Charlotte Blake Brown (1846 ‚Äì April 19, 1904) was an American physician. She was one of the first female doctors to practice on the West Coast of the United States and was a co-founder of the San Francisco Hospital for Children and Training School for Nurses. Biography Charlotte Amanda Blake was born in Philadelphia, in 1846. Both her parents were from Brewer, Maine, and Charlotte was subsequently sent to attend high school in Bangor, Maine while living with relatives. After that she entered Elmira College in New York, graduating in 1866. She married Henry Adams Brown, and in 1872 attended the Women's Medical College of Philadelphia, graduating with an MD in 1874. She moved to San Francisco the following year and founded the Pacific Dispensary for Women and Children with Dr. Martha Bucknell. A third female physician, Dr. Sara E. Brown, subsequently joined them, and the institution was re-organized as the San Francisco Hospital for Children in 1878. Brown had lived in California once before. Her father went to San Francisco at the height of the California Gold Rush in 1849, and the family joined him in 1851. In 1854 they moved to Chile, where her father (a Presbyterian minister) ran a mission for Scottish miners until 1854, when they returned to Philadelphia. Brown's first application to join the San Francisco Medical Society was rejected on account of her gender. In 1876, however, she was one of four women admitted into the California Medical Society, causing the San Francisco physicians to re- consider and grant her membership two years later. In 1880, Brown and her colleagues organized within their hospital the first nurses' training school on the West Coast. Brown wrote 18 articles for medical journals in addition to carrying on a busy practice and raised three children, two of whom also became physicians.

With increased Internet access, word-of-mouth promotion and the acceptance of the Dutch political parties, Stemwijzer (stem means vote and wijzer has two meanings: wiser and indicator) has become a tradition in Dutch elections, but is controversial. Famously the current first minister Mark Rutte got an advice to vote for D66 after filling in the questionnaire and not his own party VVD. He has since refused to participate in any activities with Stemwijzer or to endorse it. Several alternatives have been launched to cater to special interests. Recently, 1 in 5 of the electorate used Stemwijzer to learn about the elections and help make up their minds whom to vote for. Using the Stemwijzer does not seem to have much influence on the voting behaviour. = London elections = Vote Match London 2008 LogoUnlock Democracy developed the first UK Vote Match for the 2008 London Mayoral and assembly elections. Covering all of the candidates for Mayor of London, it was used by 50,000 people. Most national newspapers carried stories about it, and several civic organisations promoted it to their members, but the main marketing tool was peer to peer. Many bloggers linked to the site, and a lot of traffic came from users emailing the link to friends and family. = European elections = The UK Vote Match project was extended nationwide for the 2009 European elections. It covers all the main parties across the UK, and advises people about the parties standing in their area. It was launched on 11 May by Stephen Fry, and has received media coverage on Newsnight and the BBC news website. The UK European Vote Match was developed as part of a wider EU project for the 2009 European Elections in which 11 member states participated.  How it works  The website is 30 policy statements relating to EU issues. The user enters which region they live in and then goes through the statements in turn, answering ‚Äúagree‚Äù ‚Äúdisagree‚Äù or ‚Äúneutral‚Äù. After responding to each statement, they then have the chance to say which policy areas are particularly important to them and which ones are not so important. Finally, they are able to select which parties they would consider voting for (all are automatically selected). The results screen ranks the political parties in order of which was the closest match to the user‚Äôs answers. It also provides a breakdown of where all the parties stand on each statement, along with links to the party‚Äôs website and other websites where the issues are debated in detail.  How it is developed  The British version was developed by Unlock Democracy and was modelled closely on the Dutch system, with the parties themselves answering the questions and the most controversial statements being chosen for the final application. Vote Match is developed in several stages. Firstly workshops with political party members, academics and members of civic groups were held to brainstorm ideas of issues relevant to the European elections. The next step was to turn these ideas into viable statements for inclusion on a long list. Careful attention is paid to the wording of the statements so that they are not leading, not full of jargon, and completely unbiased. This left a long list of about 100 statements. These statements are then sent out to the political parties, who respond to the statements in line with party policy. One all the parties have completed this it is possible to see which are the most controversial between all of the parties. The long list is then cut down to the 20-40 most controversial statements which form the quiz.

Early life Edmonson was born on September 23, 1932 in Long Beach, California, but grew up in Nogales, Arizona, just across the border from Mexico. At the age of 5, he briefly played the role of Curley on the Our Gang comedy short-film series. Edmonson began his singing career at age seven a member of the St. Andrew's Episcopal Church choir, where he sang with his three older brothers. He attended Tucson High School where he further developed as a singer and learned to play the guitar. After high school, Edmonson attended the University of Arizona, where he studied anthropology. Edmonson took a strong interest in Native American tribes, including the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, helping to produce a Spanish-Yaqui dictionary. As a result, in 1948, the tribe made him an honorary member. Travis studied other native communities, and even lived on an Apache reservation. Music career Edmonson did not graduate from the University of Arizona, but he \\"became locally famous for serenading college girls\\" and met first his wife while studying there. In the early 1950s, Edmonson served in the United States Army, before beginning his musical career in San Francisco. After singing solo, he joined a quartet, the Gateway Singers with Louis Gottlieb. In 1958, he left the Gateway Singers to form Bud & Travis along with Bud Dashiell, a friend of his brother. The two released 11 singles and eight albums from 1958 to 1965 and became quite popular, appearing at many nightclubs and on television, including a guest appearance on the show The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. The two played folk music, infused with the influence of Mexican styles that Edmonson enjoyed, particularly mariachi. After seven years together, the two split up and Edmonson continued to perform solo. Edmonson was considered a folk music \\"pioneer\\" and influenced groups such as the Kingston Trio. Bob Shane, the only surviving member of the trio, said in an interview that he \\"idolized him,\\" saying \\"he had command of the stage better than anyone I've ever seen.\\" Edmonson suffered a stroke in 1982, after which he experienced health problems and performed little until his death on May 9, 2009 in Mesa, Arizona. For his musical accomplishments, Travis was inducted into the Hall of Fame by the Tucson Area Music Awards in 1995.

The 1772 church resembles its parent church, Green Hill Church of Stepney Parish in Wicomico County, Maryland, except that while Stepney was built in brick, Christ Church is of wood construction. Its weathered appearance gave rise to a nickname \\"Old Lightwood,\\" although it now is painted barn red. Old Christ Church, near Chipman's Mill (of which only the dam remains) History Laurel did not exist when the colony of Maryland laid out its original 30 parishes in 1692. Scharf's History of Delaware reportedly states the last Native Americans in Delaware left from the Chipman's Pond area, which became the site of this Christ Church, in 1748.Raymond B. Clark, Jr., Delaware Church Records p. 24 (St. Michaels Maryland 1986) By 1772, a small settlement had been built, including a mill (now Chipman's Mill State Park), store, some houses, and iron foundry. The large Stepney Parish of the Church of England levied 80,000 pounds of tobacco from citizens and Robert Houston built this chapel of ease for residents of its northern part, often called simply \\"Broad Creek Chapel.\\" However, it turned out that both Maryland and Delaware claimed this relatively remote area known for its heavy stands of virgin pine trees. This dispute led to clarification of the boundary via the Transpeninsular Line and Mason‚ÄìDixon line, which placed the church in Delaware. It then became the \\"Mother Church\\" of Western Sussex County, Delaware. By 1821, Rev. Daniel Higbee was elected rector for this church and four others. St. Peter's Church in Lewes, Delaware was to pay him $180 per year, and this Christ Church and three others paid him $120 annually. Those less wealthy churches included Prince George's Chapel in Dagsboro, Delaware (begun 1755 as a chapel of ease for St. Martin's parish in Worcester County, Maryland and caught in the same boundary dispute), St. Pauls' Church in Georgetown, Delaware, and St. George's Chapel about 9 miles south of Lewes. Pew rents at this church were once five dollars per year, and this parish helped to form St. Phillips in Laurel in 1834, St. Luke's in Seaford, Delaware in 1835, as well as St. John's Little Hill, St. Mark's in Millsboro in 1848, and All Saints in Delmar in 1886 when the railroad down the Delmarva Peninsula brought relative prosperity to this area.Clark p. 25--with some correction using NRIS dates, including that St. Peter's in Lewes and St. Paul's in Georgetown preceded this remote parish's founding, although their earlier buildings were demolished. Four Delaware governors have been members: Nathaniel Mitchell, who is buried there, William B. Cooper, William H. H. Ross, and Elbert N. Carvel. Architecture The by church has been repaired and painted on the exterior. It is particularly known for its simple, original interior, now one of only about a dozen in the Atlantic Coast of the United States that have never been plumbed or electrified. Only the window sashes are painted, and the pulpit stands on the middle of the north wall, with an altar at the east end. Box pews are high, with doors to each family section, signified by chalked names. The ceiling is a flattened barrel vault. A gallery remains at the west end, reached by stairs and was once used for slaves and free negroes, with seats but no back rests.

He had obtained his own command during the French Revolutionary Wars and was to play a part in bringing about three of the battles of the Napoleonic Wars, the Battle of Copenhagen, the Battle of Trafalgar, and the Battle of Cape Ortegal. He only directly participated in the third, but his actions there, and the capture of the French frigate beforehand brought him honours and rewards. While towing the Didon to a British port, he and another vessel were sighted by the combined Franco- Spanish fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, and mistaken as scouts for the Channel Fleet. He therefore turned south to Cadiz, leading to the abandonment of the planned invasion of England, and the destruction of the French fleet at Trafalgar by Horatio Nelson some months later. He rose through the ranks after the end of the wars with France, and was commander of the South America Station during Charles Darwin's voyage aboard . He eventually died with the rank of vice-admiral in 1845 after a long and distinguished career. Early life Baker was born in 1771 in Kent, where his family were residents of Walmer. His naval career began on 23 August 1781 when he joined the storeship as a midshipman, serving in the Downs under Captain John Stone. He remained with the Dromedary until 26 June 1782, and joined under Captain John Peyton on 17 October that year, also on the Downs station. He and Peyton left Kite on 21 January 1783, as Peyton had been given command of the 74-gun , serving with the Channel Fleet. Baker returned to serve under his original commander, Captain Stone, on 15 March 1783, Stone by now commanding the 32-gun fifth rate . He sailed out to Halifax with her, and left Hermione on 5 October 1785 when she was paid off. The end of the American War of Independence left Baker without a ship, but he was able to gain employment sailing on the ships of the East India Company. This occupation lasted for the next two and half years, until he rejoined the navy on 22 March 1788, serving aboard the 28-gun . He and the Dido sailed to Halifax, where Baker transferred aboard the 24-gun sloop on 22 July 1790 in order to sail home. Baker spent the winter of 1790 ashore, but returned to sea on 18 May 1791 when he joined the 100-gun at Plymouth. He left the Royal Sovereign on 24 September 1791 to join Captain William Bligh's 64-gun , but by October he had transferred aboard the 32-gun . Baker and the Winchelsea served in the English Channel until February 1792, when he came ashore. His next posting was in August, when he joined the 38-gun under Commodore William Cornwallis for service in the East Indies. While serving in the East Indies Baker was commissioned lieutenant, on 13 October 1792, and on 17 October he was appointed to the 10-gun Swan. He returned to England and left her on her being paid off on 23 December 1793. Baker was then appointed as acting-commander of the hired armed cutter Lion. Command Baker served in the Channel as part of the forces under Rear-Admiral John MacBride, before moving into the hired armed lugger Valiant on 20 May 1794, and then to in November as her acting-captain. He was promoted to commander on 24 November 1795 after good service in conveying despatches to the West Indies. He spent between 1796 and 1797 in the North Sea, after which he was appointed flag captain aboard the 98-gun , the flagship of Sir John Orde. On 12 July he was appointed to command the 28-gun , serving in the Downs under Vice-Admiral Joseph Peyton. He was active against French privateers while in command of Nemesis, capturing the 14-gun Renard in the Channel on 12 January 1800, followed by the Mod√©r√© some time later. The Nemesiss boats participated in a fireship attack on the French frigates in the Dunkirk Roads on 7 July 1800, but an event of international significance occurred on 25 July 1800. =Baker and Copenhagen= The tensions caused by the British enforcement of the blockade eventually led to the Battle of Copenhagen Baker and the Nemesis had been assigned to enforce the blockade of naval stores to the French and Dutch dockyards, with a small squadron under his command. On 25 July he approached a convoy of six merchantmen off Ostend, that was being escorted by the 40-gun Danish frigate Freja, and announced his intention to search the merchants, as he suspected them of carrying stores to be used by the French. The commander of the Freja, Captain Krabbe, announced that he would fire on any boat that Baker sent to carry this out. Baker did so anyway and the Danish opened fire, but missed the boat. The shot hit the Nemesis and killed a man. Incensed, Baker ordered a general action and after 25 minutes fighting, subdued the Freja. The Freja and the convoy were escorted into the Downs, where the commander of the station, Vice-Admiral Skeffington Lutwidge, ordered that the Freja continue to fly the Danish colours while the matter was investigated. The heart of the dispute centred over the right of British ships to stop and search merchants. The Danes insisted that a convoy escorted by one of their ships flying a neutral flag, was a guarantee of the cargoes being shipped, except in the approaches to a blockaded port. The British had no reason to trust or fear the Danes and were not inclined to alter this policy, and a diplomatic mission was sent to Copenhagen under Lord Whitworth, accompanied by a fleet under Vice-Admiral Archibald Dickson. The negotiations resulted in the British agreeing to repair and return the Freja, leaving the matter of the rights of searching vessels to be determined later. The incident caused the Russian Tsar, Paul I, to place an embargo on British goods, though this was lifted three weeks later. Simmering discontent over the unresolved matter of British rights in enforcing the blockades led to the Danes, Swedes and Russians forming the Second League of Armed Neutrality. In response the British despatched a fleet under Sir Hyde Parker and Horatio Nelson to force the Danes to withdraw from the League, which resulted in the Battle of Copenhagen. Baker's actions were approved of by the Admiralty, and on 26 May 1801 he was appointed to command the 36-gun . The Phoebe was assigned to the Irish station, where Baker remained until 27 May 1802. =Baker and Trafalgar= The battle-scarred HMS Phoenix and Didon shortly after their engagement on 10 August 1805, depicted by Thomas Whitcombe The Peace of Amiens temporarily left Baker without a ship, but he returned to active service with the resumption of hostilities, taking command of the 36-gun on 28 April 1803. He was assigned to the Channel Fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis, and on 10 August 1805 he came across the 40-gun French frigate off Cape Finisterre. Prior to the sighting the Phoenix had intercepted an American merchant, en route from Bordeaux to the United States. The American master had been invited onto the Phoenix, sold the British some of his cargo of wine, and had toured the Phoenix before being allowed to continue on his way. The Phoenix had at this time been altered to resemble from a distance a large sloop of war. The Didon, which was carrying despatches instructing Rear-Admiral Allemand's five ships of the line to unite with the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Vice- Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, intercepted the American merchant and from him received news that a 20-gun British frigate was at sea and might be foolish enough to attack the Didon. The Didons commander, Captain Milius, decided to await the arrival of the British ship, and take her as a prize. The Phoenix was therefore able to approach and engage the Didon before the French realised that she was a larger frigate than they had anticipated. After a sharp action lasting several hours, with Baker on one occasion having his hat shot off his head, the French surrendered. The Phoenix had 12 killed and 28 wounded, the French sustained losses of 27 killed and 44 wounded. By intercepting the ship carrying the despatches for Allemand, Baker had unwittingly played a role in bringing about the battle of Trafalgar, but he was to play an even greater role a few days later, possibly even staving off an invasion of England. While sailing to Gibraltar with his prize in tow, Baker fell in with the 74-gun on 14 August. The following day the three ships were sighted by the combined fleet under Villeneuve, heading for Brest and then on to Boulogne to escort the French invasion forces across the Channel. Villeneuve mistook the British ships for scouts from the Channel Fleet, and fled south to avoid an action. A furious Napoleon raged 'What a Navy! What an admiral! All those sacrifices for nought!' Villeneuve's failure to press north was a decisive point of the Trafalgar Campaign as far as the invasion of England went, for abandoning all hope of fulfilling his plans to secure control of the Channel Napoleon gathered the Arm√©e d'Angleterre, now renamed the Grande Arm√©e, and headed east to attack the Austrians in the Ulm Campaign. The British ships altered their course and made for Plymouth, where they arrived on 3 September, having prevented an attempt by their French prisoners to capture the Phoenix and retake the Didon. =Baker and Cape Ortegal= Baker resumed his service in the Bay of Biscay, and on 2 November he was discovered off Cape Finisterre by four French ships of the line under Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, that had escaped from the destruction of the Franco- Spanish fleet at Trafalgar two weeks previously. They chased the Phoenix southwards, with Baker trying to lure them towards a British squadron he knew to be in the area, under Captain Sir Richard Strachan. He made contact with Strachan's forces later that day, and was sent by Strachan to round up the rest of the scattered squadron while Strachan took the bulk of his force in pursuit. The British eventually closed on the fleeing French on 4 November, whereupon Phoenix joined the other frigates in harassing the French, until Strachan could bring his larger ships in action. The frigates then attacked one side of the French line, with the ships of the line engaging the other, until the French were forced to surrender. The Phoenix was one of the ships taking possession of Scipion. Rewards and later commands The voyage of the Beagle took place during Baker's tenure as commander in chief in South America Baker was rewarded for his good services by being given command of his prize, now commissioned as , on 17 November. He transferred to in May 1806, in which he served in the Bay of Biscay until 1808. A posting as flag captain to Rear-Admiral Thomas Bertie aboard the 74-gun came on 21 May 1808, and involved service in the Baltic. While on leave in Sweden he met and married Sofia Augusta Ruuth (1789-1871), daughter of Count Eric Ruuth, and the couple returned to England in 1811. Baker continued in active service through the rest of the Napoleonic Wars, commanding the 74-gun from 22 November 1811 until 2 August 1815. By the end of 1815 he could reflect that his active career had included playing a significant role in bringing about three of the decisive actions of the Napoleonic Wars, Copenhagen, Trafalgar, and Cape Ortegal. Further rewards followed after the end of the war; he was appointed a Companion of the Bath on 4 June 1815, nominated a Colonel of the Royal Marines on 12 August 1819 and promoted to Knight Commander of the Bath on 8 June 1831. The Dutch nominated him a Knight of the Military Order of Wilhelm in 1816. Baker became a rear-admiral on 19 July 1821, and took up the position of commander-in-chief on the South America Station in 1829. During his period of command, the second voyage of took place, carrying the naturalist Charles Darwin. The Beagle came under his orders as the senior officer of the station, and he was requested by the Admiralty to supply any of the needs of the surveying mission. Baker remained in command of the station until 1833. The Baker River (Chile) bears his name. He returned home, was promoted to vice- admiral on 10 January 1837, and died at Walmer on 26 January 1845, at the age of 74.

Biography The son of an advocate to the parlement de Paris, Montereul was originally intended for a legal career himself, but in the course of a trip to Italy with Pomponne de Belli√®vre (a nephew of pope Urban VIII) he was made a canon of Toul. Paul Pellisson wrote that he was \\"very proper in negotiation, with a flexible and agile mind, very concerted, and who would hardly ever do anything without a purpose. It was he who gave the opinion that the Elector Palatine would have to pass into France incognito, to go to command the Duke of Weimar's troops, and seize de Brissac; this was why he was pursued there, and why the Elector was stopped on his journey.\\"Histoire de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßoise, volume 1, p. 300 (1653) In November 1637 when Belli√®vre was appointed ambassador to the Court of St James, Montereul joined him at Charles I's court accepting the post of secretary to the ambassador. He stayed in London as charg√© d'affaires as when Belli√®vre left in late January 1640, returning to France himself in early summer 1641 when the was appointed ambassador. For just over two years from February 1642 until the spring of 1644 Montereul was secretary to the Marquis de Fontenay-Mareuil, the French ambassador in Rome. When it looked likely that the Royalists (Cavaliers) would lose the English Civil War, the Scots who were then allied with the English Parliamentarians (Roundheads), looked to Cardinal Mazarin, by then the chief minister of France, for help in securing Charles I's position as king, but on terms acceptable to the Scots. In response Mazarin appointed Montereul as French resident in Scotland. Montereul arrived in London in August 1645. Once there he opened a dialogue with English Presbyterians such as the Earl of Holland who were sympathetic to the Scots, who too were Presbyterians and formally allied with the Roundheads thorough the Solemn League and Covenant, but who was disliked by non-Presbyterian Roundheads such as Oliver Cromwell and other religious Independents. There were Scottish commissioners in London who were looking after Scottish interests in the alliance, and during talks with them and English Presbyterians, the idea arose that if Charles I was to place himself under the protection of the Scottish army, then the Presbyterian party could advance their interests. In January 1646, in furtherance of this plan Montereul journeyed to the Royals headquarters in Oxford where he met Charles I. However Charles was at first unwilling to accept Montereul's proposals as he was unhappy with the proposed abolition of the episcopacy in both kingdoms. Montereul returned to London empty handed. Back in London there was nearly a diplomatic incident when Montereul on discovering that the Earl of Northumberland had obtained French as yet unopened diplomatic correspondence, retrieved them, causing Percy to considered detaining the Montereul by force, but in the end the Earl backed down. cites TNA: PRO, SP16/513/1, fols. 56‚Äì7. In March Montereul returned to Oxford, and without the agreement of Scots, but in the name of the French king, promised Charles that he would be received by the Scots as their rightful sovereign. Having made that promise Montereul journeyed north and the Scottish Army encampment on outskirts of Newark-on- Trent. He lodged at King's Arms Inn in Southwell (now the Saracen's Head). After further correspondence and with very few options open to him, Charles I journeyed to the Scottish camp and placed himself under the protection of the Scottish commander David Leslie, Lord Newark. It quickly became apparent to Montereul that what the Scots would do and what Charles I was willing to give were not as close as Montereul had led both parties to expect. In June Montereul returned to France with Charles holding out false hopes of French diplomatic aid. Cardinal Mazarin decide not follow Montereul's advice and decided to send Belli√®vre to England as an ambassador. Montereul returned to Newark, but on the way his diplomatic dispatches were seized and read by Parliamentary officers. When their contents became public Charles's credibility suffered, because what they contained showed that his private commitments differed from those he was publicly putting forwards. When Charles was transferred to English custody and lodged in Holmby House, Montereul left him and travelled to Edinburgh. Here he maintained good relations with both the Engagers and the party that would become known as the Whigamores. Since Montereul's first arrival in England a key concern of Mazarin had been the importance of raising troops for French service. Rendering assistance to Charles was for the cardinal a secondary concern, doubly so once it became likely that the English Parliament would emerge victorious. The numbers of soldiers that Montereul was able to raise remained very low, so from Mazarin's perspective Montereul efforts England was not fruitful. On his return to France in July 1647, Montreuil resumed his role as secretary to the prince of Conti, and went to Rome again in 1648 then, on his return to Paris, elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1649. Remaining faithful to the prince of Conti and to the duke of Longueville, he entered into a secret correspondence with them during their imprisonment in 1650, but died of tuberculosis aged 36 or 37, shortly after they were freed. Works Besides a few pieces of verse and prose which were not published, he left an abundant correspondence, published in Edinburgh at the end of the 19th century. *The Diplomatic correspondence of Jean de Montereul and the brothers de Belli√®vre, French ambassadors in England and Scotland (1645‚Äì48), edited, with an English translation, introduction and notes, by J.

The Amerrisques also are known as Cordillera Chontale√±a at their central range. Its coordinates are 12¬∞12'0\\" N and 85¬∞19'0\\" W in DMS (degrees minutes seconds) or 12.2 and -85.3167 (in decimal degrees) and is 329 meters above sea level. Amerrique is the Indian name of the mountains between Juigalpa and Libertad in the Chontales Department in Nicaragua; these mountains separate Lake Nicaragua from the Mosquito Coast. The Mayan name Amerrique signifies \\"the country of the wind\\", \\"the country where the wind blows constantly\\". The range is named after the Amerrisque tribe, who are fast fading away. It is supposed that the Amerrisques were once powerful, but very little is known concerning them. The decay of their speech went on for a long time before contact with Europeans, and the name by which the people and the mountains are now known is, not improbably, the bare remnant of the original word, which may very well have been something like Amerristiquiqque, shortened successively to Amerristique and Amerrisque. As Nicaragua's divide, the Amerrisques contain some high peaks such as Pataste (1736 m) in Madriz Region, Quiabuc (1604 m) in Estel√≠ Region, and Chag√ºite (1345 m) in Matagalpa Region. At the same time, they are the source of many rivers such as the Segovia (775 km), the Siquia-Escondido (207 km), while crisscrossed by rivers born at other ranges such as the Grande (500 km), the Viejo (209 km), etc. The range also separates the Great Lakes Xolotl√°n and Cocibolca in Western Nicaragua, from the Mosquito Coast in Eastern Nicaragua. The Amerrisques boast a rich flora, due to their latitude and altitude, which ranges from sub-alpine, by Honduras, to tropical, by Costa Rica. Species range from unique regionals such as madro√±o, espavel, and chilamate to North American species such as pine, oak, sweetgum, and terebinth, and South Americans such as gumtree, mahogany, and rosewood. The fauna includes mountain lions, coyotes, ocelots; deer, guatusas, tapirs; anteaters, armadillos, quetzals; guardabarrancos, toucans, harpy eagles; great owls, roadrunners, rattlesnakes; corals, fer-de-lance, etc. While the northern parts of the range are pine or oak-clad, the central parts sport dry-to-rainy forests and cattle ranching. The southern heights are covered in thick jungles along the San Juan River. Some important cities located at the feet of the Amerrisques include Estel√≠ (210,000), a cultural and manufacturing center, and Juigalpa (110,000), a cattle ranching area. thumb Origin of the name America The English geologist and naturalist Thomas Belt, in his book The Naturalist in Nicaragua (1874), indicated that the etymology of America came from the Amerrisque range‚Äîan important source of gold in the early 16th century. The French- American geologist Jules Marcou, in his work Nouvelles Recherches sur l'Origine du Nom d'Am√©rique (first published: Paris, 1875), accepted and supported the thesis on the origin of the name America by Belt, who had served as engineer to the Compa√±√≠a Minera de Chontales between 1868 and 1871 in the gold deposits of Santo Domingo, San Benito, and San Antonio. Belt and Marcou were not the first to mention this thesis either. In Tradiciones peruanas (1872), the Peruvian writer Ricardo Palma had already mentioned the name's derivation from the mountains of Amerrique. Without citing the source from which he obtained the information, he affirmed that \\"the name America circulated by oral tradition among the men of Columbus.\\" The Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana (Barcelona, 1907), volume 38, page 537, suggests that Columbus may have heard the name Amerrisque from the Rama people, who lived near the present-day Bluefields (in Rama Cay), and who had probably originated farther up the Escondido River, perhaps at its sources in Amerrisque. The Nicaraguan archaeologist Jorge Espinosa also expressed that the Amerrisques gave their name to the Western Hemisphere, although he based his thesis, for the University of Louisiana, on historical maps drawn by John Cabot in 1497, where the name Amerrisque already appears five years before Christopher Columbus set foot in Nicaragua in 1502.Jorge Espinosa, \\"Amerrisque Christened America.\\" El Nuevo Diario, October 18, 2008.

It originates on the superomedial aspect of the patella and inserts in the space between the adductor tubercle and the medial femoral epicondyle. Its main function is to prevent lateral displacement of the patella. The MPFL is the primary stabilizer to lateral displacement of the patella providing approximately 50-60% of restraining force. Injury to the MPFL is most common during a non-contact twisting action. The most likely time for the patella to shift laterally is during the first 20-30 degrees of flexion as the quadriceps tighten simultaneously and pull the patella laterally. Beyond 30 degrees, the quadriceps tendon and patellar ligament pull the patella posterior into the groove of the knee joint making lateral dislocation of the patella unlikely. Treatment Initial dislocation recurs about 15-44% of cases, and symptoms continue in about half. Recurrence of a laterally displaced patella is more common as the incidence of dislocation continues in the affected individual. Repairing the MPFL can be done surgically through an MPFL reconstruction. Indications for such are two documented patellar dislocations and exam findings of excessive lateral patellar mobility. MPFL reconstruction involves attaching two connections to patella and one to the femur. This reconstruction holds the femur and patella in place.

Other problems include video game-provoked seizures in patients with epilepsy. In rare and extreme cases, deaths have resulted from excessive video game playing (see Deaths due to video game addiction). General findings Video games since their inception have been the subject of concern due to the depictions of violence they may contain, which have heightened as the technology behind video games improve the amount of visual detail and realism of games. Video games are often seen as a possible cause to violent actions, notably in the aftermath of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, but academic studies have yet to identify any direct evidence between depictions of violence in video games and violent behavior.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_controversies#Violence There may or may not be an accompanying video game addiction. Video games are also been linked in some studies to aggressive behaviour and violence or fearful behaviour by its players in the short term although other studies have not supported this link. Studies have mainly reported health problems in children, mainly boys. Several specific names have been given to video-game related health problems, for example PlayStation thumb, Nintendinitis and acute Wiiitis; however, the literature does not seem to support these as truly separate disease entities. Video game consoles linked to medical problems include the PlayStation and the Nintendo Wii, although it is unknown whether certain types are more connected to these problems than others. :) Physical signs linked to excessive video game playing include black rings in the skin under the eyes and muscular stiffness in the shoulders, possibly caused by a tense posture or sleep deprivation. Existing literature on gaming is inconsistent, and studies occasionally produce contradictory results. Some studies show strong correlations between gaming and psychological issues like increased aggression in males and increased depression in females. Another study claims that girls who gamed were less likely to experience depression but were more likely to get into fights. In 2009, during a speech to the American Medical Association, US President Barack Obama identified video games as a health concern, stating that they are a key factor in unhealthy sedentary lifestyles.  Musculoskeletal issues  When questioned, children often admit to having physical complaints during video game playing, for example pain in the hands and wrists, back and neck. Ergonomic measures could improve postural problems associated with video game playing. A 2004 case report in The Lancet, authored by a 9-year-old boy, mentions the Playstation thumb, which features numbness and a blister caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid game play. Using dermoscopy, dermatologists found point-like hemorrhages and onycholysis (letting go of the nail) in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis. Nintendonitis has been used to describe tendon injuries (tendinosis) of the hands and wrists in Nintendo players. A 2010 case report in the New England Journal of Medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal after using a Wii balanceboard; this was dubbed a Wii fracture. A further study involving musculoskeletal symptoms and computer use among Finnish adolescents affirmed the association between musculoskeletal symptoms and computer usage. The study claims that daily computer use of 2 hours or more increases the risk for pain at most anatomic sites. Consistently long sessions of video game play also leads to an increased likelihood of lower back pain, according to a study conducted in a population of school children. Children who played video games for more than 2 hours a day were more inclined to have lower back pain, however the same could not be said for those who watched television instead.  Vision problems  Video game playing may be associated with vision problems. Extensive viewing of the screen can cause eye strain, as the cornea, pupil, and iris are not intended for mass viewing sessions of electronic devices. Using video games for too long may also cause headaches, dizziness, and chances of vomiting from focusing on a screen. However, certain studies have shown that video games can be used to improve various eye conditions. An investigation into the effect of action gaming on spatial distribution of attention was conducted and revealed that gamers exhibited an enhancement with attention resources compared to non- gamers, not only in the periphery but also in central vision. Further studies in 2011, concluded that a combination of video game therapy alongside occlusion therapy, would greatly improve the recovery of visual acuity in those experiencing amblyopia. The 20 20 20 rule used for computer eye strain may help prevent damage to the eyes. Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.https://www.juststand.org/blog/prevent-eye-strain- with-the-20-20-20-rule/ Epileptic seizures Concerns that video games can trigger epileptic seizures began in the early 1980s, with the first medically documented case of a video game-induced seizure occurring in 1981. In early 1993 The Sun reported a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game; similar though less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world, and within a year all video game console manufacturers required that epilepsy warnings be included in the instruction manuals for all games published for their consoles. Studies published in 1994 in Pediatrics and The Lancet found that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy, and that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the TV set and wearing sunglasses while playing.  Obesity  Video game play is frequently associated with obesity. Many studies have been conducted on the link between television & video games and increased BMI (Body Mass Index). Due to video games replacing physical activities, there appears to be a clear association between time spent playing video games and increased BMI in young children. One such study produced data that indicated that boys who spend less than 1.5 hours on the television and playing video games, were 75.4% less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than 1.5 hours. A study conducted in 2011 formalized the association of video game play and an increase in food intake in teens. A single session of video game play resulted in an increase in food intake, regardless of appetite. The recent trend of \\"active video games\\" revolving around the Wii and Xbox Kinect might be a way to help combat the aforementioned problem however this finding still needs confirmation from other studies. Furthermore, a study conducted in Baylor College of Medicine revolving around children claims that there is no evidence which supports the belief that acquiring an active video game under naturalistic circumstance would result in a beneficial outcome toward children. The study produced no results showing an increased amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video games. It has been estimated that children in the United States are spending 25 percent of their waking hours watching television and playing video games. Statistically the children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity we can see.

The first edition, published by Communications Research Machines, Inc. (CRM) and written by a small editorial team and large set of prominent \\"contributing consultants\\", is notable for its lavish illustrations and its humanistic approach. It was significantly rewritten by David L. Kirk and others for the second and third editions, which were issued by Random House. First edition Noah's Ark, by Kerstin Apelman √ñberg, was used in the chapter on \\"Human Sexual Behavior\\"; this and other objectionable images led to limited adoption of the first edition and were removed in later editions. The 1972 first edition of Biology Today had no principal author but was written by fifty-four contributing consultants, many of whom were leading figures in biology (and seven of whom were Nobel laureates). Visually, it features numerous artistic interpretations of biological topics as well as striking diagrams and photographs. Many of these images, such as a surreal depiction of the injection of heroin, a series of diagrams showing how to use a contraceptive diaphragm, and a painting titled Noah's Ark depicting copulating humans and animals, proved controversial and led to few adoptions of the textbook. By 1981, a reviewer of a later, much-changed edition wrote that the original \\"might now be considered a 'classic' for it is hardly likely that such a fine humanistic biology textbook will be published again. (If you have a copy, hold on to it.)\\" In the preface, John H. Painter, Jr.--leader of the editorial team and credited as the book's publisher--explains that \\"science is a peculiarly human endeavor that seeks to newer and better solutions to the problems plaguing us all\\"; that modern biological sciences are rooted in work of physicists who turned to biology after World War II; that understanding life at the molecular level allows science to find \\"solutions to problems of immediate concern\\", rather than earlier biological studies that \\"floated disconnectedly above the physical and chemical substrate of life\\"; and that information processing is at the core of many biological advances.Biology Today (1972), p. v The introduction is an illustrated essay, \\"What Is Life?\\", by Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi --a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist and, as the essay's biographical tag explains, a protester against \\"the irrational pursuit of war and politics that characterizes our Western culture\\" as well as an advocate of using technology \\"to create a psychologically and socially progressive world where humanistic values are paramount\\". The essay explains Szent-Gy√∂rgyi's outlook on the fundamental problems of biology, the relationship between biological and physical sciences, and reasons for pursuing biology. Szent-Gy√∂rgyi concludes that \\"To express the marvels of nature in the language of science is one of man's noblest endeavors. I no reason to expect the completion of that task within the near future.\\"Biology Today (1972), pp. xx-xxxi =Biology Today Film Series= CRM produced a series of films associated with Biology Today: The Origin of Life and Evolution, The Cell: A Functioning Structure (in two parts), and Muscle. Like the textbook, the films were visually innovative, featuring extensive animation to depict complex aspects of biology. According to a review in The American Biology Teacher, The Origin of Life and Evolution used \\"creative cinematography to recreate current views\\" and won awards at \\"two major education film festivals\\". While the reviewer considered it the best of its kind (in 1977) and praised it both for educational value and captivating \\"visual imagery\\", he noted that it was too sophisticated for the full range of its intended audiences and that \\"basic knowledge of DNA is a prerequisite for gaining maximum usefulness from the film.\\" =Contributing consultants= *Preston Adams *Thomas Peter Bennett *Konrad E.

Whittaker Biology Today (1972), pp. ii, 948-955 Second and third editions The second and third editions (published in 1975 and 1980 by CRM/Random and Random House alone, respectively) were significantly rewritten by Washington University biologist David L. Kirk and others. Kirk wrote fifteen chapters of the second edition and co-wrote five more.\\"Preface, Biology Today (second edition) .\\" Botany online - The Internet Hypertextbook. Accessed 15 May 2009. With the second edition, the controversial material from the original was removed, and the list of contributing consultants was smaller. The third edition was very different from the first. It had, for the first time, a principal author credited (David L. Kirk) and had a long list of consultants (not \\"contributing consultants\\" as in the earlier editions). The third edition had just 31 chapters grouped into six sections (there were 45 chapters in 8 sections in the original), and rather than a humanistic approach for a broad college audience, it employed what Kirk described as \\"a somewhat more rigorous approach than many competing textbooks\\". A reviewer judged it \\"well-written, pedogogically sound, and, generally, scientifically accurate\\", but lacking the stylistic flair (and the seven Nobel Prize-winning contributors) of the original.

The vessel operates between Ciutadella de Menorca and Alcudia. The vessel is named after British‚ÄìAmerican astrophysicist Cecilia Payne. Between 1999 and 2018 she was operated by Irish Ferries as Jonathan Swift. Design and construction Cecilia Payne was constructed by Austal Ships in Henderson, Australia, at a cost IR¬£29million. The vessel was launched in February 1999 and was delivered to Dublin in May 1999, before entering service in July 1999. The vessel is of a catamaran design. Power is provided by four Caterpillar 3618 diesel engines with a total output of 28,800 kW. The vessel employs four Kamewa waterjets for propulsion and has a service speed of 40 knots (75 km/h). Jonathan Swift was designed to allow quick turnarounds at port. It is equipped with a bow door which allows vehicles to drive on at either end and drive straight off at the end of the journey. The vessel was able to use existing terminal facilities in both ports. ServiceIrish Ferries= The introduction of Jonathan Swift was delayed due to an industrial dispute between Irish Ferries and the trade union SIPTU, who represented seven officers that had been transferred from the company's conventional ferry operations to man the new high-speed ferry. These officers refused to operate the vessel at lower manning levels which had been proposed by Irish Ferries. Irish Ferries threatened to sell or charter Jonathan Swift if the issue was not resolved. On its entry into service in July 1999, Jonathan Swift increased Irish Ferries' passenger capacity on the Dublin-Holyhead route by 73%, and its car capacity by 50%. The vessel has spent its entire career on this route, operating alongside the company's conventional ferries. = Balearia = On 30 January 2018, Irish Continental Group announced that Jonathan Swift was to be sold to Balearia Eurolineas Maritimas S.A (Balearia) for a sum of ‚Ç¨15.5m plus fees.

Louis Joseph Xavier was born at the Palace of Versailles. He was the second surviving child and eldest son of Louis, Dauphin of France and Maria Josepha of Saxony, and was thus the oldest brother to the future kings Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X. It is a known fact that he was the favorite child of his parents,Zhand Shakibi, Revolutions and the Collapse of the Monarchy, (I.B. Tauris, 2007), 58. and was said to be handsome and bright. He was put in the care of Marie Isabelle de Rohan and given the title of Duke of Burgundy by his grandfather, King Louis XV. He was much loved by those who were close to him, especially his older sister Marie Z√©phyrine, who died at the age of five in 1755. It is unknown if the Duke, who was not even four years old yet, was affected by this. But it is known, however, that the absence of his older sister was felt by the Duke. Death The Duke of Burgundy and his mother, by Quentin de La Tour, 1761. The young Duke was pushed off a wooden horse by one of his playmates in 1759. As he was recognized for his kindness, he did not tell anyone about this, in order to prevent his friend from getting into any trouble. After this incident, the Duke of Burgundy's health started to deteriorate quickly. The family's physician, Dr. Barbier, decided to operate on him in 1760. The Duke was operated on while he was conscious. Knowing that he would die, the Dauphin had him baptised on 29 November 1760, with Louis XV and Marie Leszczy≈Ñska, his grandparents, as his godparents. Until that moment, he had been known just as \\"Burgundy\\". By 1761, the Duke was bound to his bed, unable to move his legs, with what was diagnosed as extra pulmonary tuberculosis of the bone.Jean- Dominique Bourzat, Les apr√®s-midi de Louis XVI, (La Compagnie Litteraire, 2008), 9.

In this battle, Edward Bruce was killed, and Bermingham had Bruce's severed head 'salted in a chest' and transported to England to be put on display before Edward II. He was briefly Viceroy of Ireland in 1321. Bermingham was the son of Piers FitzJames MacPhioris de Bermingham and Ela de Odingsells. He was contracted to marry Matilda de Burgh in 1308 but was married to Aveline de Burgh, both were daughters of Richard √ìg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster. In 1312 he was made a knight by the Lord Deputy of Ireland. He was the commander of the English army in Irelands in 1318. He fought in the Battle of Faughart on 14 October 1318 as commander of the forces loyal to King Edward II of England against the army led by Edward Bruce, who had been crowned High King of Ireland. Bruce was killed in the battle. He was created 1st Earl of Louth and granted estates at Ardee on 12 May 1319 as a reward for his services to the Crown in defeating the Scots. In 1320 the pope ratified his marriage to Aveline, despite his having been contracted to marry her sister. Je had three children with Aveline, their son Richard, Lord Ardee, died in 1322.

Harborth's research ranges across the subject areas of combinatorics, graph theory, discrete geometry, and number theory. In 1974, Harborth solved the unit coin graph problem,Heiko Harborth, L√∂sung zu Problem 664A, Elem. Math. 29 (1974), 14‚Äì15. determining the maximum number of edges possible in a unit coin graph on n vertices.In 1986, Harborth presented the graph that would bear his name, the Harborth graph. It is the smallest known example of a 4-regular matchstick graph. It has 104 edges and 52 vertices. In connection with the happy ending problem, Harborth showed that, for every finite set of ten or more points in general position in the plane, some five of them form a convex pentagon that does not contain any of the other points. Harborth's conjecture; ; . posits that every planar graph admits a straight-line embedding in the plane where every edge has integer length.

Biography After studying at the coll√®ge d'Harcourt, he became the student and assistant of √âtienne Laur√©ault de Foncemagne. Dacier came to public notice in 1772 via his translation of the Histories of Claudius Aelianus and the same year became an associate member of the Acad√©mie des inscriptions, becoming its president and permanent secretary in 1782. In that position, he wrote the organisation's history from 1784 to 1830. He translated the Cyropaedia by Xenophon (1777). He became a member of Paris's corps municipal in 1790 and led the imposition of the new system of contributions directes, but refused Louis XVI's offer of the post of finance minister. After retiring to Seine-et-Oise during the French Revolution, he became a member of the Tribunat in 1799. In 1800 he was made curator of manuscripts at the Biblioth√®que nationale and elected to the Acad√©mie des Sciences morales et politiques. It was to Dacier that Champollion sent his famous 1822 letter, known widely as Lettre √† M. Dacier, revealing his discovery of how to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics. At age 80, Dacier was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1822; at the time he was the oldest member of the society. He was made a baron on 26 May 1830. Pierre-Fran√ßois Tissot, his successor in the Acad√©mie, said of him that \\"he had the sanest ideas on scholarship, and he unceasingly tended to give it a useful and philosophical direction. \\"Don't look for gold mines\\" he said to his brother- academicians and especially to their young emulators.

Dora II is a more open and incomplete structure than Dora I. Dora II (Dora 2) is an unfinished German submarine base and submarine pen or bunker in Trondheim, Norway, which is next to Dora I (Dora 1). Construction of the bunker (designated by the Germans as DORA II) was undertaken during the Second World War, but the complex was never finished unlike Dora I. Trondheim was traditionally referred to as Drontheim in German, and the name DORA is the letter \\"D\\" in the German phonetic alphabet.  History Background= Diagram showing locations of the submarine bunkers Following the occupation of Norway in 1940, it was soon realised that the country only had limited facilities for minor naval repairs. More extensive work usually meant a return to Germany. The capitulation of France two months later overshadowed the strategic importance of Norway to some extent, but it was still regarded as a better location for access to the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans than Germany. Nevertheless, better protection for U-boats from aerial attack was required so a bunker-building programme was instigated.Jak P Mallmann Showell Hitler's U-boat Bases (2002) Sutton Publishing p. 55 German U-boat bases in occupied Norway operated between 1940 and 1945, when the Kriegsmarine (German navy), converted several naval bases in Norway into submarine bases. Trondheim was an important U-boat base in Norway during the war. It was the home of the 13th flotilla and it had 55 U-boats assigned to the flotilla during its service. =Construction= The German civil and military engineering group, Organisation Todt, started constructing the facility as a submarine base as they were finishing Dora I (completed in June 1943). Construction of Dora II began in 1942 but was never completed. The second bunker was a little more than half complete by the time the war ended. If finished it would have been long by wide, with four pens capable of holding six U-boats. The completed walls are thick, and the roof is thick (only a quarter of the roof was completed). After World War II Inside of Dora 2 (2016) In 1947 and 1948 the port authority conducted cleanup and blasting on Dora II. Part of the walls on the uncompleted sides were blasted away. Dora II is used as a shipyard and as a warehouse and garage for boats and cars by companies such as Trondheim Verft AS and Skipsmaling AS.

The team's center, Turner played with the Pros from around 1911 until his death in 1914. Canton Professionals By 1911 Turner became the captain of the Professionals. At this time a rivalry existed between the team and Peggy Parratt, the captain of Shelby Blues. Parratt, prior to joining Shelby Blues, was the captain of the hated Massillon Tigers, the top rival for Canton. During a game in 1911, Turner pulled his entire team from the field to protest a referee's call in favor of the Shelby blues.

I'm done!\\" Death Nonetheless, Turner returned to the gridiron for the next three seasons. He continued to play for the Pros and kept up the rivalry with Parratt. However, tragedy struck near the end of the 1914 season when Turner was severely injured during a game against Parratt and the Akron Indians. While making a tackle on Akron's Joe Collins, Turner's back was fractured and his spinal cord was completely severed. According to Canton manager Jack Cusack, who was at Turner's bedside when he died, his last words were \\"I know I must go,\\" he said, \\"but I'm satisfied, for we beat Peggy Parratt.\\" Canton won the game 6‚Äì0.

The committee became a standing committee in 1909 when Senator Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island submitted a resolution that had the effect of giving all current select committees, including Industrial Expositions, full committee status. The committee was abolished in 1921, along with many other obsolete committees. =Predecessor committees= *Select Committee on the Centennial of the Constitution and the Discovery of America (1885‚Äì1891) *Select Committee on the Quadro-Centennial (1891‚Äì1895) *Select Committee on International Expositions (1895‚Äì1899) *Select Committee on Industrial Expositions (1899‚Äì1909) References Category:Defunct committees of the United States Senate Category:Select Committees of the United States Congress Category:1899 establishments in the United States Category:1921 disestablishments in the United States ","title":"United States Senate Committee on Industrial Expositions"},{"id":"22801808","text":"Buckhorn Lake is a private lake in Harris County in the state of Texas, United States.

Developing since the 1980s as a profession but since the 1950s as a practice (philosophical midwifery), practitioners of philosophical counseling ordinarily have a doctorate or minimally a master's degree in philosophy and offer their philosophical counseling or consultation services to clients who look for a philosophical understanding of their lives, social problems, or even mental problems. In the last case philosophical counseling might be in lieu of, or in conjunction with, psychotherapy. The movement has often been said to be rooted in the Socratic tradition, which viewed philosophy as a search for the Good and the good life. A life without philosophy was not worth living for Socrates. Philosophical practice has continued to expand and is attractive as an alternative to counselling and psychotherapy for those who prefer to avoid a medicalization of life-problems. Numerous philosophical consultants have emerged and there is a strong international interest and a bi-annual international conference. History  Peter Koestenbaum at San Jose State University in California was an early figure in philosophical counseling. His 1978 book The New Image of the Person: The Theory and Practice of Clinical Philosophy set out the essential contributions of philosophy to counseling. His own practice was augmented by extensive training of mental health professionals in applications of philosophical principles. Gerd B. Achenbach and Ad Hoogendijk are two German and Dutch philosophers who established themselves as consultant philosophers in the 1980sAchenbach, G. B. (1984) Philosophische Praxis, K√∂ln: Verlag f√ºr Philosophie J√ºrgen Dinter.Hoogendijk, A. (1988) Spreekuur bij een filosoof, Utrecht: Veers and led the way to a number of other developments all over the world. They proposed an alternative to psychotherapeutic culture by working exclusively within the field of existential investigation with clients or patients, whom they called 'visitors'. The world's oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the German Society for Philosophical Practice and Counseling, which was founded in 1982 by Achenbach. In the United States, the oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the National Philosophical Counseling Association (NPCA), formerly called the American Society for Philosophy, Counseling, and Psychotherapy, which was co-founded in 1992 by three American philosophers, Elliot D. Cohen, Paul Sharkey, and Thomas Magnell. The NPCA offers a primary certificate in logic-based therapy (LBT) through the Institute of Critical Thinking. The movement is also connected with and related to existential therapy, which has thrived in the United Kingdom since the establishment of the Society for Existential Analysis (SEA) in London in 1988. This was based on the work of Emmy van Deurzen, also a philosopher who has applied philosophical thinking to the practice of psychotherapy. Philosophical consultancy is often applied to business consultancy as well as to individuals, as it frequently involves a rethinking of values and beliefs and is also a method for rational conflict resolution. Pierre Grimes founded the Noetic Society in 1967 for the study of dialogue and dialectic. He became the head of the Philosophical Midwifery Program when the Noetic Society was incorporated in 1978.Pierre Grimes ‚Äì The Noetic Society The American Philosophical Practitioners Association (APPA) was founded in 1998 in New York City by Lou Marinoff. APPA offers a certification program in client counseling for those with advanced degrees in philosophy who wish to practice philosophical counseling. It also publishes a professional Journal and has a membership list of those certified as philosophical counselors on its website. Marinoff was at the center of a 2004 controversy when his philosophical counseling practice at City College of New York was temporarily shuttered by college officials who feared he was offering mental health advice without proper training and licensing; Marinoff responded by suing for what he described as his freedom of speech being stifled. Philosophical practice has continued to expand and is attractive as an alternative to counselling and psychotherapy for those who prefer to avoid a medicalization of life-problems. Numerous philosophical consultants have emerged and there is a strong international interest and a bi-annual international conference. There are a number of important publications in the field.See, for example: Lahav and Tillmans 1995, Grimes, 1998, Curnow 2001, Herrestad et al. 2002, Marinoff 1999, Rochelle 2008, 2011, Weiss 2015. There are presently a number of professional associations for philosophical counseling throughout the world. In India an academic course in philosophical counselling is been offered by the Department of Philosophy, Panjab University, Chandigarh and University of Kerla .. https://www.keralauniversity.ac.in/downloads/MAPHILOSOPHY1509356655.pdf In 2020, a project in philosophical counseling in India was awarded by the Ministry of Education to the Department of Philosophy, Panjab University, Chandigarh: Goals and methods Philosophical consultancy is a relatively new movement in philosophy which applies philosophical thinking and debating to the resolution of a person's problem. Achenbach argues that it is life that calls to thinking, rather than thinking that informs life. The act of philosophising can, therefore, give direction in its own right, as living precedes thinking and practice precedes theory. According to the Preamble of the NPCA Standards of Practice, :a philosophical practitioner helps clients to clarify, articulate, explore and comprehend philosophical aspects of their belief systems or world views. ... Clients may consult philosophical practitioners for help in exploring philosophical problems related to such matters as mid-life crises, career changes, stress, emotions, assertiveness, physical illness, death and dying, aging, meaning of life, and morality. On the other side philosophical practitioners also initiate projects in common life worlds with various goals that are related to essential problems of life, such as sustainable energy, direct democracy, etc. Activities common to philosophical practice include: # the examination of clients' arguments and justifications # the clarification, analysis, and definition of important terms and concepts # the exposure and examination of underlying assumptions and logical implications # the exposure of conflicts and inconsistencies # the exploration of traditional philosophical theories and their significance for client issues # the initiation of projects for common goods # all other related activities that have historically been identified as philosophical. =Variations= The methods and orientations of philosophical counselors vary greatly. Some practitioners, such as Gerd B. Achenbach (Germany), Michel Weber (Belgium) and Shlomit C. Schuster (Israel) are dialogical and dialective engaged, while confessing to a \\"beyond method\\" approach. They hold that philosophical counseling has the aim to empower clients' philosophical abilities, which additionally may have therapeutic implications.Schuster, S.C. (1999). Philosophy Practice: An Alternative to Counseling and Psychotherapy. Westport, CT:Praeger; cf. Michel Weber's own blend of praxis. Other practitioners are more directive and view philosophical counseling as a form of mental health intervention.Raabe, P. (2001). Philosophical Counseling. Westport, CT: Praeger. Some philosophical practitioners, notably Louis Marinoff (U.S.) and Guenther Witzany (Austria), view philosophical practice as a separate practice area distinct from mental health practices such as psychology and mental health counseling;Guenther Witzany (ed) (1991). Zur Theorie der Philosophischen Praxis. Essen. . while others, notably Elliot D. Cohen (U.S.), think they are necessarily intertwined. Some philosophical counselors draw inspiration from the anti-psychiatry movement, arguing that widespread mental health diagnostic criteria as outlined in DSM IV have unfairly or inaccurately pathologized humanity.See, e.g., Z. Kotkowicz (1997). R.D. Laing and the Paths of Anti-Psychiatry, NY: Routledge According to a New York Times article on philosophical counseling, \\"only Cohen and Marinoff have branded easily comprehended techniques. Cohen's logic-based therapy builds on the work of his mentor Albert Ellis, who invented rational emotive behavior therapy.\\" References Further reading  * Achenbach, G. B.

She was subsequently sentenced to life in prison , but was pardoned after four years and six months at the request of Congressman Bill Richardson. McCord's story was documented on Raw TV's Banged Up Abroad (Locked Up Abroad in the United States) Biography McCord grew up in Houston, Texas, United States. She left home when she was 18 years old and moved into an apartment with a friend. After a few months, they were becoming low on funds when McCord's roommate returned from a trip to Europe, claiming to have made $10,000 (USD) by smuggling diamonds. Intrigued, McCord agreed to meet her roommate's employer, but when she learned that not only would she be traveling to Bangladesh, but would also be smuggling drugs, she became reluctant. McCord's soon-to-be employer then doubled the payment to $20,000 and informed her that she would be smuggling drugs into Switzerland, not the US. McCord agreed. She learned that her roommate had also smuggled heroin, not diamonds, through an airport. After two weeks, the last five days of which were spent at a five-star resort in Dhaka, unsure of when she would receive the drugs, McCord became impatient as her vacation visa was about to expire. According to McCord, as she was attempting to flee at the last minute, she was caught in the resort's lobby by the supplier, who then forced her into a cab and duct-taped 7 lbs of heroin to her body (per National Geographic's Locked Up Abroad - Bangladesh docudrama).  Arrest and sentence  McCord stated in her interview on National Geographic's Locked Up Abroad that she was threatened by her supplier as her brother dropped her at the airport. Afraid, and anxious to return home, McCord approached her gate. When she realized passengers were being searched physically, she rushed to the restroom to attempt to remove the packages. The heat made the duct tape melt and she was unable to remove it. She stated that she prayed and asked that she get through this, promising she would never do anything bad again. Upon exiting the restroom, McCord noticed the official was behind a curtain and could not see her. She attempted to go to the airplane without being searched. Mere steps away from success, the official came out of the room and called McCord back. After being taken into custody, McCord was shocked to learn that the penalty for drug smuggling in Bangladesh was death. The police allegedly led McCord to believe that if she identified the supplier who gave her the heroin, all charges would be dropped and she would be allowed to go home. As an American teenager raised to trust the police, McCord perhaps took them at their word. She told Christian Reader Magazine that she had heard of extradition agreements and expected, at the very least, to be returned to the US once she led them to the supplier. Her good behavior in prison, and the fact that the judge did not believe McCord to be a frequent smuggler, resulted in McCord receiving a life sentence rather than death by hanging. McCord reported being told that the court asked the Americans if they could sentence her to hang as a sign of solidarity with the US Government's War on Drugs. McCord was told that the court was advised that the Americans would accept no harsher sentence for their citizen than what had historically been handed down to one of their own women for a similar case. Days before McCord's sentencing hearing, she told Christian Reader, a renowned drug dealer in Dhaka was sentenced mid-trial to life imprisonment. She was later released for mistrial, but the precedent had been set; McCord was sentenced to 30 years ‚Äî the Bangladeshi equivalent of a life sentence. Imprisonment and pardon Though devastated that her \\"youth was over,\\" (as she relates in the Locked Up Abroad - Bangladesh docudrama) McCord tried to make the most of being in prison. She learned to speak Bengali and taught other prisoners of her Christianity, as they taught her of their Hindu and Muslim faiths. In 1996, after four years and six months in prison, McCord was pardoned at the request of Congressman Bill Richardson. Due to significant efforts by US Embassy consulate officers, the pardon was processed in record time and she returned home in Richardson's custody on July 30, 1996. After a day in Washington D.C., McCord returned to Houston with her mother on August 1, 1996. McCord earned an associate degree (June 1999) and bachelor's degree (June 2001) within five years of returning to the US. She also worked full-time at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston and, more recently, at the AES Corporation. She now lives and works on the East Coast. During the interview on the National Geographic episode, McCord said she learned a lot and would never do it again, but would not change the past. In an interview at the airport in Dhaka, McCord spoke in Bengali and expressed affection for the people of Bangladesh, as well as a desire to return one day and show the gracious government what she has done with the second chance they gave her.  Banged Up Abroad  McCord's story was featured in series three of the British TV series Banged Up Abroad. JC Gonzalez portrayed Lia McCord's brother, who drove to pick her up at Bush Airport while she was being arrested in Bangladesh.

They are also known as \\"force- sensitive resistor\\" and are sometimes referred to by the initialism \\"FSR\\".FSR Definitions FSR usage  History  The technology of force-sensing resistors was invented and patented in 1977 by Franklin Eventoff. In 1985 Eventoff founded Interlink Electronics, a company based on his force-sensing-resistor (FSR). In 1987, Eventoff was the recipient of the prestigious international IR 100 award for the development of the FSR. In 2001 Eventoff founded a new company, Sensitronics, that he currently runs.Sensitronics  Properties  Force-sensing resistors consist of a conductive polymer, which changes resistance in a predictable manner following application of force to its surface.Tactile Sensors They are normally supplied as a polymer sheet or ink that can be applied by screen printing. The sensing film consists of both electrically conducting and non-conducting particles suspended in matrix. The particles are sub-micrometre sizes, and are formulated to reduce the temperature dependence, improve mechanical properties and increase surface durability. Applying a force to the surface of the sensing film causes particles to touch the conducting electrodes, changing the resistance of the film. As with all resistive based sensors, force-sensing resistors require a relatively simple interface and can operate satisfactorily in moderately hostile environments. Compared to other force sensors, the advantages of FSRs are their size (thickness typically less than 0.5 mm), low cost and good shock resistance. A disadvantage is their low precision: measurement results may differ 10% and more. Force-sensing capacitors offer superior sensitivity and long term stability, but require more complicated drive electronics.  Operation principle of FSRs  There are two major operation principles in force-sensing resistors: percolation and quantum tunneling. Although both phenomena actually occur simultaneously in the conductive polymer, one phenomenon dominates over the other depending on particle concentration. Particle concentration is also referred in literature as the filler volume fraction \\\\phi. More recently, new mechanistic explanations have been established to explain the performance of force-sensing resistors; these are based on the property of contact resistance R_C occurring between the sensor electrodes and the conductive polymer. Specifically the force induced transition from Sharvin contacts to conventional Holm contacts. The contact resistance, R_C, plays an important role in the current conduction of force- sensing resistors in a twofold manner. First, for a given applied stress \\\\sigma, or force F, a plastic deformation occurs between the sensor electrodes and the polymer particles thus reducing the contact resistance. Second, the uneven polymer surface is flattened when subjected to incremental forces, and therefore, more contact paths are created; this causes an increment in the effective Area for current conduction A. At a macroscopic scale, the polymer surface is smooth. However, under a scanning electron microscope, the conductive polymer is irregular due to agglomerations of the polymeric binder. Up to date, there is not a comprehensive model capable of predicting all the non-linearities observed in force-sensing resistors. The multiple phenomena occurring in the conductive polymer turn out to be too complex such to embrace them all simultaneously; this condition is typical of systems encompassed within condensed matter physics. However, in most cases, the experimental behavior of force-sensing resistors can be grossly approximated to either the percolation theory or to the equations governing quantum tunneling through a rectangular potential barrier. = Percolation in FSRs = The percolation phenomenon dominates in the conductive polymer when the particle concentration is above the percolation threshold \\\\phi_c. A force-sensing resistor operating on the basis of percolation exhibits a positive coefficient of pressure, and therefore, an increment in the applied pressure causes an increment in the electrical resistance R, For a given applied stress \\\\sigma, the electrical resistivity \\\\rho of the conductive polymer can be computed from: :\\\\rho=\\\\rho_0(\\\\phi-\\\\phi_c)^{-x} where \\\\rho_0 matches for a prefactor depending on the transport properties of the conductive polymer and x is the critical conductivity exponent. Under percolation regime, the particles are separated from each other when mechanical stress is applied, this causes a net increment in the device's resistance. = Quantum tunneling in FSRs = Quantum tunneling is the most common operation mode of force-sensing resistors. A conductive polymer operating on the basis of quantum tunneling exhibits a resistance decrement for incremental values of stress \\\\sigma. Commercial FSRs such as the FlexiForce, Interlink and Peratech sensors operate on the basis of quantum tunneling. The Peratech sensors are also referred to in the literature as quantum tunnelling composite. The quantum tunneling operation implies that the average inter-particle separation s is reduced when the conductive polymer is subjected to mechanical stress, such a reduction in s causes a probability increment for particle transmission according to the equations for a rectangular potential barrier. Similarly, the Contact Resistance R_C is reduced amid larger applied forces. In order to operate on the basis of quantum tunneling, particle concentration in the conductive polymer must be held below the percolation threshold \\\\phi_c. Several authors have developed theoretical models for the quantum tunneling conduction of FSRs, some of the models rely upon the equations for particle transmission across a rectangular potential barrier. However, the practical usage of such equations is limited because they are stated in terms of Electron Energy E that follows a Fermi Dirac probability Distribution, i.e. electron energy is not a priori determined or can not be set by the final user. The analytical derivation of the equations for a Rectangular potential barrier including the Fermi Dirac distribution was found in the 60\`s by Simmons. Such equations relate the current density J with the external applied voltage across the sensor U. However, J is not straightforward measurable in practice, so the transformation I=JA is usually applied in literature when dealing with FSRs. Just as the in the equations for a rectangular potential barrier, the Simmons' equations are piecewise in regard to the magnitude of U, i.e. different expressions are stated depending on U and on the height of the rectangular potential barrier V_a. The simplest Simmons' equation relates I with U,s when U\\\\approx0 as next: :I(U,s)=\\\\frac{3A\\\\sqrt{2mV_a}}{2s}(\\\\frac{e}{h})^{2}U\\\\exp(-\\\\frac{4{\\\\pi}s}{h}\\\\sqrt{2mV_a}) where V_a is in units of electron Volt, m, e are the electron's mass and charge respectively, and h is the Planck constant. The low voltage equation of the Simmons' model is fundamental for modeling the current conduction of FSRs. In fact, the most widely accepted model for tunneling conduction has been proposed by Zhang et al. on the basis of such equation. By re-arranging the aforesaid equation, it is possible to obtain an expression for the conductive polymer resistance R_{Pol}, where R_{Pol} is given by the quotient U/I according to the Ohm's law: :R_{\\\\it{Pol}}=\\\\frac{s}{A\\\\sqrt{2mV_a}}(\\\\frac{h}{e})^{2}\\\\exp(\\\\frac{4{\\\\pi}s}{h}\\\\sqrt{2mV_a}) When the conductive polymer is fully unloaded, the following relationship can be stated between the inter-particle separation at rest state s_0,the filler volume fraction \\\\phi and particle diameter D: :s_0=D\\\\Big[\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6\\\\phi}\\\\Big)^{\\\\frac{1}{3}}-1\\\\Big] Similarly, the following relationship can be stated between the inter-particle separation s and stress \\\\sigma :s=s_0(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M}) where M is the Young's modulus of the conductive polymer. Finally, by combining all the aforementioned equations, the Zhang's model is obtained as next: :R_{\\\\it{Pol}}=\\\\frac{D\\\\Big[\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6\\\\phi}\\\\Big)^{\\\\frac{1}{3}}-1\\\\Big](1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})}{A\\\\sqrt{2mV_a}}\\\\big(\\\\frac{h}{e}\\\\big)^{2}\\\\exp\\\\Big(\\\\frac{4{\\\\pi}D}{h}\\\\Big[\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{6\\\\phi}\\\\Big)^{\\\\frac{1}{3}}-1\\\\Big](1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})\\\\sqrt{2mV_a}\\\\Big) Although the model from Zhang et al. has been widely accepted by many authors, it has been unable to predict some experimental observations reported in force-sensing resistors. Probably, the most challenging phenomenon to predict is sensitivity degradation. When subjected to dynamic loading, some force- sensing resistors exhibit degradation in sensitivity. Up to date, a physical explanation for such a phenomenon has not been provided, but experimental observations and more complex modeling from some authors have demonstrated that sensitivity degradation is a voltage-related phenomenon that can be avoided by choosing an appropriate driving voltage in the experimental set-up. The model proposed by Paredes-Madrid et al. uses the entire set of Simmons' Equations and embraces the contact resistance within the model; this implies that the external applied voltage to the sensor V_{FSR} is split between the tunneling voltage V_{bulk} and the voltage drop across the contact resistance V_{Rc} as next: :V_{FSR}=2V_{RC}+V_{bulk} By replacing sensor current I in the above expression, V_{bulk} can be stated as a function of the contact resistance Rc and I as next: :V_{bulk}=V_{FSR}-2RcI and the contact resistance R_C is given by: :R_C=R_{\\\\it{par}}+\\\\frac{R_C^0}{\\\\sigma^k} where R_{par} is the resistance of the conductive nano-particles and R_C^0, k are experimentally determined factors that depend on the interface material between the conductive polymer and the electrode. Finally the expressions relating sensor current I with V_{FSR} are piecewise functions just as the Simmons equations are: When V_{bulk}\\\\approx0 :R_{\\\\it{bulk}}=\\\\frac{s_0(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})}{(A_0+A_1\\\\sigma^{A_2})\\\\sqrt{2mV_a}}(\\\\frac{h}{e})^{2}\\\\exp(\\\\frac{4{\\\\pi}s_0(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})}{h}\\\\sqrt{2mV_a}) When V_{bulk} :I=\\\\frac{(A_0+A_1\\\\sigma^{A_2})e}{2{\\\\pi}hs_0^{2}(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})^{2}}\\\\Bigg\\\\\\\\{(V_a-\\\\frac{V_{bulk}}{2})\\\\exp\\\\Bigg[-\\\\frac{4{\\\\pi}}{h}s_0(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})\\\\sqrt{2m(V_a-\\\\frac{eV_{bulk}}{2})}\\\\Bigg]-(V_a+\\\\frac{V_{bulk}}{2})\\\\exp\\\\Bigg[-\\\\frac{4{\\\\pi}}{h}s_0(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})\\\\sqrt{2m(V_a+\\\\frac{eV_{bulk}}{2})}\\\\Bigg]\\\\Bigg\\\\\\\\} When V_{bulk}>V_a/e :I=\\\\frac{2.2e^{3}V_{bulk}^{2}(A_0+A_1\\\\sigma^{A_2})}{8{\\\\pi}hV_as_0^{2}(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})^{2}}\\\\Bigg\\\\\\\\{\\\\exp\\\\Bigg[-\\\\frac{8{\\\\pi}s_0(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})}{2.96heV_{bulk}^2}\\\\sqrt{2mV_a^3}\\\\Bigg]-(1+\\\\frac{2eV_{bulk}}{V_a})\\\\exp\\\\Bigg[-\\\\frac{8{\\\\pi}s_0(1-\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{M})}{2.96heV_{bulk}}\\\\sqrt{2mV_a^3(1+\\\\frac{2eV_{bulk}}{V_a})}\\\\Bigg]\\\\Bigg\\\\\\\\} In the aforesaid equations, the effective area for tunneling conduction A is stated as an increasing function dependent on the applied stress \\\\sigma, and on coefficients A_0, A_1, A_2 to be experimentally determined. This formulation accounts for the increment in the number of conduction paths with stress: :A=A_0+A_1\\\\sigma^{A_2} = Current research trends in FSRs = Although the above model is unable to describe the undesired phenomenon of sensitivity degradation, the inclusion of rheological models has predicted that drift can be reduced by choosing an appropriate sourcing voltage; this statement has been supported by experimental observations. Another approach to reduce drift is to employ Non-aligned electrodes so that the effects of polymer creep are minimized. There is currently a great effort placed on improving the performance of FSRs with multiple different approaches: in-depth modeling of such devices in order to choose the most adequate driving circuit, changing the electrode configuration to minimize drift and/or hysteresis, investigating on new materials type such as carbon nanotubes, or solutions combining the aforesaid methods.  Uses  Force-sensing resistors are commonly used to create pressure-sensing \\"buttons\\" and have applications in many fields, including musical instruments, car occupancy sensors, artificial limbs, Foot pronation systems and portable electronics. They are also used in Mixed or Augmented Reality systems as well as to enhance mobile interaction.

It operated under that name from 1873, when a printing business established by the royal engraver Hippolyte Brasseux in 1826 was acquired by √âdouard Devambez. At first the firm specialized in heraldic engraving, engraved letterheads and invitations. Devambez clients included the House of Orl√©ans, the House of Bonaparte and the √âlys√©e Palace. Devambez widened the scope of the business to include advertising and publicity, artists‚Äô prints, luxurious limited edition books, and an important art gallery. The House became recognized as one of the foremost fine engravers in Paris, winning numerous medals and honours. With the artist √âdouard Chimot as Editor after the First World War, a series of limited edition art books, employing leading French artists, illustrators and affichistes, reached a high point under the imprimatur A l'Enseigne du Masque d'Or ‚Äì the Sign of the Golden Mask and with PAN in collaboration with Paul Poiret.Anon, 'The Work of The Maison Devambez', Commercial Art Magazine May 1928 √âdouard's son, Andr√© Devambez, became a famous painter and illustrator after receiving the Prix de Rome.  1826-1873: The business before Devambez  The engraving business acquired by Devambez just before the Franco-Prussian War was founded in 1827 at No. 17, passage des Panoramas, as a \\"modest store\\" by Brasseux the younger. He was the younger brother of Brasseux the older, an engraver established in the galleries of the Palais-Royal who was known to work for king Louis Philippe I. As his brother, Brasseux the younger was specialized in stamps, medals, heraldic engraving and stone engraving. . According to an article published in 1927 in L'ami des lettr√©s, Brasseux the younger was moderately successful in his business and did not succeed to enlarge significantly his customer base. He sold the business in 1863 to a M. Beltz. Beltz in turn sold the business who ran it for the next seven years, after which it was bought by √âdouard Devambez.  Devambez Engraver and Fine Printing  √âdouard Devambez was not simply an artisan, but also an artist (described in B√©n√©zitB√©n√©zit, Dictionnaire des Peintres, Sculpteurs, Dessinateurs et Graveurs. as an engraver of book-plates). This artistic temperament ensured a scrupulous attention to questions of taste, balance and appropriateness in typography, engraving and design. Devambez began exhibiting his work at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, winning a bronze medal in 1878 and a silver medal in 1889 in the category \\"artistic printing and heraldic painting\\". Among the specialities of La Maison Devambez at this time were: book printing and production; type-founding; engraving on steel, copper, lead, wood, and stone; printing; typography; lithography; colour printing and colour lithography; calligraphy; colouring; stamping; binding; gilding; and the sale of inks, paints, journals, ledgers, papers, boxes, stationary, leather goods, and special fabrics.Rapport Groupe II Classe 11, 'Exposition Universelle 1878', Gravure et Peinture H√©raldique, 1878. In 1890, the business moved to 63, Passage des Panoramas, where what began as a simple printing studio became a prestigious store that attracted clients such as the House of Orl√©ans, Roland Bonaparte, the Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and the √âlys√©e Palace and the H√¥tel de Ville, entrusted with the printing of official menus and programmes for receptions for visiting foreign monarchs such as the Emperor of Russia Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna for their visit in Dunkerque on 18 September 1901. Devambez was also appointed official engraver to the Royal Family of Portugal. Devambez produced the traditional Livre d‚ÄôOr (Golden Book, or Presentation Volume) for important events such as visits by the King of Spain or the King of Great Britain, and Livres d‚ÄôOr for the Pasteur Institute, the Red Cross and others. After World War I the firm also produced Livres d‚ÄôOr to commemorate the fallen, for instance the Livre d‚ÄôOr de la Compagnie Alg√©rienne 1914-1918.Anon., 'The Work of the Maison Devambez', Commercial Art Magazine, May 1928. The reputation of La Maison Devambez continued to grow, with further medals at the Expositions Universelles, with a gold medal at Brussels in 1897, a Diploma of Honour at Toronto in 1898, and a gold medal in the category \\"engraving and printing\\" at the Exposition Universelle de Paris in 1900. At this exhibition (for which √âdouard Devambez served as a member of the jury), he was named a Chevalier de la L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur, and also obtained the prestigious title of Notable Commer√ßant. M. Lahure, reporting on the 1900 Exposition, wrote: > 'Monsieur Devambez, with the soul of an artist, loves his art with a > passion, but this has not hampered him in making the House of Devambez one > of the foremost engravers in Paris.

The expansion of the business so far beyond its original boundaries necessitated an expansion of the premises. Rather than moving out of the Passage des Panoramas, where his main rival Stern was also located, Devambez took over two further adjacent shops. √âdouard Devambez died on 2 June 1923.  Galerie Devambez  The Galerie Devambez was opened at 43, Boulevard Malesherbes in 1897. Initially it was used purely as a sales outlet for original prints ‚Äì lithographs, etchings, drypoints ‚Äì and facsimile prints of watercolours. During the First World War the Galerie was used by the Louvre (which was closed) to sell prints created by the Chalcographie du Louvre.[Chimot], Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez, 1929, Introduction p.IV. The first Catalogue d‚ÄôEstampes d‚ÄôArt, √âditions de Grand Luxe de la Galerie Devambez lists limited edition prints by the following artists: Adler, Baudoux, Berthoud, Boichard, Brouet, Bernard Boutet de Monvel, Bucci, G.

No complete list exists of exhibitions held at the Galerie Devambez between 1908 and 1931. However catalogues of many of the shows are in the library of the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs in Paris. Pierre Sanchez has published in 2009 a book on the shows and artists of the gallery.Galerie Devambez 1907-1926. R√©pertoire des artistes et liste de leurs oeuvres par Pierre Sanchez chez L'√âchelle de Jacob The first exhibition at Galerie Devambez was a major show of drawings by Auguste Rodin, exhibited from 19 October to 5 November 1908. The Rodin show caused shock and outrage because of the erotic nature of many of the drawings. The sculptor F. W. Ruckstull was horrified, writing disapprovingly: ‚ÄòIn his exhibition of drawings, held on 19 October 1908 in the Galerie Devambez in Paris, he showed the most libidinous set of drawings ever exposed to an invited public, in which there were at least two that were frankly pornographic and for which show he was, by both French and foreign people, called \\"beast\\", \\"monster\\", \\"vulgar charlatan\\", \\"sadist.\\" etc.‚Äô Others were charmed and delighted by the freshness of Rodin's work. The foreword to the catalogue praised the ‚Äòbold, truthful images‚Äô, while the critic of Le Journal wrote that, ‚ÄòOne cannot find in these hundred and fifty sketches and drawings of Rodin a single note seen before.‚Äô This set the tone for a glittering series of important exhibitions, such as the Premi√®re Exposition d‚ÄôArt N√®gre et d‚ÄôArt Oc√©anien, organized by Paul Guillaume, 13‚Äì19 May 1919, with a catalogue by Henri Clouzot and additional text by Guillaume Apollinaire. Apollinaire, who died the previous year, had collaborated with Paul Guillaume on the pioneering study Sculptures N√®gres in 1917.Lemke, Primitive Modernism, 1998, pp.35-41: Paul Guillaume. 'A New Aesthetic', 1919. This exhibition ‚Äì drawn from Guillaume's private collection - placed African art at the heart of Modernism. Artists exhibiting at Galerie Devambez included Mary Cassatt, Armand Guillaumin, Claude-Oscar Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Auguste Marquet, Paul Signac, Raoul Dufy, Maurice de Vlaminck, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Tsuguharu Foujita, and Giorgio de Chirico. The Exposition de Peinture Moderne organised by M. Paul Guillaume in the Galerie Devambez from 27 January to 12 February 1920 with an introductory text by Guillaume Apollinaire is considered as a turning point in the modern art history.Colette Giraudon, Paul Guillaume et les Peintres du XXe Si√®cle (La Biblioth√®que des Arts, 1993). Picasso exhibited four works : T√™te, Buste, Nature Morte, and Nu de Femme. Modigliani exhibited twelve : La Demoiselle du dimanche, Portrait de Jean Cocteau, La Dame au m√©daillon, La Collerette blanche, La jolie Fille rousse, Le Liser√© noir, Madam Pompadour, Femme au fauteuil, Beatrice, L‚ÄôEnfant gras, La Rouqine, T√™te de Femme, and Raymond. Matisse exhibited one painting, Les Trois s≈ìurs, and four bronze sculptures : Le Serf, Femme accroupie, T√™te de femme, and Torse de fillette. Giorgio de Chirico's important painting Il Ritornante, also exhibited at this show, sold from the collection of Pierre Berg√© - Yves Saint Laurent at Christie's in February 2009 for ‚Ç¨11,041,00 ($14,285,461).See Christie's catalogue. The catalogue text by Apollinaire reads : > Les grands po√®tes et les grands artistes ont pour fonction de renouveler > sans cesse l'apparence que rev√™t la nature aux yeux des hommes.

Together, these two important exhibitions curated by Paul Guillaume redefined the spirit and direction of Modernist art in the aftermath of World War I. The gallery also hosted annual exhibitions of the Salon de l‚ÄôAraign√©e, the Soci√©t√© des Peintres-Graveurs, and the Soci√©t√© des Peintres Lithographes.  Devambez publishing  Long-established as a printer, Devambez only ventured into book publishing at the start of the twentieth century, the first being in 1908, a book by Georges Cain on La Place Vend√¥me. The publishing business was carried out from premises at 23, rue Lavoisier. Books were published either simply under the name Devambez, as Devambez √âditions de Luxe, or as √Ä l‚ÄôEnseigne du Masque d‚ÄôOr, Devambez ; the term Masque d‚ÄôOr was also used for two beautiful Art Deco almanacks for the years 1921 and 1922, illustrated with pochoir prints by √âdouard Halouze. In this capacity, between 1906 and 1932 Devambez published around 70 general books, mostly illustrated, of which a selection of key titles is listed below.Monod, Manuel de l‚ÄôAmateur des Livres Illustr√©s Modernes, 1992. * Georges Cain, La Place Vend√¥me, 1908 * Eug√®ne Belville, Monogrammes, Cachets, Marques, Ex-Libris, 1910 * L√©on Bourgeois et al., La Mis√®re Sociale de la Femme, 1910 * Ren√© Peter, La Cr√©ation du Monde, ill.

The appointment of √âdouard Chimot in 1923 as artistic director of a fine press imprint, Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez, opened a new era for Devambez. Chimot was among the artists who carried the Symbolist aesthetic forward into the age of Art Deco. The 1920s were his heyday. This was when his own art was at its most powerful and original, and also when his influence throughout the Parisian art world was most strongly felt. As artistic director of the fine press Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez, √âdouard Chimot worked closely with artists such as Pierre Brissaud, Edgar Chahine, Tsuguharu Foujita, Drian, Jean Droit, Henri Farge, and Alm√©ry Lobel- Riche. Typically, books published by Andr√© Devambez under the direction of Chimot were illustrated with original etchings, in strictly limited editions of a few hundred copies. In 1929, Devambez published a lavish catalogue, simply entitled Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez, in an edition of 100, to be given to his chief collaborators and preferred clients, containing extra proofs from all the books published from 1923-1929. Each copy of this catalogue was numbered and signed by Chimot to a named recipient. As almost all the books are already listed as out-of-print and unobtainable, the catalogue is not a sales pitch, but a record of achievement. To make the 100 books, the publisher bound up existing proof pages, to distribute to those most interested: > 'Ce n‚Äôest pas un catalogue de reproductions que nous lui offrons, mais les > pr√©cieux d√©fets des livres eux-m√™mes: les eaux-fortes du tirage et les > feuilles typographiques du tirage, imprim√©es sur les diff√©rents papiers > employ√©s pour chaque √©dition.' In order to construct a catalogue in this way, all copies of the book must be unique in their content. Devambez may have regretted the extra expense involved in creating this exquisite calling card, as the Wall Street Crash and subsequent Depression devastated his market. No one would be buying, or bankrolling, projects such as these in the 1930s. There were several books still in the pipeline, but the glory days of the Chimot/Devambez partnership were over. Some announced books seem to have been cancelled. The artists involved in Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez include Art Deco masters such as Pierre Brissaud (who illustrated three books of the 31 or 32 published) and Drian. Drian was born Adrien Desir√© √âtienne, into a peasant family in Lorraine. The chatelaine of the village took an interest in the talented boy, but was horrified by his desire to be an artist. So when Adrien √âtienne went to Paris to study at the Acad√©mie Julian, he took the pseudonym Drian ‚Äì his own first name, as his contemporaries heard it in his slurred Lorrain accent.Marcus Osterwalder, Dictionnaire des illustrateurs 1890-1945, 1992, p.321. He is often listed as Adrien Drian or √âtienne Drian, but both are incorrect: the name Drian stands alone, like Ert√©. Chimot drew from the wide range of artists from round the world who had settled in Paris in the 1920s : William Walcot was an English artist born in Odessa to a Russian mother; Edgar Chahine and Tigrat Polane were both Armenian √©migr√©s; Tsuguharu Foujita, known to his Montmartre friends as L√©onard, was the artist who more than any other infused Japanese art with a modern Western sensibility. √âdouard Chimot himself was the most prolific supplier of original prints to Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez, illustrating with etchings Les Chansons du Bilitis, Les Po√©sies de M√©l√©agre, Les Belles de Nuit, La Femme et le Pantin, and Verlaine's Parall√®lement. = List of books published under the imprint Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez = (See References for sources of this listing.[Chimot], Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez, 1929: Monod, Manuel de l‚ÄôAmateur des Livres Illustr√©s Modernes, 1992.) * Anatole France, Le Petit Pierre, ill.

They produced posters, catalogues (for instance a catalogue for Chrysler designed by Valerio), and adverts. An article in the Commercial Art Magazine in May 1928 notes that Devambez had already discovered the secrets of creating a brand: \\"In direct advertising he devotes particular attention to arousing the interest of possible buyers by objects which are not specific advertisements, but create a favourable disposition towards the advertiser on whose behalf they are produced.' During the First World War, Devambez created many posters for the Bureau de Propagande Fran√ßaise √† l‚Äô√âtranger, by artists such as Abel Faivre, Andr√© Devambez, Th√©ophile- Alexandre Steinlen, Adolphe Willette, and Jean-Louis Forain.[Chimot], Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez, 1929, Introduction, p.III. From 1921 to 1936 Devambez had an exclusive contract with one of the leading poster artists of the day, Leonetto Cappiello. His most famous posters are for Parapluies Revel, La Belle Jardini√®re, Cachou Lajaunie, Bouillons Kub, and Le Th√©√¢tre National de l‚ÄôOp√©ra.Jack Rennert, The Posters of Leonetto Capiello, 2007. Other artists who frequently created posters for Devambez include Lucien Boucher, Roger de Valerio, and Victor Vasarely.B√©n√©zit, Dictionnaire des Peintres, vol. 14, p.59. Devambez also produced books for clients such as railway and shipping companies. These luxurious productions were not for sale, but were given away as promotional items. One typical item, an Art Deco-style guide to fashionable Paris complete with a \\"List of firms recommended\\", was published for the French State Railways. Written in English by Jacques Deval, it mimics the style of Anita Loos‚Äô Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The title is ...and blondes prefer Paris. Four letters, twenty-two postcards, two night letters and one cable from his sweet, sweet Annabel Flowers to her darling, darling, George Sabran.  PAN, Annuaire du Luxe √† Paris, Paul Poiret La Maison Devambez became intimately connected with the other grand houses of fashionable Paris. The 1927 book Les Arcades des Champs √âlys√©es celebrated the achievement of the architect Marcel Duhayon. Marcel Duhayon designed luxury hotels in Paris : Hotel Royal Monceau, Hotel Commodore, Hotel California, Grand Hotel des Ambassadeurs. He was the uncle of Suzanne Goyard, the wife of Fran√ßois Goyard, the grand-grand son of the founder of Goyard, the Parisian trunk maker founded in 1853. The luxury shops of the day were celebrated in the pochoir illustrations by √âdouard Halouze in the Almanach du Masque d‚ÄôOr, in 16 pages of adverts at the back for shops such as Cartier. Companies such as Mo√´t et Chandon joined Jeanne Lanvin, Transatlantic shipping lines and French railway companies in commissioning promotional literature from Devambez. Most crucial of all these contacts was with the fashion designer Paul Poiret. In 1928, Poiret and Devambez collaborated on the most luxurious all the de-luxe Devambez books, entitled Pan: Annuaire de Luxe √† Paris. It was essentially a collection of 116 Art Deco plates ‚Äì some pochoir-coloured - advertising all the most exclusive Paris brands, including Van Cleef & Arpels, Judith Barbier, Mitsubishi, Maigret, Herm√®s, Lanvin, Callot Soeurs, Maxims, Galeries Lafayette, Jane R√©gay, Les gants Jouvin, La Tour d'Argent, Madeleine Vionnet, Worth, Moulin Rouge, and Devambez themselves. The illustrators included Gus Bofa (Madeleine Vionnet), Lucien Boucher (Au Printemps), Raoul Dufy (La Baule), Charles Martin (Simon), Sem (Maxim's), and Roger de Valerio (Devambez). Despite the beauty and artistic success of the list edited by Chimot for Les √âditions d‚ÄôArt Devambez, Pan was probably Devambez‚Äô finest hour.

(p.115) John Segrave, 2nd Baron Segrave (1256‚Äì1325) was an English commander in the First War of Scottish Independence. Segrave commanded the English in Battle of Roslin, and the Battle of Happrew. He also was involved with the execution of William Wallace, and was the one who carried his quarters to their destinations in Scotland. He died a wealthy man. Early life Born 20 July, about 1256 (aged 39 in 1295), he was the son and heir of Nicholas de Segrave, 1st Baron Segrave, and his wife Maud, daughter of Geoffrey de Lucy, Knt., of Newington, Kent, Cublington, Buckinghamshire, Dallington and Slapton, Northamptonshire, etc., by his wife, Nichole. In 1270 John married Christian, daughter of Sir Hugh de Plescy (son of John du Plessis, 7th Earl of Warwick), Knt., of Hook Norton, Headington, and Kidlington, Oxfordshire, Stottesden, Shropshire, Kidderminster, Worcestershire, etc., by his 1st wife, Isabel, daughter and co-heiress of John Biset. Christian's maritagium included the manor of Stottesdon, Shropshire. At the same time, his sister Amabel married Hugh's son, John de Plescy. After his father-in-law's death, John de Segrave had custody of his lands during the minority of his heir. Under Edward I In 1277 and 1282 Segrave served in the two major campaigns against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales. In October 1287 he went to Ireland, nominating proctors to represent him for one year. On 6 August 1291 he received at Berwick letters of protection for one year on staying in Scotland on the king's service. He was then for a time constantly employed in the wars against the Scots. On the death of his father in 1295 Segrave, then 39, entered as heir into the possession of his property. He was first summoned to the Bury parliament of November 1296, and was then regularly summoned until his death. On 14 January 1297 Segrave was one of the magnates attending the Hilarytide parliament at York, with the intention of proceeding against the Scots, but the expedition was postponed. =Opposition leader and Scottish campaigns= Segrave attached himself to one of the leaders of the growing baronial opposition to the king, in 1297 making an indenture with Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, by which he covenanted to serve the earl, with five other knights. In return he obtained a grant of the earl's manor of Lodene in Norfolk. During the crisis of 1297 Segrave was summoned on 1 July to appear in London to attend the king beyond sea, but he appeared as proxy for the Earl Marshal Bigod, who pleaded sickness. Segrave, however, on 28 December 1297 received letters of protection for himself and his followers, on their proceeding to Scotland on the king's service, and he subsequently fought in the Falkirk campaign. In 1299 he was again summoned to fight against the Scots. In 1300 he was once more in Scotland, taking a conspicuous part at the siege of Caerlaverock, representing Bigod in this campaign also. In 1301 Segrave attended the parliament at Lincoln and was one of the signatories of the letter of the barons to the pope, dated 12 February. On 5 August 1302 he was appointed to the custody of Berwick Castle of Berwick-on-Tweed. On 29 September he was ordered to make a foray into Scotland as far as Stirling and Kirkintilloch. After November the truce with the Scots ended, and Segrave was entrusted with the custody of Scotland. On the first Sunday in Lent 1303 Segrave, with his followers dispersed, was suddenly attacked when near Edinburgh by some Scots in ambush, severely wounded, and taken prisoner with twenty other knights. He was, however, subsequently recaptured by the other portions of his army who had escaped the earlier surprise. Segrave continued in Scotland after Edward I arrived to prosecute the war in person. He was present at the Siege of Stirling Castle, which surrendered on 24 July 1304, and, on the departure of Edward, was appointed justice and captain in Scotland south of the River Forth. Serious resistance to Edward now seemed over, and Segrave's main business was to administer the conquered districts and to track down William Wallace, who still held out. In March 1304 Segrave defeated Wallace in one of his last attempts at resistance. Next summer Wallace was handed over to Segrave, who personally escorted his prisoner to London, reaching the city on 22 August 1305. Before this Edward had on 18 Aug. put Segrave at the head of the special commission appointed to try Wallace. He remained responsible for Wallace's custody during his imprisonment in London, and on 23 August pronounced the sentence of treason against him. After Wallace's death, Segrave took his quartered remains back to Scotland to be displayed at Newcastle, Berwick, Stirling, and Perth. On 25 October 1305, he received his salary, this perhaps being the date of his ceasing to act as warden of Scotland. In 1306 he was again summoned to Carlisle to share in Edward I's invasion of Scotland. Under Edward II Under Edward II Segrave received numerous offices. In the early months of the new reign he became justice of the forests beyond the River Trent, and constable of Nottingham Castle. On 10 March 1309 he was appointed warden of Scotland, with a following of sixty men at arms, and on 10 April 1310 the appointment was renewed.. Scotland was now rapidly falling into the hands of Robert Bruce, Segrave's work was mostly preserve the English frontier: he is in fact described by a border chronicler as warden of the marches on the side of Berwick. But a continued truce from November 1309 to the summer of 1310 restricted Segrave's efforts. Segrave adhered to the barons during the struggle against Piers Gaveston, and as a result his offices of constable of Nottingham and justice of the forests beyond Trent were on 1 October 1310 transferred by the king to Gaveston himself. Both grants were renewed to Gaveston two months before his execution. On 4 September 1312, soon after Gaveston's death, Segrave received the office of keeper of the forests on this side Trent. In 1314 he took part in the great expedition against Scotland, and on 24 June fought at the battle of Bannockburn. After the English defeat he fled towards Carlisle, and took refuge with others in Bothwell Castle; but the sheriff, who held the castle, changed sides, and handed over the fugitives as prisoners. Segrave was kept in Scotland until the end of 1314, when he was released in exchange for some Scottish prisoners and on payment of a large ransom; his son Stephen arranged the conditions of the exchange. He still held his keepership and the custody of Nottingham Castle, to which Derby Castle was now added. On 14 July 1316 he received a grant of ¬£1,000 in aid of his ransom from the Scots and for other losses in the king's service, sums due to the crown being deducted from the gross sum. He was one of the continual council, appointed at the reconciliation between Edward II and Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster in 1318, to be perpetually about the king. On 30 November 1321 he was one of those ordered to raise the local levies on the king's behalf in Warwickshire, Leicestershire, and Staffordshire. Death On 16 July 1324 Segrave was appointed Seneschal of Gascony and with Fulk FitzWarin, was captain of the troops going to Gascony, serving under Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent. Next year he died in Aquitaine, aged nearly 70 years old. The extent of the Segrave territories and influence had been much widened during his lifetime. His father's estates were nearly confined to the central midland counties, but he also acquired territory in Norfolk, Oxfordshire, Huntingdonshire, and other shires. In 1301 he had licence to crenellate his house at Bretby, Derbyshire, and in 1306 to fortify his manor-house at Caludon, Warwickshire, with a moat and embattelled wall. Family Segrave's eldest son, Sir Stephen de Segrave, died shortly after him in 1325. His second son, John, described by 1312 as John de Segrave the younger, married Juliana, daughter and heiress of John de Sandwich, lord of Folkestone, and died in 1349, leaving an infant daughter and heiress named Mary. John Segrave, 4th Baron Segrave, son of Stephen, succeeded to the title and estates. He served in Edward III's French wars, and married Margaret, daughter and heiress of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk. This John was the last of the Segraves summoned to parliament. Coat of arms His coat of arms - sable a lion rampant argent crowned or - (inherited from his father) appears on the following rolls of arms which verify his presence on the Scottish campaigns mentioned above: The Falkirk Roll (together with his brother Nicholas, who bore the same arms differenced by: overall a label of three pendants gules); The Caerlaverock Poem (again with Nicholas); and The Stirling Roll (with brothers Henry, Nicholas and Simon and son Stephen). Of course, his brothers and son all have differenced arms.

He commanded 350 Chickasaw auxiliary troops, whom he had recruited, as a militia captain under Andrew Jackson during the Creek War of 1813-1814. Later he joined the US Army under Jackson for the remainder of the War of 1812. George temporarily became chief of the Chickasaw again after his late brother Levi Colbert died in 1834. George was a planter who owned significant land in Mississippi, and a ferry in northwestern Alabama. His father, James Logan Colbert, was half Scot, half Chickasaw. George was three-fourths Chickasaw and one quarter Scottish. Early life and education The second of six mixed- race sons of James Logan Colbert, a North Carolinian son of a settler of Scots descent and his second wife Minta Hoye, a Chickasaw, George \\"Tootemastubbe\\" Colbert was born in present-day Alabama in 1764.Pate, James P., \\"George Colbert,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed November 3, 2009). As a youth he began to rise in prominence in the Chickasaw nation, as he gained status from his mother's clan as well as his actions. The Chickasaw had a matrilineal kinship system, in which children were considered born into their mother's clan; positions of hereditary leadership were passed through the mother's line. Military service Colbert was said to serve with American troops under Arthur St. Clair in 1791 and Anthony Wayne in 1794 during the Northwest Indian Wars. During the Creek Wars, he recruited 350 Chickasaw warriors and assisted Andrew Jackson against the Red Sticks, and later during more of the War of 1812. Career By the early 1800s, George \\"Tootemastubbe\\" Colbert established Colbert's ferry near Cherokee, Alabama. It was a significant crossing of the Tennessee River along the Natchez Trace, an important trade route. George Colbert was able to accumulate land and became an influential planter; he also raised livestock and was a trader as well as being the eldest son eligible for the position of Chief. The tribe owned an estimated 150 enslaved Africans as labor on their land as was custom with many intercultural tribes in the region. A few slaves escaped during the confusion of the eventual Trail of Tears. He and his brothers, Levi and James, were among the primary negotiators of between his people and the United States government in the early 19th century. The Chickasaw ended up ceding much of their land to the United States after Levi \\"Itawambamingo\\" Colbert had died en route to Washington D.C during negotiations in 1834. Being between both \\"white\\" and \\"native\\" cultures, he and his brother were heavily relied upon to act on the tribe's behalf, so once Levi died, negotiations abruptly ceased and in the year 1834, the Chickasaw joined many other tribes in removal (the Trail of Tears). Itawmaba County in Mississippi is named after Levi. Before removal, George \\"Tootemastubbe\\" Colbert served again as chief of the Chickasaw temporarily. (The reason his younger brother served is due to George never truly wanting the position). The year 1834 was the beginning of the tedious and heart breaking path to the newly established Indian Territory. Tishomingo became chief of the Chickasaw once they started on the trail and remained in charge once they arrived until his death in 1838 en route. Neither he nor George, who died also en route in 1839 at age 75, ever reached the new territory alive. Tishomingo died near the Arkansas river in 1836; Tootemastubbe died just before arrival to the Chickasaw's new territory at Fort Towson (which is Choctaw territory located east of the Chickasaw). Marriage and family George Colbert married two times. They were two sisters from the Wind Clan Cherokee, and he fathered a total of six sons and two daughters. Saleechie Doublehead, the daughter of Chief Doublehead was the younger sister of Tuskiahooto Doublehead and both were his wives. He solely married Saleechie due to the older sister being barren. (The Chickasaw allowed the men in the tribe to marry multiple wives per tribal law). George Colbert never arrived to the Chickasaw section of \\"Oka Homa\\". Several ancestry search sites state he died on the Trail of Tears at Fort Towson which is Choctaw territory. Saleechie Doublehead was a direct descendant of Pocohantas's youngest sister, \\"Cleopatra\\", as dubbed by John Rolfe. His father, James Logan Colbert, was the first child of mixed blood due to his father, Major William d'Blainville \\"Piomingo\\" Colbert (born 1695, died after 1792 and buried on Isle of Skye) coming to the new world in the early 1720s and marrying the Chickasaw chief's daughter, Mimey \\"Dorothy\\" Colbert. This marriage made William's negotiations for trade easier due to her influence and position in the tribe. James Logan Colbert was born from this union as William had only married one wife in accordance to the Catholic faith. Major William received his commission as an Army Officer from President George Washington himself in 1786 along with his grandson, General William \\"Chootshemataha\\" Colbert. Look up Chief Piomingo, Major William d'Blainville Colbert; Blainville-sur-Orne, France; Chateau d'Colbert in Blainville; Jacobite Uprisings; Massacre of Glencoe. Addendum: (William \\"d'Blainville\\" Colbert is so called since he was one of the first of the Castlehill Colberts of Inverness to be born outside Scotland in Blainville-sur-Orne, France, in 1695. The Chateau de Colbert is located in Blainville; it was one of the properties once owned by the deceased Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a cousin, who served as King Louis XIV's Treasurer in the mid-1600s. The Colberts/Cuthbert's of Castlehill, Inverness, Scotland had to leave due to the original Jacobite uprising, the Glorious Revolution,(also known as the Massacre of Glencoe) which ousted Roman Catholic King James II of England and VII of Scotland to be replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary II and William of Orange finally in 1692. The Jacobite Uprisings of 1689-1692 shed the blood of 30 members of another close family to King James II (and VII), the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe, so the \\"King Baron\\" Colberts had to find sanctuary in France. The Colbert family were heavily intertwined/intermarried with the Catholic Stuart family.

Originally known as Walter Cook and Son and specialising in the building of Thames sailing barges, it operated until the 1980s - at which time, it was the last remaining barge yard in Britain. In 1999, Topsail Charters took on the lease of the yard and refurbished it. They restored boat building and barge repair to the site and maintain the last set of original barge repair blocks on the east coast of England. History Walter Cook took on the shipyard on the River Blackwater at Maldon in 1894 to build the Thames sailing barge Dawn, which had been ordered by James Keeble, a member of a well-known local barge owning family. The Dawn was launched in 1897 and, not long afterwards, the yard started work on the Lord Roberts, for Meesons of Battlesbridge. In 1902, the British King was launched - the second barge built by Walter Cook and Son for the Keebles. As well as barges, Cooks yard built the steamboat Annie for Charrington the brewer. The Annie was used for taking passengers to Osea Island, and it was the first of a succession of pleasure crafts that set off from the beach at Maldon promenade. In 1907 Cooks were contracted by the Admiralty to build a prototype of the newly designed Montague Whaler. This resulted in many years of work on subsequent orders. The yard built a hundred whalers during World War II , launching roughly one every three weeks. In the 1920s a visit by Josh Francis of the Colchester barge owners Francis and Gilders led to forty years of steady barge building work for Walter Cook and Son. As wooden barges started to get old, their owners became reluctant to spend money repairing them and some of them were sold off for other uses. In 1937, Cooks converted the sailing barge Challenger to a yacht. A lot of barges were requisitioned during World War II and many of them were damaged as a result. Cooks' yard was very busy with repair work after the war ended. In those days, too, a lot of barges came to the yard to be fitted with diesel engines, as the days of trading under sail alone began to pass. =Post war= In late 1945, and 1946, Cook's yard undertook the re-fitting for the owners, Chief Engineer Bill Wilson and Skipper Albert Brand, of the Southend Motor Navigation Co. of their 75 ft TSMV Julia Freak. She had been volunteered for Operation Dynamo in 1940, thereafter requisitioned by the Admiralty for service as a coastal minesweeper and handed back to her owners in an appallingly-neglected condition. Cookie's boat-builders helped S.M.N.CO Staff outfit her for the 1946 holiday season at Southend-on-Sea after the Admiralty released the vessel from her wartime service. For that 1946 season, the refitted Julia Freak, built by Hayward's of Southend on Sea at their Yard hard by The Kursaal, during the 1920s, was re-registered as the New Prince Of Wales 1 in memory of the Fleet Flagship of that name sunk off La Panne during Operation Dynamo in May 1940 with Sub Lt Peter Bennett in command. Also for the Southend Motor Navigation Co. in 1946 Cookie repaired and re-engined the 48 ft late-Victorian sailing Smack \\"May\\" (Regd # LO180 and renamed \\"Valerie\\" after her 1946 refit) after a sinking from bomb damage at her mooring alongside Southend Pier Pavilion, being salved and spending the rest of World War II in a mud-berth at Leigh-on-Sea. She returned to fishing service, used by The Southend Motor Navigation Co. to fulfil a fishery contract issued by and paid for the Ministry Of Food. \\"Cookie\\" also built two new twin-screw passenger-carrying launches for the Southend Motor Navigation Co. in the late 1940s both successively larger replacements for the prewar Princess Maud which was volunteered for Operation Dynamo in 1940 and reported \\"lost to causes unknown\\". The second and larger of these two new launches Cookie built for Bill Wilson & Albert Brand was a 60 ft l.o.a. vessel, Christened New Princess Maud. The first and smaller 48 ft launch was rechristened Duchess of York. Again, both of these new passenger-carrying \\"pleasure boats\\" were replacements for war losses. The Hythe at Maldon alongside Cookie's Yard became the Southend Motor Navigation Co. 's regular winter-layup base after World War II. All three of the aforementioned S.M.N.Co. pleasure boats worked in the summer- holidaymaker river-excursion trade until the mid-1960s. These notes of the Southend Motor Navigation Co.'s long association with Cook's Yard are publicly posted \\"In Memoriam\\" for W.H.(\\"Bill\\") Wilson, by his oldest son Lloyd, who has treasured memories of playing around the Cook's Yard slipway during the winter lay-up periods from 1946‚Äì1953, and was often loaned one of Cookie's small yard work-boats, to perfect his rowing abilities. Walter Cook retired in 1946 and the yard was taken over by his son Clifford, who had been working there since 1919. G F Sully contracted Cook's yard to maintain all their barges, including the Hydrogen. Cooks were also contracted by the Leigh Building Company to maintain their fleet of barges, which suffered from very rough treatment and were constantly needing repair. Current use Clifford Cook retired in 1970 and the yard was bought by Barry Pearce and Gordon Swift, and later Roger Beckett. Cook's yard continued with barge maintenance and boat building until 1992, when the last shipwright left. In 1999, Topsail Charters took over the yard and restored shipwrighting and rigging to their traditional place by the river.

The litigation includes several cases including Hopkins v. De Beers Centenary A.G., et al., No. CGC-04-432954, which commenced on July 24, 2004, and Sullivan v. DB Investments, No. 04-cv-02819, and earlier related cases that commenced in 2001.  Allegations  The complaints charged that De Beers had created a global cartel in the markets of rough and polished diamonds ‚Äì with a market share that reached nearly as high as 90% - through aggressive management of supply and prices, and collusive agreements with competitors, suppliers, and distributors. This was a quintessential antitrust violation of the Sherman Act.Hopkins v. De Beers Centenary AG, No. CGC-04-432954, 2005 WL 1020868 (Cal. Sup. Ct., Apr. 15, 2005).  Settlement agreement  In October 2005, the parties reached a preliminary agreement to settle the claims of all indirect purchasers nationwide, with Sullivan serving as the procedural vehicle for seeking court approval of the settlement, notice and claims administration. Working out the details took three years between Plaintiffs' Counsel and De Beers.\\"Global diamond cartel is cut down to size,\\" Special to the National Law Journal, Oct. 6, 2008. On April 14, 2008, the Court conducted a fairness hearing and on May 27, 2008, granted final approval to the settlement.Sullivan v. DB Invs., Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81146 (D.N.J., May 22, 2008). The settlement provides $295 million to purchasers of diamonds and diamond jewelry, including $130 million to consumers. In addition, De Beers consented to a historic injunction that prohibits De Beers from monopolizing the world supply of rough diamonds and from fixing the price of polished diamonds. The injunction also requires De Beers to submit to the continuing jurisdiction of the United States District Court for enforcement of the injunction.\\"Diamond rebates may be coming,\\" The Chicago Tribune, January 22, 2008, p. 10. Commenting on the case, plaintiff's counsel Eric B. Fastiff of Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein stated that De Beers' offer to settle \\"showed that our strategy was correct. If you put litigation pressure and represent your client vigorously, eventually a guilty defendant will recognize that it needs to resolve its problems.\\" On May 21, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the final petition for review.

He began his music career at the age of 15 in a production of Bye Bye Birdie for J.C. Williamson Theatre Company. He also worked for a time recording musical sessions for local radio. Career  He was classically trained at Sydney Conservatorium of Music, where he studied piano, clarinet, theory and composition. Mackay was later head-hunted by EMI Australia, which initially employed him as a Recording Engineer but soon promoted him to \\"Head of Artists and Repertoire\\". During this time, Mackay was responsible for producing 30 hit singles and discovering some of Australia's most popular pop acts; he is probably best known in Australia as the producer of most of the Australian recordings made by The Twilights, one of Australia's most popular bands of the mid-1960s; his credits include the band's ambitious swansong Once Upon A Twilight. Mackay's Australian commercial success led to an internal transfer to the firm's United Kingdom offices, where Mackay went on to work at the legendary Abbey Road studios. Mackay eventually left EMI to set up his own independent company, June Productions Ltd. He also diversified into the medium of television, arranging and producing themes such as Coca- Cola's \\"I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing\\" as well as scores for BBC TV shows Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, Carla Lane's Bread and As Time Goes By. The Auf Wiedersehen, Pet project notably generated a hit single, \\"That's Livin' Alright\\", by Joe Fagin, which won Mackay an Ivor Novello Award and a BAFTA nomination. In both 1972 and 1973, Mackay conducted the orchestra for the UK's entries in the Eurovision Song Contest. The World Starts Tonight (1977) is the debut studio album by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler, released in February 1977 by RCA Records. Most of the songs were written by Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe, who worked as her managers while she was signed to RCA. They also produced the album alongside David Mackay. Musically, the album features country and pop songs. Natural Force (1978) is the second studio album by Tyler, released in May 1978 by RCA Records. In the United States, the album was titled It's a Heartache. As with her debut, Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe wrote most of the tracks on the album. David Mackay returned again to produce, with Scott and Wolfe. In 1990, Mackay and Jon English co-wrote a concept album, Paris, which has since been staged as a rock musical in Australia and elsewhere several times beginning in 2003. In 2002, Mackay's career came full circle as he returned to the world of musical theatre as a supervisor to a West End theatre production of 125th Street. In 2018, Bonnie Tyler announced that she would be working with Mackay, who co-produced her first two albums. Tyler and Mackay also collaborated on Frankie Miller's album Double Take (2016). In March 2019, Between the Earth and the Stars was released as the seventeenth studio album by Bonnie Tyler, and was produced by Mackay.

War work Yealland moved to London during World War I and worked at the National Hospital for the paralyzed and epileptic, there he mainly dealt with cases of hysteria. Yealland did not consider shell shock an illness, and believed men showing such symptoms displayed a lack of discipline or sense of duty. He practised a form of therapy based on punishment. He was an exponent of auto-suggestion. He gained a reputation for curing and sending his patients back to the trenches quickly. Yealland published his wartime findings in Hysterical Disorders of Warfare in 1918. Allegedly, Yealland claimed a success rate of 100 per cent, and while his methods of treatment were regarded as particularly unethical by the academic discourse of the 1980s, more recent research suggests that his ill-reputation might have come about owing to an over-representation of successful cases in Yealland's own works. In popular culture Lewis Yealland appears in Pat Barker's Regeneration, where he is portrayed unsympathetically, treating a shell-shocked man suffering from hysterical mutism using electric shock treatment and showing no compassion for his patient.

Poised to become one of the most notable sculptors of his time, he died at the age of 25. Education and career Bour√© studied at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux- Arts from 1837 to 1841, first under Guillaume Geefs in 1838 and then with Eug√®ne Simonis. In October 1841, he traveled to Italy and visited Rome, Florence and Pisa. His teacher Simonis wrote to him in 1842 on the value of studying in Florence: He began studies in 1842 at the workshop of Emilio Santarelli (1801‚Äì1886), rather than at the Florence academy, and earned the attention of Lorenzo Bartolini, who was struck by his precocious talent. He remained in Florence until 1844.Arto Dictionnaire, \\"Bour√©, Paul Joseph\\" biography. Bour√© returned to Belgium in 1844 and began to exhibit his works.

At the time, however, a reviewer characterized the work as an entirely physical treatment of the myth, admittedly modeled \\"with an astonishing power and vigor,\\" but failing to capture what was then a common view of Prometheus as a Christ-like figure symbolizing the struggle of doomed human intelligence. Bour√© himself was hailed as \\"on the way to becoming a truly distinguished artist.\\"Salon de 1845: Analyse critique de l'exposition des beaux-arts (Brussels, 1845), pp. 129‚Äì130, 240‚Äì253, full text online. In 1848, Bour√© showed Enfant jouant aux billes (Child Playing with Balls) and Sauvage surpris par un serpent (Savage Surprised by a Snake), earning the gold medal. The latter work in particular locates the artist at the intersection of classicism and Romanticism. Its serpentine struggle between human and animal has been compared to the Laoco√∂n theme in sculpture. Bour√© departs from the classical heroic conception by portraying his human subject as \\"without hope, already defeated, strangled and trapped, deprived of any possibility of fighting for liberty.\\"Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Fabritius catalogue , referencing Francisca Vandepitte, Le Romantisme en Belgique.
