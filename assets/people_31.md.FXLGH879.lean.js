Kamalpur, a hamlet on the border, was defended by 140 regular and paramilitary Pakistani soldiers under the command of Captain Ahsan Malik. The company-sized Pakistani unit fought against a brigade of Indian soldiers and Mukti Bahini as the Indian military made several unsuccessful attempts to overrun the Pakistani positions. After defending the area for 21 days, the besieged Pakistani troops were ordered by their superiors to surrender. The defending Pakistani troops suffered hardly any casualties, despite being subjected to repeated Indian artillery bombardment and air strikes. Start of hositilites Attacks against Pakistani border outposts in the north began in July. These were mounted by Mukti Bahini, mainly former members of East Pakistan's regular forces, but failed to make any damage. Further attacks on Kamalpur, a kilometre from the border, continued on 22 October and 14 November, the latter being carried out by the Indian Army's 13th Battalion, Brigade of the Guards (of Kler's brigade), which established blocking positions to the south. Malik was cut off and his CO, Lt. Col. Sultan Ahmed tried to relieve him and the other two outposts (Naqshi and Baromari, to the east) without success. On 29 November Major Ayub of 31 Baloch tried to resupply Malik's tiny garrison but failed.  Unsuccessful siege of Indian Army  Kler tried to take Kamalpur on the run, using Mukti Bahini troops, but failed. Later, Kler made two more attempts to overrun the Pakistani troops positions in Kamalpur, but likewise unsuccessfully. He then decided to mount an attack by the 1st Battalion, Maratha Light Infantry on the forty men and four 120mm mortars of 83 Mortar Battery belonging to Pakistan Army. 1st Battalion of Maratha Light Infantry successfully overran them, suffering one casualty. Kler then 'decided to lay siege to Kamalpur and break down its will to resist', according to Gen. Sukhwant Singh. After laying the siege, Kler launched a third attack on Pakistani positions in Kamalpur. However, the third attack met the same fate as previous two unsuccessful attacks. Failure of the third attack and resulting casualties had dispirited the attacking troops, and the higher command had developed second thought about Kler ability to handle live operations. Getting wary because of casualties, successive failures and demoralisation among the attacking troops, Kler decided to starve out the garrison by a prolonged siege.' Sukhwant Singh knew that there was no Pakistani artillery in this sector, only two troops of mortars, but states that Kler was '...further handicapped inasmuch as one of his battalions had just been reorganised from (a unit) raised initially for counterinsurgency with no support elements. In tackling a weak platoon post, another battalion brought out some weaknesses of leadership under fire. The battalion reached its objective with relatively few casualties. As expected, the enemy turned mortar fire on the objective. A mortar bomb landed on the trench occupied by four men close to the commanding officer (Colonel). He saw limbs fly and lost his nerve.'  Artillery and air strike  At about 09:30 on 4 December, after withdrawing his troops from close siege, Kler 'hammered the post with seven sorties of MiG-21s firing rockets and cannon and this was repeated twice later in the day'. Maj. Gen. Gurbux Singh (commander of the north region) himself entered affairs by sending Capt. Malik a note via a Mukti Bahini courier: \\"whatever you decide to do, we have every intention of eliminating Kamalpur post. It is to save you and our side casualties this message is being sent to you\\". He sent another note after a further air strike and this was met, as had been the other messages, by increased firing by Malik's men. But it could not go on, Malik received the order by radio to surrender, which he did at 1900 that day.  Outcome  Sukhwant Singh noted, 'Malik had put up a courageous stand ... and surrendered after holding a brigade of besiegers for 21 days ... Sam Manekshaw sent a personal congratulatory message to Malik commending his defiant stand.' and wrote 'Militarily his performance was excellent'. Maj. Gen. Gurbux Singh decided to meet Malik personally but, while being driven towards Kamalpur by Kler, their jeep went over a mine and he was badly wounded. When Capt. Malik's force was taken in, it was found that his company was nearly out of ammunition, barring a few hand grenades and a few bullets each. They were ready to fling themselves on the enemy with daggers and bayonets if it came to that, until they realised that the piece of territory they were defending was already a different country.

The gem measures 15,7 x 11,8 cm. The Gonzaga Cameo is a Hellenistic engraved gem; a cameo of the capita jugata variety cut out from the three layers of an Indian sardonyx, dating from perhaps the 3rd century BC.Gonzaga Cameo history It was a centrepiece of the Gonzaga collection of antiquities, first described in a 1542 inventory of Isabella d'Este's collection as representing Augustus and Livia. The figures were later identified as Alexander the Great and Olympias, Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, Nero and Agrippina the Younger, and many other famous couples of antiquity. The male figure on the cameo is clad in the attributes of Alexander, including a laurel-wreathed helmet, and wears a gorgoneion. His other aegis represents a bearded head, probably that of Zeus Ammon. The man's laurel wreath is crowned by a snake which suggests the uraeus. The contrasting male and female profiles were in all probability intended to suggest Zeus and Hera.Portraits of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II . The Hermitage Museum. Retrieved on 2009-05-15. The brown necklace is a later addition masking that the cameo was, at some point, broken in half.  Owners  Young Peter Paul Rubens, then in the employ of the Mantuan Duke, admired the Gonzaga cameo as the finest in existence. During the War of the Mantuan Succession it was carried off by the imperial troops to Vienna and was preserved in the Prague Castle treasury through the Thirty Years' War.–ü—Ç–æ–ª–µ–º–µ–π II –∏ –ê—Ä—Å–∏–Ω–æ—è (–ö–∞–º–µ—è –ì–æ–Ω–∑–∞–≥–∞). At the end of the conflict the Swedes marched into Prague and looted the imperial treasury. Several years later the cameo resurfaced in the collection of Queen Christina of Sweden. There is little record of its subsequent history. It is assumed that the Queen took it with her to Italy, bequeathing it to her favourite, Cardinal Decio Azzolini. It was subsequently acquired, with the rest of Christina's art collection, by Livio Odescalchi, Duke of Bracciano and nephew of Innocent XI.Ancient Rome website. In 1794 the cameo was part of Pius VI's collection in Vatican. The invading French took it with them to Paris where it entered the collection of Napoleon and Empress Jos√©phine. After Napoleon's downfall, Alexander I of Russia paid a visit to the Ch√¢teau de Malmaison and offered Jos√©phine every assistance in his power. As a sign of gratitude she presented the cameo to the Tsar.Scarisbrick, Diana. Life at Malmaison . // Apollo, 5th Nov 2007. Since then, the so-called Malmaison cameo has been kept in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. In Vienna there is a rival Hellenistic cameo, of lesser quality,Karl Gotfried M√ºller. Ancient Art and Its Remains. London, 1852. Page 136.Johann Georg Heck. Iconographic Encyclop√¶dia of Science, Literature, and Art. New York City, 1851. Page 24. which the Habsburgs also described as the \\"Gonzaga cameo\\", probably on assumption that it had not been stolen by the Swedes in 1648. This results in considerable confusion between the two.  Subject  The cameo shows the profiles of a man and a woman which conceivably possess family likeness. This capita jugata type of portrait, showing two superimposed profiles, is known from the coins issued by Ptolemy II Philadelphus in Hellenistic Egypt. Such portraits show Ptolemy with his sister and wife, Arsinoe II. Ptolemy was the first Hellenistic ruler to marry his sister; and it was at his court that the image of the twin deities, theoi adelphoi, gained currency. To shore up the identification, it has been argued that the woman's head on the cameo is covered with a sort of bridal veil. J. J. Pollitt of Yale University believes that it is the Vienna cameo that represents Ptolemy and Arsinoe.Pollitt, Jerome Jordan. Art in the Hellenistic Age. Cambridge University Press, 1986. . Pages 23-24. As for the Saint Petersburg cameo, Pollitt argues that the sharply defined quality of the \\"neoclassical\\" workmanship indicates a later date than is commonly recognized. He identifies the figures as Tiberius and Livia represented \\"in very generalized form so that they would simultaneously evoke the imagery of a Ptolemaic cameo and, through it, the imagery of Alexander\\".

It is the second book of The Serpentwar Saga, preceded by Shadow of a Dark Queen and followed by Rage of a Demon King. Plot summary Erik von Darkmoor and Rupert Avery (Roo), have returned to Krondor after serving in Calis special unit that was sent down to the continent of Novindus. Erik plans on staying in the army as a corporal in the coming war, and Roo states that he plans on becoming a rich trader. After being pardoned of their crimes by Borric, King of the Kingdom of the Isles, Erik and Roo begin a journey to visit their family in the town of Ravensburg. In an inn along the way, they meet one of Roo's cousins, Duncan, who decides to travel with Roo on the promise of becoming rich. Once in Ravensburg, Erik visits his mother, who faints on the sight of him, as they were told that Erik and Roo were hanged. After a quick explanation, Erik learns from his childhood friend, Rosalyn, that Stefan von Darkmoor, who raped her, is the father of her young child. Roo meets up with his father while buying a wagon, and it is quickly apparent that Roo's father cannot bully him around anymore, and rents out his services as a teamster to Roo. The plot centers primarily on the rise of Roo as an important merchant in Krondor. In the background we see a little of the progression of the war: Erik leaves with a group of special forces to re-infiltrate the den of the Pantathian Serpent Priests, Duke James follows Roo's rise from the sidelines, and steps in from time to time to help. Erik invested his share of the bounty with Roo who tried to parallel import wine from his native Ravensburg into Krondor. Running afoul of the underworld guild of the Mockers, Roo lost everything and had to start from scratch again by working in Barret‚Äôs Coffee House, an establishment similar to the real-world Lloyd's Coffee House. The job gave him an opportunity to have another go at business and Roo eventually becomes possibly the richest man in the Western Realm by exploiting a shortage of grain in the free cities and through it forming the Bitter Sea Trading Company. Roo marries the daughter of his first business partner Karli and has a number of children but at the same time starts an affair with Sylvia Esterbrook, a callous but beautiful woman who seduces Roo under the orders of her father and Roo's Principal business rival Jacob Esterbrook. Near the end of the book, we follow the war more closely, as Miranda, Calis, Erik, and their squad find that there is a \\"third player\\" at work‚Äîsomeone is already slaughtering the Pantathians. It turns out to be a demon. This greatly aids their quest, as it is a tremendous distraction to the Serpents. As they delve deeper into the mountain they find that the Pantathians have used thousands of human sacrifices to infuse life force into a gem as a \\"key\\" to open the Lifestone. But Calis discovers something unexpected‚Äîthe Key is not what it appears. Nor are the Dragon Lord artifacts they find. Something has contaminated them. Miranda brings the Key and a Dragon Lord helmet to Elvandar, where Pug, Tomas, and the Spellweavers attempt to discern its use. Erik tosses the rest of the artifacts into lava, which releases tremendous energy. He, Calis, and a small squad escape the mountains, but their way home is lost. They are eventually rescued by Nakor and Roo, who decided to sail to Novindus to save them. The book ends with many unanswered questions: who is the \\"third party\\" at work? how were the artifacts corrupted and why? is another force after the Lifestone? are demons somehow involved, fooling the Pantathians? Reception Dean Evans reviewed Rise of a Merchant Prince for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Evans comments that \\"the book is excellently written but, like an old car on a winter's morn, it takes a while to get going. But when Feist does eventually get into his narrative stride, he writes with a colourful verbosity. I'm a sucker for his sagas and this one is far from the expected gap-filling potboiler. All in all, it's a great read.\\" References Category:1995 novels Category:1995 fantasy novels Category:American fantasy novels Category:HarperCollins books Category:Novels by Raymond E.

These four acres (1.6 ha) include 27 houses mostly built in the late 19th century. Unlike some of the city's other residential historic districts, Balding Avenue was a middle class neighborhood, and its houses still reflect that. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Geography The district consists of Balding Avenue between its southern end at Mansion Street and the next intersection to the north at Marshall Street, and the lots of every house with a Balding address in that corridor. The southern end is just at the northern boundary of downtown Poughkeepsie, with several other historic buildings. The Queen Anne Style house at 73 Mansion is right on the corner (it was excluded from the district because it was a different size and shape from the Balding houses), and next to it is the Poughkeepsie post office. Across Mansion are the offices of the Poughkeepsie Journal. This block of Balding is shaded with large trees along the side of the street. Within the district, the houses are of similar designs, ranging from two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half stories in height. All have clapboard siding. Various Victorian-era architectural styles are in evidence, from Second Empire to Queen Anne. Four houses in the Hudson River bracketed style are arranged in a row from 6-12 Balding. All these houses exhibit a modest amount of ornament. Poughkeepsie's other historic districts recognize the homes of the wealthy (Academy Street, Garfield Place) or the working class (Union Street, Mill Street-North Clover Street). This is the only one in a middle-class neighborhood, as suggested by the minimal use of decorative detailing on the houses. Only one home, at 1 Balding, is not considered a contributing property to the district. It was built in 1924, after the district's period of significance, two decades after all of the other houses had been completed. History An 1867 map of the city lists Balding Avenue as a proposed street. It must have been built shortly thereafter, as the first houses on it, 14 and 27 Balding, both in the Second Empire style, were built in 1872. Six more followed, mainly in the middle of the block, during the rest of the 1870s. Most of the district was built out over the 1880s and '90s. Local architect Percival M. Lloyd, designed the classically detailed 32 Balding, the only house on the street for whom the architect is known, in 1896. In the 1900s, 4 and 11 Balding closed out this building boom. The other corner lot at Mansion Street, 1 Balding, was finally built on in 1924. There has been no significant construction or modification since.

It was originally developed by Fox Williams under the name Barney & Clyde, and they ported it to the Sega Genesis for which it was published by Sunsoft under license from Audiogenic. The game is a childlike Sci-Fi fantasy platform game in which players control a little human boy named Bubble along with recent alien acquaintance Squeak. The Platform levels are separated by brief underwater scrolling shooter bonus segments. Story The story takes place on the planet Grool, a planet inhabited by mostly short, anthropomorphous felines. The idyllic and mundane lifestyle of the feline aliens is interrupted when an alien invader known as Kat of Nine Tails kidnaps Grool's sentient populace, inadvertently leaving one of them, Squeak, behind. Shortly after, Squeak encounters a human boy known only as Bubble who agrees to rescue Squeak's captured populace. Gameplay Players controlled Bubble and at any time during gameplay could command Squeak to either 'follow' or 'wait' for him. Squeak, who was invulnerable to enemies and enemy fire, had his own AI and would help collect items or give Bubble a boost via piggy-back, letting Squeak toss him up to tall heights or by simply standing on top of Squeak's head. Collectable items included gems, coins, and a submersible icon which was necessary to play the shooter stages; some items could be picked up and carried to other locations such as springs, but the only items the player could pick up in the shooter stages were extra lives and Speed-ups. In both modes of gameplay (collecting and shooting), Bubble was equipped with unlimited ammunition, either stars or torpedoes.

It was not until 1990 the company, then marketed under the name Misfortune Kookies and based in Fort Wayne, Indiana, started producing its first five flavors: strawberry, lemon, orange, blueberry, and mint. Their cookies included 100 different comical fortunes, and were carried by Bloomingdale's retail chain, as well as other retail outlets.Huntington Herald-Press newspaper, 1990 In 1992, the company relocated to Indianapolis, Indiana, and seven years later moved to its present location and doubled the size of its production facility. The company created an online retail site in 1995, making it the first on-line seller of flavored and gourmet fortune cookies. It appeared in The Johnson Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation's 100 Growth report for Indiana businesses two consecutive years, in 1998 and 1999. The company continued to innovate, introducing giant fortune cookies in 1999. In 2011 they began selling caramel-dipped fortune cookies, another innovation because they don't require special shipping like chocolate-dipped cookies do.

Background Marie-Louise Giraud, at the age of 39, was guillotined on the morning of July 30, 1943, in the courtyard of the prison de la Roquette in Paris by executioner Jules-Henri Desfourneaux for having performed 27 abortions in the region of Cherbourg. She was the only faiseuse d'anges (French slang: literally \\"maker of angels\\") to be executed for this reason. A man was also beheaded the same year for three abortions. Coming from a poor family, Giraud was married to a sailor, with whom she had two children. She worked as a domestic housekeeper and laundress. From the beginning of World War II, she also rented rooms to prostitutes. She began to perform abortions, initially without compensation. Political context The law of 1920, which criminalized abortion, had the following aims: * to fill the hole in the population due to the bloodshed of the 1914-1918 war * to boost the birth rate, which was chronically lower in France than in neighboring countries (including Germany), and had been for over a century The law of March 27, 1923, stated that whoever caused the miscarriage of a woman shall be punished by one to five years imprisonment and a fine of 500 to 10,000 FF. Also, the woman who had aborted risked six months to two years in prison. A person charged with abortion was judged not by a jury, but by a panel of judges, as juries were believed to be swayed too easily by emotion. In 1935, paralleling a similar movement in the United States, Dr. Jean Dalsace opened Suresnes (Hauts-de-Seine), the first birth control clinic. However, on July 29, 1939, a month before the invasion of Poland, the criminal penalties for abortion were increased. Economic deprivation, food shortages, and the separation of a large number of married couples (1.9 million French prisoners of war interned in Germany) led to pregnancies - out of wedlock or not - becoming fewer, but there was a greater demand for abortions, frequently for the victims of forced relationships with the occupying force. Therefore, the Law of February 15, 1942, made abortion a crime against state security, punishable by the death penalty. The law was repealed after the Lib√©ration. The trial At trial, the President stressed the \\"immorality\\" of the accused. Twenty-seven women had used Giraud's services. According to the Advocate General, the death penalty was \\"necessary\\" in Giraud's case. The court sentenced Giraud to death. Only a presidential pardon could save her life, but Marshal P√©tain refused to commute the sentence. Remarks At the same time in 1942, the recently created College of Physicians was allowed to perform abortions not only if the mother's life was in danger, but also when her health was seriously compromised. Switzerland was also among the first countries to allow abortions if the life or health of the mother was in danger. In July 2004, abortions under a physician's supervision were certified by the French Ministry of Health after the legalization of abortion in 1975.

The Charlotte Meeting House was built in 1840 by the Methodist congregation of Charlotte, Vermont. In 1952 it was moved to the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont. It now serves as an exhibit building on the museum grounds.Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc. History The building was originally erected by the Charlotte Methodist Church in 1840, after their original wooden structure was destroyed in a fire in 1837. By 1899 it had ceased to function as a church and was taken over by a group of thirteen young women who had formed an amateur theatrical group and used the building as a playhouse.The Charlotte News, December 2, 2004 In 1902, the group incorporated as the Breezy Point Library Association and bought the building to serve as the town library. Charles W. Henry, Vermont's foremost painted theater curtain artist, often painted backdrops for the association's productions. After a windstorm damaged the building in 1950, the association voted to sell it to the Shelburne Museum so that it could be preserved.http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=16 In 1952, the Shelburne Museum dismantled the building and moved it to its grounds, finding replacements for missing or damaged elements, including the belfry, pews, and pulpit, in an abandoned church in Milton, Vermont. The interior plaster walls were painted in tones of white and grey to resemble paneled woodwork (see Trompe-l'≈ìil). Architecture The structure reflects the stylistic tendencies established in the last decade of the 18th century when the church plan became the standard on which meeting houses were designed. The church plan refers to a rectangular structure with a pitched roof and incorporated bell tower, with the entrance located along the structure's short axis and the pulpit positioned opposite. Since the church plan and the word \\"church\\" connoted Anglicanism, Puritan communities used the term \\"meeting house\\" to refer to the building they used for both secular and religious meetings. Puritans, and later Congregationalists, traditionally constructed their meeting houses on a square or rectangular plan with hipped roofs, a separate bell tower, and the entrance and pulpit situated on the long sides of the building. By the late eighteenth century, as communities began to distinguish between meeting houses and churches, Protestant communities adopted both the title \\"church\\" and the associated plan in designing their religious buildings. The Meeting House's triangular pediment, accented with cornice moldings, reflects the pervasiveness of Greek Revival architecture in the mid-nineteenth century. The lack of other adornment, typical of the Greek Revival style, lent itself well to New England Protestant architecture.

Plot Peter Denver (Van Heflin), a renowned Broadway producer, is attending a party hosted by the viciously haughty and celebrated actress Carlotta \\"Lottie\\" Marin (Ginger Rogers) and her quiet husband Brian Mullen (Reginald Gardiner) when he meets Nancy \\"Nanny\\" Ordway (Peggy Ann Garner). The seemingly na√Øve Ordway, a 20-year-old, aspiring writer, says she hopes to make it big in New York. She convinces a reluctant Denver to persuade his wife, Iris (Gene Tierney) ‚Äî another famous actress, who is temporarily out of town ‚Äî to agree to Nancy's use of the couple's apartment to write in during the day. After the Denvers return from the airport and find Nancy hanging dead in their bathroom, a variety of people Ordway has recently met in New York begin to reveal deeper and darker connections with her. Lt. Bruce (George Raft), the detective assigned to the case, soon discovers that this apparent suicide was in fact a homicide. Further, he believes that Denver, who is suspected of having had an affair with Ordway, is the murderer. Denver evades arrest and seeks clues to discover the real murderer. The case becomes further complicated when he and Lt. Bruce independently realize that Ordway's dealings in New York belie her apparent innocence. Ordway had recently stayed for a time with her uncle and then moved in with a woman roommate, whose brother she evidently had agreed to marry, as well as staying for some time with her uncle. A series of flashbacks reveal that Ordway was craftily piecing together a scheme that would help her both to climb the social ladder and to later conceal the identity of her secret lover by falsely implicating Denver. This mysterious romance is confirmed by an autopsy, which reveals that Ordway was pregnant at the time of her death. Everyone Ordway knows is suddenly a suspect in the murder case, including Lottie Marin and Brian Mullen, who live in the same apartment building as the Denvers. In the end, Mullen can no longer keep silent and reveals to his friend Peter Denver that he was Ordway's secret lover, but swears that he didn't kill her. Having bugged Mullen's apartment, Lt. Bruce barges in and charges Mullen with the homicide. Lottie finally admits that she murdered Nancy Ordway for having had the affair with her husband, whom she later intended to blackmail. Lottie set up the killing to look like a suicide. Cast * Ginger Rogers as Carlotta \\"Lottie\\" Marin * Van Heflin as Peter Denver * Gene Tierney as Iris Denver * George Raft as Detective Lt. C. A.

Studio head Darryl Zanuck assigned the project to Nunnally Johnson, who worked on it after writing the script for How to Marry a Millionaire (1953). Johnson then made his debut as director on Night People (1954) starring Gregory Peck, and Peck was announced as the Black Widow male lead, which was, however, eventually played‚Äîafter being passed on by William Holden‚Äîby Van Helflin. Johnson said the film would be the \\"All About Eve of suspense pictures.\\" Nunnally Johnson had offered the role of flamboyant stage actress Carlotta Marin to flamboyant stage actress Tallulah Bankhead, Johnson's first choice for the role, then to Joan Crawford, who was not interested. Bankhead had declined the role as too small; it was successfully offered to Ginger Rogers (whose role in Johnson's 1952 production We're Not Married! had also been declined by Bankhead). Rogers was accorded top billing in Black Widow.New York Daily News 21 May 1954 \\"Hollywood Today\\" by Hedda Hopper p.C16San Francisco Examiner 21 April 1954 \\"Joan Crawford, William Holden & Maggie M'Namara Sought For Chiller\\" by Louella Parsons p.31Rochester Democrat Chronicle 31 May 1954 \\"Ginger Rogers to Return From Europe For Role\\" by Louella Parsons p.12 Johnson's first choice for the role of Nanny Ordway, 20th-Century-Fox-contractee Maggie McNamara, was cast in the role but soon sidelined by illness, with her Three Coins in the Fountain co-star Jean Peters being expected to replace her. However, the role of Nanny Ordway would ultimately afford a brief cinematic comeback to former child star (at 20th Century Fox) Peggy Ann Garner. Johnson had tested Garner for Black Widow on the recommendation of cinematographer Charles G. Clarke who, while overseeing location footage for Black Widow in New York City, had happened to cross paths with Garner whom he'd worked with on Junior Miss nine years earlier.Atlanta Constitution 1 October 1954 \\"Peggy Ann Garner in Luck at Last\\" by Ed Sullivan p.28 Johnson did successfully recruit gangster film icon George Raft to play against type as an investigating police officer. According to Johnson, Raft would show up on set word-perfect and looking no older at age fifty-four than he had at age thirty-nine. Reception When the film was released, The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther panned the screenplay and the actors, writing that \\"Black Widow, which was discovered at the Roxy yesterday, bears little or no resemblance to the recent local spider scourge, except that it is moderately intriguing and considerably overplayed. It is merely an average whodunit, stretched out on the CinemaScope screen and performed by a fancy cast of actors so that it looks more important than it is ... The major fly in the ointment‚Äîor, should we say, in the web‚Äîis Peggy Ann Garner, playing the little Southern girl. Miss Garner's endeavors to give out with a rush of peach-blossom charm are beclouded with affectation. And the idea that she could be the greedy and ruthless little vixen that is finally revealed is hard to believe ... And, finally, the shrill and shoddy character that Ginger Rogers plays‚Äîa poison-tongued Broadway actress‚Äîis indifferently written and performed. It is asking a lot of an audience to believe that she could display anything but clothes. George Raft as a poker-faced detective acts with flat- toned indifference, too, and Gene Tierney and Reginald Gardiner barely manage to live through their roles.\\" Film critic Dennis Schwartz panned the film in 2011, opining that \\"It's a flimsy story that is apathetically written, poorly paced and overacted with shrill performances by both Ginger Rogers and Peggy Ann Garner. The B-film crime drama might have been better served as a cheapie production, with some of its filler scenes lopped off.\\"Schwartz, Dennis , Ozus' World Movie Reviews film review, July 5, 2008; accessed February 9, 2011. Craig Butler, however, reviewing it for AllMovie, calls the film \\"entertaining\\" and notes that the \\"cinematography is frequently stunning\\". He refers to some \\"marvelous dialogue\\", noting \\"the film moves along at a nice, steady clip\\" and stating that \\"it's enough fun that most viewers will overlook ‚Ä¶[the] flaws\\". He praises Garner and Rogers, noting the latter's \\"standout performance\\".Butler, Craig. Film review at allmovie.com; accessed March 17, 2014.

He was a captain at the time, serving in the 31st Battalion, Baloch Regiment. Defence of Kamalpur Attacks against Pakistani border outposts in the north began in July. These were mounted by Mukti Bahini, mainly former members of East Pakistan's regular forces, but failed to make any impression. Further attacks on Kamalpur, a kilometre from the border, came on 22 October and 14 November, the latter being made by the Indian Army's 13th Battalion, Brigade of the Guards (of Kler's brigade), which established blocking positions to the south. Malik was cut off and his CO, Lt. Col. Sultan Ahmed tried to relieve him and the other two outposts (Naqshi and Baromari, to the east) without success. On 29 November Major Ayub of 31 Baloch tried to resupply Malik's tiny garrison but failed. Kler tried to take Kamalpur on the run, using Mukti Bahini troops, and failed. He then mounted an attack by the 1st Battalion, Maratha Light Infantry on the forty men and four 120mm mortars of 83 Mortar Battery and overran them, suffering one casualty. Kler then 'decided to lay siege to Kamalpur and break down its will to resist', according to Gen. Sukhwant Singh. Getting wary because of casualties, successive failures and demoralisation among the attacking troops, he decided to starve out the garrison by a prolonged siege.' Sukhwant Singh knew that there was no Pakistani artillery in this sector, only two troops of mortars, but states that Kler was '...further handicapped inasmuch as one of his battalions had just been reorganised from (a unit) raised initially for counterinsurgency with no support elements. In tackling a weak platoon post, another battalion brought out some weaknesses of leadership under fire. The battalion reached its objective with relatively few casualties. As expected, the enemy turned mortar fire on the objective. A mortar bomb landed on the trench occupied by four men close to the commanding officer (Colonel). He saw limbs fly and lost his nerve.' At about 0930 on 4 December, after withdrawing his troops from close siege, Kler 'hammered the post with seven sorties of MiG-21s firing rockets and cannon and this was repeated twice later in the day'. Maj. Gen. Gurbux Singh (commander of the north region) himself entered affairs by sending Capt. Malik a note via a Mukti Bahini courier: '...whatever you decide to do we have every intention of eliminating Kamalpur post. It is to save you and our side casualties this message is being sent to you ...' He sent another note after a further air strike and this was met, as had been the other messages, by increased firing by Malik's men. But it could not go on, Malik received the order by radio to surrender, which he did at 1900 that day. Sukhwant Singh stated, 'He had put up a courageous stand ... and surrendered after holding a brigade of besiegers for 21 days ... Sam Manekshaw sent a personal congratulatory message to Malik commending his defiant stand.' and wrote 'Militarily his performance was excellent'. Maj. Gen. Gurbux Singh decided to meet Malik personally but, while being driven towards Kamalpur by Kler, their jeep went over a mine and he was badly wounded. When Capt. Malik's force was taken in, it was found that his company was nearly out of ammunition, barring a few hand grenades and a few bullets each. They were ready to fling themselves on the enemy with daggers and bayonets if it came to that, until they realised that the piece of territory they were defending was already a different country. When he returned to Pakistan, he was decorated with a Sitara-e-Jurrat which is the third highest military award in Pakistan. Later on, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army at the time, acknowledged the bravery of Malik's men in a letter written to his Pakistani counterpart. He even wrote a personal letter to Malik.

He was an Arctic guide and interpreter who played an important role in exploration of the Northwest Territories of Canada. Guide and chief He was a Metis, the son of Fran√ßois Beaulieu and Ethiba, a woman of Chipewyan and Cree descent. The circumstances of his childhood are speculation at present. As a young man, requested for his knowledge of the region, Beaulieu accompanied Sir Alexander Mackenzie on his overland trek to the Pacific in 1793. In 1820 he met Arctic explorer, John Franklin, and provided him with valuable information regarding a base camp on the Dease Arm of Great Bear Lake for his planned exploration to the mouth of the Coppermine River. (Franklin was unable to follow Beaulieu's advice, possibly resulting in the loss of life on that journey). Beaulieu was the guide and interpreter on the second expedition from 1825‚Äì27 which was based at Fort Franklin on the west shore of Great Bear Lake. His knowledge and input into the planning and completion of this trip made it the most successful of its kind in the Canadian Arctic. Beaulieu was well known as a chief of his tribe as well. As a chief of the Yellowknife tribe, Beaulieu became the \\"terror\\" of the neighboring tribes of Dogribs, Slaveys and Sekanis; he is said to have killed 12 of the last group with his own hand. He and his followers settled on the Salt River, where he maintained a trade in salt retrieved from the river with the Hudson's Bay Company, which granted him a monopoly. He was still active as a hunter at the age of 85 and lived to be just over 100. Through marriage, he was a brother- in-law of Yellowknives chief Akaitcho, whom he succeeded as chief. He died at the Salt River settlement in November 1872, his 101st year, though the date of his death is somewhat unsure. Salt River, NWT John Franklin's 1819-1820 expedition map showing Salt River, N.W.T. In his book En route pour la mer Glaciale Emile Petitot recounts his visit with Francois Beaulieu in 1862 at Salt River (near Fort Smith). \\"That same night we set up our tent at Salt River. It is an undrinkable river whose source is the Caribou Mountains. The salt of this river is deposited naturally on the shore where a great quantity is taken to supply all the forts and missions of the north. This river belongs to its discoverer, a French Metis called Beaulieu, who has worked a piece of land into a nice farm where he lives with several of his children. He is one of the oldest who witnessed the events that happened in the north. His father, a Frenchman, was a coureur de bois working for the \\"Compagnie des Sioux\\". He came to this region that no one in Canada knew about. His son, our hero, who he had from a Chipewyan wife, saw arrive, in 1780, the first explorer of Great Slave Lake, Peter Pond; then in 1789, Sir Alexander Mackenzie. His uncle, Jacques Beaulieu, served as interpreter for the first of the officers of the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company. Himself at 18, accompanied to Great Bear Lake another Mackenzie who was a professional hunter. In 1825, he was the interpreter of Sir John Franklin. Chosen by the Yellowknife tribe as their chief, Beaulieu became the terror of the Dogribs, the Slaveys and the Sekanis of whom he killed a dozen, around Fort Halkett. This Metis sultan, \\"sybarite\\" of the desert, who was of French blood but raised like a pagan, had three wives; one Cree, one Dene and one Metis. He also had children in all the tribes he had visited, without counting six married children, fathers and mothers or grown children, that lived with him. In 1845, Beaulieu, saw the first Canadian missionary, Father Jean-Baptiste Thibault, at Portage La Loche. The faith of his father, that covered his pagan soul, was awakened. He became a serious convert, put away two of his wives and kept only the old Metis woman with whom he would remain faithful. He helped the others, returned their children, and insured that they were fed and supported. After that, the patriarch, which is what Beaulieu was called in this place, retired to Salt River, and sold its produce to the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company. The salt, the crops from his fields, milk from his cows, fish \\"coregone\\" from the Slave River, and the hunt, was ample enough to assure him and his dependents an easy life. He also traded in furs. When I saw Beaulieu, in 1862, he was 85 years old, yet he still hunted by himself, travelled hundreds of miles, running behind his dogs. He died a few days after his birthday at 101 years old, leaving behind a brother in law named Poitras who was almost as old as him.\\" (translation of pages 312 to 314) Personal life In 1848, 'Old Man Beaulieu' was baptized by Father Alexandre-Antonin Tach√©, O.M.I., at Portage La Loche and became an active adherent to the Roman Catholic religion, as a result of which, at the age of 80, he dismissed two of his wives. He thereafter spent much energy promoting the Catholic faith.

The result has been widely used to construct non-Hamiltonian planar graphs with further properties, such as to give new counterexamples to Tait's conjecture (originally disproved by W.T. Tutte in 1946). This theorem was proved by Latvian mathematician Emanuel Grinberg in 1968.  Formulation  Let G be a finite planar graph with a Hamiltonian cycle C, with a fixed planar embedding. Denote by ∆ík and gk the number of k-gonal faces of the embedding that are inside and outside of C, respectively. Then : \\\\sum_{k \\\\geq 3} (k-2) (f_k-g_k) = 0. The proof is an easy consequence of Euler's formula. As a corollary of this theorem, if an embedded planar graph has only one face whose number of sides is not 2 mod 3, and the remaining faces all have numbers of sides that are 2 mod 3, then the graph is not Hamiltonian. In this case, only the first face contributes to the mod-3 value of the sum, and it causes the sum to be nonzero. The factor of k ‚àí 2 in the contributions for the other faces causes their contributions to be zero mod 3. For instance, for the graph in the figure, all the bounded faces have 5 or 8 sides, but the unbounded face has 9 sides, so it satisfies this condition and is not Hamiltonian. Applications Grinberg used his theorem to find non-Hamiltonian cubic polyhedral graphs with high cyclic edge connectivity. The cyclic edge connectivity of a graph is the smallest number of edges whose deletion leaves a subgraph with more than one cyclic component. The 46-vertex Tutte graph, and the smaller cubic non- Hamiltonian polyhedral graphs derived from it, have cyclic edge connectivity three. Grinberg used his theorem to find a non-Hamiltonian cubic polyhedral graph with 44 vertices, 24 faces, and cyclic edge connectivity four, and another example (shown in the figure) with 46 vertices, 25 faces, and cyclic edge connectivity five, the maximum possible cyclic edge connectivity for a cubic planar graph other than K4. In the example shown, all of the bounded faces have either five or eight edges, both of which are numbers that are 2 mod 3, but the unbounded face has nine edges, unequal to 2 mod 3. Therefore, by the corollary to Grinberg's theorem, the graph cannot be Hamiltonian. Grinberg's theorem has also been used to find planar hypohamiltonian graphs, graphs that are not Hamiltonian but that can be made Hamiltonian by removing any single vertex. The construction again makes all but one face have a number of edges congruent to 2 mod 3 (, ). uses the theorem in a somewhat more complicated way to find a planar cubic hypohamiltonian graph: the graph he constructs includes a 4-edge face adjacent to four 7-edge faces, and all other faces have five or eight edges. In order to satisfy Grinberg's theorem, a Hamiltonian cycle would have to separate one of the 4- or 7-edge faces from the other four, which is not possible. Limitations There exist planar non- Hamiltonian graphs in which all faces have five or eight sides. For these graphs, Grinberg's formula taken modulo three is always satisfied by any partition of the faces into two subsets, preventing the application of his theorem to proving non-Hamiltonicity in this case . It is not possible to use Grinberg's theorem to find counterexamples to Barnette's conjecture, that every cubic bipartite polyhedral graph is Hamiltonian. Every cubic bipartite polyhedral graph has a partition of the faces into two subsets satisfying Grinberg's theorem, regardless of whether it also has a Hamiltonian cycle .  References  *.

(April 5, 1716 ‚Äì May 17, 1774) was a Swiss-born American painter, primarily of portraits. He was active mainly around Charleston, South Carolina, in which city he remained almost without competition for the bulk of his career.Biography at the Worcester Museum of Art LifeEarly life and career= Mrs Thomas Lynch, 1755, Reynolda House Museum of American Art Theus was born in the city of Chur, in the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden, and was the eldest child of Simeon and Anna Walser The√ºs. He was nineteen when he immigrated with his family to the Province of South Carolina, whose General Assembly had provided land grants and transport funds to encourage European Protestants to settle in the colony. Simeon The√ºs was given of land along the Edisto River in what was then Orangeburgh Township, today Orangeburg County. By 1740, the younger Theus was in Charleston, advertising in the South Carolina Gazette: > Notice is hereby given, that Jeremiah Theus Limner is remov‚Äôd into the > Market Square near Mr. John Laurans Sadler, where all Gentlemen and Ladies > may have their Pictures drawn, likewise Landskips of all Sizes, Crests, and > Coats of Arms for Coaches or Chaises. Likewise for the Conveniency of those > who live in the Country, he is willing to wait on them at their respective > Plantations.South-Carolina Gazette, August 30 ‚Äì September 6, 1740. He established his studio in a central location, the northeast corner of Broad and Meeting Streets. Just what degree of training he received is unknown; given that opportunities to study art were limited in Charleston at the time, however, it seems likely that he had received some training while he was still in Switzerland. Theus was twenty-eight in 1744, yet he already felt confident enough in his abilities to open an evening drawing school in his home.South- Carolina Gazette, October 22, 1744; it ran again on October 29 and November 5, 1744. Theus took on a variety of commissions during his early career, including painting and guilding the steeple of St. Michael's Episcopal Church in 1756, a job for which the congregation's commissioners paid him 77 pounds and 10 shillings for his labor and supplies. He also painted the weather vane, and contributed 50 pounds towards the building fund for a new structure; he later owned a pew in the church. Portrait of Suzanna Moore Smyth, 1755. San Antonio Museum of Art =Later years= Theus was able to build a highly successful practice for himself in the three decades he spent in Charleston; this was due largely to the fact that for much of that time he was the only painter in town with any significant reputation. Perhaps his greatest competition came from English-born and -trained John Wollaston, who visited the city in 1765 and remained for about two years before returning to England. It seems likely that the latter painter influenced Theus to some extent; among the decorative touches he preferred for his work were dresses trimmed with ermine, for his female sitters, and a marble tabletop, both of which began appearing in portraits by Theus at about the time Wollaston was in Charleston. The very end of his career also saw the rise to popularity of Philadelphia- born Henry Benbridge, who had received training in Italy and had migrated to South Carolina not long after his return home; he would soon replace Theus as the most popular painter in the city.Saunders, Richard H. and Ellen G. Miles. American Colonial Portraits ¬∑ 1700‚Äì1776. Washington, D.C.; Smithsonian Institution Press, 1987. Mrs. Jacob Motte (Rebecca Brewton), c. 1758, watercolor on ivory, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art Theus died in Charleston in 1774; his death was noted in at least three local papers, including The South-Carolina and American General Gazette and the South Carolina Gazette, both of which referred to him in their obituary notices as both \\"ingenious\\" and \\"honest\\". His will is dated September 15, 1770, with a codicil added on March 14, 1774, and directs that his paintings, prints, paints, and books should be sold to provide support for his family. At the estate sale, one Edward Oats purchased \\"\\"a great many PORTRAITS of Men, Women, and Children\\" with the intent of finding interested buyers for the set; whether or not he was able to sell the paintings off is unknown. The will reveals how successful Theus was in his chosen profession; besides holding nearly 3,000 pounds in cash, he owned a house in Charleston, of land in Orangeburgh Township, a town lot in Orangeburgh, and seven slaves. He had also, before his death, given 2,100 pounds to the children of his first marriage. =Personal life= Elizabeth Theus 1742-1797, age 23, first child of Theus and Elizabeth Shaumloffel wearing a musket & powder horn crown and colonial militia outfit, ready to fight for freedom. Theus married twice during his time in Charleston. His first wife, whom he wed on January 13, 1741, was Cathrina Elizabeth Shauml√∂ffel, daughter of one John Shauml√∂ffel of Orangeburgh Township; she was just 17 at the time of the wedding. The couple would go on to have five children together. Cathrina died in 1754 while giving birth to the sixth, who died at birth. In the following year, Theus married again, this time to a widow named Eva Rosanna Hilt. The wedding likely took place around September, because in that month the artist purchased a brick house at the corner of Mazyck (today Logan) and Broad Streets in Charleston. Theus and his second wife would have four children. Work Portrait of a Man (Probably Isaac Holmes), 1755, oil on canvas, in the Worcester Art Museum Theus typically confined himself to uncomplicated compositions, and the bulk of his portraits are bust-length works, approximately thirty by twenty-five inches at their largest; like many portraitists of the era, he also produced miniatures. Three larger-scale works by him exist. The first, a portrait of Elizabeth, wife of Peter Manigault, dates to 1757, and was meant to be the pendant to a portrait by Allan Ramsay. That Manigault was familiar with Theus' work may be seen by the letter he wrote to his mother, which accompanied the Ramsay portrait home in April 1751, in which he wrote that \\"I desire Mr Theus may see it, as soon as convenient after it arrives....I‚Äôll be extremely obliged to you, if you‚Äôll let me know his Judgement...\\"Peter Manigault, London, to Ann Ashby Manigault, Charleston, April 15, 1751, as quoted in Webber 1930, 277‚Äì78 The source of Mrs. Manigault's pose is unknown, but is believed to have been taken from an English mezzotint, as was common at the time. Only once more in his career did Theus work on such a scale, producing a pair of portraits, of Barnard Elliott, Jr. and his wife, around 1766. Elements of the portrait of Mrs. Elliott ‚Äì including details of her costume, jewelry, and pose ‚Äì have since been shown to have been taken from a number of contemporary English mezzotints. Theus frequently borrowed from English prints for his smaller works as well, and at least one historian has noted that many of his female sitters share identical poses and elements of costume, down to the folds and shadows in their dresses; each work is individualized with minor changes to various details. Male sitters in Theus portraits were typically offered a handful of poses to choose from, including the then-popular hand-in- waistcoat gesture; sometimes the artist would include a hat, tucked under the sitter's arm, to provide variety. In other portraits, Theus preferred the shorter bust-length portrait type; in either case, the format chosen allowed him to avoid having to paint the subject's hands. Lt. Col. Barnard Elliott, c. 1740. Gibbes Museum of Art Portraits of children allowed Theus greater variety in choosing the sitters' poses, and he exercised this freedom in a number of works. In some he chose to use a landscape background, rather than the plain backdrop reserved for his adult subjects; others are allotted a variety of props, including a fishing line and hook, an acorn and a pet squirrel, or a piece of fruit. About twenty portraits of children by the artist exist. Besides creating original work, Theus sometimes served as a copyist for his clients, although few of his surviving works have been demonstrated to be copies. Among these are a copy of a portrait of Christiana Broughton by Henrietta Johnston and a copy of a work variously attributed to William Keable and John Wollaston. Two nearly identical portraits of a man, possibly Isaac Smith, are also known to be by Theus; they appear to be copies of a lost original. Although Theus made some attempt to individualize the faces of his sitters, they share so many characteristics as to be nearly indistinguishable. Hallmarks of his style include close-set eyes, long noses, full lips, and dimpled chins. There is some evidence that he attempted to work from life when painting his subjects' faces, adding details of costume later in his studio. Costume remains the dominant focus of most of his portraits; he took greater care in depicting the colorful details and trimming of clothing than in showing his sitters' faces. Elizabeth Prioleau Roupell, 1753. High Museum of Art Like many of his contemporaries, Theus did not confine himself to portraiture when it came to his art. His advertisement in the Gazette indicates that he was willing to paint landscapes and decorative work, including coats of arms and family crests, in addition to human subjects. That he accepted the commission to paint and gild the steeple of St. Michael's Church suggests, furthermore, that he thought of himself at least in part as a journeyman. Today paintings by Theus can be found in a number of American museum collections, including those of the Brooklyn Museum of Art,Brooklyn Museum collection search the Worcester Art Museum, the Gibbes Museum of Art, the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

It is also known as the Neutra Research House, the Van der Leeuw House, the Richard and Dion Neutra VDL Research House II, or the Richard and Dion Neutra VDL Research Houses and Studio. It was designed by Richard Neutra and his son Dion Neutra. (81 pages, with house plans, design sketches, and 20 photos) The house is currently owned by California State Polytechnic University, Pomona,Prioritization and Recovery Responses  Cal Poly Pomona and is maintained by its College of Environmental Design. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009,. and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2016.. History Originally built in 1932, the house was built for Neutra and his family and called the VDL Research House because it was built with a loan from Neutra's early patron, Cees H. Van der Leeuw, a wealthy Dutch industrialist and architecture aficionado. Neutra and his wife, Dione, raised their three sons at the house. He also ran his architecture practice out of a studio in the house until he later opened his design studio at the Neutra Office Building on Glendale Boulevard (a property that is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places). The original house was destroyed by fire in March 1963. Along with the house, the fire destroyed Neutra's collection of sketches, writings and architecture library. Neutra's son, Dion Neutra, rebuilt the house with his father's oversight. The original footprint of the house was preserved, though a number of changes were made in the design. One critic later wrote that the \\"original clarity was now gone, but the new house gained a jumpy visual complexity.\\" In 1980, Neutra's widow donated the house, then valued at $207,500, to Cal Poly Pomona to be used by the university's College of Environmental Design faculty and students. The building was in some disrepair and in danger of deteriorating further, in 2008, when a fund-raising campaign to preserve it was launched. Architecture firm Marmol Radziner volunteered pro-bono services that include repairs to the roof, the reflecting pool, and the building's water intrusion and waterproofing issues. Improvements were completed during Phase I and II of the restoration project.http://www.neutra-vdl.org/site/news.asp?9212014142952 Design Downstairs interior In his design of the VDL Research House, Neutra sought to show that the innovations of his Lovell Health House could be incorporated into designs for less affluent clients. Through use of natural lighting, glass walls opening onto patio gardens and mirrors, Neutra designed a space that was not confining and which reflected the nearby lake. Neutra later wrote the following about the VDL Research House: > I was convinced that high-density design could succeed in a fully human way, > and I saw my new house as a concrete pilot project. I wanted to demonstrate > that human beings, brought together in close proximity, can be accommodated > in very satisfying circumstances, taking in that precious amenity called > privacy.

One felt a great sense of freedom in the VDL, > as everything was carefully planned to avoid interference between the > various zones of the house, and there were many options for getting off by > oneself. View of upper floor Neutra later took pride in the fact \\"hundreds of perfect strangers have been coming by the house every year,\\" many coming to a halt, \\"somehow mesmerized, and perhaps wistfully wondering why this constructive figment of clarity and composure hadn't grown on Los Angeles generally.\\" It was not only strangers that admired the Neutra VDL compound. Over a forty-year period stars of the second generation of California modernism like Gregory Ain, Harwell Harris and Raphael Soriano started their careers here. Famous clients like the director Josef von Sternberg and Edgar Kaufmann spelled out their needs to Neutra here. A cultural salon for Los Angeles hosted visitors such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Alvaar Alto, Charles and Ray Eames and many others. The social history of this place has been documented at neutrahistory.org Upstairs interior One critic later said of the house: > Even a down-on-his-luck architect deserves humane housing. When the budding > Modernist hero Richard Neutra built a home along Silver Lake Reservoir in > 1932, he had a budget of $10,000 and a tiny sliver of land. What he built > became a nimble experiment in urban living. The small rooms in the house are arranged around an open staircase and have \\"austere, built-in furniture, all in neutral tones.\\" It has been said that the \\"house's strength came from its temporal quality: Light, water and air were meant to induce a wholesome life.\\" The house was Neutra's third commission in the United States and was built four years after the Lovell Health House in Los Feliz. The Research House later became the focus of a cluster of ten Neutra-designed houses on Argent Place overlooking Silver Lake. The house is located just a few hundred yards from the Neutra Office Building, Neutra's offices from 1950‚Äì1970, which is also NRHP-listed. The house is open for tours led by Cal Poly Pomona architecture students on Saturdays.Neutra VDL House: Tours It is the only Neutra-designed house that is regularly open to the public.

It is the only major chain in Puerto Rico following CineVista's bankruptcy. The chain has expanded into Dominican Republic, Panama, St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. Maarten, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, Antigua, Aruba, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Guadeloupe. History and expansion In 2005, Caribbean Cinemas bought the second floor CineVista location at Plaza Las Am√©ricas after it was closed by the latter company; reopening under the Caribbean Cinemas brand as the largest of the chain, with 17 theater halls. In 2007, CineVista also closed its location on the second floor of Plaza del Norte before declaring bankruptcy and ultimately going out of business; Caribbean Cinemas also opted to buy out the empty space five years later and reopened as Caribbean Cinemas in May 2012 with 5 theater halls and one in 3D. In October 2016, Caribbean Cinemas announced that a new location, and its first premium format, dubbed Caribbean Cinemas VIP, will be built in the Puerto Rico Convention Center District, with seven theater halls, and one in premium large format, due for a 2019 opening. As of 2019, Caribbean Cinemas is celebrating its 50th Anniversary since its founding in 1969. Digital 3D In February 2009, Caribbean Cinemas debuted its first digital 3D theater with Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience at Plaza las Am√©ricas. Over the years, more digital 3D films have been projected in most locations with at least one theater hall dedicated to it. Premium large format Caribbean Cinema at the San Patricio Plaza in Pueblo Viejo barrio in Guaynabo In December 2014, Caribbean Cinemas opened its first premium large format theater hall, dubbed Caribbean Cinemas Extreme (CXC), at Las Catalinas Mall, a premium large screen reserved seating theater format. It utilizes a 4K projector and employs Dolby Atmos sound system, transmitting 128 audio channels and over 30,000 watts of power to over 60 speakers located throughout the hall for a 360¬∞ sound. In the following months, four more theater halls have been converted in locations at Plaza las Am√©ricas, Plaza del Caribe, Plaza Guaynabo and Barceloneta. Montehiedra was added a CXC after its major renovation in 2016, making it the fifth large format screen of the company. IMAX and 4DX Playa In February 2016, Caribbean Cinemas announced the arrival of the first IMAX and 4DX theaters to the Montehiedra location, which meant it had to undergo a complete renovation. As part of plans, a second floor was to be constructed for the IMAX theater, meaning that of the 14 halls it has always had since 1996, two had to be merged to meet the standards of an IMAX theater to accommodate up to 400 people. Another renovation to the Montehiedra location is the first 4DX theater hall in Puerto Rico with synchronized moving seats, and special effects such as strobes for lightning, mists for rain, wind fans, bubbles and blows of air. In May 2016, Caribbean Cinemas announced that AT&T; and Toyota would be the corporate sponsors to the IMAX and 4DX theaters, respectively, at Montehiedra Cinemas, which reopened in June 2016 debuting the first IMAX and 4DX halls in Puerto Rico. As of 2017, the Ana G. M√©ndez University System took over as the corporate sponsor of the 4DX experience. The Caribbean Cinemas theater at Plaza Carolina also underwent renovations to make way for the second theater of the chain to have 4DX and IMAX, announced in August 2018. The renovated theater reopened in November 2018 and plans for renovating the Las Catalinas Malls Cinemas is expected for 2019.

The film was also the highest grossing Soviet film of 1948, with approximately 48,600,000 tickets sold. Synopsis The film is set in July 1942 during The Great Patriotic War. Part of the Red Army leaves the mining town Krasnodon. After that, the city gets occupied by the German troops. Enemy machines destroy their path and members of the Komsomol group are forced to return home. In response to the atrocities of the invaders, the young Komsomol members, who are former students, create an underground anti-fascist Komsomol organization Young Guard. This organization leads a covert war against the occupation forces; young men spread antifascist leaflets, free a group of Red Army prisoners, burn the German stock exchange, thus saving their countrymen from being sent to work in Germany. On the day of the Red October anniversary, the young guards hang red Soviet flags.

Its collections focus mainly on American art, and its holdings include works by Andrew Wyeth, Josef Albers, Jasper Johns (from South Carolina), Andy Warhol, Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence, Ronnie Landfield, Helen Turner, Mary Tannahill, Eric Fischl, Marylyn Dintenfass, and Leon Golub. Southern American and South Carolina-based artists, such as Henrietta Johnston, are also represented. History In 1963, the South Carolina General Assembly established the Greenville County Museum Commission. The art association acquired its first permanent home with the purchase of the Gassaway Mansion in 1958. In 1974 GCMA moved into its modernist building. The new building is almost 90,000 square feet for spacious exhibition galleries, a museum shop, art storage, a 190-seat auditorium, and classrooms for studio instruction. In 1973 the American Association of Museums accredited GCMA and renewed accreditation in 1986 and 1998. In 1985, the Museum refined its collections policy to focus on creating a comprehensive survey of American art using southern related examples. In 1995 the GCMA published a book, The Southern Collection, which includes 126 essays about 146 different works in the collection. The Greenville County Museum of Art is one of 55 museums in South Carolina fully accredited by the Alliance of American Museums, a rigorous benchmark. The American Alliance of Museums awarded accreditation to the Museum first in 1973 and subsequently renewed accreditation in 1986, 1998, and 2009. Exhibitions and Collections The museum is nationally known for three collections: the Southern Collection, a survey of American art using southern-related examples; Andrew Wyeth: The Greenville Collection; and a collection of contemporary art unrivaled in the state. The museum's ‚ÄúSouthern Collection‚Äù explores the breadth of American art and history through the Southern experience from the colonial era to the present. Among the highlights are a group of pre-Civil War vessels created by African-American potter and poet David Drake, a collection of American Impressionism, and an array of works by 20th-century masters like Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, Romare Bearden, and Andy Warhol. The GCMA is home to an important collection of modernist works by South Carolina native African-American artist William H. Johnson. The museum boasts individual works by such twentieth-century masters as George Bellows, Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, Josef Albers, and Philip Guston. The collection includes 40 works by Jasper Johns, 68 by Stephen Scott Young, and twenty-six by Andrew Wyeth. The GCMA is home to the largest and most complete collection of Wyeth watercolors owned by any public museum in the world. Andrew Wyeth himself wrote in a letter dated March 6, 1998, ‚ÄúThe Greenville County Museum now has what I consider the very best collection of my watercolors in any public museum in this country‚Äù. By virtue of a tax millage, GCMA operations are supported by Greenville County, while program support comes from private sources. =Exhibitions= * Sundays at 2: Family Art Adventure - Mar 17, 2019 * Third Thursday Tour: Grainger McKoy - Mar 21, 2019 * Sundays at 2: Music in the Galleries - Mar 24, 2019 * Sundays at 2: Music in the Galleries - Mar 31, 2019 *Arnold Mesches: How Does Your Garden Grow? - March 27, 2019-September 15, 2019 *William de Leftwich Dodge, James Earl, Howard White McLean, Ralph E.

Although Greenville County taxpayers support the museum's operations and building maintenance, no public funds are provided for art purchases. It is solely through the generosity of both private citizens and corporate donors in our community that more than $62 million of art has been added to Greenville's collection. =General Information= The Greenville County Museum of Art is open Wednesday through Saturday 10am-5pm, and Sunday 1pm-5pm.

He was the third son of Duke Casimir of Bytom by his wife Helena. Life It's unknown why after his death in 1312, his father left Siemowit the most extensive part of his Duchy, Bytom (already since 1311, he was made the formal co-ruler). Despite Siemowit's role that was not too important, he established contacts with the court of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high in the Wawel Castle. Siemowit could maintain his rule over Bytom for only four years, until 1316, when, in unknown circumstances, his older brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw assumed the government of the Duchy. The next information about Siemowit is found on 19 February 1327, when, together with his brothers W≈Çadys≈Çaw and George, he paid homage to the Bohemian King John of Luxembourg in Opawa. This event demonstrated that, whatever the reasons why Siemowit lost his sovereignty over Bytom in 1316, at the end of the 1320s there is a full reconciliation between the brothers. Siemowit was then mentioned again around 1340 in a document of the Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw, Przec≈Çaw z Pogorzeli, where he is named Duke of Gliwice. This is the last notice about Siemowit as a living person. He died between 1342 and 1355, probably closer to 1342. He died unmarried and childless, and it is unknown where he was buried.

Players must have at least one bunny alive (in space) at the end of the game to win. The secondary strategy of the game is to explore the solar system by launching your bunnies into space in ships.

A player owns any Carrot that he brings to the planet Jupiter, and at the end of the game when all Carrots have been claimed, the Magic (or winning) Carrot is revealed.

Minimal surfaces of class VII (those with no rational curves with self-intersection ‚àí1) are called surfaces of class VII0. Every class VII surface is birational to a unique minimal class VII surface, and can be obtained from this minimal surface by blowing up points a finite number of times. The name \\"class VII\\" comes from , which divided minimal surfaces into 7 classes numbered I0 to VII0. However Kodaira's class VII0 did not have the condition that the Kodaira dimension is ‚àí‚àû, but instead had the condition that the geometric genus is 0. As a result, his class VII0 also included some other surfaces, such as secondary Kodaira surfaces, that are no longer considered to be class VII as they do not have Kodaira dimension ‚àí‚àû. The minimal surfaces of class VII are the class numbered \\"7\\" on the list of surfaces in . Invariants The irregularity q is 1, and h1,0 = 0. All plurigenera are 0. Hodge diamond: Examples Hopf surfaces are quotients of C2‚àí(0,0) by a discrete group G acting freely, and have vanishing second Betti numbers. The simplest example is to take G to be the integers, acting as multiplication by powers of 2; the corresponding Hopf surface is diffeomorphic to S1√óS3. Inoue surfaces are certain class VII surfaces whose universal cover is C√óH where H is the upper half plane (so they are quotients of this by a group of automorphisms). They have vanishing second Betti numbers. Inoue‚ÄìHirzebruch surfaces, Enoki surfaces, and Kato surfaces give examples of type VII surfaces with b2 > 0\\\\. Classification and global spherical shells The minimal class VII surfaces with second Betti number b2=0 have been classified by , and are either Hopf surfaces or Inoue surfaces. Those with b2=1 were classified by under an additional assumption that the surface has a curve, that was later proved by . A global spherical shell is a smooth 3-sphere in the surface with connected complement, with a neighbourhood biholomorphic to a neighbourhood of a sphere in C2. The global spherical shell conjecture claims that all class VII0 surfaces with positive second Betti number have a global spherical shell. The manifolds with a global spherical shell are all Kato surfaces which are reasonably well understood, so a proof of this conjecture would lead to a classification of the type VII surfaces. A class VII surface with positive second Betti number b2 has at most b2 rational curves, and has exactly this number if it has a global spherical shell. Conversely showed that if a minimal class VII surface with positive second Betti number b2 has exactly b2 rational curves then it has a global spherical shell. For type VII surfaces with vanishing second Betti number, the primary Hopf surfaces have a global spherical shell, but secondary Hopf surfaces and Inoue surfaces do not because their fundamental groups are not infinite cyclic. Blowing up points on the latter surfaces gives non-minimal class VII surfaces with positive second Betti number that do not have spherical shells.

Background Michele Avila grew up in Arleta, Los Angeles, in the San Fernando Valley. Michele Avila and Karen Severson had been best friends since they were eight years old. The two girls began to grow apart when they entered San Fernando High School; Severson reportedly grew jealous of Avila because she was considered more popular and attractive. Severson was also upset because Avila began spending less time with her, opting to spend her time with boys. Severson later started a rumor that Avila had been having sex with various boys. As a result, Avila was beaten up by a group of girls who accused her of sleeping with their boyfriends. During the girls' junior year in high school, Avila began dating a boy named Randy. Avila broke the relationship off after a month due to Randy's constant partying. Shortly after the break up, Severson and Randy began a relationship and eventually moved into an apartment together. Severson later told Avila's mother Irene that she once witnessed Randy pulling Avila onto his lap. Avila told Randy she was not interested in rekindling their relationship and advised Severson to break up with Randy. The incident angered Severson and she stopped speaking to Avila. Ten days before Avila's death, the two got into a physical altercation in a neighborhood park. According to witnesses, Severson threatened Avila with a broken beer bottle and then pushed and slapped her. Murder On October 2, 1985, Avila told her mother that she was going out with one of her school friends, Laura Doyle. Doyle picked Avila up and the two left. Four hours later, Doyle called Avila's mother and asked to speak to Missy. After Avila's mother told Doyle that she thought her daughter was with her, Doyle told her that she had dropped Avila off with three boys driving a blue Camaro. After getting gas, Doyle said she returned to the location where she dropped Avila off but she and the three boys were gone. On October 5, Avila's body was found face down in a stream in Big Tujunga Canyon in Angeles National Forest. She had been forcibly drowned in eight inches of water, her waist length hair was hacked off and there was a four-foot log found on top of her body. Conviction and aftermath Irene Avila later said she had no reason to suspect Severson or Doyle were involved in her daughter's death. Both had attended Avila's funeral and Doyle sent the family a sympathy card along with $20. Severson also moved in with Irene Avila for a time to console her and become a \\"surrogate daughter\\" (although this is disputed by Severson). Severson was also seemingly obsessed with the murder. She visited Avila's grave several times a week, covered the walls of her room with pictures of Avila and newspaper clippings about the crime, and repeatedly visited the creek where Avila's body was found. At one point, she told Irene Avila that she had seen Avila's ghost. Police had no leads in the case and the case went cold. In July 1988, Eva Chirumbolo, another teen who had taken the 45-minute drive into the mountains, came forward and told police about the murder. Severson and Doyle were arrested and charged with first degree murder. According to the prosecutors, Severson and Doyle lured Avila to the creek and then proceeded to yell at her about her supposed promiscuity. Both girls accused her of having sex with their boyfriends and told her that she had messed up too many relationships. The two then held Avila face down in approximately six inches of water. To hold her body down in the water, the two placed a four-foot, 100-pound log on her body. In March 1990, Severson and Doyle were convicted of second degree murder, and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. The jurors later said they were not convinced that the murder was planned and rejected the first degree murder charge. Karen Severson was released from prison on December 9, 2011, after serving 23.5 years. Laura Doyle was released from prison in December 2012 after serving 22 years. After Severson, out of prison, began promoting a memoir about the crime and her prison experience and made a deal to have a film produced, Avila's family sued her in 2015, seeking to take the profits of the sales.

It runs from Mering near Augsburg via Geltendorf to Weilheim and is listed by the Deutsche Bahn as Kursbuchstrecke 985.  Construction  The Mering‚ÄìGeltendorf‚ÄìSchondorf (29.77 km) and Weilheim‚ÄìDie√üen (13.07 km) sections were the first to be constructed. They were built by the Augsburg railway division of the Royal Bavarian State Railways and were completed simultaneously on 30 June 1898. The intervening 18.36 km section from Die√üen to Schondorf was finished on 24 December 1898.  Electrification  The line was electrified between Mering and Geltendorf from 7 September 1970 in order to provide a diversionary line for the heavily trafficked trunk route from Augsburg to Munich, the Geltendorf‚ÄìMunich-Passing having been electrified two years earlier. Nowadays the Ammersee Railway in only of regional importance. Trains run hourly from Augsburg-Oberhausen via Weilheim to Schongau and back. Until the early 1990s there were still long-distance trains (the FD-Z√ºge) on the line that did not take the 'bypass' via Munich on their way from the north of Germany to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, but went directly from Augsburg along the Ammersee Railway to Weilheim. One curious aspect was the mode of operation on the non-electrified section from Geltendorf to Weilheim. A diesel engine was hooked up to the train in Geltendorf or Weilheim and the electric locomotive was hauled along with its pantographs lowered. This gap in the electrified network still remains a stumbling block, because all trains on the Ammersee Railway are diesel-hauled, although there is now catenary between Geltendorf and Augsburg. This excludes the few trains that, until the end of 2008, used to run only between Geltendorf and Augsburg in the morning and evening and were therefore hauled by electrics. A closure of this gap in the electrified network is planned in the longer term. The long waits at some of the crossing stations and irregular services meant that travel on the Ammersee Railway was not particularly attractive in the past. This has changed since 14 December 2008 with a new, tauter timetable. The variable interval services have been restricted to the Die√üen-Weilheim section. On the rest of the line, as on the through services to Schongau and Augsburg-Oberhausen, a strict hourly service is offered. Since 14 December 2008, running powers on the Ammersee Railway have been awarded to the Bayerische Regiobahn (BRB). The BRB is a sister company of the Bayerische Oberlandbahn (BOB) and belongs to the Veolia Group. The BRB operates the Weilheim‚ÄìSchongau and Augsburg‚ÄìGeltendorf‚ÄìWeilheim lines and, from 2009, has also worked the Augsburg‚ÄìAichach‚ÄìIngolstadt and Ingolstadt‚ÄìEichst√§tt Stadt routes.

Background Little is currently known about Stenson's background. Detail of his parentage remains unknown and neither is it known where he would have received his training as an engineer. It is known that he was a non-conformist, being buried in the old Baptist cemetery at Hugglescote and also that he is said to have been born at Coleorton, Leicestershire. The connection of his family with Coleorton is supported by a baptismal entry for one William Stenson of Coleorton Moor which occurs in the register of Packington Baptist Church for 1770, though this would relate to an adult baptism and therefore not that of Stenson the engineer. It has also been suggested that 'Stenson' would have been a variant spelling of 'Stinson', the Stinsons being a very prominent family of tradesmen in this district. During the nineteenth and early twentieth century for example, several of this family were proprietors of businesses in the neighbouring village of Whitwick, which included a tallow candle factory, mineral water factory and butcher's shop. Founding of Whitwick Colliery and birth of the town of Coalville In the 1820s, he started to sink a mine shaft on a farm alongside a track known as Long Lane in the parish of Whitwick. His boring, in what was then a remote wilderness, proved the presence of coal and led to the growth of an industrial settlement around the site of the colliery which is now known as the modern town of Coalville. Soon after founding the Whitwick Colliery, when visiting the se a suitable route and then, with the backing of his partners, formed the Leicester and Swannington Railway Company. He contacted George Stephenson, who invested ¬£2500 in the enterprise and Stephenson's son, Robert, was appointed the railway's engineer. Stenson - often referred to as 'the father of Coalville' - lived to the grand old age of ninety and witnessed the birth of the new town. His house (now demolished) was near the site of the present day North West Leicestershire Municipal Offices, and this has been commemorated by the placement of a memorial stone, \\"erected in loving memory by his family, July 1999\\". More recently, his memory has been perpetuated by the naming of a road on the Whitwick Business Park - \\"Stenson Road\\", and also by the renaming of the town's municipal offices, to \\"Stenson House\\".

Biography Mullins entered Texas A&M; College at 16, and after graduation studied to become a lawyer, but a dramatic religious experience under the preaching of Major William Evander Penn caused him to pursue a career in foreign missions. He entered the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, graduating in 1885 as one of the top students in his class. He married Isla May Hawley, whom he met at Walnut Street Baptist Church in Louisville. They were parents of two sons, both of whom died in early childhood.Mullins, Isla May, Edgar Young Mullins: An Intimate Biography, Nashville, TN: Sunday School Board, 1929. The Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board, short on funds, turned down his application to become a missionary to Brazil. Years later, Mullins would become Associate Secretary of the Foreign Mission Board. Mullins also served in pastoral ministry in Baltimore, Maryland, where his experiences in the inner city gave him a sensibility to social issues that lasted a lifetime. Following his time in Baltimore, Mullins settled into pastoral work in New England, far from his alma mater, which was embroiled in a bitter theological controversy with its third president, William Heth Whitsitt. When Southern Seminary sent an agent to his doorstep in Newton Centre, Massachusetts, to offer him its presidency, Mullins expressed initial shock at the thought of stepping into that difficult post. The unanimous call of the trustees persuaded him, however, and he assumed the presidency in 1899. Toward the end of his seminary presidency, Mullins led in the relocation of the 1877-era campus from downtown Louisville to a spacious suburban tract known as \\"the Beeches\\" in the hills east of the city. In 1926 a handsome academic and residential complex was completed in classical Georgian architecture, with a distinctive clock tower in his honor atop the main administrative building, Norton Hall. The main housing complex on the new campus was named Mullins Hall also in honor of his leadership. In addition to serving as president, Mullins taught theology at the seminary. Out of his classroom experiences a pivotal textbook, The Christian Religion in Its Doctrinal Expression, was published in 1917, in addition to nine other books‚Äînotably, The Axioms of Religion, Why is Christianity True?, and Christianity at the Crossroads. Through his books, sermons and denominational articles, Mullins became one of the most influential Baptists of the twentieth century. His influence extended to all spheres of Southern Baptist life. From 1921 to 1924 Mullins served as the elected president of the Southern Baptist Convention as it wrestled with significant issues including the teaching of evolution. Mullins helped prevent a split in the denomination through the development of a consensus doctrinal statement called The Baptist Faith and Message, adopted in 1925, which has been updated several times as the convention has turned steadily more conservative in recent years.Mullins, E.Y, The Axioms of Religion, George, Timothy and Denise, editors. Nashville, TN: Broadman, 1997. Shortly before his death from a paralyzing stroke, Mullins was named president of the Baptist World Alliance, in recognition of his important role in international Baptist life. 43 boxes of his correspondence and notebooks are held at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.

It is situated on the B5299 road about four miles (6 km) south-south-west of Carlisle city centre, and approximately five miles (8 km) from Junction 42 of the M6 motorway. Description The village is on the River Caldew, just to the north of where the Roe Beck joins the river. It is served by the Dalston railway station on the Cumbrian Coast Line between Carlisle, Workington and Barrow in Furness, taking over two hours for the full journey. There are two popular schools in Dalston, St. Michaels Primary School and Caldew Secondary School which has over a thousand pupils. There is also a Nestl√© factory producing powdered milk, a BP fuel depot and a factory producing specialist materials. Dalston has a population of around 2,500 and serves as a key service centre for a much wider rural area. At the centre is the Square, which is not square, dominated by St Michael's and All Angels Church. Most of the shops are located in and around the Square. To the northwest of the centre of the village is the Barras Lane trading estate, home to many businesses. There is a county electoral division of Dalston, stretching north towards Carlisle, with a total population at the 2011 United Kingdom census of 6,051. History Rose Castle Rose Castle, home of the Bishop of Carlisle for many centuries until 2009, is within the parish of Dalston, from the heart of the village. The Architects Anthony Salvin and Thomas Rickman were responsible for the alterations which took place in the 19th Century. Dalston Hall is a grade II* listed fortified house which is now a country house hotel.

Amanda Dunbar began painting in an after school art class at the age of 13. Her spontaneous and advanced works acquired significant interest immediately. Amanda is currently listed as a prodigy of the visual arts in the current textbooks for advanced university education entitled \\"Child Psychology\\" by John Wiley & Sons Canada, Ltd. Early life and education Amanda Dunbar was born in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. She moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada at the age of 4 and attended Orleans Wood Elementary School. Dunbar moved with her family to Allen Texas where she attended Ford Middle School and graduated from Allen High School in 2000. * * At the end of the eighth grade she signed up for an after-school art class where the instructor asked the class to paint something - anything - so that he could gauge their skill level. Dunbar picked up a brush and created \\"Mother's Touch\\", a portrait in the French impressionist style of a woman in a blue dress drying her small daughter after her bath. The impressed instructor quickly notified Dunbar's parents of her unusual skill. When she was young she liked many things such as cooking, drawing, acting, singing, etc. She never knew what she wanted to as she grew up. She thought she could be a nurse like her mother. But, she never thought that her career would be becoming an artist. * * Dunbar graduated from Southern Methodist University in Dallas with a BFA in 2004. She graduated cum laude with departmental distinction. * Dunbar was named State Artist of Texas in 2005. She went on to study abroad in France, Italy and Spain. She acquired a post baccalaureate certification at the Pont Aven School of Contemporary Art in 2006. In 2006 she also became the youngest honoree on record and is the only painter to date to be inducted into the Governor's Texas Women's Hall of Fame. She was 23 at the time and honored in the arts category. In 2009 Dunbar was awarded a Distinguished Alumni Award from Southern Methodist University for Emerging Leadership. Earlier in the year she was awarded the 2009 Americanism Award by the DAR. Career Dunbar began painting at the age of 13 and had a solo exhibition in Dallas, Texas at the age of 16. Of the 68 paintings on display, most sold on the opening night with sales totaling over $500,000.00. The success of her showing prompted national media attention and she has been profiled since in numerous magazines and print media including People Magazine, Southern Living and ArtNews. She has appeared on TV shows including Oprah (twice). Dunbar publicly credits the talk show host for inspiring her business model and philanthropic goals particularly after she took over control of her studio art business from what she considered bad management at the age of 18. At the age of 15, Dunbar made a decision to become an advocate for children's and artist's causes. She took part in a documentary entitled \\"The Artist in Me\\" that became a special feature on Mattel's Barbie as Rapunzel DVD, released in 2002 to inspire creativity among children. She also became an Ambassador to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in 2004. Dunbar has donated to charities including the Grammy's Musicares Foundation. ABC World News profiled the artist in 2007 as a \\"Person of the Week\\" when Charles Gibson discovered that she had quietly donated over $1M to various causes. Dunbar frequently speaks to youth, (girls in particular) and artists on a range of topics. Dunbar is the Founder and CEO of Dunbar Studios in Dallas. She is also the lead designer for the Precious Rebels line of art guitars. Her art guitars from the collection are among the most expensive guitars in the world. The collection is named as a subtle tribute to Oprah Winfrey, whom the artist states is \\"the most precious rebel on earth\\" and remains a significant influence to the artist's life today. Dunbar's art can be found in many private and corporate collections around the world.

Biography Farquhar was born in Cambridge, New Zealand in 1928 but spent most of his early years in Fiji. He was educated in New Zealand, and was a pupil at St Peter's School in Cambridge and Wanganui Collegiate. He was an accomplished sportsman and academic at both schools, captaining the cricket team in summer and hockey team in winter. He also broke many of their short and middle distance running records. He began his university studies in Christchurch before completing his degree at Victoria University of Wellington where he studied with Douglas Lilburn. He went to the United Kingdom where he completed a Master of Arts at the University of Cambridge, and also studied composition with Benjamin Frankel at the Guildhall School of Music in London. On his return to New Zealand in 1953, he joined the staff of the Department of Music at Victoria University, and was made Professor of Music in 1976, retiring in 1993. He was the Founder-President of the Composers Association of New Zealand in 1974 and was awarded their Citation for Services to New Zealand Music in 1984. In the 2004 New Year Honours he was made a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to music. He wrote numerous orchestral, choral, stage and instrumental works, songs and music for children, and has been recognised since the 1950s as being at the forefront of New Zealand composition. Farquhar died in Wellington, New Zealand on 8 May 2007.  Compositions  Ring Round the Moon = This music was originally commissioned by Richard Campion for the New Zealand Players' production of Ring Round the Moon, Christopher Fry's adaptation of Jean Anouilh's play L'invitation au ch√¢teau. In the second act a ball takes place offstage and the text specifies a large number of dances. The music was first recorded on acetate discs by an ad hoc orchestra led by Alex Lindsay; these small recordings were then played through speakers for the production, sounding very loud to the cast but filtering out more gently to the audience. At the end of the long national tour, the cast knew the music very well and suggested to Farquhar that he should do something with it. The result, some years later, 1957, was a suite of nine dances first performed by the Alex Lindsay Orchestra. This rapidly became Farquhar's most performed piece and was commercially recorded by the Alex Lindsay Orchestra in 1962, a recording still available today as a CD reissue. Ashley Heenan, through the NZ APRA Committee, commissioned an arrangement for full orchestra for the National Youth Orchestra to take on a tour of Europe and China in 1975. This version was shortened to six dances by leaving out the first three numbers. The music has also been used for a ballet, The Wintergarden, choreographed by Arthur Turnbull for the Royal New Zealand Ballet, and a variety of other versions exists: a Waltz Suite (1989) for string orchestra; an arrangement of the original Dance Suite (1992) for violin and piano; as well as shorter arrangements for both brass band and concert band. = Other compositions = *A Unicorn For Christmas, opera in three acts *Concertino for piano and strings *Concerto for guitar and chamber orchestra *Concerto for Wind Quintet, for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn *In Despite Of Death, a song cycle for baritone and piano *Magpies and other birds, settings of three poems by Denis Glover for vocal quartet *No-one and anyone, a setting of anyone lived in a pretty how town by E.

This type may also be called an appointment diary. In stationery, a Diary (UK & Commonwealth English), Datebook, Appointment Book, Planner or Agenda (American English) is a small book containing a main diary section with a space for each day of the year with room for notes, a calendar, and usually various pages at the beginning and end containing various pieces of reference information, which may include maps and telephone codes, and pages for a short address book at the end. Most diaries are pre-printed for a specific year, which is printed on the cover, with each day's space therefore able to be printed with the day of the week. However diaries that can be used for any year are also produced. Page-marker ribbons are commonly included. The US Customs official definition of a diary is: \\"A book prepared for keeping a daily record, or having spaces with printed dates for daily memoranda and jottings; also applied to calendars containing daily memoranda on matters of importance to people generally, or to members of a particular profession, occupation, or pursuit\\".US Customs case decision The main different sizes produced are the small pocket diary and larger desk diary, both of which come in many different sizes. Any size may be referred to as an appointment diary, especially larger diaries with pre- printed lines for each period in the day, as in the picture above. A large variety of layout formats are sold, including: *page per day *week per view/opening *week per page *month per view/opening Often, as in the diary pictured above, weekend days are given less space than workdays. Small calendars of the current month, and if there is room, previous and following months at the bottom of the page are also typical. Most diaries run from January to December, but school or academic diaries, also known as \\"mid-year\\" diaries, run for twelve months from shortly before the beginning of the school or academic year. Many diaries are themed for different interest groups, and contain relevant reference information to that interest, and others are given as gifts by businesses. Especially in diaries for children or young people, many are now branded for fictional characters, authors, recording artists or magazines.

Professor of sociology at the University of Montpellier III, he was also the founder of the journal Quel Corps ?,see the anthology L'opium Sportif: La Critique Radicale Du Sport. De L'extreme Gauche a Quel Corps, ed. by Jean-Pierre Escriva and Henri Vaugrand, Paris, L‚ÄôHarmattan, 1996 member of the editorial staff of the monthly R√©pertoire and is actually director of the journal Pr√©tentaine. Brohm has written many books and is the leading proponent of the radical critique of sport in France. According to Brohm the \\"[....] critical theory of sport is founded on three principal axes: 1) Sport is not simply sport but a means of government, a means of pressure on public opinion and a mode of ideological framing of the populations and of parts of the youth, and this in all countries of the world, in totalitarian countries as well as in so called democratic countries. This was noticeable during the big political events which were the Olympic Games in Moscow, the soccer championship in Argentina and, more recently, in France. 2) Sport has become a sector of accumulation of wealth, money, and therefore also of capital. It attracts considerable amounts of money; I would even say today it is the most spectacular showcase of the globalized society of commodities. Sport has become a key commodity of this society. 3) The last point, the ideological aspect properly speaking. Sport constitutes a political body, a space of ideological investment in gestures and movements. You can see this for example with Combat sports. It‚Äôs also an ideological valorisation of efforts via asceticism, training, self-sacrifice; sport is presented as an ideological model. Sport institutes a bodily order founded on the management of sexual drives and aggressive impulses; insofar as it seems that sport is a form of social appeasement, social integration, reducing violence, allowing fraternity; this type of discourse to me is a load of muddled illusions and mystifications.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on May 14, 2009. It was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by Michael Schur. In the episode, Andy gets the casts removed from his legs, and Ann starts reevaluating their relationship when she learns he kept them on longer than necessary so she would keep pampering him. An intoxicated Mark flirts with Leslie, who feels conflicted about whether she wants to move forward when he is drunk. The episode generated positive reviews. Several commentators claimed \\"Rock Show\\" represented a turning point in the series, in which the show found its own tone and broke away from similarities to The Office. According to Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 4.25 million viewers in its original airing, the lowest viewership for the season. \\"Rock Show\\", along with an \\"Extended Producer's Cut\\" of the episode, was included on the Parks and Recreation Season One DVD, which was released in the United States on September 8, 2009. Plot The parks and recreation department have cake to celebrate Andy (Chris Pratt) having his leg casts removed, and Ann (Rashida Jones) invites everybody to a local bar to hear Andy's first rock concert since he broke his leg. Leslie (Amy Poehler) is disappointed she cannot go, because her mother (Pamela Reed) has set up a business meeting with a local town manager. Later at the hospital, Ann learns from Dr. Harris (Cooper Thornton) that Andy could have had his casts removed two weeks earlier and she realizes that he postponed it because he wanted Ann to keep pampering him. Angry, Ann begins reevaluating her relationship with Andy. Later that evening, Leslie realizes the dinner with 62-year-old George Gernway (Ron Perkins) is actually a blind date set up by her mother. George, who tells the documentary camera crew he is getting \\"very positive signals\\", invites himself to go with Leslie to the rock show. Mark (Paul Schneider) feels lonely because he is the only one at the concert without a date: Tom (Aziz Ansari) is with his attractive surgeon wife Wendy Haverford (Jama Williamson), Ron (Nick Offerman) is dating his ex-wife's sister Beth (Stephanie Erb) and April (Aubrey Plaza) is with, \\"like the gayest person I've ever met, but I make out with him when I'm drunk sometimes.\\" Noticing Ann is angry with Andy, Mark makes a pass at her, but Ann angrily rejects him. Leslie and George show up and are mocked by Tom. After the concert ends, Andy tries to stay as long as possible to avoid a fight with Ann, but she insists they leave. George goes home because he was falling asleep and Leslie starts to leave, but an intoxicated Mark asks her to stay and have a beer with him. When Leslie notes to the camera crew that they seem to be getting along just like when they made love five years earlier, she realizes he was drunk then too. When the bar closes, the two decide to keep drinking alongside the pit outside Ann's house, which Leslie plans to turn into a park. When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, \\"I really, really like it when you serve me food.\\" Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes back inside and watches television. Production Norm Hiscock wrote the script for \\"Rock Show\\", which was widely credited as a turning point for Parks and Recreation. \\"Rock Show\\", the first season finale of Parks and Recreation was written by Norm Hiscock and directed by series co- founder Michael Schur. Schur said he felt \\"Rock Show\\" marked a change in tone for the series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories than any of the other episodes from the season. Schur said: \\"We treated that whole six-episode season like a pilot. If you go back and watch those episodes now, you can see us making changes. The sixth episode is different in tone than the first. And we made some character tweaks, like every show ever does\\". Amy Poehler said she believed \\"Rock Show\\" would end what she described as the inevitable comparisons between Parks and Recreation and The Office, which is also produced by Parks creators Schur and Greg Daniels. Poehler said, \\"I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I‚Äôm kind of hoping we‚Äôre on the other side of that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it‚Äôs just a completely different world in a similar style.‚Äù Schur made his directorial debut with \\"Rock Show\\", and had only one day of preparation before directing the episode. While preparing to direct the episode, Schur was asked to make an appearance on The Office as Mose Schrute, the cousin of Dwight Schrute and a popular minor character, in the fifth season finale episode, \\"Company Picnic\\". Schur regretfully declined because he needed the time to work on \\"Rock Show\\", leading Office episode writers Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta to create the character Rolf, Dwight's friend played by James Urbaniak, as an alternative. Andy's bandmates during the rock show scene were played by Mark Rivers (drums), Andrew Burlinson (guitar) and Alan Yang (bass). All four actors performed their own instruments live during the filming. Originally, they planned to pre-record the songs and pantomime them for the episode, but after practicing a few times around the extras, they decided to shoot it live. The band performed each song twice, and Schur said he tried to shoot and direct it as if it were a music video. Yang is a writer with Parks and Recreation, and wrote the previous first season episode, \\"Boys' Club\\". Rivers is a composer who has worked on the sketch comedy show Human Giant, which starred Parks star Aziz Ansari. Rivers wrote the songs performed in \\"Rock Show\\", which Pratt said took him only \\"about fifteen minutes\\". Hiscock wrote the lyrics for \\"The Pit\\" in the initial outline for the episode and they were handed to Rivers who then fleshed them out. The songs were designed to resemble the music of the American rock band Hootie & the Blowfish. The only song not written by Rivers was \\"Ann\\", a romantic ballad Andy played for Ann, which was written by Pratt himself. \\"Ann\\" first appeared in \\"Boys' Club\\". Like most episodes of Parks and Recreation, a great deal of the scenes in \\"Rock Show\\" were improvised by the actors. Paul Schneider made up his own dialogue during the scene in which he and Poehler sit next to the pit and he talks about it as if it is already a park. Poehler's laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction. Pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue, including his rationale to Ann for why he lied about his leg casts: \\"I really, really like it when you serve me food.\\" Pratt also changed the reaction his character had to Mark falling into the pit. The script originally called for Andy to be serious and concerned, but Pratt changed it so his character thought the fall was funny. Pratt also improvised the songs he sang during an early scene in the episode, in which Andy makes up songs about random items in Ann's living room out of boredom from wearing the casts for so long. One of the songs he sings is about a lamp, and included the lyrics, \\"I wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched.\\" Pratt thought of the song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend. During a scene when Andy describes his style of music, April responds that she completely understands him, although the other characters seemingly do not. That line was improvised by Aubrey Plaza, and later helped inspire the writing staff to place the April and Andy characters into a romantic relationship. Schur said of this, \\"At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, but when we watched it, we thought there might be something there.\\" The scene with Mark making a pass at Ann at the rock show, and Ann's angry reaction to the attempt, were a last-minute addition to the episode. Although Mark and Ann would develop a romantic relationship in the second season, the Parks and Recreation writers had not decided what would happen between the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Leslie and Ann, at the time \\"Rock Show\\" aired. In the original pilot script, Mark helped Leslie solely because he was attracted to Ann and felt that green-lighting Leslie's project would give him an excuse to spend more time with her; the shooting version was retooled to make Leslie less pathetic and Mark less unlikable, by having him won over by Leslie's determination to fight against the odds. Immediately after \\"Rock Show\\" was originally broadcast, NBC set up an official website for \\"Scarecrow Boat\\", Andy's band featured in the episode. The site, at scarecrowboat.com, included ringtones, band posters, songs for download and photos. George Gernway was played by Ron Perkins, the husband of Parks and Recreation casting director Nancy Perkins. Aubrey Plaza conceived the idea of her character dating a gay man who she occasionally makes out with. Her \\"gay boyfriend\\" would become a major part of April's character in the second season. The scenes about Mark's efforts to have a speed bump lowered were inspired by Scott Albright, a California city planner who works as a consultant on the show. Albright said it would only be realistic for a city planner to lower a speed bump if a large number of residents complained about it. The hospital scenes in \\"Rock Show\\" were filmed on-location in an actual California hospital. Cultural references Andy describes the style of his band's music as a mix between Matchbox Twenty and The Fray. George says his favorite rock band is The Everly Brothers, a country-influenced rock band from the 1950s and 60s. Andy finds Ann's lost iPod, a portable music player by Apple Inc., inside his leg cast after it is removed. When Andy starts watching television while Ann rushes off to help Mark at the end of the episode, he is watching the reality series The Real Housewives of Atlanta. The scene between Mark and Leslie at the pit was mirrored in the second season finale \\"Freddy Spaghetti\\", which aired in May 2010 and was Mark's final appearance as a regular cast member. During that scene, the two overlook what was once the pit, but was now a filled-in lot, and Mark gives her construction plans for a park before kissing her goodbye on the cheek and leaving. Schur said of the scene, \\"It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year.\\" Goor said of using that setting, \\"I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, they sat on the bench and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, they sat on the bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye.\\" During one scene, Andy goes through a list of previous names his band has had. Pratt said about half the band names featured in the episode came directly from the script, but after he made up one on the spot, the directors encouraged him to keep improvising. Pratt said he went through about 200 fake band names during the take. The various names of Andy's rock band include: *A.D. and the D Bags *The Andy Andy Andies *Andy Dwyer Experience *Angelsnack *Crackfinger *Death of a Scam Artist *Department of Homeland Obscurity *Everything Rhymes with Orange *Fiveskin *Flames For Flames *Fleetwood Mac Sexpants *Fourskin *God Hates Figs *Handrail Suicide *Jet Black Pope *Just The Tip *Malice In Chains *Mouse Rat *Muscle Confusion *Ninjadick *Nothing Rhymes with Blorange *Nothing Rhymes with Orange *Penis Pendulum *Possum Pendulum *Punch Face Champions *Puppy Pendulum *Rad Wagon *Razordick *Teddy Bear Suicide *Threeskin *Two Doors Down *Scarecrow Boat Reception In its original American broadcast on May 14, 2009, \\"Rock Show\\" was watched by 4.25 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, marking the lowest viewership for the season. Although the rating was almost the same as the previous week's episode, \\"The Banquet\\", Bill Gorman of TV By the Numbers still called the rating \\"pitiful.\\" The episode received a 1.9 rating/7 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34, and a 2.0 rating/6 share among viewers between 18 and 49. \\"Rock Show\\" received generally positive reviews, with many critics claiming it to be the best episode of the series up to that point. The scene in which Leslie rejects Mark's kiss in the pit was considered by some reviewers to be a critical turning point both for the show and for the development of Leslie Knope's character. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad wrote in a 2010 article, \\"Leslie finally realized that she can move on from Mark and the show realized that it could actually make her a real character\\". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said after six episodes, he felt \\"Rock Show\\" was the episode where the Parks and Recreation found the right tone for the series and Leslie Knope character. Sepinwall said all the characters were very likable, the jokes seemed natural and the awkwardness of the show was turned down enough to work properly. The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said while the first five episodes of the season had been disappointing, \\"Rock Show\\" marked an improvement in which \\"the characters were more defined, their quirks and rhythms understood\\". Matt Fowler of IGN said he did not find the episode especially funny but that it did a good job of fleshing out the characters. He said Chris Pratt was especially funny, and that his band's song \\"The Pit\\" was stuck in his head after the episode. The A.V. Club writer Keith Phipps, who had mixed feelings about Parks and Recreation throughout the season, said \\"Rock Show\\" was very funny and restored his faith in the potential of the series. Phipps said he believed the show would become very popular in the second season, and that people would later claim to like the first season more than they did the first time they saw it. In October 2009, while reviewing the second season episode \\"Sister City\\", A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce said he believed Parks and Recreation showed a streak of vast improvement that started with \\"Rock Show\\" and continued into the second season. Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was \\"solid all-around\\" and especially liked Leslie's blind date with the elderly man and Chris Pratt, especially his listing of all his previous band names. Medina said, \\"Parks and Recreation is only six episodes in, and it's already better than I anticipated. It has its own tone, a talented cast, and a plot that's advancing toward something, at least as fast as governmental red tape will allow it to.\\" Richard Lawson of Gawker said the episode was the best of the season and that he liked the wistful pacing and Poehler's performance. Lawson said, \\"Anyone who dismissed this show after its first sorta underwhelming episode made a mistake. The show has only gotten tighter and sharper, culminating in last night's funny/sad finale.\\" Time television reviewer James Poniewozik said the episode was the best yet for developing Poehler into a \\"more multi-facted, less risible character\\". He also said the supporting staff played \\"flawlessly\\" off each other in the rock show scene, and thinks there is \\"huge potential\\" in the dynamic between Leslie and her undermining mother. Not all reviews of the episode were positive. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune said the Leslie Knope character was unappealing in \\"Rock Show\\" and throughout the first season, which she said surpassed the Friends spin-off Joey as \\"the worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical.\\" DVD release \\"Rock Show\\", along with the five other first season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was released on a one-disc DVD set in the United States on September 8, 2009. The DVD included cast and crew commentary tracks for each episode, as well as about 30 minutes of deleted scenes. The disc also included an \\"Producer's Extended Cut\\" of \\"Rock Show\\", which incorporated scenes that were cut from the originally broadcast episode. Many of the deleted scenes were improvised dialogue from the actors in brief extensions of episodes already included in the originally broadcast episode. In one of the cut scenes, Marlene Knope tells the audience that Leslie's business meeting is actually a date. The producers decided to cut the moment, so the audience would find out at the same time Leslie learns it. In another cut scene, Andy tries to convince Ann that the doctor lied to her about Andy requesting more time with the leg casts because the doctor wanted more money. One of the longest cut scenes from the extended edition was a conversation between Leslie and Mark at the bar, in which Mark explains his ideals about city planning when he attended college are much different than the practical, technical aspects of his job. Although the scene was cut, Michael Schur said the monologue did a great deal to help develop Mark's character.

In the mid-8th century, however, they were downgraded to a supply and logistics corps and assigned a province (thema) in north- western Asia Minor, which was named after them. As an administrative unit, the Theme of the Optimatoi (, thema Optimat≈çn) survived until the Ottoman conquest in the first decades of the 14th century. History The Optimates were first set up in the late 6th century (c. 575), by Emperor Tiberius II Constantine (r. 574‚Äì582).. According to the Strategikon of Emperor Maurice, the Optimates were an elite regiment of Foederati, most likely of Gothic origin.. They were a cavalry corps, somewhere between one and five thousand strong, and formed part of the central reserve army, their commander bearing the then unique title of taxiarchƒìs.. The presence of descendants of these men, called Gothograeci () by the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, is attested in northern Bithynia as late as the early 8th century.. At that time, Warren Treadgold estimates that the corps numbered 2,000 men, a figure that possibly corresponds to its original size as well.. In the mid-8th century, under the rule of Emperor Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775), and as part of his measures to reduce the power of the thematic generals following the revolt of Artabasdos, the Count of the Opsician Theme, the corps was downgraded. Split off from the Opsician Theme, the region where the Optimates had settled, including the peninsula opposite Constantinople, both shores of the Gulf of Nicomedia and stretching to the shores of the river Sangarius, was then constituted as the separate thema of the Optimatoi () with Nicomedia as its capital.. The first mention of the Optimatoi as a separate thema in the sources occurs only in 774/5,. but it is clear that its creation must have come in the years after the suppression of Artabasdos's revolt.. The same period also saw the further dismemberment and weakening of the once powerful Opsician Theme with the creation of the Bucellarian Theme.. Henceforth, unlike the other themata, the Optimatoi no longer provided armed troops, but formed a corps of 4,000 mule- drivers with their animals, which provided the baggage train (touldon) of the imperial tagmata in Constantinople.. The unique role of the Optimatoi set it apart from all other themata: given their non-combatant functions, the Optimatoi were not divided into intermediate-level commands (tourmai or droungoi), a fact pointed out by Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913‚Äì959) as a sign of inferior status.. Consequently, their commanding domestikos held the lowest rank of all provincial stratƒìgoi in the imperial hierarchy. As with the other themata, for the administration of his duties as governor of the province, the domestikos was assisted by a deputy (topotƒìrƒìtƒìs), a chief financial official (chartoularios) and a secretariat headed by a pr≈çtokankellarios.. The rural districts of the thema were raided by Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert, but Nicomedia was retained, and the area secured again under Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118) with the help of the First Crusade. The area was occupied by the Latins after the dissolution of the Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, but the thema was re- established by John III Vatatzes when he retook the region in 1240, and survived until the area was gradually conquered by the rising Ottoman beylik in the first half of the 14th century.

He was the fifth and youngest son of Duke Casimir of Bytom by his wife Helena. Life As the youngest son, Mieszko was destined to the clergy since his early childhood. Nevertheless, after his father's death in 1312 he received the town of Siewierz, but he continued his church career and in 1313 he joined to the Knights Hospitaller. Two years later (in 1315) Mieszko, together with his older brother Boles≈Çaw, traveled to Hungary, at the request of their sister Queen Maria and soon after his arrival, Mieszko was appointed Hungarian Prior of the Knights Hospitaller; however, three years later, in 1318, he resigned from that dignity at the express command of the Pope. After his resignation as a prior, Mieszko remained as a faithful supporter of his brother Boles≈Çaw, who in return rewarded his fidelity in 1328, when he obtained for Mieszko the dignity of Bishop of Nitra. This happened despite the opposition of the local Chapter, who were completely against the nepotism; however, the full support shown to the Piast princes by the King Charles I Robert and his new wife Queen Elizabeth (Queen Maria died in 1317) ended this dispute with a complete success to Mieszko, who, in order to assume the rule over the bishopric, finally decided to resign his Duchy of Siewierz on behalf of his brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw. The government of Mieszko over Nitra wasn't easy. Despite all the problems, he was completely involved in activities who raised the importance of his episcopal city, and decided to start his rule with huge impetus, built a new cathedral (who was completed after his death in 1355). In 1334, and after years of continuous conflict with the Chapter, Mieszko was named Bishop of Veszpr√©m (this time with the consent of the Pope and the local nobility). During this time, he also held the position of chancellor of Queen Elisabeth of Hungary (who certainly was involved in the election of Mieszko as Bishop), who bought him important benefits (Mieszko received from Federal Chancellery the amount of 500 fines per year by orders of Queen Elisabeth). During the last years of his life, Mieszko continued with his close cooperation with the Hungarian House of Anjou. In 1342 he participated in the coronation of the new King Louis, who also remained in close contact. Mieszko died in 1344 and was buried in the cathedral of Veszpr√©m.

Biography  Shiu-Kay was born in Hong-Kong, before moving to Edinburgh and studied at Telford College of Arts and Technology. In 1969 he went to the Polytechnic of Central London (now University of Westminster) to study architecture. In 1974 he wrote his thesis paper on building architecture out of waste, and in 1976 he received his RIBA qualification. In the 1970s, Kan spent his early career as an architect working for Sir Norman Foster on Hong Kong HQ of HSBC and SAPA. He also worked for Nicholas Grimshaw and Terry Farrell on public housing. He then went to Milan to pursue a career as a designer and had a brief stint as a 3D designer for the fashion house Fiorucci. He was denied a job for Flos Lighting, so he went back to London to start his own company SKK Lighting in 1979 in Belsize Village NW London. He has been Managing Director since then. In the 1990s SKK moved to Islington and settled in Soho, London. After his initial success in the early 1980s, Shiu-Kay sold his design to some major clients (e.g., House of Fraser, Habitat, and IKEA). When he started his architectural lighting department in 1982, this proved to be equally as successful as his \\"soft option\\" products. Some of his projects include, for example, the St Anne Shopping Centre, BT, AA, BA, Next, and Oasis. He has also consulted and designed for the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and renowned musicians from bands like U2 and Coldplay. He has been involved in lighting diverse objects (e.g., hotels, stores, restaurants, factories, national monuments) and very special birthday parties, such as Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs. He is also known for his work on the Memorial Gate on Constitutional Hill in London.

The garbage architectural design of a conservatory built of secondary wastes of tin cans, cardboard and Watney beer crates, caused a lot of attention from the press and Shiu-Kay appeared on Blue Peter, presented by John Noakes and Percy Thrower. = Lighting design = In Milan, Kan became heavily influenced by the style of Milanese and developed a strong interest in the designer lighting company. His first design was the \\"Kite Light\\" which he designed while working with Mark Sutton Vane.

It was also the twenty-fifth and final episode of the show's second season. The episode was written by Joshua Safran and directed by Norman Buckley. It originally aired on Monday, May 18, 2009 on the CW. \\"The Goodbye Gossip Girl\\" opens with graduation at Constance Billard and St. Jude's. Everything seems to be going smoothly until Gossip Girl sends a devastating e-mail blast that humiliates the majority of the senior class, prompting Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) to seek out the identity of Gossip Girl. Unfortunately, Gossip Girl further wreaks havoc on the senior class during a party just when Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) decide to confess their feelings for one another, interrupting them, causing previous issues to resurface between them. Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley), Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), and Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr) are caught in the crossfire of Serena's war with Gossip girl and Jenny Humphrey (Taylor Momsen) faces the prospect of becoming Queen when Blair's minions rebel against her make a bidding war on who will be the next Queen Bee. Plot Serena is excited that, come her high school graduation later that day, she will no longer have to deal with \\"Gossip Girl\\", an anonymous blogger who revealed the sensational details of her and her classmates' lives throughout high school. She and Blair recall that Gossip Girl does not report on college happenings and that her first blast was about Serena, back in the ninth grade. Nate apologizes to Vanessa for how poorly he had handled breaking up with her, and informs her that he and Blair have broken up--news Blair has held from her on-and-off boyfriend Chuck. Meanwhile, Dan discovers he has been left off the graduation program. In the midst of the ceremony, Gossip Girl sends out a blast with unflattering labels for each of the main characters: \\"Nate: class whore; Dan: the ultimate insider; Chuck: coward; Blair: weakling; and Serena: \\"After today, you are officially irrelevant.\\" Although Dan is unperturbed, the others are furious and seek revenge by trying to uncover Gossip Girl's identity. After they deduce that she is most likely one of the graduates, and Serena sends a text to Gossip Girl's tip line. Jonathon's cellphone rings, but he proves that he is not Gossip Girl and has merely hacked into her storage of tips. The attempted outing angers Gossip Girl so much that she unleashes her entire stockpile of tips, which concern events that have happened throughout the series but have thus far remained secret. Tempers flare as the secrets are revealed and everyone confronts each other. Chuck and Blair turn their anger onto Serena, who had set the trap that had provoked Gossip Girl's wrath. Upset, Serena texts Gossip Girl to meet her alone face-to-face at a bar, threatening to reveal her true identity to everyone. Gossip Girl calls her bluff and arranges for the whole class to meet Serena in the bar. Via e-mail, Gossip Girl then points out that she had given them all the perfect graduation present: a clean slate, as all their secrets were now out. She also reminds them that without their tips and their thirst for gossip and sordid drama, she would be nothing. She reveals that she will be following them to college, and her identity remains a mystery. In the meanwhile, the underclassmen carry out a contest to determine the next queen bee. The title is given to the girl who brings the juiciest piece of gossip to the current reigning clique, whose current ruler is Blair. Although at first uninterested, Jenny decides to enter in hopes of dismantling the high school's hierarchy after winning. Blair initially makes things especially difficult for Jenny, even after Jenny hesitates to reveal a certain winner about Blair. Following the revelatory Gossip Girl blast, which ruins Jenny's secret, a softened Blair approaches Jenny in the bathroom and offers her a new winning secret about the clique. Jenny refuses, but Blair tells her that queens must be cold, mentioning Queen Elizabeth I and explaining that you can't make people love you, but you can make them fear you. Later that night, she convinces Jenny to share the secret with Gossip Girl and then crowns Jenny queen. The characters turn their attention to the coming seasons. Nate turns down his summer internship at the mayor's office and begs Vanessa to go backpacking with him, as they had planned to do before breaking up. Carter Baizen tells Serena that he has found the information she requested about her father, whom she has secretly been searching for. Georgina tells Dan that she has recovered the money he needs to attend Yale, but Dan tells her he is set to attend NYU. Georgina reveals that she is as well before hanging up to request Blair as her roommate. Also revealed to be attending NYU is Scott, Lily and Rufus's lovechild, who appears to know about his birth parents. Meanwhile, Lily and Rufus spend the evening reminiscing before deciding to marry. Blair pours out her heart to Chuck, saying \\"I love you so much it consumes me.\\" Chucks leaves on a trip to Europe. At the close of the episode, Chuck returns with gifts from each stop he made in Europe; he tells her that he did not set out to buy the gifts, but saw her everywhere he went. Chuck finally tells Blair that he loves her, the words Blair has been hoping for all season long.

Michelle Graham of Film School Rejects praised the finale and reviewed the entirety of the second season. \\"‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù once called the swearing in of a certain Vice President ‚Äúa triumph of the middling‚Äù and that‚Äôs definitely what this season has felt like.\\" Graham commended the writer's usage of the characters searching for the identity of Gossip Girl, stating \\"The idea of discovering the identity of Gossip Girl was tantalizing, especially as it really does have to be someone featured on the show‚Äôs peripheries. Of course, we were never going to really find out who it was, as it‚Äôd spell the end of a lucrative series for The CW. However, the chase was fun and the consequences of going head to head with the big G were far reaching.\\" Graham also commended the cliffhanger involving Rufus and Lily's lovechild Graham heavily praised the relationship between Chuck and Blair and hailed the well-received kiss between them, calling Chuck's declaration of love one of the high points for the season finale. \\"It did seem as though Gossip Girl had managed to finally destroy Blair and Chuck‚Äôs chances as her all-out assault hit them mid-seduction. The couple that had gone through hell over the last two seasons seemed about to be happy together, only to have past affairs used to ruin it. However, the writers realised that another trip around the block for Dan and Serena just yet would throw the fans into a revolutionary frenzy, and so rescued the damsel and her black knight.\\" Graham opined on the direction of their relationship following Chuck's declaration. \\"How will Blair and Chuck fare with an honest to goodness grown-up relationship, now that the games are at an end and they have both declared their feelings?\\" Graham welcomed Georgina's return following her previous arc that began during the episode, Southern Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. \\"Of course, to balance the cute we need something evil and no character manages that better than good old Georgina Sparks. Her mere moments in the episode rank as my other high point as not only do we discover that the Poppy Lifton issue has been resolved. (The only problem with this scene: HOW did she resolve the issue?) but also that she will be back!\\"With the return of Georgina in the finale, Graham expressed high hopes for her character for the next season, stating \\"Perhaps this will be the spark (no pun intended) required to shake Blair‚Äôs cobwebs off and get her back to her queen bee fighting weight.\\" Entertainment Weekly listed Chuck and Blair's final scene in their \\"25 Great 'I Love You's\\".

Starting in 2012, Lehrer was discovered to have routinely recycled his earlier work, plagiarised widely from colleagues, and fabricated or misused quotations and facts. Scrutiny began when freelance journalist Michael Moynihan identified multiple fabrications in Lehrer's third book, Imagine: How Creativity Works (2012), including six quotations attributed to musician Bob Dylan. Imagine and Lehrer's earlier book How We Decide (2009) were recalled after a publisher's internal review found significant problems in that material. He was also fired from The New Yorker and Wired.

While an undergraduate, he worked in the laboratory of Eric Kandel, \\"examining the biological process of memory and what happens in the brain on a molecular level when a person remembers or forgets information\\". He appears on one published paper from that laboratory, as fourth of eight authors on a primary report in a three-laboratory collaborative genetics study characterizing homologs of the human DYRK1A gene from model organism C. elegans, a gene believed to \\"play a significant role in the neuropathology of Down syndrome\\". While at Columbia, Lehrer also contributed to the Columbia Review, and was its editor for two years. He tied for second place for the Dean Hawkes Memorial Prize in the Humanities. Lehrer was a 2003 Rhodes Scholarship recipient, supporting his study at Wolfson College at Oxford University; Search \\"Jonah Lehrer\\" at this site to access information used. while he is reported to have planned to study \\"philosophy, physiology and psychology\\", he is further reported to have instead studied 20th century literature and philosophy. Writing careerPrint and online periodicals= Lehrer has written for The New Yorker (July 2008-March 2012; staff writer June 2012), Wired (July 2010-June 2012) Scientific American Mind (June 2008-July 2009), Grantland, The Wall Street Journal, and The Boston Globe, as well as the journal Nature, and Seed magazine. Lehrer had contributing editor roles at a variety of publications, including at Scientific American Mind (2009-2012) and for Radiolab (2007-2012, 38 episodes). Lehrer resigned from The New Yorker on July 30, 2012, after the accusations of fabricated Bob Dylan quotes in Imagine surfaced. On August 31, 2012, Wired.coms editor-in-chief, Evan Hansen, stating Lehrer's \\"failure to meet ... editorial standards\\", severed the relationship between that venue and the writer. =Books= Lehrer is the author of three best-selling books: Proust Was a Neuroscientist (2007), How We Decide (2009), and Imagine: How Creativity Works (2012). The latter two of these books have been withdrawn from the market by their publishers after \\"internal review uncovered significant problems\\" with the books. These and other work by Lehrer have been characterized as having misused quotes and facts, plagiarized press releases and authored work, and to have otherwise recycled earlier published work. These acts and the process of uncovering them are recounted in So You've Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson. In print Proust Was a Neuroscientist is a collection of biographical essays on creative figures such as Marcel Proust, Paul C√©zanne, Walt Whitman, and Auguste Escoffier. Chris McManus, professor of psychology and medical education, University College London, writing in Nature, opens his review, saying \\"'Oh no he wasn't!' might well be the response to ... Lehrer's claim ... ,\\" continuing to note that while \\"Lehrer's conceit of the artist as a neuroscientist is not unique\\" (Semir Zeki and Patrick Cavanaugh having preceded him with the general point), that the \\"impressions [of artists] are neither experiments nor science\\" and that the \\"conceit remains exactly that, if the term 'neuroscientist' is to retain any serious meaning\\". McManus goes on to quote Lehrer, with this analysis: On a more positive note, McManus notes that \\"The most interesting parts of Proust ... are its manifestos on art and science in the prelude and coda\\" that begins with C.P. Snow; however, Lehrer proceeds (McManus notes) with \\"attacks\\" on Richard Dawkins, Brian Greene, Steven Pinker and E. O. Wilson for failing to engage in a \\"dialogue of equals\\" with nonscientists. McManus closes, stating that while Lehrer's notion of a \\"fourth culture\\" is a \\"grand dream\\", his \\"attempt at [it] fails\\" since the neuroscience laid out by Lehrer \\"seems 'sheer plod', undermining the central conceit‚Äîfor what artist would partake in such a paltry matter?\\" Nonscientists, on the other hand, mostly offered praise for Proust. Science journalist and Guggenheim Fellow D. T. Max described it for The New York Times as \\"a precocious and engaging book that tries to mend the century-old tear between the literary and scientific cultures\\". The review by music critic Helen Brown in The Telegraph stated, \\"Lehrer is a dazzlingly clever young man whose writing bears witness to both the clarity of his scientific training and the humanity of his literary studies. The Whitmanesque electricity of all the thought and heart he has put into this book fizzes from each sentence.\\" Jonathon Keats at Salon, writing as an artist, approached the \\"conceit\\" noted by McManus from the opposing perspective, and described Proust as being written \\"arbitrarily and often inaccurately\\". On June 6, 2013, Simon & Schuster announced that it would publish a book by Lehrer with the working title The Book of Love. In Slate.com, Daniel Engber suggested that Lehrer might have plagiarized portions of his book proposal from the work of his former New Yorker colleague Adam Gopnik. Both had written about the same episode in the life of Darwin, using the same biography (that of Desmond and Moore) as a source. The book was published as A Book About Love in 2016. Reviewing it in The New York Times, Jennifer Senior described it as \\"a nonfiction McMuffin\\" and \\"insolently unoriginal,\\" containing \\"a lot of dime- store counsel\\" and \\"a series of duckpin arguments, just waiting to be knocked down.\\" She concluded, \\"Perhaps Mr. Lehrer has changed‚Äîpersonally. But not sufficiently as a writer. I fear it may be time, at long last, for him to find something else to do.\\" Withdrawn In How We Decide, Lehrer argued that two main parts of the brain are involved in decision-making, the rational and the emotional. Steven Berlin Johnson, a technology writer with training in semiotics and English literature, reviewed How We Decide for The New York Times long before its withdrawal from market during the Imagine fabrication scandal (see below), where he wrote: Adam Kepecs, however, writing in the journal Nature called portions of the book into question based on current understanding of neuroscience. For instance, Kepecs noted that \\"Lehrer's insistence on attributing decisions to either an emotional brain or a rational one\\" was \\"problematic\\" because there \\"is no evidence that the brain has distinct and opposing emotional and rational regions.\\" Kepecs laments that Lehrer's writing is \\"neurobabble [which] has unfortunately become commonplace in science journalism.\\" Before it was pulled from the shelves by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH), Imagine: How Creativity Works was on the Los Angeles Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list for 22 weeks. Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called Lehrer adept for Imagines \\"teasing out ... social and economic implications of scientific theories while commuting easily among the realms of science, business and art ...\\" noting that \\"[h]e deconstructs the creative process behind a Bob Dylan song with the same verve he brings to the story of how Procter & Gamble created the Swiffer, its New Age mop. ... \\" But Christopher Chabris, writing in The New York Times Book Review, derided Imagine for its \\"many elementary errors\\" and formulaic approach, as well as for \\"Lehrer's failure to grasp some fundamental principles of scientific thinking\\". A review by Michael S. Roth in The Washington Post said, \\"Lehrer practices what he preaches, showing an appetite for learning, a determined effort to cross fields and disciplines, and a delight in exploring new possibilities,\\" while Isaac Chotiner of The New Republic described Imagine as inaccurate, simplistic, and glib, and concluded \\"Lehrer writes self-help for people who would be embarrassed to be seen reading it.\\" Plagiarism and quote fabrication scandalFindings of self- plagiarism= On June 19, 2012, Joe Coscarelli of New York magazine and Josh Levin of Slate reported that five posts by Lehrer on The New Yorker blog had reused significant, identical portions of his own work without acknowledging having done so, referring to the practice as \\"self-plagiarism\\". Additionally, Edward Champion reported that portions of Imagine: How Creativity Works had been published previously in various forms by Lehrer, and that he had subsequently re-used parts of his books, unattributed, in further submitted publications, e.g., * [Lehrer's] Proust Was a Neuroscientist (2007), p. 185: > The most mysterious thing about the human brain is that the more we know > about it, the deeper our own mystery becomes. * [Lehrer's] Review of Out of Our Heads, by Alva No√´. San Francisco Chronicle (March 1, 2009): > The most mysterious thing about the human brain is that the more we know > about it, the deeper our own mystery becomes. All five of The New Yorker blog posts now appear on the magazine's website with editor's notes listing where Lehrer had previously published related sentences, a list that included The Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe, Wired, and The Guardian. In a response soon after, a spokesperson for Lehrer's publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH), stated: \\"[Lehrer] owns the rights to the relevant articles, so no permission was needed. He will add language to the acknowledgments noting his prior work.\\" Lehrer apologized for this unattributed reuse of his own work. In a related matter, a correction was appended to a January 30, 2012 article by Lehrer on The New Yorker website, noting that quotations published in the original version of that article had been taken from the work of another writer, Peter Dizikes, at another publication, the MIT Technology Review (i.e., without permission or attribution). See the undated Editor's Note at the end of this article. =Imagine fabrications, The New Yorker resignation = The seriousness of the disclosures then further escalated. Some weeks later, Michael C. Moynihan reported in Tablet Magazine that Lehrer had fabricated quotes attributed to singer Bob Dylan in his book Imagine, Moynihan discussed his discovery at length with Mark Colvin, host of Australia's ABC News' program Friday Late. Moynihan noted later that the quotations immediately sounded phony to him when he read the book: they \\"sounded like a Dylan self-help book\\", leading him to seek clarification from Lehrer and Dylan's manager. In a subsequent statement, Lehrer admitted, \\"The quotes in question either did not exist, were unintentional misquotations, or represented improper combinations of previously existing quotes.\\" He also acknowledged having initially lied about the sources for these quotes to Moynihan when first confronted about them. At a Moth storytelling event, Jonah Lehrer said \\"I'd been a lifelong Dylan fan and was familiar with approximate versions of what he'd said, so I put in those approximations to make it sound better, as if I'd actually done my homework. And then I forgot they were there.\\"The Moth. \\"Attachment\\" by Jonah Lehrer. https://themoth.org/stories/attachment In the wake of plagiarism revelations Lehrer resigned from The New Yorker on July 30, 2012, less than two months after he had joined the staff. Several scheduled speaking engagements were cancelled. In the days and weeks that followed, reporting on the scope of the issues, and related criticism, continued. Colleen Curry of ABC News in the U.S. compared Lehrer in mid-July to \\"Publishing's ... Notorious Offenders\\", Janet Cooke, Stephen Glass, and Jayson Blair. =Recall of Imagine= Lehrer's publisher for Imagine and for his two other major works, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, announced that unsold print copies of the book would be recalled and sales of e-books would be suspended.https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2012/08/01/jonah-lehrer- book-pulled-boston-based-publisher-houghton-mifflin-harcourt-after-author- admits-fabrication/R64AXel66XZbh5lOJipV3K/story.html HMH was subsequently reported, in early August, to have placed all of Lehrer's books that they had published under an internal review. =Broadened review and consequences= On July 31, 2012, New York Public Radio issued a statement that described Lehrer \\"a talented and valued colleague.\\" The statement also expressed that the station was \\"deeply saddened by the news\\" of the preceding week and further addressed Lehrer's role as a contributing editor between 2007 and 2012. The statement suggested that his work at this NPR venue was untainted, because of their applied journalistic oversight: The final episode to which Lehrer is seen to contribute, \\"The 'Decline Effect' and Scientific Truth\\", aired on June 29, 2012. It contains a comment indicating audio editing to make two corrections to content. One is a factual quantitative statement. The other is an attribution of a quote without reference to any individual at the program bearing responsibility. On August 10, 2012, Steve Myers at Poynter.org reported that a quotation from the magician Teller of the performance duo Penn and Teller that had been included in Imagine was inaccurate, but that a previous version of the quote, which Lehrer had used for a 2009 Wired magazine article, had been accurate. In the wake of the disclosures, Wired.com asked journalism professor Charles Seife to investigate Lehrer's posts to its website. Writing in Slate.com (after Wired.com declined to publish his findings), Seife stated that he had found 17 of a sample of 18 Lehrer posts to contain rampant, longstanding recycled work, as well as plagiarism of press releases and of authored work, and issues with misuse of quotes and facts. He summarized his findings in this way: On August 31, 2012, Wired.com's editor- in-chief, Evan Hansen, stated: \\"Lehrer's failure to meet WIRED editorial standards leaves us no choice but to sever the relationship.\\" As well, reports appeared indicating the systematic cancellation of Lehrer's many scheduled speaking engagements, including addresses to the Holmes Report's Global Public Relations Summit and Iowa State University's College of Engineering, a ticketed book signing at the Aliso Creek Inn in Laguna Beach, California, and an appearance as a part of the Robert Simpson Charles Lectureship in Ethics at Earlham College. In The New Republic, Isaac Chotiner gave a mostly negative review to Imagine in June 2012. He accused Lehrer of grossly oversimplifying complicated scientific issues and habitually using \\"slippery language\\", such as treating creativity and imagination as synonyms when they actually describe different phenomena.Chotiner, Isaac. The Curse of Knowledge, The New Republic June 6, 2012; accessed 12 December 2017 After the revelations about Lehrer's plagiarism and falsification of data, Chotiner revisited Imagine in 2013: > If I had known of Lehrer's deceptions before writing my piece, I would have > tried to argue that the book would have been just as absurd and nonsensical > even if every word of it had been true. ... The fact that such a shoddy > piece of work could be written by such an ostensibly serious writer is > somehow more disturbing than the knowledge that an overconfident journalist > invented several quotes.Chotiner, Isaac. The Real Trouble with Jonah Lehrer, > The New Republic June 6, 2012; accessed 12 December 2017 =Ronson's So You've Been Publicly Shamed= The controversy surrounding Lehrer's misuse of Bob Dylan quotes in Imagine and his February 2013 speech to the Knight Foundation feature heavily in Jon Ronson's 2015 book, So You've Been Publicly Shamed. Ronson argues that the media response to Lehrer's journalistic malpractice amounts to shaming, and that is extreme and overdone. Slate.com Journalist Daniel Engber disagreed, arguing that the media has not been \\"too hard\\". In assessing Ronson's book in March 2015, Engber argues that Lehrer's Knight Foundation apology (see above) and Ronson's view of Lehrer's actions and of the apology fail to address the full scope of Lehrer's malpractices; Engber states Engber concludes that Lehrer's catalogue of inaccuracy \\"wasn't sloppiness or a rash of dumb mistakes. At best, it was a systematic disregard for journalistic ethics. At worst, it was calculated fraud.\\" =Affirmation of Proust, recall of How We Decide= By March 2013, Lehrer's publisher HMH determined that his first book, Proust Was a Neuroscientist (2007), had no significant problems and would remain in print. However, adding to the mounting disgrace of the Imagine recall and severed ties with The New Yorker and Wired.com, Lehrer's publisher announced at the same time that his second book, How We Decide (2009) would also be pulled. =Apologies= Lehrer at his February 2013 Knight Foundation paid apology speech, which drew significant media disapprobation On February 12, 2013, Lehrer gave a paid speech to the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation; entitled \\"My Apology\\", his speech included the following content: Lehrer also announced plans to continue writing, and spoke of potential safeguards to prevent similar lapses in judgment and accuracy from recurring; at one point he stated, \\"I need rules.\\" Various media commentators have criticized the speech, arguing that Lehrer did not express sufficient regret and finding Lehrer's attempts to use neuroscience to discuss his conduct evasive and misleading. Daniel Engber wrote in Slate that the speech \\"was couched in elaborate and perplexing disavowals\\". Joseph Nocera of The New York Times wrote that \\"As apologies go, it was both arrogant and pathetic.\\" Michael Moynihan, who broke the Imagine fabrication story, is reported (by Jon Ronson, see below) as having described it as \\"a string of Gladwellian bullshit\\". The day after the speech, the foundation acknowledging that paying Lehrer was a mistake. As of March 2015, Lehrer appears to be offering a repeating form of apologia for his misconduct, at student fora, for which he is reported to not be receiving honoraria, according to a report in the Fresno State University student publication, The Collegian; at one such forum at Fresno State, Lehrer stated that his large workload led to \\"very serious mistakes. I was taking on more projects than I could handle.\\" With regard to the Dylan quotes he admits to having fabricated, Lehrer specifically cites the pressure he felt from the deadline to finish Imagine. Lehrer now states that he \\"records all his interviews for reference\\" and \\"sends interview subjects the quotes he plans to use\\".  Further projects and news On June 6, 2013, Simon & Schuster announced that it would publish a book by Lehrer with the working title The Book of Love. In Slate.com, Daniel Engber suggested that Lehrer might have plagiarized portions of his book proposal from the work of his former New Yorker colleague Adam Gopnik. Both had written about the same episode in the life of Darwin, using the same biography (that of Desmond and Moore) as a source. The book was published as A Book About Love in 2016. Reviewing it in The New York Times, Jennifer Senior described it as \\"a nonfiction McMuffin\\" and \\"insolently unoriginal,\\" containing \\"a lot of dime-store counsel\\" and \\"a series of duckpin arguments, just waiting to be knocked down.\\" She concluded, \\"Perhaps Mr. Lehrer has changed‚Äîpersonally. But not sufficiently as a writer. I fear it may be time, at long last, for him to find something else to do.\\" In March 2014, Lehrer began to post blog entries on the scientific subjects that interested him at jonahlehrer.com; in the opening post, \\"Welcome to my blog,\\" Lehrer thanks his readers, expresses the desire to regain their trust, and indicates that \\"when possible, all material will be sent to the relevant researchers for their approval. If that's not possible, an independent fact- checker will review it.\\" In November 2014, the Associated Press (AP) announced that Portfolio, an imprint of Random House, had acquired rights to a work, then entitled, The Digital Mind: How We Think and Behave Differently on Screens, that was to be \\"co-written by Lehrer and Shlomo Benartzi\\", the latter a behavioural economist, and professor and co-chair of the Behavioral Decision-Making Group at the UCLA Anderson School of Management. Adrian Zackheim of Portfolio was reported by AP as stating that while \\"[n]o responsible publisher could entirely overlook his past mistakes ... the prospect of working with him was also fantastically appealing,\\" and as describing Lehrer as \\"one of the most gifted nonfiction writers of his generation\\". The early characterization of the proposed work proved to be inaccurate with regard to the eventual book that was released. Business professor Benartzi is involved with a new Portfolio title that involves Lehrer, entitled The Smarter Screen: Surprising Ways to Influence and Improve Online Behavior (alternative subtitle, What Your Business Can Learn from the Way Consumers Think Online); Lehrer is listed as a contributor, rather than a co-author‚ÄîCarlos Lozada of The Washington Post notes that Lehrer's name appears on the cover \\"in far smaller type size than Benartzi's name\\" Lehrer is described by the publisher as \\"a science writer living in Los Angeles\\", and only Benartzi's photograph appears on the jacket. Personal life In 2008 Lehrer married journalist Sarah Liebowitz. The couple has two children: Rose, born in 2011, and a son. Lehrer bought the historic Shulman House in Los Angeles in 2010.

The album was released in 2004 by ArtistShare and won the Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album in 2005. In 2020, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Background Schneider's three previous albums were nominated for Grammy Awards, but the previous one, All√©gresse, was released four years before Concert in the Garden. The delay has been attributed to the financial difficulty of recording with large groups, which are required for the music that Schneider writes. Compared to previous albums, this album is more classical than jazz, with a greater influence of Brazilian, Spanish, and flamenco music. Reception The JazzTimes review was mostly positive, stating, \\"Three Romances\\" and \\"Buleria, Solea y Rumba\\" \\"are revelatory in their complete realization\\", but the solos on the other pieces \\"are not strong enough to provide sufficient contrast to the piece's slow, hovering progress\\". The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the album a maximum four stars and added it to the book's Core Collection. Penguin stated that \\"Concert in the Garden\\" was a weakness, but overall the album was \\"the great achievement of her career so far.\\" Legacy The album was inducted into the National Recording Registry in 2019.

The text gives a numbered list of the cities of Eranshahr and their history and importance for Persian history. The text itself has indication that it was also redacted at the time of Khosrow II (r. 590‚Äì628) in 7th century as it mentions several places in Africa and Persian Gulf conquered by the Sasanians. The book serves as a source for works on Middle Iranian languages, a source on Sasanian administrative geography and history, as well as a source of historical records concerning names of the Sasanian kings as the builder of the various cities. The text provide information on the Persian epic, the XwadƒÅy-nƒÅmag (lit. ‚ÄúBook of Kings‚Äù). The book may be the same as \\"AyƒÅdgƒÅr ƒ´ ≈†ahrƒ´hƒÅ\\" (lit. ‚ÄúMemoir of Cities\\") named in the Bundahishn and said to have been written following an order of Kavadh I. Terms Eran and Eranshahr Coin of Ardashir I (r. 224‚Äì242) and Shapur I (r. 240-270) The terms Eranshahr (60px) and Eran were in use in Sasanian Iran. From early Sasanian era (Ardashir I and Shapur I's elaborations), as a designation of their land they adopted ƒírƒÅn≈°ahr ‚ÄúLand of the Aryans‚Äù and this served as the official name of their country. Ardashir I, who was the first king of the Sasanian Empire, had used the older word ƒìrƒÅn (Parthian aryƒÅn) as part of his titles and in accordance with its etymology. At Naqsh-e Rostam in Fars province and the issued coins of the same period, Ardashir I calls himself Arda≈°ƒ´r ≈°ƒÅhƒÅn≈°ƒÅh ƒìrƒÅn in the Middle Persian version and ≈°ƒÅhƒÅn≈°ƒÅh aryƒÅn in its Parthian version both meaning ‚Äúking of kings of the Aryans.‚Äù His son Shapur I referred to himself as ≈°ƒÅhƒÅn≈°ƒÅh ƒìrƒÅn and anƒìrƒÅn (lit. \\"king of kings of the Aryans and the Non-Aryans\\") in Middle Persian and ≈°ƒÅhƒÅn≈°ƒÅh aryƒÅn and anaryƒÅn in Parthian. Later kings used the same or similar phrases. and these titles became the standard designations of the Sasanian sovereigns. Rise of the Sasanian empire However the major trilingual (Middle Persian, Parthian, and Greek) inscription of Shapur I at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht in Fars, introduces another term ƒìrƒÅn≈°ahr in Middle Persian and aryƒÅn≈°ahr in Parthian. Shapur's declaration reads an. . .ƒìrƒÅn≈°ahr xwadƒÅy hƒìm.. (lit. ‚ÄúI am lord of the kingdom (Gk. nation) of the Aryans‚Äù). This follows his title ‚Äúking of kings of the Aryans,‚Äù and thus makes it \\"very likely\\" that ƒìrƒÅn≈°ahr \\"properly denoted the empire\\". Next to Darius's inscription, this inscription of Shapur at walls of Ka'ba-ye Zartosht is among the most important inscriptional records. It records parts of Persian-Roman wars and gives \\"a clear picture of the extent of his empire\\" by naming of provinces, mentioning religious foundations and mentioning senior officials of the court of Papak, Ardashir and Shapur I. According to the inscription, after death of Shapur's father and his accession, the Roman emperor Gordianus III ‚Äúmarched on Assyria, against ƒírƒÅn≈°ahr and against us‚Äù. War with Rome. Beside the royal title, the term \\"Eran\\" was also used as an abbreviation of \\"Eranshahr\\" and referred to the empire in the early Sasanian era. In this case the Roman west was correspondingly referred to as ‚ÄúanƒìrƒÅn‚Äù. As references to empires, Eran and Aneran occur already in a calendrical text from MƒÅnƒ´ (dating back probably to Ardashir I's era.) This shorter term \\"Eran\\" appears in the names of the towns build by Shapur I and his successors as well as in the titles of several high- ranking administrative officials and military commanders. For the former there are examples such as \\"Eran-xwarrah-Shapur\\" (The glory of Eran (of) Shapur), \\"Eran-ashan-kard-kavadh\\" (Kavadh pacified Eran) and for the latter \\"Eran- amargar\\" (Accountant-General), ‚ÄùEran-dibƒ´rbed\\" (Chief Secretary), ‚ÄùEran- drustbed‚Äú (Chief Medical Officer), ‚ÄùEran-hambƒÅragbed\\" (Commander of the Arsenal), and ‚ÄùEran-spƒÅhbed‚Äú (Commander-in-Chief). Kusts of Eranshahr Coin of Khosrow I (531‚Äì579) According to the book and as an ancient Iranian tradition, ƒírƒÅn≈°ahr is divided into four \\"mythologically and mentally\\"..rather than \\"real\\"; per Gignoux, cf. defined regions or sides called kusts. These parts/regions/sides of the state during and after Khosrow I, on the pattern of the four cardinal points, are (1) XwarƒÅsƒÅn ‚Äúnortheast‚Äù; (2) XwarwarƒÅn ‚Äúsouthwest‚Äù; (3) Nƒìmr≈çz ‚Äúsoutheast‚Äù; and (4) ƒÄdurbƒÅdagƒÅn ‚Äúnorthwest‚Äù. The kusts were named diagonally beginning from northeast to southwest, and from southeast to northwest-a style likely following an Old Persian tradition in naming satraps. The usual Middle Persian term \\"abƒÅxtar\\" (loanword from MIr.s: abƒÅxtar, abarag According to Tafa≈º≈ºoli and Cereti. cf. . to be because of \\"the Zoroastrian association of the north with the abode of evil\\" Excerpt: In the Zoroastrian cosmogonical division, the northern part (nƒìmag/kanƒÅrag ‚Äúside‚Äù) is called abƒÅxtar, which is under the superintendence of the star Hapt≈çrang ‚ÄúUrsa Major‚Äù.

The youngest of 14 children, he was educated after his father's death and excelled in classics. He attended Christ's Hospital and Jesus College. While attending college, he befriended two other Romanticists, Charles Lamb and Robert Southey, the latter causing him to eventually drop out of college and pursue both poetic and political ambitions. Although he often wrote poetry, his talent did not manifest until after 1794, when he transitioned into what would later be described as Romantic poetry. During this time, he worked with Southey on developing an ideal political government called Pantisocracy. Eventually, Coleridge would give up his political ambitions and focus on his poetic career. Parents Coleridge's grandfather, the elder John Coleridge, was a weaver by trade, and, as Coleridge claimed to William Godwin, he was also \\"half‚Äìpoet and half‚Äìmadman\\".Ashton 1997 p. 12 In 1719, his wife Mary gave birth to John, the younger. Their son was sent to the Crediton Grammar School until the age of 15, when the bankruptcy of the elder prompted the younger to seek employment. While the younger despaired at his fate, a random gentleman discovered him and offered him a job as an usher for a school. While working for the school, he took up a wife, had four daughters, and pursued his studies. In 1747, he was accepted into the Sidney Sussex College, at the age of 28, and studied classics and Hebrew. After finishing college, the younger John Coleridge became a teacher in Devon.Ashton 1997 pp. 12‚Äì13 A few years after moving to Devon, the younger John Coleridge's wife died. In 1753, he married Ann Bowden, a woman from Exmoor of a modest background. They had 9 sons and 1 daughter, with Samuel Coleridge being the youngest. By 1772, the year of Samuel's birth, John Coleridge was a well-respected vicar of the parish and had advanced to the position of Head Master of Henry VIII's Free Grammar School at Ottery. The positions brought the family only a small income, but they did earn the friendship of the community's baronet, Stafford Northcote. In addition to his employment, John Coleridge also wrote a few religious works and a Latin grammar.Ashton 1997 p. 13 Childhood Coleridge was born on 21 October 1772 in the rural town of Ottery St Mary, Devon, England, the youngest of the children.Radley, 13 Of his childhood, Coleridge suggests that he \\"took no pleasure in boyish sports\\" but instead read \\"incessantly\\" and played by himself.Coleridge 1889 p. 2 He was close to his father and distant from his mother, a woman whom he would provoke in an attempt to receive her attention. At the age of seven, Coleridge ran away from home after an argument with his older brother Frank that provoked his mother to punish him.Ashton 1997 pp. 14‚Äì15 He would tell the story to his friends in his later years with particular emphasis on his mother and \\"how miserable my Mother must be\\" about him running away. A search party was formed with the local noble and family friend Northcote eventually being the one to find Coleridge and bring him home. This event appeared in Coleridge's later poems including \\"Monody on the Death of Chatterton\\" (1829).Ashton 1997 p. 15 John Coleridge died in 1781 when Samuel was 8 years-old. Since his father was a source of happiness for the young Coleridge, the death affected him deeply. He was also the only son left at home; Frank was enlisted in the Navy just prior to John's death and Coleridge's other brothers were busy with careers or their own families. One of the brothers, George, took responsibility for Coleridge.Ashton 1997 pp. 16‚Äì17 Of him, Coleridge declared that he was \\"father, brother, and every thing\\".Letter to Luke Coleridge, 12 May 1787 Without his father around, Coleridge and his family were forced to move from the schoolhouse to a nearby home with a loss of their income. Soon after, one of John Coleridge's former students, Judge Buller, arranged for Coleridge to be sent to Christ's Hospital. Coleridge was accepted after his mother petitioned on 28 March 1782, along with Fulwood Smerdon, John Coleridge's successor, and Samuel Taylor, Coleridge's godfather, that he be accepted. After acceptance, he attended a school in Hertford to prepare him for Christ's Hospital.Ashton 1997 pp. 18‚Äì19 =Education= Christ's Hospital was founded in London by Edward VI in 1552 and intended to educate orphans and the poor. By the 18th-century, it catered to educating the children of poor gentry. The age of the institution and the traditions of the school soon became a point of pride for Coleridge.Ashton 1997 p. 20 He remained there throughout his childhood, studying and writing poetry, and it was at the school that he studied the works of Virgil and William Lisle Bowles.Morley 1884 pp. i-iv While at school, Coleridge was often in the school's sanatorium for a mild feverish condition and spent time by himself reading and studying classics. Although he was known for his speech aptitude, he was also known for his poor manner of dress. He also composed poetry, mostly imitations of Milton, Gray, and others.Ashton 1997 pp. 22‚Äì27 During that time, Coleridge became a friend of Charles Lamb. Unlike Lamb, Coleridge did not have family in London to spend his vacation with, which caused the young Coleridge strain. Over the nine years that he attended the school, he only returned home 3 or 4 times. He experienced loneliness throughout the time until two of his brothers, Luke and George, came to London. He wrote many letters to his brothers, but only one to his mother during his time in London. Luke was important to Coleridge and Luke's moving to Devon affected the schoolboy. Coleridge made other friends, including Charles Le Grice, but this could not keep Coleridge from missing Luke, to whom Coleridge would write often.Ashton 1997 pp. 22‚Äì23 In one letter, Coleridge wrote: \\"Legrice, and I, are very polite, very civil, and very cold. So that I doubly lament your absence, as I have now no one, to whom I can open my heart in full confidence.\\"Letter to Luke 12 May 1787 With the letter was one of Coleridge's first poems, \\"Easter Holidays\\", which discusses both present happiness and future sorrow. Another poem written that year was \\"Dura Navis\\", a poem that is possibly about his brother Frank and describes a state of loneliness and solitude along with battles at sea and eventual cannibalism of the crew. He continued to write poetry, including \\"Monody\\" (1790) which compares himself with Thomas Chatterton, an individual that committed suicide. He composed \\"The Destruction of the Bastile\\" that responded to the fall of the Bastille during the previous year. The poem contains Coleridge's cheering on of events within revolutionary France and a possible revolution in England. While he stayed at the school's sanatorium recovering from illness, Coleridge wrote the poem \\"Pain: Composed in Sickness\\". It was also during this time that Coleridge was first prescribed opium, in the form of laudanum, as a treatment of his fever.Ashton 1997 pp. 24‚Äì29 The deaths of his brother Luke and sister Ann in 1791 near the end of his school career prompted Coleridge to write the sonnet \\"On Receiving an Account that his only Sister's Death was Inevitable\\".Ashton 1997 p. 17 By 1788, Coleridge befriended a few other boys including Robert Allen and Tom Evans. Together, the three boys would visit Evans's home in London. It was there that Coleridge met Mary Evans, the oldest of Tom's three sisters, and Coleridge became infatuated with her. He also became attached to Tom's mother, a woman that later took care of the boys over Coleridge's 1791 Christmas vacation for college.Ashton 1997 p. 25 Coleridge later told George, \\"I have indeed experienced from her a tenderness scarcely inferior to the solicitude of maternal affection.\\"Ashton 1997 qtd. p. 25 This affection developed to the point of Coleridge composing a poem \\"To Disappointment\\" that places Mrs. Evans in the role of his mother. His involvement with the family was the first of Coleridge's long relationship with predominately female circles of friends. His feelings on the matter combined affection and sexual attraction in a way that he was uncomfortable with, and Coleridge was to later remark that he was unable to have sex with his wife because he viewed her in a sisterly manner.Ashton 1997 pp. 25‚Äì27 At the end of his time at Christ's Hospital, he received a scholarship to attend Jesus College, Cambridge and was to begin his time at the college in September 1791. During his transition from Christ's Hospital, Coleridge composed \\"On Quitting School for College\\", a poem that contains his saying good bye to his previous homes in a manner that was more positive than how he truly felt about those places. Although Coleridge enjoyed some of the moments at school, he believed that his time was that of deprivation and focused mostly on future happiness that would not actualize in the way he had hoped.Ashton 1997 pp. 30‚Äì33 College From 1791 until 1794, Coleridge attended Jesus College. He received 70 pounds per year in scholarship to attend the school with 30 pounds from the Rustat Scholarship, a scholarship dedicated to the sons of clergymen that prove themselves in academics. However, this was only enough to provide Coleridge with a meagre living at Jesus College, which he would complain of often. This was compounded by the debt that Coleridge began to accrue and avoided paying. It is uncertain how Coleridge used his income, but it is possible that he ran into debt because of indulgence in wine and opium, the drug that he continued to use throughout college. It is also possible that he spent his money on prostitutes, which he deeply regretted and even had nightmares over. He was prone to sexual nightmares, and he recorded one such dream in 1803 about being pursued by a prostitute at both Christ's Hospital and Jesus College.Ashton 1997 pp. 33‚Äì37 Although he had few friends at first, he befriended Thomas Middleton, a student at Pembroke College, who acted as \\"patron and protector\\" according to Coleridge's account in Biographia Literaria. His education was spent working in the chapel and attending lectures in both math and classics.Ashton 1997 pp. 33‚Äì34 Coleridge also wrote many poems and submitted some for various competitions. In July 1792 he won the Browne Gold Medal for a Sapphic ode that he wrote on the slave trade.Radley, 14 Later in December, he competed for the Craven Scholarship but didn't win. He also wrote more personal poems, including one written about lost love accompanying a letter to Mary Evans on 13 February 1792. Throughout college and in his poetry, Coleridge involved himself with politics, including issues around the French revolution, the slave trade, and the abolition of the Test and Corporation Acts. Coleridge became involved with issues surrounding the Test and Corporation Acts when a tutor at Jesus College, William Frend, was placed on trial during early 1793 by the Fellows of Jesus College for being a Unitarian and no longer supporting Anglicanism. Although Frend was removed from the school in April 1793, he influenced Coleridge's political and religious beliefs to the point of Coleridge eventually working as a Unitarian preacher after leaving Jesus College.Ashton 1997 pp. 35‚Äì38 Later in 1793, Coleridge competed for the Browne Medal but his ode on astronomy only won him second place. He wrote less poetry except for in Latin. One English poem was included in a letter to George in July 1793 called \\"The rose\\". Another poem was written during summer vacation called the \\"Songs of the Pixies\\", which described a cave near his home in Ottery that was called \\"the Pixies' Parlour\\". The poem celebrates the moment and also describes Coleridge's expectations to be crowned with a poet's laurels. Coleridge continued to accrue debt, 150 pounds by the summer vacation, which prompted him to leave college at the end of 1793. He used the last of his money to purchase an Irish Lottery ticket, an event which inspired him to write a poem on the matter which was published by the Morning Chronicle on 7 November 1793. Afterwards, he read a poem to a group of students at Trinity College, \\"Lines on an Autumnal Evening\\", which was heard by Christopher Wordsworth, brother to Coleridge's eventual companion and friend, William Wordsworth.Ashton 1997 pp. 39‚Äì41 On 2 December 1793, he enlisted in the 15th (The King's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons using the false name \\"Silas Tomkyn Comberbache\\",Holmes, 4 needing a means to provide himself with food. He was a poor soldier and a struggled for three months, trading his abilities to write in return for other soldiers helping him with his horse and other matters. Coleridge's true identity was revealed whilst he was serving in Reading. His captain, Nathaniel Ogle, son of the Rev. Newton Ogle, Dean of Winchester Cathedral, found a plaintive Latin exclamation written on the wall of the stables. On discovering its author was Comberback, Ogle quickly uncovered the real persona behind it and Coleridge's old Christ's Hospital schoolmate, G. L. Tuckett, was told of the enlistment and he informed George Coleridge. His brothers arranged for his discharge a few months later under the reason of \\"insanity\\", and George paid off Coleridge's debt. Eventually, Coleridge was readmitted to Jesus College in April 1794 and began writing poetry again. During June 1794, he advertised an edition of poems called Imitations from the Modern Latin Poets and toured Wales with Joseph Hucks. Before they arrived at Wales, they visited Robert Allen at Oxford and met Robert Southey. Coleridge and Southey shared similar political views and the two bonded immediately. Eventually, both would leave college without attaining their degrees.Ashton 1997 pp. 41‚Äì44 Early career Coleridge's transition into being a Romantic poet began in 1794 when he began to focus on nature in his poetry. This was a direct influence from his relationship with Southey and the emotional connection that they shared as friends, and their friendship developed to the point of Coleridge no longer pursuing Mary Evans. The two encouraged each other to write poetry, with Coleridge adapting his 1791 poem \\"Happiness\\" for this purpose. They also encouraged each other in their liberal political beliefs and visited the British proponent of democracy Tom Poole in 1794. He encouraged the two towards Southey's idea of Pantisocracy. Coleridge continued with his ideas of political reform and democracy, and, in 1795, he responded to the sedition trial of political activists Joseph Gerrald, Maurice Margarot, Thomas Muir, and Thomas Fyshe Palmer in a \\"Moral and Political Lecture\\" at Bristol. The lecture included a reading of Southey's poem titled \\"To the Exiled Patriots\\" which condemns the trial.Ashton 1997 pp. 47‚Äì50 When Coleridge's and Southey's plan to create a Pantisocratic nation in the Americas during the summer of 1794, Coleridge determined to marry Sara Fricker, sister of Southey's fianc√©e Edith Fricker. In order to fund the trip and the marriage, Coleridge was determined to have published his poetic-dramatic work, The Fall of Robespierre. The closet drama was written partly by Coleridge, the first act, and partly by Southey, the second and third, and it describes the events of Robespierre's final moments and his execution and that of 21 of his supporters along with denouncing tyranny. The work was published by Benjamin Flower and only under Coleridge's name. When the summer ended, Coleridge left for London and began to spend time with his school friends, including Lamb. Soon after, he stopped his communication with Sara Fricker, which caused problems between him and Southey. Matters were compounded when Mary Evans wrote to Coleridge during Autumn 1794 after hearing of Coleridge's and Southey's Pantisocratic plans; she wanted him to reconsider the idea. This letter was followed by letters from his brother George which also asked him to reconsider.Ashton 1997 pp. 51‚Äì56 The letters affected Coleridge deeply and he visited George in November 1794. Coleridge still desired to be with Mary, but during the visit, he found out that Mary was engaged. After hearing the news, Coleridge determined that he was not in love with Sara Fricker. In December, he began to work on his poetry and befriended many of the liberal political activists in London. These new friends included William Godwin and Thomas Holcroft, two men that Coleridge agreed with politically but differed theologically. Coleridge would dispute with the two over religious questions, and Coleridge was able to boast of turning them from strong atheistic views. Coleridge, an admirer of Godwin and Godwin's Political Justice, dedicated a poem to Godwin as part of his poetry series called \\"Sonnets on Eminent Characters\\" that was published at the end of 1794 in the Morning Chronicle. Of his other poetry, Coleridge wrote a poem about Christ's nativity titled \\"Religious Musings\\", which was not published until 1796. Eventually, Southey grew tired of waiting for Coleridge to return from London and travelled to meet his friend in January 1795.Ashton 1997 pp. 57‚Äì62 When Southey and Coleridge met, they disputed over plans for their Pantisocracy; Southey wanted to travel to Wales to prepare and Coleridge wanted to work in London to earn money. Southey was able to convince Coleridge to return to Bristol and the two returned during January 1795. Soon after his arrival, Coleridge began talking to Sara Fricker again and returned to his plans of marrying her. He also befriended many political liberals, including the bookseller Joseph Cottle, the later publisher of Coleridge's and Wordsworth's Lyrical Ballads. During this time, Coleridge began to raise money through lectures on politics, of which he gave three during February. His first lecture was called \\"A Moral and Political Lecture\\", given at the Bristol Corn Market, attacked the British government and William Pitt. The other two lectures were reworked to form a pamphlet entitled Conciones ad Populum. Or Addresses to the People, published on 3 December 1795. In the pamphlet, Coleridge uses the image of the winter 1794 famine in asking for political changes. Coleridge continued to lecture during the year, giving one on 16 June on the topic of abolishing the slave trade and one on 26 November in opposition to the Gagging Acts. The November lecture was expanded into the pamphlet The Plot Discovered, which was published in early December before the Gagging Acts were passed. Politics was not the only topic Coleridge lectured on in 1795; he gave \\"Six Lectures on Revealed Religion\\" during the spring that combined Unitarian religion and political ideas together.Ashton 1997 pp. 62‚Äì70 In August, Southey was offered by his uncle to travel together to Lisbon and afterwards to train as a lawyer. This upset Coleridge because he saw this as an act of betrayal and a destruction to their plans of Pantisocracy. There is no evidence that the two kept in contact for many months. During that time, Coleridge continued his engagement to Sara Fricker and wrote two poems to her, \\"The Eolian Harp\\", 20 August 1795, and \\"Lines Written at Shurton Bars\\", September 1795. He kept to his promise and married her on 4 October 1795.Ashton 1997 pp. 72‚Äì74 On 14 November, Southey married Edith with Coleridge writing a letter the day before stating that \\"You are lost to me, because you are lost to Virtue\\".Letter to Southey 13 November 1795 In the letter, Coleridge attacks Southey for causing the divide between the two of them and for pursuing money instead of their beliefs.ashton 1997 p. 74 Coleridge's and Southey's relationship dissolved, and Coleridge was without a close friend. However, he met William Wordsworth, a fellow poet, in September 1795 and would eventually become close with him. Their relationship did not yet start, and in January 1796 Coleridge was travelling to find subscribers for a proposed political magazine called The Watchman. During this time, he met with Erasmus Darwin and discussed both politics and religion; Darwin's atheism bothered Coleridge but he respected Darwin's philosophical views. He returned in February and The Watchman was first published on 1 March 1796 with the purpose of attacking the Gagging Acts. It was printed every 8 days, and the second on 9 March attacked the practice of Church-led fasting. The paper was soon discontinued on 13 May when Coleridge ran out of money to print it. The lack of funds was compounded by illness in Sara's family and the death of her brother-in-law. He was able to make money on the publication of Poems on Various Subjects, 16 April 1796, and by giving lectures about Roman history.Ashton 1997 pp. 74‚Äì83 Coleridge's Poems on Various Subjects was decently received and a second edition would be published in 1797 containing more poems. However, he lacked a steady income and began making plans on how to provide for his family. In May 1796, Coleridge resumed his friendship with Lamb after Lamb spent time in a madhouse. Also in May, a group of Coleridge's friends decided to give a small income in return for their appreciation of his talents, but he still needed more. He took on the son of a rich Quaker, Charles Lloyd, as a boarder, which allowed him to provide for his family. While making the deal on 19 September 1796, he received word that his wife gave birth to their son, Hartley. Coleridge began making plans for moving to the countryside at Nether Stowey and did so, much to the displeasure of Lamb. Eventually, Wordsworth joined him along with visits from Poole, Lamb, and other associates. He partially mended his friendship with Southey and contributed verse to Southey's Joan of Arc epic, lines later to be put together in the poem \\"The Destiny of Nations\\". In February 1797, Coleridge reviewed Matthew Lewis's The Monk for the Critical Review and began writing Osorio, a play requested by Sheridan for Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. While these works and others were being composed, Coleridge began to bond with Wordsworth, which started a close, poetic relationship that would influence both of their careers and inspire their greatest works.Ashton 1997 pp. 85‚Äì101 Pantisocracy Coleridge and Southey came up with a theoretical political government named Pantisocracy. Originally named Pantocracy, the system was intended be a perfect, egalitarian society formed in America. Poole discussed their ideal government during their visit, and had hope for what the system would accomplish. However, Poole thought that the system would have little chance for succeeding, and he advised Coleridge and Southey that there would be problems regarding females and marriage contracts within the society. As plans were developed, they formed a group of people that would become part of the society, including Southey's mother, Southey's fianc√©e and her family, and a few others that they knew. Coleridge and Southey also encouraged the group to study agriculture and carpentry to help with the settlement.Ashton 1997 pp. 46‚Äì50 When locals heard of the group's plans for starting a new society in the Americas, rumours were spread and criticism was lodged against Pantisocracy. This was compounded when Southey's aunt, with whom he was living, found out about both the idea and Southey's intention in marrying Edith Fricker, a person that his aunt felt was below his station. His aunt immediately stopped talking to him and kicked him out of her house. When Coleridge left for London, his thoughts about Pantisocracy began to change and he backed off his role in the matter. This was partly to blame for the intervention by Mary Evans and his brother George, and partly about Southey advocating for a master class and a servant class in their new society, all of which upset Coleridge.Ashton 1997 pp. 54‚Äì56 The idea did not completely collapse until Southey abandoned the plans in August 1795 in order to become a lawyer.Ashton 1997 p. 72 Early works Most of Coleridge's juvenalia was posthumously published. Those written while he attended Christ's Hospitals were imitations of conventional models of poetry during the late 18th-century. In particular, he focused on John Milton's L'Allegro, Il Penseroso, and his Lycidas, along with the poems of Collins, Gray, and Thomson. In terms of form, Coleridge relied on many abstract nouns that he would mark with capitalisation, and his nouns were constantly modified with a set of two adjectives. He did not start working with his own poetic form until 1794. Although they don't provide a sense of where Coleridge developed his poetry later, the school-age poems do give insight into Coleridge's thoughts and feelings during those years.Ashton 1997 p. 27 When Thomas Middleton gave Coleridge an edition of William Lisle Bowles's Sonnets, he was inspired by the poems and even wrote a sonnet to Bowles in praise of the poems' language in 1794. Other poets, including William Cowper and his conversational poem, The Task (1785), also served as an influence in terms of how to compose diction within poetry.Ashton 1997 pp. 29‚Äì30 Coleridge explained his feelings about those that influenced him in a letter to John Thelwall written on 17 December 1796, \\"But do not let us introduce an act of Uniformity against Poets ‚Äî I have room enough in my brain to admire, aye & almost equally, the head and fancy of Akenside, and the heart and fancy of Bowles, the solemn Lordliness of Milton, & the divine chit chat of Cowper.\\"Letter to John Thelwall 17 December 1796 It was also in 1794 when Coleridge began to emphasize nature in his works and transitioned into a Romantic poet. During the summer of that year, he worked closely with Southey and co-wrote the political drama The Fall of Robespierre, but it was not a success and lacked merit. However, his poetry took off after reading Schiller's play, Robbers, and composing a sonnet in response dedicated to Schiller during December near the time that he composed his sonnet to Bowles. The Bowles poem was included in the \\"Sonnets on Eminent Characters\\" series along with poems dedicated to Edmund Burke, Thomas Erskine, Godwin, Southey, Kosciusko, Pitt, Joseph Priestley, and Sheridan.Ashton 1997 pp. 52‚Äì61 Coleridge spent much of his time working on pamphlets and lecturing, especially on topics of political reform. He spoke often on liberal ideas and condemned practices such as slavery and movement within the British Parliament to expand sedition laws. When he spoke on religion, he emphasized Unitarianism and how it was a middle ground between the problems of Anglicanism and the problems of atheism. His religio-political views were influenced by the images found in the works of Spenser, Milton, and Bunyan, and his ideas were similar to those expounded by Priestley and David Harley. He especially disapproved notions of the Trinity and of Christian mysteries early on and instead substituted redemption without need for dogma. By 1805, he would change his views and become more Orthodox.Ashton 1997 pp. 68‚Äì71 NotesReferences * Ashton, Rosemary. The Life of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

He was the son of obstetrician Karl Christoph Hueter (1803‚Äì1857). In 1854 began his medical studies in Marburg at the age of 16. Following the state examination in Kassel (1858), he continued his education in Berlin, Vienna, England and Paris. In Paris (1861‚Äì63) he performed research of human joint anatomy. In 1865 he became an assistant to Bernhard von Langenbeck (1810-1887) in Berlin, and in 1868 succeeded surgeon Gustav Simon (1824-1876) at the University of Rostock. In 1870 he was appointed professor of surgery at the University of Greifswald, where in 1877 he was named university rector. Hueter was the author of a highly regarded work on joint diseases, Klinik der Gelenkkrankheiten mit Einschluss der Orthop√§die (1870), and with Strasbourg surgeon Georg Albert L√ºcke (1829‚Äì1894), he was co-founder of the journal Deutsche Zeitschrift f√ºr Chirurgie.

Goals  The four primary goals of the National Strategy for Homeland Security are: * Prevent and disrupt terrorist attacks; * Protect the American people, our critical infrastructure, and key resources; * Respond to and recover from incidents that do occur; and * Continue to strengthen the foundation to ensure our long-term success. The first three goals help to organize national efforts while the last goal entails creating and transforming homeland security principles, systems, structures, and institutions.NSHS page 1  Implementation  One of the first steps in implementing the strategy was the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. According to the \\"Homeland Security and National Security\\" section of the national strategy document:NSHS page 5 = NIMS/ICS = Generally, the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides local guidance on implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS) for local handling of emergency responses. As responses use up local resources, state and federal resources are mobilized under the National Response Framework, so that operational priorities are met during emergency responses of increasing size and complexity. All of these response activities are within the overall scope of the National Strategy for Homeland Security, whether emergency incidents are the result of terrorism or failure to respond may cause increased vulnerability to terrorism that may occur later.

The Colorado and San Juan rivers deposit large volumes of silt into Lake Powell, slowly decreasing its capacity. The sediment will eventually build up against the dam and could affect its safe operation and lead to its failure. The dam, anchored in unstable Navajo sandstone (sometimes said to be \\"solidified sand dunes\\"), nearly failed in 1983 as the result of a flood on the upper Colorado River that led to extended use of its tunnel spillways. The spillways, designed for short-term use, soon underwent cavitation and began to fail. Emergency installation of eight-foot flashboards and other efforts narrowly averted total failure. Siltation, concrete degradation, spillway operational problems, and unstable dam abutments are all key factors that affect the safe operation of the dam. It is estimated that a breach of the dam would produce a floodwave that would overtop the Hoover Dam. The dam's useful lifespan has been estimated by some to be no more than 85 to 100 years, and was described as \\"America's most regretted environmental mistake\\" by David Brower, then-head of the Sierra Club. Different estimates by the Bureau of Reclamation and others suggest a lifespan of between 500‚Äì700 years. Overview Glen Canyon Dam is a concrete arch dam on the Colorado River in northern Arizona in the United States, just north of Page. The dam was built to provide hydroelectricity and regulate the flow of the river from the upper Colorado River Basin into the lower. The Lake Powell reservoir is the second largest artificial lake in the country, extending upriver well into Utah. The dam is named for Glen Canyon, a colorful series of gorges, most of which now are buried under the reservoir. Construction of Glen Canyon Dam began in 1956 and was finished in 1966. When the reservoir filled, the dam began to deliver a steady, regulated flow of water downstream and generate a cheap, plentiful supply of electricity. In 1983, major floods nearly destroyed the two tunnel spillways that could have led to the dam's collapse, but disaster was averted by a close margin. By taming floods that were characteristic of the Colorado River, the dam has led to major physical and ecological changes in the lower river. Controversy continues over the positive and negative effects of the dam. Siltation The Colorado River carries an estimated 45 million tons of sediment annually at Glen Canyon, and as Lake Powell is the farthest large reservoir upstream on the Colorado River mainstem, the sediment load is completely trapped in the reservoir as the Colorado discharges into it. This sediment is creating a steadily advancing \\"toe\\" of sediment, i.e. an underwater alluvial fan, that is advancing towards the dam. Some estimates by conservationists predict that the sediment will reach the dam base in about 80 to 100 years, while others made primarily by government agencies estimate it will take as long as 500 to 700 years. It will take still longer for the sediment to accumulate to the point where it could clog the outlet works, which are the lowest openings in the upstream face of the dam. Some critics predict that if the water level then drops, it may fall below the penstock openings, which are higher up on the dam face, which will cause the release capacity of the dam to drop to zero. This would dewater the Colorado River bed below the dam which would remain dry until the next major spring inflow. Only springs, seeps and tributaries such as the Paria, Little Colorado and Virgin River would supply the river flow during these times, perhaps causing unprecedented drops in levels of Lake Mead as well. The primary failure mode for Glen Canyon dam will likely be an overtopping one spring caused by insufficient storage capacity (either a huge inflow, bigger than 1983, or insufficient storage capacity because the lake was too full of either water or sediment). Colorado River Delta today, showing inflows mostly from the Hardy River and other Mexican tributaries An example of the fast deposition rate of Colorado River sediment is found in Lake Mead itself, where, before the completion of Glen Canyon Dam, ten percent of its storage was already compromised by sediment. When Lake Powell levels drop, sediments deposited in its upper reaches are carried into the receding water by the Colorado and its tributaries. One large flash flood caused by heavy rainfall could move all or most of these sediments into Lake Powell, creating a sudden loss of storage capacity. The only way to control sediment flow in the reservoir, without removing the dam outright, is by dredging. 1983-84 flooding In May 1983, three years after Lake Powell was first filled, an unusually long-lasting winter due to the 1982-83 El Ni√±o event produced increased snowfall over the entire multi-state Colorado River basin. Dam engineers anticipated a normal winter, and maintained reservoir levels at their usual levels through the winter.The Year the Dam (Almost) Broke = Inflow capacity= Spring ended with a sudden influx of warm weather and then rain. The combination of rain and snowmelt eventually produced a combined inflow into Lake Powell of over per second. The average annual peak flow prior to 1963 was per second. The Bureau of Reclamation predicts that the probable maximum flood at Glen Canyon is per second, almost seven times the 1983 total. = Outflow capacity= Glen Canyon Dam has two tunnel spillways capable of allowing to bypass the dam's regular spillways. The spillway tunnels were excavated around both abutments of the dam, dropping steeply from their control gates on Lake Powell to connect with the lower reaches of the diversion tunnels, which were utilized as the lower ends of the dam's spillways. This measure saved cost, but introduced a weak point at the elbow where the two tunnels intersected. The upper ends of the diversion tunnels were then sealed with a solid concrete \\"plug\\".Powell, pp. 12‚Äì13 While this made the spillways more economical to construct, they had less capacity in part because engineers must maintain at least 30 percent clearance between the water level and the tunnel ceiling. in addition to the tunnel spillways, the dam has a set of river outlet works designed to release per second. The dam also releases water through the dam's power turbines, which are capable of releasing per second. The official spillway capacity is . = Tunnel spillways damaged = The releases from Glen Canyon Dam in May 1983 At first, as inflows exceeded normal levels, the US Bureau of Reclamation engineers opened penstocks to full release. When inflow rates continued to rise, they also opened the river outlet works. The reservoir continued to rise. Reclamation Bureau officials met in late June and agreed that the maximum water level the dam could handle was . At that level they feared they could not control the spillway gates. The engineers decided to raise the floodgates controlling the tunnel spillways. This became the first time that the spillways had ever been used for their intended purpose. Volume initially ran at per second per tunnel. After several days, noticeable vibrations were felt in the dam wall and surrounding rock. Water exiting the spillways contained noticeable debris, including sandstone, signaling severe erosion taking place within the tunnels. Reclamation responded by reducing releases by half, however, the rumblings continued. The noise was so noticeable that a worker in the employee dining room, located near the power plant, reported that it \\"sounded like the barrages that he had experienced in Vietnam\\". The engineers soon closed the spillways for an inspection. =Cavitation damage found= Inspection crews were lowered down the spillway tunnels in a small cart to assess damage. They found that cavitation, a known risk associated with tunnel spillways, had severely damaged and eroded the -thick concrete tunnel lining. In some locations the cavitation had exposed the soft sandstone. The tunnels could not be kept closed as more rain fell in the Colorado River Basin and the reservoir continued to rise. Reclamation reopened the left spillway, allowing per second; the right, which had suffered worse damage, was only permitted to carry per second. = Emergency flashboards installed= As the reservoir level increased, plywood flashboards were installed on top of the spillway gates. They allowed reservoir water to rise without increasing releases. = Tunnels damaged further= The left tunnel, however, was suffering further damage, described as a \\"surging, boiling flow that filled the portal\\". The tunnel had formed a hydraulic jump as it was turned into a \\"pressure conduit\\" by the surging flow of water. The interior erosion threatened to collapse the tunnel. Engineers knew that increasing the flow would decrease the turbulence but would further damage to the tunnel walls. To increase the reservoir's capacity further, engineers began an emergency effort to add to the height of the spillway gates, avoiding increasing the rate of water releases. Spillway gates at Glen Canyon Dam during 1983 flood. Note the flashboards installed atop to prevent water from overtopping the gates. = Diversion tunnel threatened= The force of the water at the left tunnel eroded concrete near the diversion plug, a device that blocked the diversion tunnel used during construction. The Bureau of Reclamation was concerned that the water would eventually erode the diversion plug altogether, creating a connection to the reservoir floor. This uncontrolled spillage would cause the reservoir to drain, creating a catastrophe. As the discharges from Glen Canyon Dam reached almost per second, with per second racing through the left spillway, the of flood storage space behind Hoover Dam downstream was exhausted. = Lake Powell reaches peak level= On July 15, 1983, Lake Powell reached its peak level, about 8 inches from where engineers thought they'd lose control. The water held steady for a few days and then gradually declined. Inflows to Lake Powell topped per second, while releases from Glen Canyon Dam topped per second. Eventually, Hoover Dam was also forced to open its gates; its discharge peaked at per second and still caused downstream flooding. As inflow lessened at the end of the season, dam engineers were able to draw Lake Powell down below critical levels. = Tunnel spillways seriously damaged= Glen Canyon Dam during the 1984 flood Inspections of both spillways found severe damage. In the more badly damaged left spillway, inspection crews discovered a deep, wide, and long hole. = Repairs and solutions = After the flood, it was suggested that the flashboards atop the spillway gates should be replaced with stronger boards and kept permanently; this would allow an \\"insurance\\" against a 1983-reminiscent flood. = Air slots added to tunnels= Research by the Bureau of Reclamation found that an air slot at a specific point in each spillway tunnel would introduce air bubbles that would prevent cavitation and resultant shockwaves. Spillway upgrades and repairs commenced immediately after the 1983 floods receded and continued through the winter of 1983-84. Through the winter, heavy snowpack was reported in the upper Colorado basin. It was feared that this would produce a flood greater than the 1983 one, and as the spillway repairs continued, water was constantly released through the dam power plant and outlet works, a rate of roughly per second. Assuming, roughly, that the river outlets have a capacity of 15000 and power plant has a rough capacity of 30000. = 1984 floods possible= The engineers allowed Lake Powell's level to fall to allow for the next winter's snowmelt. When the snowpack began to melt in spring of 1984, water levels reached several inches below the top of the flashboards in late June. As summer continued, inflows decreased and the reservoir level began to decrease. On August 12, 1984, construction teams completed repairs to the left spillway. It was tested at per second for several days. No noticeable damage was found in the spillways.The Colorado in Flood. Bureau of Reclamation Video, on display at Carl Hayden Visitor Center Lake Powell with \\"bathtub ring\\" = Aftermath= The 1983 flood, although it nearly caused a catastrophic disaster, was a \\"relatively small flood\\". It was, in fact, only a 25-year flood, or a flood that has a four percent chance of occurring in any given year. =Impact of dam failure= In 1990, the Bureau of Reclamation prepared a study of a Glen Canyon Dam failure. They predicted that if Lake Powell were at high pool, about of water would surge out of Lake Powell at an initial depth of over . Downstream communities and possibly every dam along the river, including Hoover Dam forming Lake Mead, Davis Dam forming Lake Mohave, Parker Dam forming Lake Havasu, Palo Verde Dam, and other dams and reservoirs, as well as riverside lowlands, would be inundated or severely damaged. The resulting flood would scour the bottom few hundred feet of the Grand Canyon. Glen Canyon Dam is the central element of the Colorado River Storage Project. If it failed, the resulting damage could limit or completely cut off water supply to residences or farmlands along the Colorado River, and depending on damage to canal headworks, even cut off water to southern California.

Life and work Osvaldo Drag√∫n was born in Colonia Berro, a Jewish agricultural settlement, near San Salvador in Entre R√≠os Province, Argentina. After his father's linseed farm suffered from recurrent locust problems, the family left the settlement for Buenos Aires. Drag√∫n left his university studies in 1953 to pursue his calling in the theatre.Audiovideoteca de Buenos Aires Joining the Fray Mocho Theatre in 1956, he premiered his first work, La peste viene de Melos (The Plague from Melos). The politically charged play, on the 1954 coup d'√©tat against Guatemalan President Jacobo √Årbenz, drew also from the playwright's own childhood memories of his father's struggles with locusts.Osvaldo Drag√∫n: Final de partida He continued to write controversial works for the Fray Mocho, including Historias para ser contadas (Tales to be Told), a series of short plays including Historia del hombre que se convirti√≥ en perro (The Story of the Man Who Turned into a Dog), Tupac Amaru and Milagro en el mercado viejo (Miracle at the Old Market), for which he received the Casa de las Am√©ricas Prize in 1962. His 1966 play, Heroica de Buenos Aires received the same distinction.DramaTeatro: El Teatro Abierto Argentino That June, however, one of Argentine independent theatre's most powerful opponents, General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, took power in a quiet coup.P√°gina/12: muri√≥ Jos√© Luis Mangieri Drag√∫n's stays abroad, which had begun in 1961, became more frequent, directing plays in several other Latin American countries and in the United States.Todo Argentina: personajes He continued to write politically themed plays, however, notably Historias con c√°rcel (Stories and Jail). He helped establish the Campana Comedy Theatre in 1969 and, six years later, premiered El Jard√≠n del Infierno (\\"The Garden of Hell\\") there.Comedia de Campana By then, independent Argentine theatre was limited not only by the boom in commercial theatre productions; but also by a climate of repression. Threats to artistic freedom during the country's last dictatorship were eased somewhat in 1980 with the support of the relatively moderate Army Chief, General Roberto Viola. Drag√∫n then premiered his ¬øY por casa c√≥mo andamos? (How're We Doing at Home?), a commentary on unhappy, paternalistic households and their effects on culture. The slowly improving climate of freedoms also led Drag√∫n to form a partnership with fellow playwrights Carlos Gorostiza and Roberto Cossa, as well as with numerous actors, to form an \\"Argentine Open Theatre\\", by which they hoped to encourage a return of the freedom of expression whose absence had led so many other cultural figures to leave Argentina since 1975. Converting a shuttered spark plug factory in the Balvanera district of Buenos Aires to the \\"Picadero Theatre,\\" they premiered a festival of their collective new works (including Drag√∫n's Mi obelisco y yo - \\"My Obelisk and Me\\") to acclaim on July 28, 1981. This success was marred by the theatre's fire bombing a week later, still an \\"unsolved mystery.\\"Centro Cultural Floreal Gorini: conferencia de prensa del 12 de mayo de 1981 The setback did not shutter the Open Theatre, however, which reopened in Corrientes Avenue's famed Tabaris Theatre (well-known locally for its revue). The Open Theatre's 1982 season, whose slogan was \\"winning back the streets,\\" featured Drag√∫n's Al violador (To the Rapist). The play was one in a trilogy that included Al perdedor (To the loser) - a semi-biographical look at ill-fated boxer Jos√© Mar√≠a Gatica - and Al vencedor (To the Victor). Following the Open Theatre's final season, in 1985, he wrote Arriba, coraz√≥n (Take Heart). The 1987 play was a success, and in 1988 Drag√∫n established the Theatre School of Latin America and the Caribbean in Havana (where he lived for a time), and reopened the Popular Theatre in Buenos Aires, in 1989. Drag√∫n relocated to Mexico City; but returned in 1996 to accept the prestigious post of Director of the Cervantes National Theatre. He helped revive the struggling Cervantes by organizing \\"theatre marathons\\" and the Ibero-American Theatre Encounters, which highlighted troupes from the Argentine hinterland and from other countries in the region, respectively. The director of the Cervantes was enjoying a night out with his wife at the Gran Splendid Cinema (today the El Ateneo Grand Splendid bookstore) on June 14, 1999, when he lost his life to heart failure at age 70.Clar√≠n The outspoken Osvaldo Drag√∫n was often out of favor among his colleagues, about which he once said: > I've always lived on islands. Cuba is an island, and the Fray Mocho Theatre > was, too. My hope is that one day, these islands will be the continent of > creativity and magic.

Sherwood Dixon was born in Dixon, Lee County, Illinois, the son of Henry S. and Margaret Casey Dixon. He was the great grandson of the founder of Dixon, \\"Father\\" John Dixon. Dixon was a 1920 graduate of the University of Notre Dame,(http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1952/08/13/page/2/article/new- nominees-family-one-of-states-oldest) a veteran of World War I and a Brigadier General in the Illinois National Guard. Dixon was a member of the Illinois Democratic State Central Committee (1938), a delegate to the 1952 Democratic National Convention and an alternate delegate to the 1940 and 1956 Democratic national conventions. He is best known for serving as the 36th Lieutenant Governor of Illinois, under Governor Adlai Stevenson II, from January 10, 1949, to January 13, 1953. Governor Stevenson sought re-election in 1952, and won the Democratic primary, however he was subsequently drafted as the Democratic presidential nominee that year (losing ultimately to Republican nominee Dwight D. Eisenhower). Dixon, who was already serving as Lieutenant Governor, replaced Stevenson as the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, but went on to lose to the Republican nominee, State Treasurer William G. Stratton. Dixon died in his hometown of the same name in 1973 and is interred in Oakwood Cemetery there.  Early life  1916 University of Notre Dame Football Team. Sherwood Dixon is fourth from the left in the second row and Assistant Coach Knute Rockne far right third row. Sherwood Dixon was a student at Notre Dame from 1915-1917, as WWI was in full bloom. During his two and a half years at Notre Dame, Dixon played football and made the varsity team as a backup center to \\"Big Frank\\" Frank Rydzewski. During his playing days at Notre Dame the team finished 18-3-1 under head coach Jesse Harper and a coaching staff that included assistant coach Knute Rockne. As a junior, Dixon, along with three other Notre Dame players, were caught playing semipro football for nearby Goshen, Indiana, on 4 November 1917. His violation against school rules resulted in Dixon being dismissed from the school team and suspended from the university on 10 November 1917. As his mother, Margaret (Casey) Dixon was a very strong willed and opinionated woman, Dixon enlisted as an Army private and joined the 332nd Infantry Regiment instead of returning home to face his mother wrath.  World War I  Photo of 1LT Sherwood Dixon shortly after the end of World War I The 332nd was a newly formed unit in Ohio and expected soon to head off to the war. Based on his college education, Sherwood Dixon was selected to be a company clerk. By the time his unit arrived in France, he was promoted to sergeant and assigned as a squad leader in one of the companies of the 2nd Battalion, 332nd Infantry Regiment, 83rd Division of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). In February 1918, the 332nd Infantry Regiment was sent to Italy and was the only US combat unit to fight on the Italian front during the war. During the later stages of the fighting in Italy, the regiment fought in the Battle of Vittorio-Veneto. Sergeant Sherwood Dixon's squad was one of the point squads of the 2nd battalion's attack across the Tagliamento River. During the attack, Dixon's company captured the village of San Vito, the bridge (Ponte) of Delizia and the village of Codroipo. They pressed a couple of miles to the edge of the village of Villaorba where they stopped as the Armistice in Italy went into effect, marking the end of the war in Italy. For his heroism, he was awarded the Silver Star and received a battlefield commission to lieutenant. After the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Dixon's unit moved past Trieste and on into Hungary where the 332nd became occupiers. During this period, Dixon's father, Henry S. Dixon sent him an application to take the Illinois Bar exam. Dixon completed the exam under the supervision of his company commander and returned the application which he subsequently passed. Having passed the Bar exam, Dixon return from the war as a decorated veteran, an Officer and as a lawyer after having fled college following his expulsion. Interwar years Upon returning to the United States and the University of Notre Dame, Dixon complete his undergraduate work in 1919 and Law School in 1920. By this point, Knute Rockne had succeeded Jesse Harper as Notre Dame's Head Coach and while back at school Dixon aided his former coach but did not return to playing football. After completing his formal education, Dixon returned to his hometown where he joined the family law practice. Over the coming years Dixon remained active with the Illinois National Guard and was an early leader of the local American Legion. Back in his hometown, Dixon would meet Helen Cahill, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Cahill. Helen was a school teacher in Dixon. Once again defying his strong willed mother, in September 1933 he and Helen eloped, drove to his alma mater and were wed at the log chapel on the campus at Notre Dame. Their first child, Henry Sherwood Dixon, would be born the following year. In the 1930s, Dixon would begin his foray into politics as a Democrat. Dixon served as president of the local school board and later served on various Democratic central committees to include both Lee County, and at the State level for Illinois.  World War II  In early 1941, now Lieutenant Colonel Sherwood Dixon commanded in the 129th Infantry Regiment as part of the 33rd Infantry Division of the Illinois National Guard when it was called to active duty. Within two years the 129th would be sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations, but because Dixon was over 45 years old, it was against Army regulations for him to deploy overseas. Instead, he was sent to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, and on 1 February 1943 Lieutenant Colonel Sherwood Dixon became the commander of the newly activate 3rd Battalion of the 442nd Infantry Regiment. The 442nd was a ‚ÄúNisei‚Äù unit composed of Japanese Americans, mostly from the Hawaiian Islands, but the officers above the rank of Lieutenant were white officers. Training started at the individual level but by the fall of 1943 the regiment had moved to company and battalion level training and exercises. Dixon focused on ensuring the battalion was at a top level of fitness and able to fight, even after extensive foot marches similar to what he experienced during the First World War. Early in 1944, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall, came to Mississippi to observe the regiment during maneuvers. Marshall was impressed with the performance of the unit. Shortly after, in late February 1944, the Army declared the 442nd combat ready. The unit soon began preparation for deployment to the European Theater of Operations. The 442nd Regiment became the most decorated unit in the history of American warfare, earning 9,486 Purple Hearts, eight Presidential Unit Citations (five in one month), and twenty-one of its members were awarded Medals of Honor. Again, Sherwood Dixon would be unable to deploy with the unit he trained, nurtured and mentored for the past year due to his age. Instead of heading off to fight in Italy for the second time, he was assigned to work for General Marshall in the Office of the Chief of Staff, in Washington DC. Dixon moved the now growing family of seven from southwest Mississippi to Alexandria, Virginia where he worked for the remainder of the war. However, his year with the 442nd created bonds with Japanese Americans that remained throughout the remainder of his life. Dixon would maintain correspondence with his former Soldiers as they fought in Italy, Southern France and into Germany. After the war he would frequently travel to Hawaii with his wife, Helen, to spend time with his former Soldiers and as late as 1997 his photo still hung in the 442nd Club in downtown Honolulu.  Political life  The November 2, 1948 Democratic ticket of Adlai E. Stevenson for Governor and Sherwood Dixon as Lieutenant Governor defeated the Republican nominees of Dwight Green and Richard Yates Rowe. Stevenson and Dixon mimicked the \\"whistle stop\\" tactic employed that year by the Democratic Presidential nominee Harry S. Truman. Their campaigning saw as many as 10 speeches a day. As the Illinois Lieutenant Governor, Sherwood Dixon presided over the Illinois State Senate as president pro tempore. During his tenure the legislative body consisted of only 18 Democrats to 32 Republicans. During the later part of his term, Dixon spent considerable time as acting governor for Stevenson, who was spending most of his time outside of Illinois during his campaign as the 1952 Democratic Presidential nominee. During this time, Sherwood Dixon was running his own campaign to succeed Stevenson as Governor. With only a week before the election, both Stevenson and Dixon would postpone their campaigns temporarily to respond to the prison riot at the Illinois State Prison at Menard. During the riot, over 300 prisoners seized control of one of the cell blocks for four days, while taking seven prison guards hostage. During the riot, Dixon's wife, Helen, substituting for her husband, appeared at numerous campaign events to include being at the side of President Harry S. Truman at one of his \\"whistle stops\\" in Illinois. Dixon ended up losing to Stratton by 227,642 votes, 5.16%.  Personal life  Sherwood Dixon's wife, Helen Cahill, was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Cahill, also of Dixon, Illinois. Sherwood and Helen married at the chapel on the campus of the University of Notre Dame in September, 1933. They had seven children Henry, Mary, William, Louise, James, Patrick, and David. Their son, James E. Dixon, was Mayor of Dixon from 1983‚Äì1991. Their son, 1LT Patrick M. Dixon, was killed in action in Vietnam on 28 May 1969.

These are genera and species, insofar as genera or species such as \\"animal\\", \\"man\\" or \\"horse\\" are not found in sensible nature, except as individual man or horse. Aristotle The concept of the form as being what makes knowledge possible dates back to the time of Socrates. Aristotle is credited with making the distinction that led to the idea of the intelligible form. He argued that the mind is divided into the active and passive intellect, where the passive intellect receives the forms of things in order to be known, and the active intellect then turns possible knowledge into knowledge in act.Aristotle, De Anima, Bk. III, ch. 5 (430a10-25). Plotinus According to Plotinus, the power of the Demiurge (the 'craftsman' of the cosmos) is derived from the power of thought. When the demiurge creates, he governs the purely passive nature of matter by imposing a sensible form, which is an image of the intelligible forms contained as thoughts within the mind of the Demiurge, upon the pure passivity of matter. The form establishes its existence in the sensible realm merely through the thought of the Demiurge, which is nous.Plotinus at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Retrieved on May 15, 2009 Aquinas In chapter 81 of the Compendium Theologiae, Saint Thomas Aquinas states that \\"the higher an intellectual substance is in perfection, the more universal are the intelligible forms it possesses.

This is the reason it receives its intelligible forms from sensible things.\\" He further states that \\"a form must have some proportion to the potency which receives it.

The taxon was discovered and named by Kissel & Reisz in 2004.Kissel, R. A. & Reisz, R. R.

The only species in the taxon, Ianthodon schultzei, was found by separating it from a block that also contained the remains of Petrolacosaurus and Haptodus. The evolutionary significance of the taxon wasn't realized until a publication in 2015. The fossil of this organism was discovered in Garnett, Kansas. Description Ianthodon was first named by Kissel & Reisz in 2004, and a more detailed specimen was reevaluated in 2014. This single juvenile skeleton with delicate bones has an estimated skull length of around 10 cm, which is similar to other taxa, such as Haptodus, during the same development stage. The specimen was easily distinguished from the skeletal element of PetrolacosaurusRoger B. J.

It can be distinguished from Haptodus by its narrower skull and dentition. The higher number of precaninie maxillary teeth and the more rectangular shape of the humerus distinguish the holotype of H. garnettensis from that of Ianthodon. The teeth of Ianthodon have wide bases but slender crowns, unusual among contemporary amniotes and indicating that Ianthodon occupied a different trophic niche from the bulbous-crowned Haptodus to which it was closely related. Like other sphenacodonts, Ianthodon has a tall lacrimal bone, and so would have had a proportionally taller snout than more basal synapsids such as varanopids and eothyridids.  Classification  Ianthodon belongs to the clade Sphenodontia within the clade Sphenocomorpha. It played an important role in understanding the initial evolution of Sphenacodonts.Currie, P. J.: A new haptodontine sphenacodont (Reptilia: Pelycosauria) from the Upper Pennsylvanian of North America, J. Paleontol., 51, 927‚Äì942, 1977 It also provided important evidence of the reptilian-mammal transition.Kemp, T. S.: Mammal-like Reptiles and the Origin of Mammals, Academic Press, New York, 1982 The cladogram below follows a cladistic analysis by Spindler and colleagues.  Paleobiology and evolutionary significance  The clear morphological evidence of the new material initialize the finalization of the understanding of the radiation of the Sphenacomorpha,Osborn, H. F.: The reptilian subclasses Diapsida and Synapsida and the early history of the Diaptosauria, Memoirs of the American Museum of Natural History, 1, 449‚Äì507, 1903 and the evolution of that led to the emergence of mammal. So based on the information, it was concluded that basal Sphenacomorphs came from a generalist form with a great potential for adaptions. However, the understanding of Ianthodon and basal Sphenacodonts are still relatively limited by the number of the specimen available for study and further excavation of Garnett fauna is required, despite the present evidence suggests that Ianthodon represents the primitive condition of sphenacodont evolution,Reisz, R.

The rifle was introduced in 2009 in 223 Remington/5.56√ó45mm NATO and as a .308 Winchester AR-10 variant in 2013, the SR-762.Gilbert, Glenn M., Ruger's SR-556: Ready To Run, Right Out Of The Box, American Rifleman, October 2009 It is one of several 21st-century AR-15 rifles to use gas piston operation (SR-556). In January 2016 Ruger discontinued all SR-556 rifles and introduced a new takedown variant with a lightweight KeyMod handguard.  Overview  The rifle features a \\"two-stage\\" piston mechanism as opposed to the semi-direct impingement system of the AR-15. Gas flow is controlled by a four position regulator. Several key parts, such as the short stroke gas piston, gas regulator, and bolt/carrier group are chrome plated. The bolt carrier features an integral lug in place of the AR-15's gas key. The flash hider is similar to Ruger's AC-556 and Mini-14GB. The 5.56 rifle includes a number of other manufacturer's parts such as a Troy Industries railed handguard and Samson folding iron sights, a Hogue rubberized pistol grip, and three Magpul PMAG 30-round STANAG magazines. The 7.62 variant uses SR-25 pattern magazines. The SR-556SC comes with three 10-round magazines and does not have the flash hider or collapsible stock, making it compliant in several states with restrictive rifle laws. The barrel is , chrome lined, and features a six groove, right hand, 1: twist. In August 2010, Ruger announced that the rifle would be offered in the 6.8mm Remington SPC cartridge. Ruger's introduction of the SR-556 was met with some criticism for its high price tag of around US$2,000. Ruger products are usually known for affordability, but the SR-556 is essentially a regular AR-15 albeit with a different, more complicated operating system, unlike cheaper alternatives, like the Smith & Wesson M&P; Sport and Sport II model rifles, of which the original Sport model lacked a forward assist and dust cover. The SR-556 was also criticized for its heavier weight than other AR-15s. Ruger addressed these shortcomings by introducing a lighter and less expensive rifle, the SR-556E.  Ruger AR-556  In September 2014, Ruger announced the AR-556, a variant that utilizes traditional direct impingement action, intended to compete with other entry- level AR-15s. It was produced to compete with other AR-15 models, including the Smith & Wesson M&P15; Sport. In March 2019, the company announced a pistol version with a 10.5-inch barrel, and an SB Tactical stabilizing brace.

Web. H. scholtzi was first described by Broom in 1907 who originally placed it as an early diapsid. It is named for his student, T.J.R. Scholtz, and was originally called Galechirus scholtzi. Later work placed it as an Eosuchian in the family Younginidae and even proposed as an ancestor for Archosauria. More recent work has placed it where it is now within Mycterosaurinae in the family Varanopidae. The closely related Elliotsmithia longiceps has been placed in a sister taxon to H. scholtzi. Geology The exact locale of the holotype is uncertain due to Broom's inexact description, but work by Reisz and Modesto (2007) places it in the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone exposures in Victoria West. This makes the horizon the Abrahamskraal formation, Beaufort Group, in the Karoo Basin. The discovery of the second fossil in that locale confirmed this as the horizon. Description and paleobiologyGeneral= Basal Varanopids are small, slender animals specialized for a specific feeding niche. H. scholtzi have six main features that are Varanopid autapomorphies, placing them firmly in the family. These are their slender, elongated quadratojugals; anterodorsal sloping of the quadrate; parasphenoid dentition; elongate hyoids; plate-like interclavicle heads; and their recurved and serrated teeth with a labiolingual compression. They also have three main autapomorphies unique to the species; these are the trunk osteoderms, ornamentation on the surangular and angular, and a longitudinal median groove ventrally placed on the dorsal centra surface. =Known fossil specimens= The holotype fossil, SAM-PK-1070, is preserved in negative relief and has a partial skull, mandibles, axial skeleton, pectoral and pelvic girdles, osteoderms, and femur elements. The preserved femurs include a complete left and partial right. Partial skull elements present are the maxilla, quadrate, parabasisphenol, jugal, quadratojugal, mandible, and the palate. Little of the skull roof remains in this specimen. The alveolar region of the mandible has five teeth preserved in it. The aggregate fossil composed of five individuals is better preserved and showed several new features not present in the holotype. These include a contact between the maxilla and both the prefrontal and the quadratojugals. An anterior inclination of the occiput and the exclusion of the quadratojugal from the temporal fenestra are also clear in this specimen. However, Spindler et al. (2018) transferred this aggregation to the separate species Microvaranops parentis. =Skull morphology= Many aspects of the skull structure are apparent between the two fossils. The overall shape is triangular and narrow, typical of Varanopids. H. scholtzi‚Äôs snout is made up of the premaxilla bone. A long narrow rectangular process of the naris along the antorbital region forms a straight dorsal border with the external naris. Where the premaxilla meets with the naris there is a straight suture instead of the Varanopid typical V shaped one. The jugal and quadratojugal have pinched tubercular ornamentation on the lateral sides. The quadratojugal has the elongated and slender shape distinct to the Varanopids, as well as a slender groove on the dorsal edge. This serves as an attachment for the squamosal, which extends anteriorly under the lateral temporal fenestra. The right jugal is almost completely preserved with clear postorbital and subtemporal rami and a large tubercle near the ventral edge. The vomers are long and slender with marginal teeth present on the medial edge of the right vomer. H. scholtzi has ventrally preserved palantines that have extending diagonally across. Near the posterior edge of the internal naris they bifurcate. Suborbital fenestrae could not have been supported by the palantines due to their width. Presence of this kind of fenestrae are seen in diapsids but absent in basal synapsids. The parabasisphenoid has a cultriform process, the extended process at the anterior end of the braincase, that is transversely broad with a deep parabolic groove between cristae ventrolaterals. These are ridges formed by the lateral edges of the bones. Posteriorly paired depressions of the parabasisphenoid were likely for cervicle muscle attachments. Small alveoli for teeth are also present on a continuous plate ventrally on the cultriform process. Reisz (2007) describe a posterior coronoid, which was originally described as the prearticular by Carroll (1976).Carroll, R. L. \\"Eosuchians and the Origin of Archosaurs.\\" Athlon: Essays on Paleontology in Honour of Loris Shano Russell. By Loris Shano. Russell and C. S. Churcher. Toronto: Royal Ontario Museum, 1976. 58-79. Print. An anterior coronoid is also described by Reisz which was originally described as the splenial by Broom (1907). The angular and surangular ornamentation are prolate and pustolous shaped tubercles [R]. Typical of Varanopids the ceratohyal is elongated and slender, acting like a strut that extends past the posterior end of the skull. H. scholtzi‚Äôs parietals are broad, triangular, and take up most of the post- orbital region. The corners form a wing-like concave process postlaterally. The pineal foramen is large, oval in shape, and slightly sunken into the parietals. Teeth of H. scholtzi are typical of Varanopids with a recurved shape, serrated mesially and distally on some. A slightly larger caniniform is present a third of the way in from the anterior end of the maxilla. These teeth are very similar to those of Mycterosaurus, but a little more robust. =Postcranial morphology= Vertebrae of H. scholtzi have neural arches that are slightly longer anteroposteriorly than they are wide, a feature also seen in Mycterosaurus. Neural spines have a blade like structure that are relatively narrow dorsally. Most Varanopids have shallow grooves on the lateral surfaces of their vertebrae, but this is only seen in the cervical region of H. scholtzi. This feature is also seen in Mesenosaurus. The cervical vertebrae have a median ventral keel that is well developed. Dorsal vertebrae have a broad ridge running along the midline of the centrum, subdivided by a shallow groove. This feature is unique and very uncommon in basal amniotes. Articulation of the vertebrae can be seen in some of the individuals in the aggregate fossil, SAM-PK-K8305. This includes the caudal region of the vertebral column. Slender ribs attached have holocephalous heads joined by a web of bones. The proximal ends are slender while the heads are triangular in shape. Very slender gastralia are present in the aggregate fossil. Surrounding the ventral column are a series of osteoderms, small rounded ossicles. These are a key autapomorphy of H. scholtzi and are articulated in the aggregate fossil. They form transverse rows of up to five osteoderms, with two to three rows per vertebrae. This feature is shared by Elliotsmithia, another Permian synapsid.Reisz, R. R., D. W. Dilkes and Berman, D.

Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 18:602‚Äì611. Preservation of the scapulacoracoids is good and show an autapomorphy for Varanopids, lack of a supraglenoid. The scapular blade of H. scholtzi is low and broad. Clavicles are preserved in both fossils and are long slender rods with narrow heads. These are positioned posterodorsally with the posterior edges tapering to connect with the scapulacoracoids. The interclavicle head has a plate like shape with a long shaft, estimated by Reisz to be around the same length of six centra. The humerus is slender with narrow ends, well preserved in one individual of the aggregate fossil. An ectepicondylar foramen is formed from the supinator process and ectiepicondyle. Radii and ulna are preserved in the aggregate and are about equal in length, about 83% of the humerus length. The radius is almost straight and the ulna slightly more robust. Two of the juvenile individuals of the aggregate have radii with a slightly bowed shape. The metacarpals and phalanges of H. scholtzi have a long and slender shape to them. Pelvic girdles are preserved in both fossils and shows the anteroposteriorly elongated ischium typical of synapsids as well as a blade like distal shape and a well-developed pubic foramen. The ilium is also elongated and rises anteriorly above the acetabulum. At the anterodorsal margin of the acetabulum the ilium and pubis connect posteriorly to form it. The pubis does not fuse to the ilium but instead twists to lay 90 degrees to the iliac blade. Femurs are preserved in both fossils and are slender, elongated bones with a sigmoidal curve.Berman, David S., and Robert R.

In modern Greek usage, it corresponds to the rank of Field Marshal.  Byzantine Empire  The term originated in the Byzantine Empire, where, in the 9th to 11th centuries, the stratarchai were a class of senior officials in charge of military finances and administration, including the hetaireiarches (commander of the mercenary guards), the droungarios of the Fleet, the logothetes ton agelon who supervised the army's horse-breeding farms, the komƒìs tou staulou (Count of the Stable) and the protospatharios of the basilikoi anthropoi. By the late 11th century, this technical meaning was forgotten, and the term stratarches, along with variants such as megas stratarches (\\"grand stratarches\\") and panstratarches (\\"all-stratarches\\"), came to be used as an honorific epithet for important generals. In this use it is for instance used to describe the famed literary hero Digenis Akritas, or famous past commanders, such as Belisarius.  Modern Greece  Rank insignia of a Stratarchis during the Kingdom of Greece In modern Greek history, the title (modern phonetic transliteration: stratarchis) retains the connotation of a victorious commander, and has been used unofficially for the two most successful Greek field commanders of the Greek War of Independence: Theodoros Kolokotronis in the Morea (Peloponnese) and Georgios Karaiskakis in Roumeli (Central Greece). As a technical term, it is also used to render in Greek the rank and dignity of Field Marshal. In this capacity, the rank was first awarded to King Constantine I in 1913, following the victorious Balkan Wars. It was awarded again to his son, King George II, in 1939, and was held by his successors, Paul and Constantine II up to the abolition of the Greek monarchy in 1973‚Äì74. Apart from the reigning monarchs, only one professional officer has been awarded the rank: General Alexandros Papagos, who was awarded it on 28 October 1949 in recognition of his services during the Greco-Italian War and the Greek Civil War. In addition, Lieutenant General Theodoros Grivas was bestowed the rank on 23 October 1862 for his leadership in the revolt that led to the ousting of King Otto, but died the following day, before it could be conferred to him in person. The rank of Stratarchis has not been retained by the current Third Hellenic Republic.

Such a collection is usually called an array variable, array value, or simply array.Robert W. Sebesta (2001) Concepts of Programming Languages. Addison- Wesley. 4th edition (1998), 5th edition (2001), By analogy with the mathematical concepts vector and matrix, array types with one and two indices are often called vector type and matrix type, respectively. Language support for array types may include certain built-in array data types, some syntactic constructions (array type constructors) that the programmer may use to define such types and declare array variables, and special notation for indexing array elements. For example, in the Pascal programming language, the declaration \`type MyTable = array [1..4,1..2] of integer\`, defines a new array data type called \`MyTable\`. The declaration \`var A: MyTable\` then defines a variable \`A\` of that type, which is an aggregate of eight elements, each being an integer variable identified by two indices. In the Pascal program, those elements are denoted \`A[1,1]\`, \`A[1,2]\`, \`A[2,1]\`,‚Ä¶ \`A[4,2]\`.K. Jensen and Niklaus Wirth, PASCAL User Manual and Report. Springer. Paperback edition (2007) 184 pages, Special array types are often defined by the language's standard libraries. Dynamic lists are also more common and easier to implement than dynamic arrays. Array types are distinguished from record types mainly because they allow the element indices to be computed at run time, as in the Pascal assignment \`A[I,J] := A[N-I,2*J]\`. Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array variable. In more theoretical contexts, especially in type theory and in the description of abstract algorithms, the terms \\"array\\" and \\"array type\\" sometimes refer to an abstract data type (ADT) also called abstract array or may refer to an associative array, a mathematical model with the basic operations and behavior of a typical array type in most languages ‚Äî basically, a collection of elements that are selected by indices computed at run-time. Depending on the language, array types may overlap (or be identified with) other data types that describe aggregates of values, such as lists and strings. Array types are often implemented by array data structures, but sometimes by other means, such as hash tables, linked lists, or search trees.  History  Heinz Rutishauser's programming language Superplan (1949‚Äì1951) included multi-dimensional arrays. Rutishauser however although describing how a compiler for his language should be built, did not implement one. Assembly languages and low-level languages like BCPLJohn Mitchell, Concepts of Programming Languages. Cambridge University Press. generally have no syntactic support for arrays. Because of the importance of array structures for efficient computation, the earliest high-level programming languages, including FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1960), and Algol 60 (1960), provided support for multi-dimensional arrays. Abstract arrays An array data structure can be mathematically modeled as an abstract data structure (an abstract array) with two operations :get(A, I): the data stored in the element of the array A whose indices are the integer tuple I. :set(A,I,V): the array that results by setting the value of that element to V. These operations are required to satisfy the axiomsLukham, Suzuki (1979), \\"Verification of array, record, and pointer operations in Pascal\\". ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 1 (2), 226-244. :get(set(A,I, V), I) = V :get(set(A,I, V), J) = get(A, J) if I ‚â† J for any array state A, any value V, and any tuples I, J for which the operations are defined. The first axiom means that each element behaves like a variable. The second axiom means that elements with distinct indices behave as disjoint variables, so that storing a value in one element does not affect the value of any other element. These axioms do not place any constraints on the set of valid index tuples I, therefore this abstract model can be used for triangular matrices and other oddly-shaped arrays.  Implementations  In order to effectively implement variables of such types as array structures (with indexing done by pointer arithmetic), many languages restrict the indices to integer data types (or other types that can be interpreted as integers, such as bytes and enumerated types), and require that all elements have the same data type and storage size. Most of those languages also restrict each index to a finite interval of integers, that remains fixed throughout the lifetime of the array variable. In some compiled languages, in fact, the index ranges may have to be known at compile time. On the other hand, some programming languages provide more liberal array types, that allow indexing by arbitrary values, such as floating-point numbers, strings, objects, references, etc.. Such index values cannot be restricted to an interval, much less a fixed interval. So, these languages usually allow arbitrary new elements to be created at any time. This choice precludes the implementation of array types as array data structures. That is, those languages use array-like syntax to implement a more general associative array semantics, and must therefore be implemented by a hash table or some other search data structure.  Language support  Multi-dimensional arrays = The number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or rank of the array type. (This nomenclature conflicts with the concept of dimension in linear algebra,see the definition of a matrix where it is the number of elements. Thus, an array of numbers with 5 rows and 4 columns, hence 20 elements, is said to have dimension 2 in computing contexts, but represents a matrix with dimension 4-by-5 or 20 in mathematics. Also, the computer science meaning of \\"rank\\" is similar to its meaning in tensor algebra but not to the linear algebra concept of rank of a matrix.) A two-dimensional array stored as a one-dimensional array of one-dimensional arrays (rows). Many languages support only one-dimensional arrays. In those languages, a multi-dimensional array is typically represented by an Iliffe vector, a one-dimensional array of references to arrays of one dimension less. A two-dimensional array, in particular, would be implemented as a vector of pointers to its rows. Thus an element in row i and column j of an array A would be accessed by double indexing (A[i][j] in typical notation). This way of emulating multi-dimensional arrays allows the creation of jagged arrays, where each row may have a different size ‚Äî or, in general, where the valid range of each index depends on the values of all preceding indices. This representation for multi-dimensional arrays is quite prevalent in C and C++ software. However, C and C++ will use a linear indexing formula for multi- dimensional arrays that are declared with compile time constant size, e.g. by \`int A[10][20]\` or \`int A[m][n]\`, instead of the traditional \`int **A\`.Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (1988), The C programming Language. Prentice-Hall, p. 81. = Indexing notation = Most programming languages that support arrays support the store and select operations, and have special syntax for indexing. Early languages used parentheses, e.g. \`A(i,j)\`, as in FORTRAN; others choose square brackets, e.g. \`A[i,j]\` or \`A[i][j]\`, as in Algol 60 and Pascal (to distinguish from the use of parentheses for function calls). = Index types = Array data types are most often implemented as array structures: with the indices restricted to integer (or totally ordered) values, index ranges fixed at array creation time, and multilinear element addressing. This was the case in most \\"third generation\\" languages, and is still the case of most systems programming languages such as Ada, C, and C++. In some languages, however, array data types have the semantics of associative arrays, with indices of arbitrary type and dynamic element creation. This is the case in some scripting languages such as Awk and Lua, and of some array types provided by standard C++ libraries. = Bounds checking = Some languages (like Pascal and Modula) perform bounds checking on every access, raising an exception or aborting the program when any index is out of its valid range. Compilers may allow these checks to be turned off to trade safety for speed. Other languages (like FORTRAN and C) trust the programmer and perform no checks. Good compilers may also analyze the program to determine the range of possible values that the index may have, and this analysis may lead to bounds-checking elimination. = Index origin = Some languages, such as C, provide only zero-based array types, for which the minimum valid value for any index is 0. This choice is convenient for array implementation and address computations. With a language such as C, a pointer to the interior of any array can be defined that will symbolically act as a pseudo-array that accommodates negative indices. This works only because C does not check an index against bounds when used. Other languages provide only one-based array types, where each index starts at 1; this is the traditional convention in mathematics for matrices and mathematical sequences. A few languages, such as Pascal and Lua, support n-based array types, whose minimum legal indices are chosen by the programmer. The relative merits of each choice have been the subject of heated debate. Zero-based indexing has a natural advantage to one- based indexing in avoiding off-by-one or fencepost errors.Edsger W. Dijkstra, \\"Why numbering should start at zero\\" See comparison of programming languages (array) for the base indices used by various languages. = Highest index = The relation between numbers appearing in an array declaration and the index of that array's last element also varies by language. In many languages (such as C), one should specify the number of elements contained in the array; whereas in others (such as Pascal and Visual Basic .NET) one should specify the numeric value of the index of the last element. Needless to say, this distinction is immaterial in languages where the indices start at 1, such as Lua. = Array algebra = Some programming languages support array programming, where operations and functions defined for certain data types are implicitly extended to arrays of elements of those types. Thus one can write A+B to add corresponding elements of two arrays A and B. Usually these languages provide both the element-by-element multiplication and the standard matrix product of linear algebra, and which of these is represented by the * operator varies by language. Languages providing array programming capabilities have proliferated since the innovations in this area of APL. These are core capabilities of domain-specific languages such as GAUSS, IDL, Matlab, and Mathematica. They are a core facility in newer languages, such as Julia and recent versions of Fortran. These capabilities are also provided via standard extension libraries for other general purpose programming languages (such as the widely used NumPy library for Python). = String types and arrays = Many languages provide a built-in string data type, with specialized notation (\\"string literals\\") to build values of that type. In some languages (such as C), a string is just an array of characters, or is handled in much the same way. Other languages, like Pascal, may provide vastly different operations for strings and arrays. = Array index range queries = Some programming languages provide operations that return the size (number of elements) of a vector, or, more generally, range of each index of an array. In C and C++ arrays do not support the size function, so programmers often have to declare separate variable to hold the size, and pass it to procedures as a separate parameter. Elements of a newly created array may have undefined values (as in C), or may be defined to have a specific \\"default\\" value such as 0 or a null pointer (as in Java). In C++ a std::vector object supports the store, select, and append operations with the performance characteristics discussed above. Vectors can be queried for their size and can be resized. Slower operations like inserting an element in the middle are also supported. = Slicing = An array slicing operation takes a subset of the elements of an array-typed entity (value or variable) and then assembles them as another array-typed entity, possibly with other indices. If array types are implemented as array structures, many useful slicing operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector of the structure. The possible slicings depend on the implementation details: for example, FORTRAN allows slicing off one column of a matrix variable, but not a row, and treat it as a vector; whereas C allow slicing off a row from a matrix, but not a column. On the other hand, other slicing operations are possible when array types are implemented in other ways. = Resizing = Some languages allow dynamic arrays (also called resizable, growable, or extensible): array variables whose index ranges may be expanded at any time after creation, without changing the values of its current elements. For one- dimensional arrays, this facility may be provided as an operation \\"\`append\`(A,x)\\" that increases the size of the array A by one and then sets the value of the last element to x. Other array types (such as Pascal strings) provide a concatenation operator, which can be used together with slicing to achieve that effect and more. In some languages, assigning a value to an element of an array automatically extends the array, if necessary, to include that element. In other array types, a slice can be replaced by an array of different size\\" with subsequent elements being renumbered accordingly ‚Äî as in Python's list assignment \\"A[5:5] = [10,20,30]\\", that inserts three new elements (10,20, and 30) before element \\"A[5]\\". Resizable arrays are conceptually similar to lists, and the two concepts are synonymous in some languages. An extensible array can be implemented as a fixed-size array, with a counter that records how many elements are actually in use. The \`append\` operation merely increments the counter; until the whole array is used, when the \`append\` operation may be defined to fail. This is an implementation of a dynamic array with a fixed capacity, as in the \`string\` type of Pascal. Alternatively, the \`append\` operation may re-allocate the underlying array with a larger size, and copy the old elements to the new area.

At , the known site of the Iron Age settlement in Mellor is partially under St Thomas Church and extends into the gardens of several nearby houses. It is on a spur about above sea level, between two valleys which drop steeply away and run west where the two small streams in the valleys meet the River Goyt, approximately above sea level. The site commands views of the Cheshire Plain and Alderley Edge to the south and the range of hills to the north.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 11. Although there are higher points locally, the site has access to a water supply and the river valleys, and there is flat land to the west which could have been used agriculturally.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 18. Background Until the 19th century little was known about hill forts; none had been excavated and their original purpose had long been forgotten. In the medieval period their origin was ascribed to various iconic figures such as Julius Caesar, King Arthur, King Alfred, the Danes, and even giants. By the 18th century it was thought that hill forts were Roman in origin.Cunliffe (1983), p. 11. Opinion changed again in the 19th century following a large scale investigation by Augustus Pitt-Rivers, who concluded that hill forts were built during the Iron Age.Cunliffe (1983), pp. 12-13. The study of hill forts was popular in the 19th century, with a revival in the 20th century due to excavations at Danebury.Cunliffe (1983), p. 12. However it was not until the 1990s that the settlement at Mellor was discovered; the site had a lack of tell-tale earthworks, such as a circular ditch (which would indicate ancient activity).Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 20. Excavations began in 1998 where unusual marks had been noted in 1995 during a drought. Instead of the medieval ditch the marks were thought to denote, the ditch of an Iron Age hill fort was revealed. As of 2009 the excavations are ongoing. Before these excavations began, relatively little was known about the prehistory of the Stockport area before about 1,200 BC.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 49. It was generally thought that the areas of Marple and Mellor had been mostly untouched by prehistoric human activity, including during the Romano-British period. Little is known about Iron Age activity in North West England as pottery is rare on the sites excavated in the region, and there is a dearth of settlement sites. Of the more than 1,300 hill forts found in EnglandForde-Johnston (1962), pp. 13‚Äì14. relatively few are in the northwest. The paucity of known sites led archaeologist Colin Haselgrove to describe the region as a \\"black hole\\" for the Iron Age.Hodgson & Brennand (2006), p. 51. Mellor is the only hill fort in Greater Manchester, and one of four known Iron Age settlement sites in the county.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 52. History There is evidence of human activity on the site pre-dating the Iron Age, as far back as 8,000-6,000 BC. During this period Mellor may have been a knap site where flint tools were produced, and also may have been a seasonal camp. Over 200 lithics have been recovered and range from the early to the late Mesolithic. A high proportion of the flints are bladed tools, indicating that the people who produced them were hunter gatherers. Bronze Age artefacts are rare on the site, and there is no definitive indication of habitation in this period. Despite this, it is likely that the long-term habitation of the site had its roots in the late Bronze Age. A flint dagger was discovered on the site. This type of artefact is rare in Greater Manchester; the nearest comparable site is in Saddleworth. Its presence has been taken as an indication that during the Bronze Age the site was used for funerary practices. Many of the hills near Mellor are surmounted by Bronze Age funerary monuments such as Brown Low, Shaw Cairn, and Werneth Low, supporting the possibility that Mellor was also a funerary site.The possibility of its being a stray find is unlikely as it is a high status object. Nevell & Redhead (2005), pp. 21-22. Also dating from the Bronze Age and found on the site was a rare high-status amber necklace. Amber does not occur naturally in Britain - the nearest source is the Baltic. It would have been traded over long distances. The necklace was discovered as part of a 4,000‚Äëyear‚Äëold burial. Bronze Age amber necklace discovered in 2008 The hill fort was built in and used throughout the Iron Age, as demonstrated by finds from the site which span the period.Nevell & Redhead (2005), pp. 23-24. Occupants lived in roundhouses, and habitation of the site was spread over a long period. In common with many other hill forts, the site was probably divided into separate areas for habitation, industry, and agricultural activities such as storage, although the layout of these areas changed over time.Nevell & Redhead (2005), pp. 29-30. Excavations indicate that the area enclosed by the inner ditch was used mainly for habitation, while the area between the inner and outer ditches was agricultural. The separation was not necessarily fixed as some of the outer area shows signs that it was used as a living space. The Roman fort of Melandra is nearby.Nevell & Redhead (2005), pp. 32-33. Fragments of glass, possibly Roman in origin, and shards of pottery which date to the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, indicate the site was used in the Romano-British period. However no Roman structures have been discovered, and the nature of Roman activity at the site is a source of speculation. The position of the hilltop indicate that it was easily defended; however, local finds indicate it was a high-status settlement rather than a military outpost unless a similar feature was located nearby. One reason that Roman structures have not been identified is that the Romano-British inhabitants may have used roundhouses rather than buildings of a typically rectilinear Roman style. This would make them more difficult to differentiate from Iron Age roundhouses and would imply a continuation of local culture rather than an imposition of Roman style. It is also possible that Romans simply influenced the area, rather than actively occupying the site.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 33.Philpott (2006), p. 74. The site was later abandoned and forgotten until its rediscovery in the 1990s. Investigation With sites such as Danebury where there is no modern habitation or built environment, extensive excavations can be undertaken to establish the general layout. The modern settlement of Mellor extends over the Iron Age hill fort, which restricts archaeological investigation. A geophysical survey was performed to establish the extent of the settlement; methods such as magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar were successful in identifying the eastern and northern sections of the ditch encircling the site. Excavations have been concentrated around the Old Vicarage. By 2004 there were 43 trenches, 14 trial trenches, and 17 test pits. The investigation of the site has revealed two ditches. While the external ditch encloses a larger area, it has smaller dimensions than the internal ditch. The chronological relation between the two ditches is uncertain.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 22. The internal ditch has been cut into the sandstone bedrock and is wide and deep; there was a palisade beyond the inner edge of the ditch. At some point, part of the ditch was refilled and a posthole inserted into it, possibly relating to a gateway. Artefacts recovered from the ditch indicate that the inhabitants of the site had links with salt-producing communities in lowland Cheshire. The Very Coarse Pottery (VCP) which was used to contain the salt at Mellor is similar to fragments recovered from the Iron Age site at Beeston Castle. A layer of charcoal has been radiocarbon dated to 830-190 BC. The latest deposits in the ditch include hundreds of fragments of Roman pottery dating from the 1st to 4th centuries, bronze Roman brooches, and Roman nails.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 24. The outer ditch is wide and deep, and like the inner ditch was cut in the local bedrock.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 25. A rare Iron Age pot was recovered from the outer ditch, with 125 shards found.Hodgson & Brennand (2006), p. 56.Nevell & Redhead (2005), p. 26. The material used to make the pot originated about away in Castleton, Derbyshire. The pot was found in one of the earliest contexts in the ditch, and dates to the Iron Age. It was probably deliberately placed at the bottom of the ditch as part of a ritual after a significant event such as digging the ditch. While the inner ditch did have a palisade, neither ditch had a bank associated with it. The archaeological excavations that have been undertaken since 1998 are funded by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council and grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and have received news coverage. The site is used as a training excavation for students and a community dig to introduce people to ancient history, with the participation of Mellor Archaeological Trust. In 2002, students from Ridge Danyers Sixth Form College built a replica roundhouse that is still standing on the site. Many of the artefacts discovered at Mellor during the excavations are on permanent display at Stockport Museum. The site is open to the public annually, in the first week of September, so that people can view the work done over the past season of digging.

Development The Capitol Greyhound Lines (GL) came into existence in November 1930, as a joint venture (owned in two equal shares) by the Blue and Gray (B&G;) Transit Company and The Greyhound Corporation to operate a single new main line along U.S. Route 50 between Washington, DC and Saint Louis, Missouri via Winchester, Virginia; Clarksburg and Parkersburg, West Virginia; Chillicothe and Cincinnati, Ohio; Bedford and Vincennes, Indiana; and Olney and Salem Illinois. The U.S. 50 route was shorter and faster (by six hours) than the best alternate route then available, which ran via Hagerstown, Maryland, Pittsburgh, Wheeling, West Virginia, Columbus, Ohio, Indianapolis and Terre Haute, Indiana, and Effingham, Illinois. Capitol Greyhound also operated a branch line between Shoals, Indiana and Louisville, Kentucky via Paoli, Indiana and provided local suburban commuter service from Washington, DC, to Winchester, Virginia, and Annapolis, Maryland. The CpGL took part in only one interlined through-route (using pooled equipment in cooperation with one other carrier) - that is, the use of through-coaches on a through-route running through the territories of itself and one other company - with the Red Star Motor Coaches - connecting Washington, DC, via Annapolis (also on US-50) with Rehoboth Beach (in Delaware) and Salisbury and Ocean City (both in Maryland), all three on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Delaware (on the Delmarva Peninsula) - until 1952, when the Carolina Coach Company (the Carolina Trailways) bought the Red Star concern. The first president of the Capitol GL was Arthur Hill, the founder and president of the B&G; firm. B&G; (along with the Camel City Coach Company, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina) in 1929 had become a part of the National Highway Transport Company, which in 1931 became renamed as the Atlantic Greyhound Lines, based in Charleston, West Virginia. The Capitol GL met the Atlantic GL (to the south), the (second) Central GL (to the north), the Dixie GL (to the south), the Great Lakes GL (to the north), the Pennsylvania GL (to the north and east), the Richmond GL (to the southeast), the Southeastern GL (to the south), and the Southwestern GL (to the west). Merger into Pennsylvania GL In 1954 The Greyhound Corporation (the parent Greyhound firm) bought the 50-percent share of the Atlantic GL (which part had come from B&G;) in the Capitol GL, then Greyhound merged Capitol into the Pennsylvania GL, which in 1955 became merged with the old (second) Central GL - thereby forming the Eastern Division of The Greyhound Corporation (called also the new (second) Eastern GL), the first of four huge new divisions (along with Southern, Western, and Central, which last name became used again (in the fifth of six instances) but with a meaning quite different from its other applications). Thus ended the Capitol GL. Beyond Capitol GL Later (about 1966) The Greyhound Corporation reorganized again, into just two humongous divisions, named as the Greyhound Lines East (GLE) and the Greyhound Lines West (GLW); even later (about 1970) it eliminated those two divisions, thereby leaving a single gargantuan undivided nationwide fleet. In 1987 The Greyhound Corporation (the original Greyhound umbrella firm), which had become widely diversified far beyond transportation, sold its entire highway-coach operating business (its core bus business), to a new company, named as the Greyhound Lines, Inc., called also GLI, based in Dallas, Texas - a separate, independent, unrelated firm, which was the property of a group of private investors under the promotion of Fred Currey, a former executive of the Continental Trailways (later renamed as the Trailways, Inc., called also TWI, also based in Dallas), which was by far the largest member company in the National Trailways trade association. Later in 1987 the Greyhound Lines, Inc., the GLI, the new firm based in Dallas, further bought the Trailways, Inc., the TWI, its largest competitor, and merged it into the GLI. The lenders and the other investors of the GLI ousted Fred Currey as the chief executive officer (CEO) after the firm went into bankruptcy in 1990. The GLI has continued to experience difficulties and lackluster performance under a succession of new owners and new executives - while continuing to reduce its level of service - by hauling fewer passengers aboard fewer coaches on fewer trips along fewer routes with fewer stops in fewer communities in fewer states - and by doing so on fewer days - that is, increasingly operating some trips less often than every day (fewer than seven days per week) - and by using fewer through- coaches, thereby requiring passengers to make more transfers (from one coach to another). After the sale to the GLI, The Greyhound Corporation changed its name to the Greyhound-Dial Corporation, then the Dial Corporation, then the Viad Corporation. [The contrived name Viad appears to be a curious respelling of the former name Dial - if one scrambles the letters D, I, and A, then turns the V upside down and regards it as the Greek letter lambda - Œõ - that is, the Greek equivalent of the Roman or Latin letter L.] The website of the Viad Corporation (http://www.viad.com) in September 2008 makes no mention of its corporate history or its past relationship to Greyhound (that is, its origin as The Greyhound Corporation).

Gameplay The player must control a lord as he tries to develop an army of knights and soldiers in order to challenge the king for the throne of England. Travelling on the medieval roads is not like traveling on today's superhighways (and requires months to get from one end of England to the other). Rivers also provide a quick path to get to the target village but the player must watch out for bandits that will attack him and his hired men. Starting the game as a 12-year-old boy, you are given only some money and a basic sword. The player can either answer a variety of moral questions or choose a pre-generated character. At the age of 18, the player is assigned a fiefdom to oversee in addition to a substantial amount of land. All games end at the player's 30th birthday. If the player doesn't slay a dragon or overthrow the King of England by then, the game is considered to be lost. While not fighting in battles or tournaments, the player can develop his fiefs with agricultural and civic developments similar to SimCity; examples of these buildings include chapels, stables, storehouses, and farms. Marriage is also possible as the player can acquire his wife through socializing with the ladies prior to the jousting. The moneylender can provide the player with loans at 50% interest.

Candidates of the Indian National Congress triumphed in the election to both the Parliamentary constituencies with Dr Thokchom Meinya Singh retaining the Inner seat and Thangso Baite wresting the Outer Parliamentary seat from Mani Charenamei of the People's Democratic Alliance. After completion of counting of votes cast by the electorates of Manipur in the 15th Lok Sabha elections, Dr Meinya defeated his nearest rival Dr Moirangthem Nara Singh of CPI by 40,960 votes with Thangso Baite favoured by voters compared to votes cast for Charenamei. Thangso Baite's victory margin by votes over Charenamei is also more than the figure of defeat suffered by the Congress candidate to the same rival in the previous poll. Inner manipur parliamentary Constituency Out of the 32 assembly segments in the Inner manipur parliamentary Constituency, Dr Meinya received maximum mandate of 16,280 votes out of the total strength of 22,726 electors in Andro assembly constituency whereas 16,136 voters of Thoubal AC stamped their approval to the eventual winner. The third highest votes gained by the Congress MP was in Khundrakpam AC where 10,393 voted in his favour. Dr Meinya, who elicited significant support in all the 32 assembly segments got the fewest 2626 votes from the electorates of Singjamei AC. The Congress candidate had won the same parliamentary seat in the previous Lok Sabha election (2004) with a victory margin of a little over 49,000. Dr nara was the nearest rival at that time, too. In the recent hustings, Dr Nara generated fair support in all the assembly segments where the average voting trend was over the 3000 mark with the exception of Nambol AC where he was preferred by only 1618 adults. Maximum number of Nambol electorates favoured former Parliamentarian Thounaojam Chaoba Singh. Chaoba who contested the 15th Lok Sabha election on MPP ticket polled 10,988 votes. The figure, in his home polling station, was also the most chaoba polled in the election. In spite of being the consensus candidate of a handful of national as well as regional political parties Chaoba finished a distant third tipping the one lakh barrier by only 1787 votes. Out of the total of votes polled by Dr Nara, the CPI stalwart received maximum support of Lilong AC electorates with 10,898 from a total of 21,451 votes favouring the former Art and Culture Minister. Mandate of Thongju AC electorates too tilted heavily in favour of Dr Nara with 10,142 votes cast for the CPI nominee out of the total of 18,210. Election to the Inner Manipur parliamentary constituency for the 15th Lok Sabha was held on 22 April with a total of seven candidates in the fray. Former Chief Minister and BJP nominee W Nipamacha, L Kshetrani devi (RBCP), Abdul Rahman (Independent) and N Homendro (Ind) were the other candidates. Dr Meinya also led in all the four districts where franchise for the inner Parliamentary Constituency was conducted. The difference of victory margin between Dr Meinya and Dr Nara was the largest in Imphal East district with 10,298 votes separating the winner and nearest vanquished. On the other hand, Imphal West witnessed the fiercest contest between the two as the difference stood at only 2144 votes. Outer manipur parliamentary Constituency Out of 28 assembly segments in the Outer seat, Thangso Baite received mandate of voters to represent them in the Parliament. Outer Parliamentary Constituency is also composed of six assembly segments of Thoubal district and Jiribam subdivision of Imphal East district, and Scheduled Tribe assembly segments spread across Tamenglong, Chandel, Ukhrul, Senapati and Churachandpur districts.

Life Carney was born in Chicago to parents of German and Irish ancestry. His father was a salesman for the Burroughs Adding Machine Corporation, and the family moved around frequently. They were also devoted listeners of Father Charles Coughlin's radio show. Carney graduated from St. Louis University High School in Missouri in 1942, and went on to Saint Louis University on a football scholarship. Despite poor vision and a football-related knee injury, he was drafted and saw service in the European Theatre of World War II as a combat engineer and military policeman. After the war, he took advantage of the G.I. Bill to return to SLU to study theology, then transferred to the University of Detroit the following year before finally ending up at St. Stanislaus Seminary in Florissant, Missouri in 1948. He spent three years as a missionary in British Honduras (today Belize) beginning in 1955 before returning to the United States to study at St. Mary's College in Kansas. After being ordained into the Jesuit order in 1961, Carney was sent to work with impoverished Hondurans by the Missouri Province of the Society of Jesus. He eventually naturalized as a Honduran citizen and renounced U.S. citizenship. Nevertheless, he was expelled to Nicaragua by the Honduran government in 1979. In Nicaragua, he ministered to members of the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers (PRTC). He eventually became chaplain to a group of PRTC fighters who had been trained by Cuba in the P-11 nd P-13 insurgency training camps in Pinar del Rio, Cuba‚Äîjoining with the group in Nicaragua and returning with them to Honduras in 1983. Death According to PRTC deserters, morale in the group sagged as the insurgents traveled from Nicaragua, across the Coco river in to Honduras, and began a brutal four-day march to the top of the barren Olancho mountain range above the river. They ran low on supplies, and as described by the PRTC insurgent commander, Dr. Jos√© Mar√≠a Reyes Mata, in his diary...\\"to celebrate the victory of the march, we ate the last of our rations\\". Carney clashed with Mata, the group's commander,when he valiantly but vainly tried to defend the life of one of the young insurgents accused of attempted desertion. According to insurgents later interviewed by US Defense Attache Office Assistant Army Attache Captain Ronald Glass, Carney grew disheartened by the actions of the atheist insurgent commander Dr. Mata, both by the summary execution of the deserter in front of the remaining men, and then by being prohibited by Mata to minister spiritually to the men, eventually prohibited from performing mass. U.S embassy documents, citing interviews with PRTC deserters suggest that, as the Honduran military closed in on the group, the 60 plus year old Carney grew physically weak, barely being able to walk even a hundred meters before having to rest. The Catholic Priest, not wanting to endanger, slowdown or burden the now fragmented group, selflessly sacrificed himself, reportedly telling his companions to leave him behind. According to the last two insurgents claiming to have seen him alive, he was left in a hammock, hidden under a triple canopy jungle in the Patuca region, where he presumably died, alone, exposed to the elements and without food. This official version based on interviews with insurgent survivors, is contradicted in news reports echoed from testimony of a man chacterized in media as an exiled former intelligence officer Florencio Cabadero who claimed that Carney was captured, tortured, and then thrown to his death from a helicopter by members of the Honduran Army's elite Battalion 316. Eric Haney, who was stationed in Honduras as a member of the Delta Force at the time, reported 'hearing' the same reports, that Carney was tortured and killed by the military. In his book Inside Delta Force, Haney claims credit for killing former Green Beret David Arturo Baez in the final firefight that saw Carney captured (The Battle of Yolo Valley, Honduras). Since the publication of his book and claim Haney has been roundly admonished by the U.S. Special Forces community for fabricating the story of his killing Baez. Yet another report echoes the same claims that Baez and Carney were taken alive by Honduran forces. However, unnamed sources [need cite] claiming to be linked to the U.S. Embassy in Honduras have purportedly offered that Carney, along with Baez, a Nicaraguan-American Sandinista serving as a military adviser to the guerrilla column, were captured. According to these unsourced reports, both he and Baez were interrogated at a small dirt landing strip in Honduras along with surviving members of the column. As with the capture and execution of Che Guevara by Bolivian Rangers on October 9, 1967, both Carney and Baez were ordered to be executed by the country's government or military. According to unnamed sources, represented as \\"U.S. MilGrp officers then stationed in Honduras\\", the execution of Baez and Carney is alleged to have been carried out by the first Honduran Special Forces officer to have graduated the U.S. Special Warfare course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The order from the Honduran military commander was that \\"all officers are to have blood on their hands\\" in order to ensure silence. According to these same unsourced reports, the bodies of the two Americans were, along with those others killed, flown back over the border on a Honduran military helicopter into Nicaragua and unceremoniously dumped into the triple canopy jungle below. Aftermath Carney's family traveled to Honduras shortly after learning of his death, but were unable to recover his body or any information. Baez's family, living in Florida, have long demanded the truth about the former Green Beret's death. Later in 1983, the army officer implicated by Cabadero in ordering Carney's death, General Gustavo √Ålvarez Mart√≠nez, was awarded the Legion of Merit by President Ronald Reagan, \\"for promoting democracy in Honduras\\" at the same time the Cuban trained and Sandinista PRTC 96 man insurgent group has crossed over in to Honduras to overthrow the civilian government of Honduran President Dr. Roberto Suazo Cordoba, the first democratically elected civilian government for Honduras in many decades. Nevertheless, some of Carney's former colleagues believe the award is evidence that then U.S Ambassador to Honduras John Negroponte authorized Carney's killing.National Catholic Reporter. January 24, 1997. Retrieved on 2009-5-15 However, there is no evidence Negroponte was aware of the two captured Americans with only the embassy's MILGRP senior staff advised of the battle and its aftermath in real time. Father Joseph Mulligan, a close friend of Carney's, has been searching for answers to the disappearance of both Carney and Baez for over 20 years. In 2010, he sent a letter to President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton requesting their assistance in seeing his FOIA request, now being processed, approved.

After World War II, the victorious Allies prohibited wartime aircraft and other military hardware suppliers from remaining in their previous industries, and Aero-Caproni would change its name to Capriolo and become one of several, including Aermacchi, MV Agusta, Vespa and Ducati, that switched to producing motorcycles or scooters. These companies did well until the mid-1960s, when the advent of affordable cars like the Fiat 500 removed the economic barrier that kept many Italians relying on motorcycles for basic transportation. Capriolo was typical of those that could not survive the transformation to a more export-orientated industry, with the US as the most important market. Motorcycle production ran from 1947 or 1948 until 1964. Some Capriolo engines featured the K√ºchen desmodromic valve system, and others used face-cams rather than the usual camshaft valve operation. Another Capriolo used a longitudinal flat twin, a layout not usually seen except on BMWs or BMW derivatives.

The \\"Slaughter House Mix\\", from the group's third studio album, Riddle Box, has become one the duo's most popular songs. Content The lyrics describe Insane Clown Posse meeting and killing multiple racist rednecks, referred to as 'Chickens'. The concept stems from the group's anti-bigotry philosophy, based on various experiences witnessed by group member Violent J. As a teenager, he had briefly lived in Bonnie Doone, North Carolina, a trailer park town just outside Fort Bragg, where his brother Robert had been staying with the U.S. Army. There, Joseph witnessed firsthand the hatred and open racism directed toward African American citizens, as well as the minorities serving in the Army, and became disgusted and infuriated with the actions that took place. In an interview with Murder Dog, Bruce said that the song is not directed toward all Southerners. He stated that \\"if you‚Äôre a redneck and you're not a racist, then obviously you know that I'm not talkin‚Äô about you. But [in the song] I'm talkin' about the racist fuckin' rednecks that fuck their daughters. It just makes me sick.\\" Music videos After signing a distribution deal with Jive Records' short-lived imprint, Battery Records, the group received funds to produce a music video for the song. Joseph and Robert Bruce developed their own concept for the video, but the director changed their plans, and the final concept instead featured Insane Clown Posse performing actions which Joseph Bruce later described as \\"[Some of] the stupidest thing[s] I had ever heard of.\\" Because the group and the label were disappointed with the video, it was not publicly released at the time, although it later appeared on Psychopathic: The Videos in 2007. The music video for the \\"Slaughter House Mix\\" was shot at the State Theatre during an actual Insane Clown Posse concert. The director of the video, former Cro- Mags rhythm guitarist Parris Mayhew, wanted Insane Clown Posse to perform the song several times in order to get the footage from all angles, but the duo refused to repeat the song because it was an actual concert, and not just a video shoot. The video was shot with the group performing the song only once. The original version of \\"Chicken Huntin'\\" was performed for the video shoot, because their fans were not yet familiar with the remix. This made Jive furious, but there were no editing problems, and Violent J later referred to the video as \\"our freshest video ever.\\" Remixes and cover versions As the group began production on its third studio album, Riddle Box, Jive Records produced a remix of the song which was rejected by Insane Clown Posse, leading the group to produce its own remix, the \\"Slaughter House Mix\\", which appeared on the new album. In 2009, Mike E. Clark produced a third remix for Psychopathic Murder Mix Volume 1. The same year, a cover of the song by Esham and Poe Whosaine appeared on Smith's \\"Bomb Ass Podcast\\" in June. The beat of the \\"Slaughter House Mix\\" was reused by Cold 187um in his song \\"3 Brothers\\", from the 2012 album The Only Solution.

Background and education Falchi began his career in 1970s Greenwich Village, New York City. He worked as a busboy at Max's Kansas City while developing his designs; at one point his neighbor was Jimi Hendrix. His clientele were originally rockers and jazz artists. Bendels Retailer Geraldine Stutz, of Henri Bendel stores, gave Falchi one of his early breaks. His designs became fashionable and he rose to early success. Materials Falchi's bags often use skins such as python, alligator and ostrich and are soft and unstructured. Market venues His main collection tends to be sold at upscale department stores for prices ranging from $1,500 to up to $5,000.

Biographical data He was born in √öbeda ca. 1477 and died on 10 May 1547 in the same city. He was born to the aristocratic, though economically disadvantaged family of Don Pedro Rodr√≠guez de los Cobos, he was the son of don Diego de los Cobos, regent of Ubeda, and Catalina de Molina. In 1522, he married the fourteen-year-old Mar√≠a de Mendoza y Sarmiento, daughter of Juan Hurtado de Mendoza y Mar√≠a de Sarmiento, 6th Countess of Ribadavia. His titles would be inherited by his only son Diego de los Cobos y Hurtado de Mendoza, (circa 1523 ‚Äì 1575), who was subsequently awarded the title of 1st Marquis of Camarasa, together with his wife, by King Charles I of Spain, a.k.a. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V on 18 February 1543. His daughter, Maria Sarmiento de Mendoza, married at Valladolid on 30 November 1538, Gonzalo II Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, Governor of the Duchy of Milan, 1558‚Äì1560 and 1563‚Äì1564, a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece since 1555. They had no children. In 2008, this title was held by the duke of Segorbe, Ignacio Medina Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba y Fern√°ndez de Henestrosa. Career in government His career benefited from the help afforded by his uncle, Diego Vela Allide, treasurer and secretary of queen Isabella I of Castile. Later, by 1503, he worked as a scribe under the dean of the Queen's secretaries, Hernando de Zafra. In 1507, upon Zafra's death, he became first Treasurer of Granada, and then Regent for √öbeda the next year. These positions were entitled to collect tribute and payments to the crown. After the death of king Ferdinand of Aragon in 1516, Cobos was charged by Cardinal Cisneros with traveling to Habsburg-ruled Flanders to become a counselor for the young new monarch, Charles I of Spain. This proved to be the crucial decision of his career, as through the favor of William II de Cro√ø, Lord of Chi√®vres, he became secretary to the king. He advised Charles on matters that dealt with the Spanish portion of his domains, and emerged as a rival to Grand Chancellor Mercurino Gattinara. Gattinara's fall in 1528 confirmed Cobos's victory, and led to his assumption of the leadership of the council of State. After traveling with Charles from 1529 until 1533, Cobos's expertise in financial matters kept him in Spain, where he served as the effective head of government until his death. Patronage of the arts Cobos was able to amass vast riches in his work with the state. He was able to use some of his riches in fostering patronage and acquiring art. He met Titian and arranged for Emperor Charles V's portrait by the famed Venetian artist. One sad note was the loss during a shipwreck of a large assembly of Italian works, including a Piet√° by Sebastiano del Piombo and a series of paintings from the City council of Lucca. Additionally, he was able to collect portraits of royalty and nobility, as well as exotic gifts brought to Spain after the conquest of the Aztecs and Incas. He is known to have given a now lost Aztec manuscript bound in jaguar skin to the historian Paolo Giovio in Naples.Davide Domenici and Laura Laurencich Minelli, \\"Domingo de Betanzos' Gifts to Pope Clement VII in 1532‚Äì1533: Tracking the Early History of Some Mexican Objects and Codices in Italy\\", Estudios de cultura nahuatl 47.1 (2014): 169‚Äì209. His patronage also led to the Italianate Renaissance architecture found in the town center of √öbeda. The Royal Palace of Valladolid was built by Cobos, who built it around a magnificent renaissance-styled courtyard nearby the residence of his in-laws (Palace of the Counts of Ribadavia). The palace later became the temporary residence of the Spanish Monarch from King Charles I of Spain to Queen Isabella II of Spain. ReferencesFurther reading *Keniston, Hayward.

The predicted molecular weight is 46.7 kDa, and the isoelectric point is 5.46. Orthologs have been determined in most eukaryotes, the most highly conserved being found in most mammalian species. Moderate conservation is maintained among other distant species such as: Gallus gallus, Xenopus, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Tetraodon, etc. The PRCC1 gene has two distinct regions: a proline-rich region on the N-terminus, and the DUF84 region on the C-terminus. The DUF84 region is found in the genome of a bacterium called Vibrio cholerae. The region consists of approximately 183 amino acid residues. V. cholorae causes cholera and stomach flu in humans. The DUF84 region alone is about 160 amino acid residues. It is the only other protein that consists of DUF84 other than PRCC1.

She is responsible for maintaining aids to navigation on the coasts of Oregon and Washington, including the Columbia River. Construction Elm was built by the Marinette Marine Corporation on the Menominee River in Wisconsin. Elm was launched on January 24, 1998. She was the fourth of the fourteen Juniper-class ships launched. Her original cost was approximately $26 million. Her hull is constructed of welded steel plates. She is long and has a beam of . She is capable of maintaining a sustained speed of 15 knots. The ship has thirteen diesel fuel tanks capable of holding 74,498 gallons. Elm has an unrefueled range of 6,000 miles at 12 knots. USCGC Elm icebreaking in the Hudson River Elm has a single variable-pitch propeller that is powered by two Caterpillar 3608 Diesel engines, each with an indicated 3,100 shp. There are two electric maneuvering thrusters, the bow thruster producing 460 hp and the stern thruster producing 550 hp. The thrusters act as part of a dynamic positioning system that is capable of maintaining the ship within five meters of a fixed position on the sea in winds up to 30 knots and seas up to . This allows the crew to work on buoys in difficult weather conditions. The ship's crane extends to and can lift onto her buoy deck, which is 2,875 square feet in area. Elm is capable of light icebreaking. She can sail through ice thick at three knots. Elm is armed with two 50-caliber machine guns and a variety of small arms for boarding operations. Elm and all but one of the Juniper-class buoy tenders are named after trees. She is the third Coast Guard ship of this name. The first Elm was a derrick barge launched in 1919 to maintain aids to navigation in the Hudson River. The second USCGC Elm (WAGL-260/WLI-72260) was a buoy tender launched in 1938.  Operational history  After launch and sea trials, Elm sailed down the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway to reach her new homeport of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina. She was based at Coast Guard Station Fort Macon. Her primary mission was to maintain 250 buoys between Shark River Inlet, New Jersey and the border between North and South Carolina, including Chesapeake Bay. She supported other Coast Guard missions as well, including search and rescue, law enforcement, oil spill response, and light icebreaking. In her search and rescue role, she extinguished a fire aboard the scallop-fishing vessel Captain O. J. Riggs in 2009. Elm was dispatched to search for survivors of the replica HMS Bounty which was sunk by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In her law enforcement role, Elm participated in repatriating Cubans attempting to reach the United States in 2007. Elm served as an icebreaker in the Hudson River and Chesapeake Bay. USCGC Elm recovers a NOAA weather buoy adrift in the Atlantic The Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. In May Elm was deployed to assist in the oil spill response, using her Spilled Oil Recovery System. She succeed in skimming more than 500,000 gallons of oil during her six-month deployment, more than any other Coast Guard cutter. Elm was one of the ships that participated in Fleet Week celebrations at Port Everglades in 2006. In January 2018 Elm went into drydock at the Coast Guard Yard in Baltimore for a mid-life major overhaul. She left the yard on June 13, 2019. On July 15, 2019 Elm reached her new homeport, Astoria, Oregon, replacing Fir, which sailed for Baltimore for her own mid-life overhaul in June of 2018. Fir's crew, already familiar with the operating area, took over Elm. In her new role, Elm is responsible for maintaining 114 floating buoys on the coasts of Oregon and Washington from the California border north to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and in the Columbia River east to Longview, Washington. She is stationed at Coast Guard Base Tongue Point. Elm has cooperated with NOAA to maintain weather buoys on several occasions in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific.

Later the members' interests turned to riding and foxhunting, and the club moved to another site in Winchester, on Mystic Lake, where it became formally incorporated in 1879. Several Myopia Club members were interested in moving the club closer to Boston, and this led to the founding of The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1882.Moss, p. 16.

Patches have been linked to intimidation of members of the public by gang members. Gang patches perform much the same identification role as gang colours do in other countries. Each of the country's gangs has its own forms of insignia, of which the most prominent is often a large symbol, frequently worn by members on their clothing as a symbol of their gang membership. The patch is often seen as being as important to gang members as a military flag is to members of an army group, and any insult to the patch is taken as being an insult to the gang as a whole. As such, the term has a more general meaning. Being a \\"patched\\" member of a gang is to be a fully initiated member of the gang - and often a ranking member of the gang's structure. The physical patches are highly valued and have been used with some success in negotiations.  Legality  Cook Strait ferry prohibiting the display of gang patches Wanganui District Council has banned the wearing of gang patches within parts of their jurisdiction.

Research was built in 1861 for the fleet of Thomas Killam and was the largest vessel built to that date in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia. In the fall of 1866 on a voyage from Quebec to Glasgow, Scotland, her rudder was badly damaged in a sudden violent storm as the ship left the Gulf of Saint Lawrence at the beginning of her voyage. The rudder subsequently broke off entirely but was replaced by eight different jury rigged rudders which allowed the drifting and battered vessel to cross the ocean and reach her destination after 88 days. George Churchill, the captain of Research and Aaron Churchill, the first mate who carried out most of the repairs in the water, were celebrated for their courage, skill and determination. They both enjoyed the nickname \\"Rudder Churchill\\" for the rest of their careers. The ship was sold to owners in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1872 and then sold out of British registry a year later.

Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of servicemen and women were discharged in the last years of the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy. The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The demobilisation process was largely successful, but some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow. The disposal of surplus military equipment took place at the same time as the size of the services was being reduced. The disposal process was managed to limit its economic impact. Most equipment was transferred to other government agencies, sold or destroyed by the end of 1949. Planning Planning for the demobilisation of the Australian military began at the end of 1942 when the Department of Post-War Reconstruction was formed.James (2009), p. 14 The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' entitlements and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. That included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available.Hasluck (1970), p. 445 An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced. It was decided to achieve that by continuing many wartime economic regulations such as prices to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were most needed.Butlin and Schedvin (1977), p. 773 Members of the first party of five year veterans to return to Sydney in August 1945 The Australian War Cabinet approved the Department of Post-War Reconstruction's proposed principles to govern demobilisation on 12 June 1944. The key element of the principles was that the order in which personnel would be demobilised was to be based on a points system, with service men and women being allocated points on the basis of their period of service, age, marital status and employment or training prospects.Hasluck (1970), p. 612 An extensive demobilisation plan was then developed by an interservice committee following further consultation with trade unions, employers and returned servicemen. The plan was accepted as the basis for planning by the War Cabinet on 6 March 1945.Hasluck (1970), p. 613 The rate at which personnel were to be discharged was set at 3,000 a day for six days a week and was to be capable of being increased in the event of an emergency. The final demobilisation plan assigned differing scales of points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points for each year of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service if they did not have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married before the end of the war. Service women who married after the war could ask for an early discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course. Limited demobilisation began during the final years of the war. In order to meet the needs of the war economy 20,000 soldiers were released from the Australian Army in October 1943. Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30,000 soldiers and 15,000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged. In mid-1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service men and women who had completed five years of service, including at least two years outside Australia, could volunteer for discharge. Post-war demobilisation Former prisoners of war wave from the bus which took them to the Royal Agricultural Showgrounds after arriving at Central Station in Brisbane The demobilisation plan was put into action on 16 August 1945, the day after Japan surrendered. The military then had a strength of 598,300 men and women, 310,600 in Australia, 224,000 serving in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and 20,100 in Britain and other parts of the world. The only personnel to be discharged during August and September were former prisoners of war and those with a long period of service, however, as general demobilisation did not begin until 1 October 1945. During the intervening months dispersal centres were established in each state and territory's capital city. The centres were to provide information on employment, land settlement, housing, training, loans, tools for trades and other benefits for service personnel as their discharges were processed.Hasluck (1970), p. 614 Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige was appointed the Coordinator of Demobilisation and Dispersal in September.Dennis et al (2008), p. 185 Former prisoners of war were given a high priority for repatriation back to Australia and discharge.James (2009), p. 15 Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most of whom had been held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all were on their way home by mid-September.Hasluck (1970), p. 617 In line with a plan approved by the Australian Government in September 1945, general demobilisation was conducted in four stages. The first stage ran from October 1945 to January 1946 and involved the discharge of 249,159 personnel, which was higher than the targets of 10,000 members of the Royal Australian Navy, 135,000 soldiers and 55,000 airmen specified in the demobilisation plan. In the second stage 193,461 personnel left the military between February and 30 June 1946 though that was slightly lower than the target of 200,000.Hasluck (1970), p. 615 The third stage ran from 1 July to 31 December, when the services had been reduced to 78,000 personnel, which was considered the strength necessary for the military's postwar tasks. Of the remaining servicemen, those who did not wish to volunteer for continuing service in the military were released in the fourth stage which began on 1 January 1947. At the end of the process, the military's strength had fallen 60,000 personnel.Hasluck (1970), p. 616 If possible, service men and women were placed on leave and allowed to return home while awaiting discharge.Long (1973), p. 476 Australian military personnel during the protest march at Morotai on 10 December 1945 The demobilisation of the military included disbanding the female branches of the three services. The Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, Australian Women's Army Service and Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force had been formed during 1941 and 1942 to enable women to serve in the military but were disbanded during 1947, with military service being again restricted to men.Dennis et al. (2008), p. 605 Demobilised service women were provided with similar assistance to male members of the military, but were placed under pressure to return to traditional family roles.Adam-Smith (1984). pp. 362‚Äì363 and p. 367. The return of Australian personnel from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages and the need to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided the personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. Refresher courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for the courses were service personnel selected on the basis of their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.James (2009), p. 16 Many men in the SWPA believed that the demobilisation process was too slow. On 10 December 1945 4,500 men at Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies staged a protest march demanding that shipping be made available to return them to Australia. Soldiers at Bougainville also complained about having to remain on the island after the war had ended, and Prime Minister Ben Chifley's plane was sabotaged in an apparent protest during his visit on 27 December 1945.James (2009), pp. 16‚Äì17 Minister for Defence Frank Forde was largely blamed for the slowness with which military personnel were being demobilised. As a result, he lost his seat at the 1946 election though the Labor Party itself comfortably retained office. Despite the dissatisfaction of the men in the SWPA, the demobilisation and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men had been returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training. A further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing their course. Demobilisation also included establishing arrangements for the medical care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually transferred from the services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary to build new hospitals for the treatment of tuberculosis and mental disorders, but as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of the conditions were respectively unsatisfactory, they had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales.Walker (1961), p. 542 The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service, which led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.Walker (1961), pp. 543‚Äì544 Disposal of military equipment Spitfire fighters awaiting disposal at Labuan in January 1946. The aircraft were later dumped in the sea. The disposal of military equipment and materials was also a key priority after the end of the war. Equipment with civilian uses such as motor vehicles, clothing and housing were urgently needed to counter shortages in the civilian economy. The timing of equipment release had to be carefully planned, however, to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods. Planning for the disposal of equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the sale or destruction of equipment on September 1944.Butlin and Schedvin (1977), p. 794 Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex-military equipment would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public, that sales to the public were to be made on a 'as is, where is' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at 'fair market prices' and that payment was to be required in cash. Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.Butlin and Schedvin (1977), pp. 794‚Äì795 Preparations for the disposal of equipment began in the second half of 1944 when the War Cabinet directed the military to survey all stocks and indicate any surpluses. General Thomas Blamey, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hindered the preparations as he believed they were premature and that the Army's stocks needed to be maintained until Japan was defeated. That position was opposed by the acting Minister for the Army, and the RAAF and RAN made some attempts to identify their surpluses, but was successful in delaying the Disposal Commission's work until July 1945. As a result, relatively little military equipment was sold between September 1944 and June 1945.Butlin and Schedvin (1977), pp. 795‚Äì796 After the war ended the Disposals Commission rapidly disposed of large stocks of military equipment. Consumer goods and raw materials which could be used immediately by manufacturers were the first items to be sold and sales of motor vehicles grew rapidly. Ex-military vehicles made an important contribution to meeting transport shortages in rural areas, but there was some dissatisfaction with the priority given to the agricultural sector and the way in which the vehicles were sold.Butlin and Schedvin (1977), p. 796 The Disposal Commission's sales were also important in meeting shortages of clothing, housing, industrial and construction equipment and tractors. Most of the military's stocks of food were donated to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or sold for export.Butlin and Schedvin (1977), p. 797 The final meeting of the Commonwealth Disposals Commission in September 1949 The disposal of military equipment, particularly outside of Australia, presented a challenge to the Disposals Commission. At the end of the war inadequate preparations were made for the storage of equipment in New Guinea, and many stores were stolen by soldiers, native New Guineans and 'salvage pirates' or damaged by the tropical conditions. Sales of stocks in those areas were completed at the end of 1946, often at very low prices, but much equipment was stolen.Butlin and Schedvin (1977), pp. 797‚Äì798 Specialised military equipment also proved difficult to dispose of given its unsuitability for civilian purposes. Bombs and other explosives were destroyed after any scrap metal was recovered and large numbers of combat aircraft had to be scrapped due to a worldwide glut. Training aircraft and other aeronautical equipment were sold to the public and other government agencies, however, and demand for tanks and Universal Carriers which could be converted to tractors was greater than expected.Butlin and Schedvin (1977), p. 798 The Disposals Commission's activities peaked during 1946 and 1947. Sales generally went smoothly and in accordance with the principles set by the Government and did not significantly disrupt normal commerce. While the Commission generally operated efficiently, some mistakes occurred such as clothing and scrap metal being sold well beneath their market value. The volume of sales dropped rapidly after 1947 and the Disposals Commission was disbanded in July 1949. By this time the commission had sold ¬£135,189,000 worth of equipment.

The word 'Khirki' prefixed to fort is an Urdu word that means \\"window\\" and hence is also called \\"The Fort of Windows\\". The Fort, which is in a quadrangular shape, with an unusual fusion of Islamic and traditional Hindu architecture. It is said to be the only monument style fort in North India, which is mostly covered; the totally covered fort of the Sultanate period is, however, in South India at Gulbarga in North Karnataka. History Khan-i- Jahan Junaan Telangani and Feroz Shah Tughlaq were intensely committed towards building architectural monuments. Together, they planned and built several tombs, forts and mosques. Telangani in particular, was credited with building seven monuments of unique designs. Constructed in the Jahapanah city, it is a novel cross-axial mosque in Tughluqian architectural style. There are no specific inscriptions on the Mosque on its construction date, though the name of the builder is inscribed on the eastern gate of the Mosque as 'Khan-e-Jahan Junaan Shah'. Therefore, in the absence of \\"epigraphic and literary\\" evidence (though one recent web reference mentions 1375 and another 1380) for its provenance, a research study has been provided by Welch and Howard in their paper titled \\"The Tughluqs: Master Builders of the Delhi Sultanate\\". The study has conjectured the year of building by comparing with many other large monuments of this period. It is dated between 1351 and 1354 when Feroz Shah Tughlaq, during his stay in Jahapanah, ordered this mosque to be built as \\"his pious inaugural contribution to the Capital\\".It is approached from the Khirki village in South Delhi and close to the Satpula or the seven arched bridge on the edge of southern wall of Jahapanah (the fourth city of Medieval Delhi), was mosque built by Khan-i-Jahan Junan Shah, the Prime Minister of Feroz Shah Tughlaq (1351‚Äì1388) of the Tughlaq Dynasty.[1] The word 'Khirki' prefixed to mosque is an Urdu word that means \\"window\\" and hence is also called \\"The Mosque of Windows\\". Architecture View of interior courtyard Exterior view of the Mosque with latticed Khirkis on the second floor The Mosque has a x square plan in an area of . It is raised on a plinth of . There are four open courtyards (square in size of on each side) encircled by arcades built with 180 square structural columns and 60 pilasters, which run in north-south direction and divides into aisles. The open courtyards are the source of light and ventilation to the internal prayer spaces. The roof is partitioned into 25 squares of equal size with 9 small domes in each square (totaling to 81 domes) and alternated by 12 flat roofs to cover the roof. The four courtyards provide light and ventilation. The four corners of the mosque are adorned with towers with three protruding gateways, one in the middle of each face, with tapering turrets flanking each gate. The southern gate, with imposing steps at the main entrance, exhibits a combination of arch and trabeated construction. It has an ornamental rectilinear frame. The turrets flanking the southern and northern gates are circular in shape; the articulation on these gives them a three storied appearance. The main gate, which leads to the qibla on the western wall, has a projecting mihrab. Above the vaulted first floor cells, ubiquitous arch windows (carved out of stone guard) with perforated screens or jalis or tracery, known as \\"Khirkis\\", are seen on the second floor. However,the foyer in front of the mihrab is not well lighted since light from the latticed windows on the second floor do not penetrate this space. The approach to the roof of the mosque is from the east gate, and the view from the roof leaves a lasting impression of the geometrical design of the Mosque. The mosque's walls are of rubble masonry construction with plastered surface on the outside. The interior walls are bland but provided with traditional carved stone screens. The symmetrically designed admirable mosque is considered as one of ‚Äúthe finest architectural compositions of the Sultanate history.‚Äù It was considered Firuz Shah's architectural benefaction. The importance of the Khirki Mosque's architectural elegance has been considered a precursor to the intensely metaphorical Mughal architecture (1526-1857), with the Lodhi period's (1451‚Äì1526) architecture - the Delhi Sultanate's last dynasty - marking the transition. Restoration A collapsed corner of the roof Over the years, a few domes on the north-east side of the mosque have collapsed and a few walls are in a dilapidated condition. The roof is on the verge of collapse at many places. Delhi chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has categorized the monument as \\"Grade A\\" in terms of archeological value. It is one of the 43 monuments identified by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for restoration before the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Some conservation works have been initiated by ASI inside the mosque. ASI - Pink colour is distinct Heritage experts of Delhi were concerned by the status of the restoration works of the Khirki Mosque done by the ASI, which converted it into a pink monument (pictured) as distinct from the lime mortar work done in the ancient times. They pressed the ASI to re-examine the restoration procedures adopted by them for conservation works of Mughal monuments. ASI suspended the restoration works of the Mosque and held a workshop on \\"Use of lime mortar in ancient times\\" to educate their staff on proper restoration of Mughal monuments. A conservationist commented that > Lime mortar survives for years but needs to be carefully prepared by using > all the required ingredients in correct amount. However, to bypass the > lengthy but necessary method, workers then changed the traditional mixing > process - followed the world over and for centuries - to 50% lime mixed with > 50% brick dust and not sand. This altered the chemical and physical > properties and also made it more expensive exercise (brick dust costs more > than sand). The well established correct method of preparing a lime-surkhi mortar for conservation in the monuments, in the past, involved initially burning of lime in a kiln, then slaking it under water for a month and thereafter grinding it in a mortar mill in the proportion of 33% lime, 66% sand and other additives. An ASI official conceded that Lime-surkhi was not used in proper proportion resulting in pink-coloured marks on some structures. ASI has now decided that in new restoration works, such as the Khirki Mosque, lime will be used in proper quantity. Visitor information Access to the mosque is through the narrow lanes of Khirki village near Saket, which is located in South Delhi. The mosque is on the other side of Press Enclave Marg from the Saket Citywalk Mall. The nearest metro station is Malviya Nagar. The mosque can be easily glimpsed down the narrow lanes off this main road. It is east of Qutub Minar and south of Connaught Place. The remnants of the fourth city of Delhi, Jahanpanah, the raised Bijai Mandal Platform and the Begampur mosque with its variety of domes are other attractions close to the mosque. Nearer to the mosque, there is a bridge structure of the time called the Satpula (means seven bridges), part of the Jahanpanah boundary walls. It is a sluice weir with seven arched main spans, with two additional bays at a higher level on the flanks.

The book contains 21 scenes recreating the Edgar Rice Burroughs story. Montyne created an illusion of depth, using special lighting and an understanding of photography, to make viewers think Tarzan was over three hundred feet in the air flying through the trees. The scene actually only had a depth of three feet. Las VegasCircus Circus= Montyne moved to Las Vegas in 1968 to sculpt the statues in front of Circus Circus. The first, The Balancer, was a self-portrait, depicting him as an acrobat. This heroic-size statue in 1978 was featured on the front cover of 35mm Photography.

A challenging contract was the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. The casino was longer than a football field, and on the 15 ceiling arches were Montyne‚Äôs murals. The murals were destroyed in the 1980 MGM Grand fire. After the MGM commission Montyne worked on his sculpting skills, creating small statues for galleries in the hotels on The Las Vegas Strip.

The objective of building the weir was for providing water for irrigation and also, as a part of the city wall, to provide defense security to the city against attacking armies. Satpula is a usage in Hindi languages, which literally means \\"seven bridges\\". History During the second decade rule of Sultan Muhammad Shah Tughlaq, the economic conditions of the Delhi Sultanate was in distress due to very high expenses incurred on the war campaign in South India (Deccan) and also due to the Sultan establishing his southern capital at Daulatabad. Both these acts necessitated increasing taxes to enhance the treasury coffers to meet large expenses. But people were dissatisfied and distressed with these developments. Some tribal groups, such as the Chaghatai tribes, had launched raids on many places in North India and even posed serious threats to Delhi, when the Sultan was on his south Indian campaign. In the period between 1334 and 1344, repeated droughts had caused famines that were further compounded by the Black Plague. These two natural calamities had added to the suffering of the people in the country. Urgent solutions had to be found to remedy the distress conditions. One of the viable options planned was of building the Satpula, the seven arches bridge or gate controlled weir or dam, to tap the water resources of the local nullah (stream) on Southern Delhi Ridge feeding the Yamuna river, which could be used to bring large areas of flat land in the vicinity under controlled irrigated agriculture to grow food crops to stem the famine conditions. This solution was also thought to provide the much needed defense to the walls of the newly built city of Jahanpanah. Topography  The location of the Satpula, which is a part of the east-west wall protecting the southern part of Jahanpanah, drains a catchment comprising a series of low hills on the south, east, and west. The stream draining the catchment area, known as Barapulla Nallah was planned to be tapped to store the run-off water of the catchment. Command area for irrigation was identified in a large open plain on the northern side for providing water supplies from the proposed storage behind the Satpula, to grow irrigated crops to sustain a large population. Thus, a reliable water storage reservoir in the arid region of Delhi, which has the Thar desert on its west, was built as the headworks or weir across the Barapulla Nallah. Even though no epigraphic evidence is available to date the Satpula, a reasseacrh study report has conjectured that it could be dated to the same time as the four-eyyan Mosque (first of its kind in India) called Jami built by Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1343. Structure Gate Platforms and sluice arches End pavilion The Satpula across the stream was built as a gate controlled weir. The total length of the structure is . It has been constructed in stone masonry. The eleven bays of the weir controlled by sluice gates cover a total length of . These eleven bays consist of eleven water tunnels (sluices), each in length, in height, and in width. These are located at different levels, with seven main bays at the lowest level. The balance two additional bays on each bank, on the far east and west sides, are at a higher level. The control arrangements seen now are in the form of gate grooves to operate vertical slide gates. When built, wooden vertical sluice gates made of heavy boards of size in thickness, width, and more than in height, were operated by a rope and pulley arrangement to control flow of water; the wooden gates have since disintegrated but the gate groves are visible in each bay. The gates of the sluices were closed as a defensive measure against possible attack in the dry season when no storage remained in the dam. Each bay of the weir has an arched opening. On both banks of the weir identical towers (defensive bastions, projecting on the south and north sides) of diameter, but with octagonal shape chambers, are built, which once functioned as madrasa (Islamic school of learning). Hence, the Satpula is also known as \\"Madarsa\\". The second level sluice bays on both banks lead to arched corridors. The walls of the octagonal chambers have graceful decorations. The stream tapped by this weir, has been diverted now further east. The indication of the use of the sluices of the structure, either as a dam or for defense purposes, could be gauged from the platforms provided at the appropriate levels. Silt deposition in the storage area of the reservoir side at the southern end is also seen now. View of Satpula structure from the reservoir end showing the three tier setting of the sluices and the towers on both banks Restoration The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has recently carried out restoration works of the Satpula. This restoration now permits access to the wide parapet of the bridge to fully view the impressive engineering structure. The restoration works carried out by ASI, for specially identified monuments, is in sync with the slogan ‚ÄòWelcome to Historical City of Delhi‚Äô adopted by the Commonwealth Secretariat for the 2010 Common Wealth Games to be held in Delhi. The restoration works of the Satpula is at an estimated cost of Rs 20 lakhs (US $40,000) for conservation of the monument to highlight its structural elegance by improving its overall view, enhancing environmental aesthetics and its illumination. The Delhi Development Authority has also invited reputed NGOs for the restoration of the water body at this site. The ASI owns the monument, whereas the water body is under the control of DDA. Visitor information Satpula is located about east of Khirki Masjid. It is close to the present city suburb of Saket on the Press Enclave Road. In the medieval period, it connected four principal cities namely, the Qila Rai Pithora (the first city of Delhi - Lal Kot or Qutub complex), Siri (with the Siri Fort forming the second city of Delhi), Tughlaqabad (the third city of Delhi) and Jahanpanah (the fourth city of Delhi, the boundary limits of which encompassed the other earlier built three cities). It is locally believed that the waters stored by the weir had healing powers because the sufi saint Nasiru'd-Din Mahmud is reported to have used the waters of this reservoir for daily oblations before offering prayers at the Mosque.

OverviewOrigins= The theatre in Argentina had developed alongside the nation's emergence as a modern economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Independent and experimental theatre, however, had long endured in the shadows of commercial productions (for which Buenos Aires' Corrientes Avenue became particularly well known). Many of the playwrights prominent in this movement were also politically opinionated, and their plays' left-leaning subtext were frowned upon by powerful figures in the Argentine military and the publishing sector, alike. Increasing repression became a serious threat to artistic freedom in the years shortly before and during the country's last dictatorship.Graham-Jones, Jean. Exorcising history. Associated University Presses, 2000.Sur del Sur =Opportunity and peril= Playwright Osvaldo Drag√∫n devised the Open Theatre as a vehicle for legal resistance to the day's repressive climate.Dictator Roberto Viola allowed the festival, believing it could help counter international criticism of military rule. Intimidation and pressure were eased somewhat in 1980, however, with the support of the relatively moderate Army Chief, General Roberto Viola. Playwright Osvaldo Drag√∫n seized the opportunity to organize a new theatre movement, calling on fellow playwrights Roberto Cossa and Carlos Gorostiza, as well as renowned theatre actors Luis Brandoni, Jorge Rivera L√≥pez and Pepe Soriano. They purchased a shuttered sparkplug factory on Santos Disc√©polo Way (a pedestrianized backstreet in the crowded Balvanera district of Buenos Aires) into the \\"Picadero Theatre.\\" Honored by the presence and support of Nobel laureate Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel and writer Ernesto S√°bato, the group announced, in a May 12, 1981, press conference, the establishment of the Teatro Abierto Argentino - the \\"Argentine Open Theatre.\\"DramaTeatro: Teatro Abierto Argentino Sensitive both to the repressive climate and to the sharp economic crisis, playwright Carlos Somigliana penned the Open Theatre's mission statement, declaring that: > Being the theatre the cultural and social phenomenon that it is, we shall > strive to recover the public at large with productions of great quality and > modestly priced tickets. They premiered their first festival on July 28, 1981, featuring Cossa's Gris de ausencia (Pale of Absence), Drag√∫n's Mi obelisco y yo (My Obelisk and Me), and Gorostiza's El acompa√±amiento (The Entourage) among the evening's repertoire. During an August 6 performance, however, three fire bombs were set off in the theatre, casting doubts on the company's viability (the incident remains one of Argentina's best-known \\"unsolved mysteries\\"). Sixteen prominent Buenos Aires theatres offered them their stages, however, and the Open Theatre relocated to the larger Tabaris Theatre, a Corrientes Avenue landmark known for its revue. The Open Theatre reopened two days later and its 1981 season ran until September 21, featuring 21 directors, over 150 cast and crew, and bringing together some 25,000 spectators. Organizer Osvaldo Drag√∫n declared that \\"today the open theatre belongs to the entire nation.\\" =Winning back the streets= The ongoing economic collapse and replacement of President Viola for the hard-line General Leopoldo Galtieri led the company to plan the 1982 season with more precautions. Playwrights were invited to submit works well in advance, and the repertoire was expanded to include works of experimental theatre. Playwright Ricardo Monti contributed to the effort by publishing the \\"Open Theatre Magazine,\\" a quarterly publication. The magazine provided a forum for potential participants as much as it prudently kept authorities abreast of its developments. Other fund-raising efforts included a coffee-table book, Teatro Abierto 1981, which sold 8,000 copies. None of the participants accepted compensation beyond covering their personal expenses related to the event, and any surplus profits were returned to the struggling company's fund. The Open Theatre's 1982 season, whose slogan was \\"winning back the streets,\\" opened in late September with Drag√∫n's Al violador (To the Rapist); Eugenio Griffero's provocative look at gay life in Argentina, Pr√≠ncipe azul (Blue Prince); and Somigliana's daring criticism of the military, Oficial primero (\\"Commissioned Officer\\"), among other works from 30 other directors. Controversy ensued, however, when a number of well-known directors' works were passed over, notably Pacho O'Donnell's; negative national sentiment on the heels of the disastrous Falklands War helped further dampen interest in the season, which closed in November. The 1983 season was produced in the Margarita Xirgu Theatre amid Argentina's imminent return to democracy, and its featured plays were more politically daring than those of the two previous seasons. Drag√∫n's Hoy se comen al flaco (Today They'll Take the Skinny Guy) headlined the opening night on September 24. Banned by the dictatorship, murgas were included in the season as theatrical works. The carnival-like marches often paraded out of the theatre house, and included banned left-wing themes. Other works included odes to tragedies in Chile and Nicaragua. The season concluded with a murga marching against censorship, and the burning of an effigy of censorship itself (\\"La Censurona\\"). =The theatre strikes back= El teatrazo (\\"The Attack of the Theatre\\") as the slogan of the 1984 season was thought of by its organizers as way to \\"share our opinion in the context of liberty.\\" The return of democracy, however, also helped deprive the festival of its status as the leading forum for artistic defiance of a repressive regime; indeed, one of the Open Theatre's leading figures, Carlos Gorostiza, had been appointed Secretary of Culture by newly elected President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. Following the failure of the 1984 season, musch of which was cancelled, the company dedicated its 1985 season to young playwrights. That season featured works from throughout Latin America and, opening on September 21, it was more successful than its predecessor; but a sixth season was cancelled, leaving the Open Theatre a place in Argentine history as \\"a modest popular resistance and, among the cultural ones, the most visible.\\" References and external links Category:Theatre companies in Argentina Category:Culture in Buenos Aires Category:Theatres in Buenos Aires Category:1981 in Argentina Category:Recurring events established in 1981 Category:1986 disestablishments in Argentina ","title":"Argentine Open Theatre"},{"id":"22818928","text":"The Tropic Rot is the fifth (and thus far final) studio album by American hardcore punk band Poison the Well.

It is near many other schools such as The Study and Selwyn House School. The school teaches grades Kindergarten to 11. The annual tuition fees for attending the school range from $19,050 to $22,160. The school also receives subsidies from the provincial government for middle and senior school, which means all students in those sections must have a certificate of eligibility allowing them to attend government-funded English schools in Quebec in accordance with Bill 101. History Miss Edgar's and Miss Cramp's School was founded in 1909 by Maud Edgar and Mary Cramp. Maud Edgar, who served as the headmistress, was the daughter of the historian and feminist Matilda Ridout Edgar and the lawyer and politician James David Edgar. The school has always been an all-girls school and began its life in a home on Guy Street in Downtown Montreal. There were 70 girls at the outset, including 15 boarders. The school's initial goals were to equip their pupils with a broad understanding of literature, languages, ethics, fine arts, as well as science and mathematics. The most novel feature of the curriculum was the organization of literature and history. Forty years later, the school relocated to a building on Cedar Avenue, on the slope of Mount Royal. By then there were approximately 150 girls attending, which included 17 boarders. The school continued to grow in size for another 16 years, and after observing a larger property at the corner of Mount Pleasant and Montrose Avenue in 1964, the school undertook a major fundraising campaign to make the move possible. The official opening took place in November 1964. At this point, ECS became a dedicated day school. Today the school is located at 525 Mount Pleasant, the property bought in 1964. The school's motto is \\"Non Nobis Sed Urbi Et Orbi\\" which translated from Latin to English means \\"not for ourselves but for the community and the world.\\" The school anthem was written by Isabelle Adami. School organization ECS is divided into three \\"schools\\": junior school (K-grade 5), middle school (grade 6-grade 8) and senior school (grade 9 - grade 11). Today the school has approximately three hundred students in total from kindergarten to grade 11. There are about 20 students in each grade. Grade 4 and up is divided into two classes. In total, the students are divided into three house groups. The houses and their colours are: Cramp house, which is represented by the colour red; Edgar house which is represented by the colour green; and Adami house, which is represented by the colour blue. Each house has three elected officials from Grade 11. Music ECS has both vocal and instrumental extra-curricular activities. Open to middle and senior school students are: Vocal Jazz, Senior Choir, Junior Jazz Band, Senior Jazz Band and Symphonic Ensemble. For the junior students there is a junior choir and an annual junior school musical in addition to their regular music classes. Every year both the vocal and instrumental groups each go on a music trip. Previous destinations include Costa Rica, Mexico, Boston, Prague, Orlando, Washington, Philadelphia and New York City. ECS' Vocal Jazz has been generating musical sound with Selwyn House School's Jazz Band for years now, and won several medals this year in Orlando, Florida, during Spring Break. The ECS girls and Selwyn boys competed against schools much larger than their own. Athletics ECS actively participates in friendly competition for sports. They have a soccer, rugby, basketball, swimming, badminton, curling, golf, tennis, football, track and field, halo, cross country, squash, ski, hockey team and others. ECS is an elite athletic school.

It grows from near Milton, New South Wales (35¬∞ S) to Eungella National Park (20¬∞ S) in tropical Queensland. It grows in tropical, sub-tropical and warm temperate rainforests. Often seen in cooler and moister sites on volcanic soils and on the richer alluvial soils. Some of the many common names include Silver Quandong, Brown hearted Quandong, Whitewood, Pigeonberry Ash, and White Quandong. The plant was named in honour of W. Kirton, who collected samples of the tree at Bulli in 1885 for Ferdinand von Mueller.  Description  Elaeocarpus kirtonii leaves A large and often dominant tree, growing to 45 metres tall, and over 2 metres in diameter. The outer bark is silvery grey and thin, with small pustules. The tree base is significantly buttressed. Another identifying feature is the senescent red leaves. Leaves resemble the Coachwood, being long, thin and serrated. 9 to long, around wide. Dull green and very veiny, a long leaf stalk, 2 to long, swollen where attached to the branch. New spring growth is a brilliant salmon pink colour, most outstanding in the rainforest. White flowers appear on racemes from January to March, being sweet scented and attractive. Similar to the cultivated Elaeocarpus reticulatus, though in longer racemes. The fruit is a blue drupe, 10 to 13 mm long with a hard stone like capsule, containing one or sometimes two seeds. Fruit matures from October to January, eaten by a large variety of rainforest birds. Like many Australian Elaeocarpus trees, germination is very slow and difficult, however cuttings prove more successful.

It was written by executive producer Robert Carlock and directed by Todd Holland. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on February 5, 2009. Guest stars in \\"Generalissimo\\" include Jon Hamm, Salma Hayek, Patrick Heusinger, Matt Lauer, Doug Mand, Greg Tuculescu, and Teresa Yenque. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) begins receiving mail intended for her new neighbor, Dr. Drew Baird (Hamm), and after going through it she decides she would like to meet him. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) resembles a Spanish-language soap opera villain, \\"The Generalissimo\\", which prompts the grandmother (Yenque) of Jack's girlfriend, Elisa (Hayek), to disapprove of their relationship. Back at 30 Rock, the new The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) interns (Heusinger, Tuculescu, and Mand) invite Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) out for a night of partying. \\"Generalissimo\\" received generally positive reviews. According to the Nielsen ratings system, it was watched by 6.4 million households during its original broadcast. Todd Holland received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for \\"Generalissimo\\". This episode was submitted for consideration on the behalf of Baldwin for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) receives the mail of her new neighbor, Dr. Drew Baird (Jon Hamm). After going through it, she believes he is the perfect man for her. To try and woo him, she follows the actions of an evil Spanish soap character called \\"The Generalissimo\\" from Los Amantes Clandestinos, despite the warnings of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Elisa (Salma Hayek). She invites Drew to a nonexistent party, and, when he arrives expecting a party, she informs him that the party is scheduled for the following evening, but nevertheless invites him in. While this plan initially appears to work, things go wrong when Liz accidentally gives Drew Rohypnol and he finds some of his opened mail in her handbag. The next day Drew receives some of Liz's mail and reads it. He says that based on her mail he probably would have wanted to meet Liz, in the same vein as she had wanted to meet him. They decide to start with a clean slate and go on a real date. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) meets his girlfriend Elisa's grandmother (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother does not like Jack because he reminds her of the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor who plays the Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, his role as the Generalissimo allows him to cut in line at Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack by making the character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, but makes one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage of pictures of Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of Matt Lauer. Meanwhile, NBC has hired recently laid off investment bankers (Patrick Heusinger, Greg Tuculescu, and Doug Mand) from Lehman Brothers as interns on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is invited to go out on the town with them, but finds that he is incapable of keeping up with their lifestyle. Tracy fears that if the public were to learn that he no longer lives a fast lifestyle, his image would be severely compromised and he would be forced to change from a comedic actor to a dramatic actor. Tracy refuses to allow this to happen, so he buys out Lehman Brothers and sends the interns back to their old jobs on Wall Street. Production Jon Hamm made his 30 Rock debut in \\"Generalissimo\\". \\"Generalissimo\\" was written by executive producer Robert Carlock and directed by Todd Holland. This was the tenth episode written by Carlock and was Holland's first directed episode. Holland was hired to direct this episode on the recommendation of his agent, who also represents series creator, executive producer and lead actress Tina Fey. \\"Generalissimo\\" originally aired in the United States on February 5, 2009, on NBC. In October 2008, when actor Jon Hamm hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL), negotiations took place with the show's producers for him to guest star on 30 Rock. Two months later, it was confirmed Hamm would appear as a love interest for Fey's character, Liz Lemon. It was also announced by NBC that Hamm would star in a three-episode arc; he made his debut in this episode, made his second appearance in \\"St. Valentine's Day\\", and made his final guest spot in the show's third-season episode \\"The Bubble\\". Hamm later appeared in the season four episodes \\"Anna Howard Shaw Day\\" and \\"Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land\\" and the season five episode \\"Live Show.\\" In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Fey said when the writing staff is developing a script, \\"We'll have an actor in mind and we'll keep referring to them. Like for this we said, 'Then Hamm comes in, blah blah blah.'\\" She believed that there was no possibility of getting Hamm, though \\"we were lucky with the timing because Mad Men was on hiatus and he was hosting SNL. So I called over there and asked them [whispering], 'Hey, is that guy funny? Tell me the truth.' And they were like, 'Yes, he's really funny.' By Saturday I knew they were right.\\" This episode was actress Salma Hayek's third appearance on 30 Rock. She first appeared in the episode \\"Se√±or Macho Solo\\" as a nurse for Jack Donaghy's mother and love interest for Jack. Hayek's second appearance came in \\"Flu Shot\\". Critical reception Alec Baldwin won the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for his work in this episode. According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Generalissimo\\" was watched by 6.4 million households, the same as the previous week's episode \\"Retreat to Move Forward\\", in its original American broadcast. It earned a 3.1 rating/7 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 3.1% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode was the eleventh highest-rated show on the NBC network that week. Todd Holland, director of this episode, received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Directing For a Comedy Series at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. This episode was submitted for consideration on the behalf of Alec Baldwin for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the same awards show. Bob Sassone of TV Squad admitted in his review that after seeing the promos for \\"Generalissimo\\" audibly groaned, and believed the story about a fictitious soap character resembling Baldwin's Jack would not work. He wrote that all of the \\"over-the-top surreal subplots\\" featured in the season would make this episode \\"the worst one of all.\\" After watching the episode, however, Sassone said all the elements worked. Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly reported that the two stories, involving Liz and Drew and Jack and Elisa, respectively, were sublime. Barrett said that Baldwin's performance \\"alone\\" would have made the episode great. Jeremy Medina of Paste praised this episode, along with \\"St. Valentine's Day\\", concluding, \\"There's no possible way to mention every funny joke or one-liner in the past two episodes. The show is just too lightning-quick for that.\\" Writing for The Monterey County Herald Marc Cabrera noted Jack's interactions with Elisa's grandmother amongst his favorite moments of season 3. The Guardian's Will Dean wrote that \\"Generalissimo\\" was the \\"best episode\\" of the series. Staci Gold of North by Northwestern wrote that this episode was majorly improved by Baldwin's \\"hilarious imitation of a Spanish accent.\\" IGN writer Robert Canning said that Baldwin stole the show in this episode, and rated it a 9.4 out of 10. Time contributor James Poniewozik was complimentary towards the casting of Jon Hamm as Tina Fey's love interest, but hoped that Hamm get \\"fleshed out beyond the central-casting dreamboat\\" in the series. Further in his review, Poniewozik said that he most enjoyed episodes in which Liz shows her \\"evil side\\" because the show \\"does an excellent job of showing how much work it is for her to be assertive and slightly evil, how she's excited yet made nervous by the idea at the same time.\\" As with Poniewozik, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club complimented 30 Rock as they \\"pulled it off with aplomb\\" in regards to Liz's actions in this episode. He said that Liz and Drew \\"are so damned delightful that it's hard not to root for them even if Liz's antics increasingly border on deranged and criminal.\\" Rabin said that the Rohypnol incident was funny \\"but also sweet and more than a little romantic.\\" Sassone enjoyed Liz and Drew's scenes, writing that when Fey and Hamm work together they are quite good. Gold said that Liz's unsuccessful attempts of seduction were \\"hilarious effects\\". Canning wrote that Liz's \\"scam\\" started weakly but that her storyline \\"grew at a great pace.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that past 30 Rock episodes took \\"old sitcom cliches\\" and were able to find a \\"demented\\" new take on them. In his review, Sepinwall wrote that \\"Generalissimo\\" felt like the staff \\"came up with the cliches they wanted to mock ‚Äì goofy/evil twins, a character spinning a ridiculous web of lies to land a new crush ‚Äì and never moved to the next step.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2009 American television episodes Category:30 Rock (season 3) episodes ","title":"Generalissimo (30 Rock)"},{"id":"22819311","text":"√âvariste L√©vi-Proven√ßal (4 January 1894 - 27 March 1956) was a French medievalist, orientalist, Arabist, and historian of Islam.

Most of the wetland is 'ombrotrophic' meaning it receives water and nutrient inputs solely from rain and is hydrologically isolated from the surrounding canals and rivers.

In 1908, the Government of Alberta passed the Edmonton Radial Tramway Act, permitting the city to provide tramway service to communities located within 80 miles of the city. With this power, the city purchased the Strathcona Radial Tramway Company Ltd., and began providing streetcar service to the City of Strathcona as well. The radial railway reached its greatest extent in 1930. Two years later, in 1932, bus service replaced streetcar service on the 102 Avenue line.

Its original form was a video originally made in 1984 by Charlie Schmidt of his cat Fatso seemingly playing a piano (though manipulated by Schmidt off-camera) to a cheery tune. While Schmidt had uploaded the video himself to YouTube in 2007, Brad O'Farrell, with Schmidt's permission, appended the video to the end of a blooper video uploaded in 2009 as if to have the cat \\"play\\" the person offstage after the gaffe as they had done in Vaudeville. The idea of this quickly expanded on the Internet by numerous other users, typically under the name \\"Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat\\", and became a meme. Though Fatso had died in 1987, Schmidt had since adopted two other cats to become the new \\"Keyboard Cat\\" and providing video footage to be used for the meme: Bento until his death in 2018, and the current Keyboard Cat, Skinny. History The loads of various Keyboard Cats have been owned by Charlie Schmidt of Spokane, Washington, United States, who has owned numerous cats. The first such video, created by Schmidt in 1984, featured Fatso, a female cat that lived from 1978 to 1987. Schmidt had made the VHS video from 1984 of Fatso wearing an infant's blue tee-shirt and \\"playing\\" an upbeat rhythm on an electronic keyboard. Off-screen, Schmidt was manipulating Fatso's paws as to appear to be playing the piano, with the shirt used to cover his hands doing this. Schmidt had only made the video out of boredom. Well after Fatso's death, Schmidt digitized and posted the video to YouTube under the title \\"charlie schmidt's \\"cool cat\\"\\" in June 2007. Schmidt later changed the title to \\"Charlie Schmidt's Keyboard Cat (THE ORIGINAL)\\" as the meme began to spread. By 2018, this video had received over 50 million views. ROFLcon II. Brad O'Farrell, who was the syndication manager of the video website My Damn Channel, obtained Schmidt's permission to reuse the footage, appending it to the end of a blooper video to \\"play\\" that person offstage after the mistake or gaffe in a similar manner as getting the hook in the days of vaudeville. The appending of Schmidt's video to other blooper and other viral videos became popular, with such videos usually accompanied with the title Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat or a variant. \\"Keyboard Cat\\" was ranked No. 2 on Current TV's list of 50 Greatest Viral Videos. The first such \\"Keyboard Cat\\" video, entitled \\"Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat\\", was created by Brad O'Farrell, the syndication manager of the video website My Damn Channel. O'Farrell both secured Schmidt's permission to use footage and asked Schmidt to allow anyone to use the footage with or without permission. O'Farrell used the footage by appending it to the end of a video of a person in a wheelchair falling awkwardly off an escalator, with the appended Fatso footage appearing to \\"play\\" that person offstage in a similar manner as getting the hook in the days of vaudeville. O'Farrell had posted his video in February 2009, though this video had been removed from YouTube due to reported copyright violations. O'Farrell used his connections on YouTube to help promote the video to be featured on the front page of YouTube, which caused other users to create similar videos based on \\"epic fail\\" videos already posted on YouTube, all appended with the Fatso footage and typically named in the same fashion. By May 2009, at least 200 videos had been created. The meme received boosts from media attention in May 2009 which included coverage in press outlets like the Associated Press, a tweet made by Ashton Kutcher to his one million followers, and by a reference on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart during a \\"toss\\" with Stephen Colbert. Keyboard Cat references grew in the media throughout 2009, fully establishing it as a meme. At the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, Andy Samberg's opening monologue suggested that award winners whose speech went on too long would be played off by Keyboard Cat. Kato Kaelin also spoofed Keyboard Cat in a segment of Tosh.0 entitled \\"Keyboard Kato\\" in the series first episode. During Weezer's 2009 summer tour with Blink-182, Keyboard Cat would play the band off every night at the end of their set. The Nintendo DS game Scribblenauts was unveiled at E3 2009; the game has the player write out objects to summon to solve puzzles, one such being \\"Keyboard Cat\\", which helped to draw attention to the title due to the timeliness of the meme. With the popularity of Keyboard Cat, Schmidt adopted a male cat Bento, which was similar in appearance to Fatso and became \\"Keyboard Cat 2.0\\". Schmidt announced the new Keyboard Cat with a new video of Bento \\"performing\\" as Fatso had done, called \\"Keyboard Cat REINCARNATED!\\" in March 2010. This video went to be used in a similar manner as the previous Keyboard Cat video. Bento died in March 2018, and received numerous tributes from the Internet. Schmidt at the time was not sure if he would bring another Keyboard Cat to the Internet. Schmidt announced in March 2019 that he had found his \\"Keyboard Cat 3.0\\" in Skinny, a male cat he had adopted in 2010, and featured Skinny in a new YouTube video. In April 2020, the original channel where the video was uploaded from was terminated after getting hacked by a Cryptocurrency business group. The channel was later reinstated, but all videos that were uploaded onto the channel have not been reinstated. =Notable uses= An easter egg in Activision Blizzard's announcement for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm reveals the game's antagonist, Deathwing, playing a keyboard with the text \\"Keyboard Cataclysm: Play 'em Off, Deathwing\\".

The Xbox Live Arcade remake of Earthworm Jim includes additional content, including one boss character inspired by Keyboard Cat. The Keyboard Cat meme has been integrated into other memes. An 8-bit version of both the cat and the song have been created. Online clothing vendor Threadless sells a \\"Three Keyboard Cat Moon\\" T-shirt based on the infamous Three Wolf Moon design; the shirt design was one of the most popular that the company has had, and they have had difficulties in meeting the demand for the shirt. The shirt appeared in a television ad for the release of the PlayStation 3 Slim game console. G4TV's Attack of the Show held a \\"Great American Keyboard Cat Competition\\" to give viewers a chance to create their own Keyboard Cat- inspired art, with over one hundred pieces submitted. Several of the top works from this were given to the charity Kitten Rescue to be auctioned off through eBay. The MLB AL East Champion Tampa Bay Rays used a variation known as \\"Rays Keyboard Kitty\\" (they also had one called \\"DJ Kitty\\") to rouse the crowd during its late season run, using a similar cat in Rays gear in several segments. On April 1, 2011, YouTube released a video showing the \\"Top 5 Viral Pictures of 1911\\", including a parody of Keyboard Cat titled \\"Flugelhorn Feline\\". There are also a number of videos in which other music has been substituted in for the original song. For example, at the height of the popularity of the podcast Serial, a YouTube video was released that showed Keyboard Cat \\"playing\\" the Serial theme song. On the homepage of the popular online game Bin Weevils, one can get a glimpse of a large television screen at the Drive-In Cinema where a \\"bin pet\\"-ified Keyboard Cat can be seen. In one example, Keyboard Cat was appended to the end of a segment of Desperate Lives (1982), a made-for-TV movie starring Helen Hunt showing the effects of drug use (with Keyboard Cat starting after Hunt's character falls out a window and suffers from overdosing); after the video, the submitter then superimposed Keyboard Cat in the music video for Hall & Oates' \\"You Make My Dreams\\". The music video segment has been jokingly called by some the \\"greatest music video ever.\\" While the video still exists at YouTube, copyright issues with Warner Music Group have forced YouTube to disable the audio. The move has alerted groups concerned about copyrights and the remix culture to warn about potential limitation of creative expression through such actions. Appearances in other media In addition to the cats' use in the memes, the various Keyboard Cats have appeared in other media outlets, typically referencing the meme. A 2010 television advertisement for Wonderful Pistachios features Bento cracking one of the nuts during the song. Bento was featured in a cinema spot promoting the UK's EE telecom network, and most recently in the 2014 film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Bento also appeared and revealed herself to be a fan of the Carolina Panthers in a National Football League advertisement that first aired during Super Bowl XLIX. Bento was the halftime entertainment for the 2014 Puppy Bowl. Lawsuit On June 21, 2011, Schmidt filed a lawsuit in Seattle Federal Court against Threadless for their 2009 line of Three Keyboard Cat Moon T-shirts, a send up of the then popular Three Wolf Moon meme, due to copyright infringement. Threadless counter-claimed by stating that Schmidt's copyright claim was not approved until September 22, 2010, more than a year after the production of the T-shirts, and that Schmidt had lost his copyright when he asked people to submit videos that paid tribute to Fatso. , this lawsuit has been settled. In May 2013, Schmidt and Christopher Torres, the creator of Nyan Cat, jointly sued 5th Cell and Warner Bros. for copyright infringement and trademark infringement over the appearance of these characters without permission in the Scribblenauts series of video games. Torres and Schmidt have both registered copyrights on their characters and have pending trademark applications on the names. Meme manager Ben Lashes manages them and Grumpy Cat, Scumbag Steve and Ridiculously Photogenic Guy. The suit was settled in September 2013, with Torres and Schmidt being paid for the use of the characters.

She wrote for teen pop newspaper Go-Set from September 1969 to September 1970 as an agony aunt in her weekly \\"Takes Care of Business\\" column, and as a feature writer. Saddington had Top 30 chart success with her 1972 solo single \\"Looking Through a Window\\", which was written and produced by Billy Thorpe and Warren Morgan of the Aztecs. After adopting Krishna Consciousness in the 1970s she took the name Gandharvika Dasi. In March 2013 she was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, and died on 21 June, aged 63. Biography Wendy June Saddington was born on 26 September 1949. Her father was Henry Saddington and Connie Evans was her mother. Henry was a bus driver and Connie was a raincoat maker. Wendy was the couple's only child and she grew up in Melbourne. At 13 she bought her first record, Stevie Wonder's With a Song in My Heart. After leaving school Saddington was a typist for a private detective, \\"just divorces and stuff like that\\". She quit after he objected to her dress sense and did not allow her a day off for Melbourne Show Day in September. She attended a club venue in Carlton, the Love In, which had two singers and she thought: \\"Oh my god, I can sing better than that\\". Her inspirations were Nina Simone, Bessie Smith, Aretha Franklin and Bob Dylan. The following week at the Love In she asked if she could get up to sing, and promptly provided \\"Bessie Smith songs and a Miriam Makeba song, 'When I've Passed on'\\". The management advised \\"you can sing here every week\\". =1960s= Wendy Saddington started her professional musical career in 1967 when she joined as a singer for Melbourne-based soul band Revolution and then Adelaide-based psychedelic rock band James Taylor Move, with Kevin Peek on guitar (later in Sky), Trevor Spencer on drums and Alan Tarney on bass guitar. When Perth pop/R&B;/blues group, The Beat 'n Tracks, relocated to Melbourne, Saddington joined and the group were renamed, The Chain, in December 1968. Saddington provided the name from Franklin's \\"Chain of Fools\\". The Chain line-up were Saddington on vocals, Phil Manning on guitar and vocals, Warren Morgan on piano and vocals, and Murray Wilkins on bass guitar. The teen pop newspaper, Go-Set started publishing in 1966, and in 1968, as a guest writer, Saddington provided an interview of soul and blues singer, Max Merritt. In March 1969 Saddington was described by The Canberra Timess Garry Raffaele as \\"by far the best female rhythm and blues singer in the country. That's a relative judgment; objectively she is an exciting, raging swinger in the style of Aretha Franklin ... vocally she screams and roars and sighs with the rhythmic feel of [Franklin]\\". Saddington left the band in May that year prior to any known recordings, the band later shortened their name to Chain and had a hit with \\"Black and Blue\\". In June 1969 she explained to Go-Set readers \\"I only want to be in it up to my waist, not up to my neck ... My attitude was all wrong in the end. I didn't care if I turned up late or drunk for a job ... [the other band members] knew I was unhappy, but they were powerless ... it was the promoters who handed out the money and they're a pack of misers\\". Go-Set had an agony aunt column, \\"Dear Leslie Pixie\\", initially written by Sue Flett and then by Jean Gollan. From September 1969 to September the following year, Saddington provided the weekly \\"Takes Care of Business\\" column in its stead, and was also a feature writer. In 2005 founder of Go-Set, Phillip Frazer, told listeners of 3CV radio, \\"[she] was so distinctive in her presentation ... she developed a cult following that included some of our gay female staff\\". He approved the idea of a \\"working class girl from the suburbs, giving advice to the kids\\". Australian music commentator, David Martin Kent, said that in her column, \\"Saddington dealt with the realistic issues of pregnancy, loneliness, and sometimes suicide. Her approach was to focus on the reality of the teenagers' problems, and provide answers that met that reality head-on\\". In 1969, Go-Set was the only Australian newspaper or magazine dealing with teen issues and culture. Rival newspapers attacked Saddington's direct approach, and parents, on talk-back radio, challenged her answers as not being aimed at the correct age group: \\"her readers were too young to understand the column\\". Saddington defended her writing with \\"Obviously some people can't face reality\\". In 2002 she recalled \\"one of the last things I wrote was that if they could talk more to their mothers then they wouldn't have to write to me\\". According to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) TV show, Long Way to the Top (2001), \\"[Saddington] had a wild appearance with heavily made-up eyes, a huge afro, and usually wore copious beads and bangles, with a pair of Levis and a cheesecloth top\\". In an interview on ABC TV series, GTK in October 1969, she stated that some members of the public laughed at her appearance and even became abusive. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the superficiality of the pop scene which made success difficult. =1970s= On the Australia Day weekend (24 and 25 January) 1970, Ourimbah was the venue for the \\"Pilgrimage for Pop\\", the nation's first rock music festival. Saddington performed as a solo artist, with other acts including Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs and Jeff St John's Copperwine. Julie Kusko from The Australian Women's Weekly estimated some 6000 to 10000 attendees \\"sat and watched, taking the long delays between poor performances without a murmur ... At night the music became better, and psychedelic lighting and colored searchlights helped. A couple of artists got standing ovations, surprisingly, for songs of the rock-'n-roll style of 15 years ago\\". Despite local predictions \\"that it would all turn into a drug and sex orgy\\", there was some nudity and drug use, but police only \\"laid four charges of indecency and ten for language and offensive behaviour\\". From March 1970 to February 1971, Saddington was co-lead vocalist with St John in Copperwine. Saddington had previously interviewed St John for Go-Set after the singer, born with spina bifida, had performed on a TV show without his requested stool. Saddington had taken the TV station to task over St John being \\"forced to perform, propped precariously, on a slippery studio floor on [his] crutches\\". During Saddingtion's time the other members of Copperwine were Harry Brus on bass guitar, Ross East on guitar and vocals, Peter Figures on drums, and Barry Kelly on keyboards and vocals. In January 1971, Copperwine attended the Wallacia Festival, in central New South Wales, and recorded a live album without leader, St John. It was released as Wendy Saddington and Copperwine Live but Saddington had left before its release in February by Festival Records on their Infinity label. Saddington was not pleased with the quality of the live album. Nevertheless, Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt her tenure with Copperwine had \\"motivated many changes in [their] musical direction, with much of the soul-copying being replaced by a more purist blues-oriented sound. That change was heard on the album\\". In July 1971, Saddington released her debut solo single, \\"Looking Through a Window\\", which reached No. 22 in September. It was co-written and co-produced by Billy Thorpe and her former bandmate, Warren Morgan of the Aztecs. The Aztecs, including Morgan and Thorpe, backed her on the recording. Soon after, Saddington formed Teardrop which were featured in an 11-minute documentary short for Film Australia, Australian Colour Diary No. 43: Three Directions in Australian Pop Music (1972) directed by Peter Weir (future director of Dead Poets Society and Master and Commander). Chart success for \\"Looking Through a Window\\" led Festival to re-release the Copperwine album as Looking Through a Window with the single added as a bonus track in 1972. From October 1972 to the end of 1974 Saddington regularly supported Sydney drag performance troupe, Sylvia and the Synthetics, which had various members including Danny Abood (aka Daniel Archer), Doris Fish (aka Philip Mills) and Jacqueline Hyde (aka Mel Slatterly). A discussion with Saddington had provided the name, \\"I was with [her] one night on our way to 'Chez Ivy's' and we just started talking about names for groups. You know, raging along and we suddenly hit on Sylvia ... and 'Synthetics' just seemed to go so well\\". Chez Ivy's was a wine bar in Bondi Junction which was frequented in the 1970s by gays and lesbians. Sylvia and the Synthetic's history \\"paralleled the early years of the gay rights movement\\" in Oxford Street, Sydney. In March 1973, The Who's rock opera Tommy was performed as an orchestral version in Australia with Saddington in the role of The Nurse. Other Australian artists were Daryl Braithwaite (as Tommy), Billy Thorpe, Doug Parkinson, Broderick Smith, Jim Keays, Colleen Hewett, Linda George, Ross Wilson, Bobby Bright, and Ian Meldrum (as Uncle Ernie in Sydney). From the early 1970s Saddington was a follower of Prabhupada and joined the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, she took the name, Gandharvika Dasi. She had been introduced to the movement in 1972 when visiting New York. In the mid-1970s Saddington worked with various groups including Shango and Blues Assembly, and in New York with Jeffrey Crozier Band. Her performing career declined in the late 1970s as her involvement with Krishna Consciousness became a major focus. =1980s‚Äì2000s= In 1983 Wendy Saddington returned to her music career by forming Wendy Saddington Band with Bobby Gebert on keyboards, Harvey James (ex-Ariel, Sherbet, Swanee) on guitar, Billy Rylands on bass guitar, and Chris Sweeney on drums. A second version appeared in 1986 to 1987 with Angelica Booth on bass guitar, Rose Bygrave (ex- Goanna) on keyboards, Mick Lieber (ex-Python Lee Jackson) on guitar and Des McKenna (\\"Animal\\" from Hey Hey It's Saturday house band) on drums. This line- up mainly played reggae music and toured rural New South Wales including Tamworth. They recorded an album at Tamworth's ENREC studios, which was not released as the master tapes were lost. In August 1994, Australian art historian, Catriona Moore, dedicated her book, Indecent Exposures. Twenty Years of Australian Feminist Photography to photographer Carol Jerrems and used Jerrems' photo, \\"Wendy Saddington 1973\\", to promote the work. On 5 September 1998 Saddington provided guest vocals on One Night Jamm by Kevin Borich Express, which also has guest vocals and harmonica by Ross Wilson (ex- Daddy Cool, Mondo Rock). The band's line up was Kevin Borich on lead guitar and vocals, his son Lucius Borich on drums, and Ben Rosen on bass guitar. Saddington \\"sang a number of jazzy, free-form blues tunes\\". Around 1985 Saddington had formed a duo with pianist Peter Head, performing mainly at the Civic Hotel and at various Kings Cross and Darlinghurst venues. They worked irregularly together for the remainder of the decade. In 2002 Head organised a Saddington concert at Sydney's jazz and blues venue, The Basement, curating a soul, jazz line up with Lachlan Doley on Hammond organ, Peter Figures on drums, and Jackie Orszaczky on bass guitar. The concert was recorded but is as yet unreleased. In 2003, Saddington provided three tracks for the album, Women 'n Blues, with other tracks by Kate Dunbar, Sally King, Jeannie Lewis and Margret RoadKnight. In August 2012 Saddington appeared on celebrity musician quiz show, RocKwiz, on SBS-TV, where she performed Simone's \\"Backlash Blues\\". In December that year she recalled her career \\"I'm not into legacies ... I usually get a job once in a blue moon ... I guess it is by choice in a way. But at the same time I have always thought I would have liked to have earned a living at it\\". She believed that Krishna Consciousness had \\"saved my life\\", reviewing her life as a heavy drinker \\"I honestly think if I had gone on with that, it would have ended up like Janis Joplin. Too fast; not good enough; too soon, you know, bang\\". In March 2013 she was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, Wendy Saddington died on 21 June 2013, aged 63.

This result is one of the deeper results in axiomatic plane geometry. It is often used in proofs to justify the statement that a line through a vertex of a triangle lying inside the triangle meets the side of the triangle opposite that vertex. This property was often used by Euclid in his proofs without explicit justification. Some modern treatments (not Euclid's) of the proof of the theorem that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent start like this: Let ABC be a triangle with side AB congruent to side AC. Draw the angle bisector of angle A and let D be the point at which it meets side BC. And so on. The justification for the existence of point D is the often unstated crossbar theorem. For this particular result, other proofs exist which do not require the use of the crossbar theorem.

It is envisioned that \\"unhealthy cells would draw a different charge at the needle from healthy ones, and could be identified by the mass spectrometer\\", with tremendous implications in the health care industry. The early versions of bio-electrosprays were employed in several areas of research, most notably self-assembly of carbon nanotubes. Although the self-assembly mechanism is not clear yet, \\"elucidating electrosprays as a competing nanofabrication route for forming self-assemblies with a wide range of nanomaterials in the nanoscale for top-down based bottom-up assembly of structures.\\" Future research may reveal important interactions between migrating cells and self-assembled nanostructures. Such nano-assemblies formed by means of this top-down approach could be explored as a bottom-up methodology for encouraging cell migration to those architectures for forming cell patterns to nano-electronics, which are a few examples, respectively. After initial exploration with a single protein, increasingly complex systems were studied by bio-electrosprays. These include, but are not limited to, neuronal cells, stem cells, and even whole embryos. The potential of the method was demonstrated by investigating cytogenetic and physiological changes of human lymphocyte cells as well as conducting comprehensive genetic, genomic and physiological state studies of human cells and cells of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

He is professor of international law at Middlesex University in the United Kingdom, professor of international human law and human rights at Leiden University in the Netherlands, and an internationally respected expert on human rights law, genocide and the death penalty. Schabas has been described as \\"the world expert on the law of genocide and international law.\\" He has written over 18 monographs and 200 articles. In 2009 he was elected President of the International Association of Genocide Scholars. He is an Officer of the Order of Canada and a Member of the Royal Irish Academy, as well as holding a position on the Board of Directors of the International Institute for Criminal InvestigationWilliam Schabas, CV, Middlesex University and Ren√© Cassin, a non-government organisation that presents a Jewish voice on human rights.William Schabas, CV., Middlesex University Schabas has authored more than 350 academic journal articles.

Schabas served as one of seven commissioners on the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and as one of six commissioners on the Iran Tribunal Truth Commission from 18 to 22 June 2012. In 2014 Schabas was appointed the head of a UN Committee investigating the role of Israel in the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. The appointment was criticized by Canada's Foreign Minister, John Baird, and the Geneva-based advocacy NGO UN Watch, on the basis of allegations that Schabas was anti-Israel, a charge he denied. In February 2015 he resigned after an Israeli complaint that he provided legal advice to the Palestine Liberation Organization in 2012. Schabas had been hired as a consultant to provide a legal analysis regarding the Palestinian bid for non- member observer status at the United Nations. Schabas stated that he was resigning to stop the controversy from overshadowing the work of the Gaza inquiry, whose results were due in March. Avigdor Lieberman hailed his resignation as an 'achievement for Israeli diplomacy'.Herb Keinon, \\"Schabas takes parting shot at 'masters of ridiculous statements' Netanyahu, Liberman ,\\" Jerusalem Post, 3 February 2015. In late 2019, Schabas defended the nation of Myanmar at the International Court of Justice in The Hague against charges of genocide towards its Rohingya population, brought by the republic of Gambia. Early life and education Schabas was born in Cleveland, Ohio, with strong roots in an Ashkenazi Jewish background, though his family name, which is a variation of the Yiddish word for \\"Sabbath\\" (\\"Shabbos\\" in Yiddish, derived from \\"Shabbat\\" in Hebrew), has been interpreted as perhaps suggesting also a Sephardic connection.Nathan Guttman, \\"8 Things You Didn't Know About The U.N. War Crimes Commission,\\" The Forward 15 August 2015. His mother, Ann (n√©e Fairley), was born in Canada and served as dean of the Faculty of Library and Information Sciences at the University of Toronto. His father, Ezra Schabas, is an American-born Canadian musician and author. His maternal grandparents were Barker Fairley, an English-born painter and scholar, and Margaret Fairley, a writer and educator also born in England. His paternal grandparents came from Galicia, and relatives on his father's side died in the Holocaust.\\"Former Head of Inquiry Into Gaza War Says He Faced Pressure and Threats\\", by Marlise Simons, New York Times, FEB. 11, 2015 Schabas moved with his family to Toronto in 1952 and received his B.A. and M.A. degrees in history from the University of Toronto, and LL.B., LL.M. and LL.D. degrees from the Universit√© de Montr√©al. He has also been awarded honorary doctorates by Dalhousie University, Halifax, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland and Northwestern University, Chicago. According to UN Watch, when Schabas was a Ph.D. student in history at the University of Toronto in 1974, and a leader in the radical SDS group, he was the subject of a university investigation for allegedly violating human rights and freedoms by physically obstructing a visiting Harvard professor from speaking on campus. Schabas was suspended from the university for four years, later reduced to two.  Career  From 1991 to 2000 he was a professor of human rights law and criminal law at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al (UQ√ÄM), and he chaired the Department of Legal Studies from 1994 to 1998. He has taught as a visiting or adjunct professor at several other institutions, including McGill University, Queen's University Belfast, LUISS University in Rome, Cardoza Law School, Panth√©on-Assas University and the National University of Rwanda. Schabas moved to Ireland in 2000, serving as the director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the National University of Ireland, Galway, until 2011. That year he moved to London to take up a chair in international law at Middlesex University, London. He is the recipient of the Vespasian V. Pellat Medal for International Criminal Justice of the Association international de droit penal and the Gold Medal in the Social Sciences of the Royal Irish Academy. Schabas was called to the Quebec bar in 1985 and practised law in Montreal for many years. He has also practised at the international level, appearing before the International Court of Justice, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court. Schabas was invited by the Special Court for Sierra Leone to serve as an amicus curiae. Schabas has participated on several human rights fact-finding missions on behalf of international non-governmental organisations, such as Amnesty International and the International Federation of Human Rights, to such countries as Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan, South Africa and Russia. The 1993 mission to Rwanda, of which he was a member, alerted the international community to the danger of genocide in that country. In 2011, Schabas attended a conference in Iran with the Tehran-based Non-Aligned Movement Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity where he was a keynote speaker. It was reported that the center has close ties with former Iranian president President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He attended the conference together with US film producer Sandra Schulberg in order to present a documentary film about the Nuremberg Trial to Iranians, which was welcomed by the audience, and spoke to them about the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities.Non-aligned Movement Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity, ' Non-aligned Movement Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity Annual Report 2011,'Namiran February 2012 Schabas states that he went as an academic, and is opposed to academic boycotts of Israel and Iran. In December 2019, the Republic of The Gambia filed charges of genocide against Myanmar. Led by justice minister Abubacarr Tambadou and with the support of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the former international criminal lawyer alleged that a genocide against the Rohingya people took place in Myanmar between 2016 and 2017. William Schabas, who in 2010 had collaborated on a report detailing systematic attacks against the Rohingya and concluding that they met the international threshold of crimes against humanity, stood in defense of the Asian nation, leading to criticism. Legal and political positionsOverview= An interview with Schabas in the journal Intellectum offers a concise overview of his opinions on Israeli operations in Gaza, the Goldstone Report, racism in Europe, the death penalty, genocide, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Sierra Leone, the International Criminal Court and its arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir of Sudan, and international criminal law in general. =Death penalty= Schabas has been very active in the movement for worldwide abolition of capital punishment. His book The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law William Schabas, The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law, Cambridge University Press (1993) 3RD.EDITION, 2003. and his other writings on the subject have been referred to in judgments by national and international tribunals, including the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Canada and the Supreme Court of the Philippines. Schabas regularly lectures on capital punishment in China and the United States. In 2009 he was a consultant to the United Nations responsible for preparing the Secretary General's five- yearly report on the status of capital punishment. Schabas is the Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the International Academic Network Against the Death Penalty and for a Universal Moratorium on Capital Punishment, and Advisor to the International Centre for Death Penalty Research at Beijing Normal University. =Genocide= For Schabas, the definition of what constituted the crime of genocide historically, unlike other laws governing international crimes, did not change for nearly 5 decades after its original formulation, though scholars beyond the legal discipline were critical of narrowness of the definition. Reviewing the evolving legal debate, Schabas notes a tendency to merge the notion of genocide with the related concept of crimes against humanity. In his own view, these should be kept distinct, with the former restricted to the definition originally framed in the Geneva Conventions, while the latter is sufficiently broad to prosecute all other cases of mass murder in ethnic and religious conflicts.William Schabas, \\"Genocide in International Law: A Discussion with William Schabas,\\" United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 4 March 2004. Schabas argues that the legal term \\"genocide\\" is a loaded one that should not be used to describe every atrocity involving mass killings. He argues that, in the strict legal sense, the only true \\"genocides\\" in recent history were the Armenian Genocide, the Jewish and Gypsy Holocaust, and the Rwandan genocide. In his book Genocide in International Law: The Crime of Crimes (Cambridge University Press, 2nd ed., 2009) he supports the view that Stalin's atrocities in the Ukraine, the killings of Slav and Soviet citizens under the Nazi occupation, and the Holodomor were not, legally, genocide. He has been criticized for denying the internationally recognized Srebrenica Genocide. In his book he summarizes the legal opinions regarding the status of the atrocities committed in Bosnia, deeming them ethnic cleansing and not genocide, stating that \\"Ethnic cleansing is also a warning sign of genocide to come. Genocide is the last resort of the frustrated ethnic cleanser.\\" Schabas also criticises the United Nations General Assembly for recognising ethnic cleansing as genocide. In March 1993, Schabas co-authored the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Human Rights Violations in Rwanda. In a later book, War Crimes and Human Rights (Cambridge University Press, 2008), Schabas states that the killings by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia during the late 1970s lacked \\"the ethnic dimension that is part of the essence of the crime [of genocide].\\" Schabas took the same position in 2001 in his article \\"Cambodia: Was it Really Genocide?\\"William Schabas, \\"Cambodia: Was It Really Genocide?\\", Human Rights Quarterly (2001). Further, while he strongly condemns the atrocities in Darfur in War Crimes and Human Rights, Schabas says that they should not be labelled genocide because \\"the summary execution\\" of non-Arabs in Darfur \\"does not establish genocidal intent.\\" In War Crimes and Human Rights he also criticises the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for finding a joint criminal enterprise to commit genocide in Srebrenica. In 10 to 12 December 2019, Schabas represented the Myanmar government, protecting Myanmar genocide with his expertise in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearing in Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. His appearance before the ICJ defending Burmese Government accused of committing genocide on Rohingya Muslim minority drew serious international criticism and condemnation among different human rights organizations and individuals, in particular, Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, who went on to write \\"William Schabas is basically selling out the Rohingya for some Myanmar gov‚Äôt $$$. Really the worst sort of behavior, how totally immoral and two- faced\\",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-profile- schabas/myanmars-lawyer-to-critics-on-genocide-case-everyone-has-right-to- defense-idUSKBN1YH02J and Stephen J Rapp, a former United States war crimes ambassador who works at the Holocaust museum, who contended saying it as, \\"We have heard this morning from my friend Bill Schabas, I was just with him 10 days ago. I prosecuted genocide, we obtained convictions for this crime. He is wrong about the law: this was a genocide. Mr. Schabas was also criticised by Stephen J Rapp as \\"Genocide Denier\\". \\"He, frankly, doesn‚Äôt think Srebrenica was (genocide) and that was found by the courts (to be genocide),\\" said Rapp. \\" =Middle East conflict=Statements In 2011, the same year Schabas attended the Center for Human Rights and Cultural Diversity conference in Iran in Tehran, he said in a speech that he believes Israeli prime minister Benyamin Netanyahu should be \\"in the dock of an international court.\\" He also wrote in a law journal article that the Israeli prime minister could be regarded as \\"the single individual most likely to threaten the survival of Israel.\\" In 2012, in regard to the Iranian nuclear program, Schabas wrote that Iran \\"very arguably has a claim to require nuclear weapons for defensive purposes\\". Regarding Hamas, Schabas said \\"If we look at the poor people of Gaza ... all they want is a state ‚Äì and they get punished for insisting upon this, and for supporting a political party in their own determination and their own assessment that seems to be representing that aspiration.\\" During his speech at the Russell Tribunal in 2013, Schabas said that it is his \\"profound belief, the international law can be used to demonstrate and underscore the violations committed by the state of Israel, and moreover can be used to hold accountable individuals who have perpetrated international crimes against the people of Palestine.\\" Asked about various possible tools for prosecuting Israel, Schabas said: \\"I would have been inclined to talk about crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, all of which I think can be shown have been perpetrated at various times during the history of the state of Israel. These are all crimes that have become increasingly robust in their definition in recent decades and for which we now have international institutions capable of prosecuting the crimes ... With a bit of luck and by twisting things and maneuvering we can get them before the courts\\" Schabas has accused Israel of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and aggression committed \\"on the territory of Palestine since 2002\\", while acknowledging that \\"much of [his] effort\\" is focused on bringing about the prosecution of Israelis at the ICC. 2014 UN Gaza inquiry The United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on 23 July 2014 calling on establishment of a commission of inquiry to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian laws carried out by Israel during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. Schabas was appointed the head of a three-member commission, together with Amal Clooney (Lebanon) who declined the nomination, and Doudou Di√®ne (Senegal). US judge McGowan Davis joined the committee as 3rd member. Schabas's appointment was criticized by Canada's Foreign Minister, John Baird, and the Geneva-based advocacy NGO UN Watch. They noted that Schabas, remarking on what he sees as the political bias in the choice of cases to prosecute made by the International Criminal Court, had asked: \\"Why are we going after the President of Sudan for Darfur and not the President of Israel for Gaza?\\":'I believe that pretending the prosecution of Sudan is not political is a mistake too. Of course it is political. Why are we going after the president of Sudan for Darfur and not the president of Israel for Gaza? Because of politics.'Yitzhak Benhorin, 'Head of UN Gaza inquiry commission called to try Netanyahu at ICC,'Ynet 12 August 2014 Schabas dismissed Baird's accusation as absurd, noting that he, Schabas, was on the editorial board of the Israel Law Review. In reply to UN Watch's demand he recuse himself on the grounds that he had once criticized Benjamin Netanyahu, Schabas countered:'\\"Like everybody inside and outside Israel, I disagree with people. Is everyone in Israel who has an opinion about (Benjamin) Netanyahu anti- Israel?\\".' Schabas said at the time that there was some merit in comments by critics that Israel was being singled out by the UN for human rights violations, but added that double standards and bias in the UN works both ways, at times to Israel's advantage, citing the fact that the United States almost invariably vetoes resolutions critical of Israel in the Security Council. In short, he concluded: > Let's just say that it's a plausible complaint that maybe Israel has gotten > a lot of attention at the Human Rights Council but at the same time it has > perhaps had a lot of inattention at the Security Council, so the double > standards work in both directions for Israel. The Israeli government condemned the appointment of Schabas, and Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Ron Prosor, said in an interview \\"Forming an investigatory committee headed by Schabas is like inviting ISIS to organize religious tolerance week at the UN.\\" Schabas replied that he does not hate Israel and that he will put his prior positions aside, adding: \\"Even if Spiderman was heading the probe, they [Israel] would've attacked him.\\" In February 2015 Schabas resigned after an Israeli complaint that he had billed the Palestine Liberation Organization for $US1,300 in 2012 for legal advice he gave them at their request, a precedent which might constitute evidence of a conflict of interest with his position as head of the investigative committee.Yonah Jeremy Bob,\\"Schabas resignation may save Israelis at ICC,\\" The Jerusalem Post, 4 February 2015. He stated that he did not want the controversy to overshadow the work of the Gaza inquiry. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the UNHRC to shelve its report: \\"After the resignation of the committee chairman, who was biased against Israel, the report must not be published\\". Avidor Liberman attributed Schabas's resignation to Israel's diplomatic work, stating that: \\"appointing Schabas to investigate Israel was like appointing Cain to investigate Abel.\\" In reply, Schabas said the Prime Minister was entitled to spin the matter any way he liked, and that both he and Avigdor Liberman were \\"masters of extravagant and ridiculous statements.\\" According to Israeli commentator Gideon Levy, Schabas had fallen victim to investigative character assassination.Gideon Levy, \\"The ugly truth about Israel's actions in Gaza,\\" Haaretz 5 February 2015: \\"One needs a great deal of chutzpah and arrogance to dig anew into the pasts of Israel's critics in an effort to assassinate their character, as in the case of Richard Goldstone, merely because they dared to criticize the state. As far as Israel is concerned, the fate of anyone who criticizes the country is sealed. He's an anti-Semite, anti-Israeli, greedy or driven by ulterior motives.\\" In an interview with the BBC Schabas admitted that \\"there is a distortion in the amount of attention given against Israel, and the number of resolutions directed against Israel\\" but defended the claim by saying Israel gets a \\"soft ride in the Security Council hearings.\\" Publications Schabas has written or edited twenty-one books dealing in whole or in part with international human rights law, including: * *The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law (Cambridge University Press, 3d ed., 2003) * *The U.N.

It features Liberty on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. Economic conditions 1834 witnessed tough economic times in the United States. President Andrew Jackson was opposed to the developing central bank of that era known as the Second Bank of the United States. His aim was to reform a system which took power away from the states and concentrated it in the hands of a few. He recognized the potential for abuse and manipulation that was not necessarily in the best interests of the United States. His attacks on the fledgling central bank served to erode their power despite the fact that their charter did not expire until 1836. This allowed the president to introduce banking reform which was officially passed by Congress in 1836. It was known as the Deposit Act. In 1834, President Jackson began action to strengthen the U.S. economy. His goal was to retire the notes of the Bank of the United States prevalent in society at that time and to replace them with specie gold. In addition, he realized that the ratio between gold and silver must be adjusted if gold specie was to remain in circulation. At that time, the gold to silver ratio was 15:1 while in Europe, the ratio was 15.5:1. This led to the practice of melting down contemporary U.S. gold coins for profit because there was a slightly higher gold content than the face value. This practice led to significant coin rarities in the Capped Bust series of gold coins minted from 1808-1834. Gold specie fineness was reduced from .9167 fine to .8992 fine and the gold to silver ratio was increased to 16:1. This action was extremely astute and ensured that the new $2.50 and $5 coins would remain in circulation. These were the first widely circulated gold coins in US history. Design The new quarter eagle also saw a reduction in diameter from 20 millimeters to 18.2 millimeters and a reduction in weight from 4.37 grams to 4.18 grams. This new issue was designed by William Kneass and minted in Philadelphia only. The original 1834 dated Classic Head $2.50 gold coins come in two different varieties: the \\"Small Head‚Äù and the ‚ÄúBooby Head.‚Äù Collecting About uncirculated (AU) and mint state specimens may exhibit proof-like or semi proof-like surfaces. In general, a semi proof-like surface is somewhat reflective around the devices and the edge of the coin as well as around the portrait. Coins that have not been cleaned generally show an original patina manifested with various golden, orange colors and a thick \\"skin\\". Advanced collectors seek such specimens as opposed to cleaned, shiny examples. This series is highly collectible and are relatively inexpensive for an early gold U.S. coin. The astute collector/investor will seek original, problem-free examples and avoid damaged and inferior coins, regardless of the grade. It is also wise to pursue coins authenticated and graded by a leading third party grading service such as Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC) or Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS).

The main feature of the mosque is a stone believed to be stained with the blood of Husayn ibn ‚ÄòAlƒ´ by Muslims. Also located near this mosque on Mount Jawshan, is a mashad (shrine) known as Mashad al-Siqt ( - Place of miscarriage). As the prisoners of KarbalƒÅ were passing through Aleppo, one of wives of Husayn had a miscarriage. The still-born child was named Muhsin, and buried at this place. Historical accounts The prisoners of KarbalƒÅ were taken through many cities on their way to Damascus on orders from Yazƒ´d. As they were nearing Aleppo, a Christian monk who lived there could see light emanating from the head of Hussain, upwards to the sky. When the caravan stopped for rest, the monk approached them and asked if he could take the head for the night in exchange for 10,000 dirhams that he had with him. When they agreed, the monk took the head and placed it on a stone, whereon blood from the head fell onto it. In the morning he returned the head and professed Islam. This version of events can be found written on a plaque within the mosque itself. =Other versions of the story= * Other Shia narrations relate that when the prisoners of KarbalƒÅ were passing through Aleppo, the head of Husayn was placed upon a rock. When blood from the head fell onto the rock, more blood began gushing forth from the rock. * Sunni sources narrate that a shepherd had a dream wherein he was instructed to build a mosque in honour of Husayn, at the place where one of his goats had its foot sunken into rock. When the shepherd awoke and pulled the goat free from the rock, a river of water began to gush forth. =Artifacts of the mosque= File:Al-NuqtahMosque-Plaque.JPGA plaque within the mosque suggests that the site was converted from a monastery in 944 C.E.

Description The company is involved in electricity sub-transmission distribution and retail supply in the State of Gujarat or outside the State. Their mandate is to establish and use a power system network and to buy and sell electrical energy, and to collect information with an eye towards further system improvements. The Gujarat Electricity Industry (Re-Organization & Regulation) Act 2003 paved the way for comprehensive reform and restructuring of the State Electricity Board with an aim to restructure the Electricity Industry in a manner that will ensure the long term viability and sustainability of the power sector in the state. As a part of the reform process, the GEB was disaggregated into several autonomous entities. The Electricity Act 2003 introduced competition by way of open access in the transmission and distribution of electricity. The Act also provided for reorganization of the Electricity Boards through appropriate transfer schemes being formulated by the state governments. The Government of Gujarat reorganized the GEB functionally into a Generation Company, a Transmission Company and four Distribution Companies. Thereby Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Limited became functional on 1 April 2005.

It is published by the University of Minnesota Press and the editor-in-chief is Frenchy Lunning. Mechademia has also held an annual conference since 2001. Volumes Since 2006, ten volumes have been published. Each volume is dedicated to a collection of articles themed around a specific topic, such as shojo manga or anime and manga fandom. It is indexed in Project MUSE and JSTOR. After a break of three years, a new series of Mechademia volumes will be published beginning in 2018, the first being themed around childhood. The scope of Mechademia will be broadened to include all of Asia in its remit. Reception Steve Raiteri from Library Journal commends Mechademia as a \\"great first effort [...] bridg[ing] the gap between academics and fans.\\" Christophe Thouny, writing for Animation also thought the writing and tone was accessible by both academics and fans. Ed Sizemore from Comics Worth Reading criticizes the journal for its review and commentary section because they \\"read like summaries of the works (films and books) discussed with no actual critique of the work\\". However, Sizemore commends the journal's academic essay section. By contrast, Raiteri in Library Journal states that fans will find the Review and Commentary section \\"the most accessible\\" section of the journal. Kevin Gifford contrasts Mechademia with shallower works on anime, praising its \\"insightful essays and reviews\\" and detail, calling it \\"worthwhile reading for anyone hungry for intelligent writing\\" about anime. Tomo Hirai of the Nichi Bei Times described the first volume as \\"an informative and inspiring read for those curious beyond the skin of anime\\". A review of the second volume of Mechademia by Comics Worth Reading's Johanna Draper Carlson criticises the journal for its dry tone and \\"flat statements following after each other separated only by footnote numbers\\". A later review by Ed Sizemore recommends that Mechademia \\"should stop trying to develop a theme for each issue\\". Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood comments that the journal's \\"strong academic bent may put off some potential readers but give it a chance and peruse through the many varied topics\\". A later review by Scott Campbell commends the third volume of Mechademia as being \\"extremely insightful and thought provoking ... [about] anime, manga, and even the future of mankind\\". D. Harlan Wilson found the third volume to be \\"as accessible as it was provocative and enlightening\\". William McClain criticises the fourth volume for having articles that are \\"too restrictive\\" in focus, calling attention to the lack of discussion, in this volume, of how anime and manga culture has spread internationally. McClain also criticises the volume for not including enough visual aids for the general reader, but praises the Mechademia journal as a whole for its experimental approach. Ellen Grabiner feels that War/Time takes the approach that war has become a part of everyday life in post-war Japanese society, and praises the broad range of essays. Timothy Iles feels that the strength of Mechademia is that it provides \\"theoretically informed, historically grounded, jargon-free research that highlights first and foremost, not the self-serving virtuosity of the researcher, but the interpretive depth of the material under analysis.\\" Abstracting and indexing According to Ulrichsweb, Mechademia is abstracted and indexed in EBSCOhost, Gale, OCLC, and ProQuest.

The school was re-established as a comprehensive high school in the fall of 2019 after being closed in 1981 and comprehensively renovated in 2017-2019. During the years when the high school was not operating, the school buildings served as the North Seattle site for Cascadia Elementary, which offered the Highly Capable Cohort for academically highly gifted students, as well as the temporary homes for an 18-21 transition program and Lincoln Springs K-8, an alternative school program. The school re-opened with grades 9-10 and will add one grade per year until it reaches full capacity. Lincoln got their tenth graders by pulling students that had already started at other schools and forcing them to move. This caused a lot of controversy.  History  The school was built in 1906 in the Wallingford neighborhood to handle the growth in the area.Seattle's women teachers of the interwar years, Doris Hinson Pieroth, p 15, 2004, , accessed May 2009 It opened in 1907 and until 1971 was a three-year senior high school (grades 10-11-12, or sophomores/juniors/seniors), thereafter a four-year high school with grades 9 to 12. Lincoln High closed as a school in its own right after 74 years in 1981, and the building has been used several times since as a temporary holding location for other Seattle public schools as their own buildings underwent renovations / remodelings / rebuildings.Clark Humphrey, Vanishing Seattle, Arcadia Publishing, 2006. . p. 74. The Lincoln building housed Ballard High School in 1997‚Äì1999 while their current facility was being built, then the Latona Elementary School (1999‚Äì2000) It next housed Roosevelt High School in 2004‚Äì2006 and Garfield High School in 2006‚Äì2008 while their respective buildings were being renovated and upgraded. September 2009 to June 2010, Lincoln was the home to the Hamilton International Middle School while the Hamilton building was renovated and housed the recently split APP North middle school cohort for one year with Hamilton in 2009-2010. McDonald Elementary occupied the old Lincoln building during the 2010 and 2011 school years while their building was being renovated. Beginning in September 2011, the Lincoln structure became the home of the elementary Highly Capable Cohort, for students who live in the north end of the city (including Queen Anne and Magnolia.) In September 2012, the site was renamed APP at Lincoln (now Cascadia Elementary) for the interim. Cascadia Elementary and the north-end Highly Capable Cohort relocated to a newly constructed permanent location on the Wilson-Pacific campus in Fall of 2017. The old Lincoln High building will then undergo its own renovations and become an Attendance Area / zoned neighborhood comprehensive public high school once again in 2019. Like many Seattle schools, Lincoln was impacted by the Japanese American internment during World War II. Among those interned were the president of the boys' Lynx Club and girls' Triple L and the editor of the school newspaper, the Totem. After the war, Edison Technical School (later Seattle Central College) on Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood expanded and took over the facilities of Broadway High School, mainly to serve returning veterans. Broadway's regular high school student body were all transferred to Lincoln High.Paul Dorpat, Broadway High School, Seattle's first dedicated high school, opens in 1902, HistoryLink, 2001-04-15. Accessed 2009-05-25. For some years after the war, Lincoln also served the city of Shoreline, until that suburb built its own public high school. In 1948, during the national \\"Red Scare\\" controversy, the school was receiving letters warning of communists within the teaching staff. In 1949, during a tuberculosis outbreak, Lincoln sent teachers to Firland Sanatorium, and patients earned Lincoln diplomas. Lincoln High School was closed in 1981 due to declining enrollment. At the time the decision was made to shutter Lincoln, the Totem newspaper had been rated All-American status by the National Scholastic Press Association seven semesters in a row, and it had a notable arts magnet program and an excellent special education program. In the years after its closure, the Lincoln High building was used by various community and religious organizations, including the Wallingford Boys and Girls Club. In 1990, the derelict building was used as the filming location for the dystopian science fiction thriller Class of 1999.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099277/locations A 1993 plan would have renovated Lincoln as a new home for Hamilton Middle School, also setting aside part of the building for community services. Instead, it has become an interim location for various other schools over the next few decades.

The three western buildings (1907/1914-1920/1930), are co-joined and form a cohesive historic presence facing Interlake Avenue North. The two eastern buildings are stand-alone structures constructed in the late 1950s and opened 1959.

PaSCs are mediated by paracrine and autocrine stimuli and share similarities with the hepatic stellate cell. Pancreatic stellate cell activation and expression of matrix molecules constitute the complex process that induces pancreatic fibrosis. Synthesis, deposition, maturation and remodelling of the fibrous connective tissue can be protective, however when persistent it impedes regular pancreatic function. Structure PaSCs are located within the peri-acinar spaces of the pancreas and extrude long cytoplasmic processes that surround the base of the acinus. PaSCs compose 4% of the total cell mass in the gland Stellate cells derive their name from their star shape and are located in other organs such as the kidney and lungs. The cells are located in periductal and perivascular regions of the pancreas and contain vitamin A lipid droplets in their cytoplasm. PaSCs engage in disease pathogenesis by transforming from a quiescent state into an activated state, which is also known as a ‚Äúmyofibroblastic‚Äù state. PaSCs express the intermediate filament proteins desmin and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The expression of a diverse range of intermediate filament proteins enables the PaSC to harbour contractile abilities. Cellular extensions also enable the cells to sense their environment. Following inflammation or injury to the pancreas, quiescent PaSCs are activated to myofibroblast like cells, which expresses Œ±- smooth muscle actin. Several morphological changes take place including nuclear enlargement and increased growth of the endoplasmic reticulum network. The activated PaSCs then grow in number, migrate and secrete extracellular matrix components such as type I collagen, chemokines and cytokines. Function Quiescent PaSCs produce metalloproteinases such as MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 and their inhibitors, which assist in the turnover of the extracellular matrix (ECM). As a result of regulating ECM turnover, PaSCs are involved in the maintenance of the modelling of normal tissue. MMP-2 secreted by PaSCs, however, contributes to the development of pancreatic cancer. Fibrosis is a prominent feature of chronic pancreatitis and of the desmoplastic reaction linked with pancreatic cancer. While the pathogenesis of fibrosis remains elusive, the activation of stellate cells contribute to pancreatic fibrosis. Numerous soluble factors regulate PaSC activation, specifically IL-1, IL-6, TNF-Œ±, TGF-B1 and activin 1. The potential sources of these activating factors include platelets, macrophages, pancreatic acinar cells and endothelial cells in inflamed pancreas. PaSCs, individually, are also capable of synthesising cytokines such as TGF-Œ≤1, activin A and IL-1. The production of these factors indicates the presence of autocrine loops that perpetuate PaSC activation, promoting the development of fibrosis. Protein kinases such as MAPKs are primary mediators of activating signals initiated by the growth factors, angiotensin II and ethanol. Other signalling pathways regulating PaSC activation include PI3K, RHO kinase and TGF-Œ≤/SMAD-related pathways. Following activation, PaSCs migrate to areas of tissue damage and contract, phagocytose, and induce products that regulate the ECM through facilitating repair or by promoting fibrosis. The migration of PaSCs is modulated by Indian hedgehog (IHH), a peptide that is involved in pancreatic development, patterning and differentiation. Stellate cells express smoothened (Smo) and patched-1 (Ptch1) proteins, which are significant features of the hedgehog receptor system. Indian Hedgehog binding results in relocation of the transcriptional of transcription factor Gli-1 into the nucleus, inducing chemokinetic migration of PaSCs. Following activation, PaSCs have two fates. If there is sustained inflammation and injury, PaSC activation is perpetuated, resulting in the growth of pancreatic fibrosis. The activation of P2 receptors induces intracellular calcium signalling which mediates the fibrogenic function of activated stellate cells. However, if inflammation and injury is minor, PaSCs undergo an apoptotic fate and become quiescent, preventing the development of fibrosis. PaSCs also display ethanol inducible ADH activity. The possibility that pancreatic stellate cells may be exposed to ethanol and acetaldehyde during ethanol consumption is likely, as the pancreas metabolise ethanol to acetaldehyde through the oxidative pathway. PaSCs are activated upon exposure to ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde or to oxidant stress. Ethanol at clinically relevant concentrations causes Œ±-SMA expression and collagen production in PaSCs but produce a minimal effect on cell proliferation. Increased Œ±-SMA expression in stellate cells exposed to ethanol suggests activation and transformation of the cells to a myofibroblast phenotype. Incubation of PaSCs with ethanol in the presence of ADH inhibitor 4MP had inhibited the increase in collagen synthesis induced by ethanol. The conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde via ADH is a significant step in the ethanol induced activation of pancreatic stellate cells. Clinical significancePancreatitis= Pancreatitis is generally classified into two forms, acute and chronic. In acute pancreatitis, necroinflammation of the organ occurs, while chronic pancreatitis is distinguished by the progressive loss of endocrine and exocrine function. After pancreatic damage occurs, pathologic events such as interstitial oedema, necrosis of parenchymal cells, activation and proliferation of PaSCs take place. Inflammation and parenchymal necrosis precede PaSC activation. Activated PaSCs are located in areas of major necrosis and inflammation that harbour cytokines, growth factors and reactive oxygen species. Inflammatory processes are essential in contributing towards the activation of stellate cells. Therefore, both autocrine and paracrine mediators are involved pancreatic stellate cell activation. Copious amounts of Œ±- SMA-expressing cells are present in fibrotic areas of pancreatic tissue sections in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Œ±-SMA-expressing cells in fibrotic areas yield MRNA encoding pro-collagen Œ±1I, indicating that activated PaSCs are the predominant source of collagen in pancreatic fibrosis. Activated PaSCs and other myo-fibroblast cells contribute to the formation of a provisional matrix at the injury site, which enables cell proliferation, migration and the assembly of new parenchymal cells. In the majority of cases, activated PaSCs recede after the termination of the injurious agent, however repeated pancreatic damage can result in proliferation of PaSCs and eventual fibrosis. In humans, persistent injury to the pancreas is linked with chronic alcohol use, pancreatic duct obstruction and genetic. Chronic damage leads to the sustained activation of the active PaSC phenotype. Diminished production of MMPs by PaSCs also contributes to the fibrotic phenotype. Other factors may also drive the persistent activated state of PaSCs in the event of pancreatitis. For example, PaSCs express protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), which is cleaved by trypsin to become active. Active PAR-2 then instigates PaSC growth and collagen synthesis. =Cancer= Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are recognised by tumour desmoplasia, distinguished by an increase in the connective tissue that surrounds the neoplasm. Activated PaSCs in the tumour desmoplasia of human pancreatic cancers express Œ±-SMA and co- localise with MRNA encoding pro-collagen Œ±1I. These factors are significant contributors of the ECM proteins that compose the desmoplasia. A symbiotic relationship exists between pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and PaSCs, which leads to an overall increase in the rate of growth of the tumour. For example, culture supernatants from human pancreatic tumour cell lines induce PaSC proliferation and the production of ECM proteins. Pancreatic tumour cells stimulate the proliferation of PaSCs through the secretion of PDGF, and induce PaSC production of ECM proteins by secreting TGF-Œ≤1 and FGF-2. Pancreatic tumour cells and PaSCs operate in a symbiotic relationship in animal studies, however data from human pancreatic tumours is limited. Connective tissue growth factor is involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases and is predominantly found in PaSCs through regulation by TGF-Œ≤. Pancreatic cancer cells also stimulate proliferation, ECM production and TIMP1 production in PaSCs. The production of these factors is regulated by fibroblast growth factor 2, TGF-Œ≤1, and PDGF. In addition to cytokine-mediated mechanisms, PaSCs also produce a tumour supportive micro-environment through the production of matri-cellular proteins. The up regulation of matri-cellular proteins such as galectin-1, and tenascin-C is present in the stromal tissues of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Matricellular proteins induce proliferation, migration and production of cytokines, ECM and angiogenic responses in PaSCs, which in turn induce cancer cell proliferation. Matri-cellular proteins may therefore directly contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer through stimulating cancer cell activity. The matricellular protein also facilitates a tumour supportive microenvironment through sustained fibrogenic stellate cell activity. A hypoxic environment in tumours influences pancreatic cancer progression. An oxygen deficient environment concomitantly exists not only in cancer cells but also in surrounding pancreatic stellate cells. The cellular response to hypoxia is mediated by the transcription factor HIF-1, which is a heterodimer protein composed of Œ± and Œ≤ subunits. Hypoxia also stimulates nuclear expression of HIF-1Œ± followed by the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PaSCs. The induction of HIF-Œ± indicates that PaSCs serves as oxygen sensing cells within the pancreas. PaSCs, endothelial cells and other cells involved in the development of pancreatic fibrosis therefore function in coordination with a low oxygen microenvironment. =Ongoing research= Treatment of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer aims to target the major mechanisms involved in both their activation and proliferation. For example, inhibition of the receptors PDGF, TGF-Œ≤ and angiotensin II in addition to suppression of the intracellular signalling pathways downstream of these receptors is likely to be of therapeutic benefit. In vitro experiments indicate that PaSCs influence the activation and proliferation process for mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, in particular ERK1/2, p38 kinase and JNK. The inhibition of the majority of MAPK pathways leads to a reduction in the activation and proliferation of PaSCs. Anti-fibrosis treatment strategies targeting PaSCs include inhibition of the activation of quiescent PaSCs. Agents such as angiotensin receptor blockers, serine protease inhibitors and adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase inhibit the activation and function of PaSCs. Camostat mesilate, an oral protease inhibitor, that is used to treat patients with chronic pancreatitis inhibited the proliferation and MCP-1 production in PaSCs in vitro. The success and effect of anti-fibrosis therapies in pancreatic cancer treatment, however, remains unclear. Rat PaSCs express COX-2 when stimulated with TGF beta 1 (TGF-Œ≤1) and other cytokines. pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 and inhibition of TGF-Œ≤1 signalling pathway decreases the expression of COX-2, Œ±-SMA and collagen I, indicating that COX-2 may be a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. Strategies aimed at inducing PaSC transformation from an activated to a quiescent state and inducing PaSC apoptosis may also be used to treat pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. For example, the administration of vitamin A induces culture activated rat PaSCs to trans-differentiate to a quiescent state, preventing the progression of pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis. History While the discovery of hepatic stellate cells is attributed to Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer in 1876, who had termed them ‚Äústellate cells‚Äù, the original discovery is attributed to more than one research group. The first documented observations of PaSCs were recorded by Watari et al. in 1982. Watari observed the pancreas of vitamin A primed mice using fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Cells displaying fading blue-green fluorescence typical of vitamin A in the periacinar region of pancreas was observed. Watari likened these cells to hepatic stellate cells. The publication of two seminal research papers in 1998 outlining the isolation of these cells provided an in vitro method by which researchers may characterise PaSCs in both health and pathology.

A syllogism is a three- proposition argument consisting of a major premise stating some universal truth, a minor premise stating some particular truth, and a conclusion derived from these two premises.Virtue Ethics info centre Retrieved on May 16, 2009 The practical syllogism is a form of practical reasoning in syllogistic form, the conclusion of which is an action. An example might be that the major premise food cures hunger and the minor premise I am hungry leads to the practical conclusion of my eating food. Note that the conclusion here is not a third proposition, like I will eat, or the occurrence of an utterance like \\"I will eat,\\" but is simply the act of eating. For this reason, practical syllogisms are only called syllogisms analogically. Since they do not consist of at least three propositions, they are not syllogisms properly speaking. =Nicomachean Ethics= The theoretical reason gives no commands. The practical reason operates in the form of a practical syllogism, whose conclusion is epitactic or imperative. Aristotle describes this syllogism as follows: All deliberate action is resolvable into a major and minor premise, from which the given action logically issues. The major premise is a general conception or moral maxim; the minor premise is a particular instance: and the conclusion is an action involved in subsuming the particular instance under the general conception or law. The conclusion is not an abstraction, as in the case of a theoretical syllogism, but consists in an action and is jussive, e.g. > Major premise: All men should take exercise; > Minor premise: I am a man; > Conclusion: I should take exercise; > >> or, > Major premise: Good students take notes; > Minor premise: I want to be a good student; > Conclusion: I should take notes. Our English phrase 'acting on principle' is, as Sir Alexander Grant pointed out, the equivalent of Aristotle's practical syllogism. The practical syllogism operates in the sphere of conduct, of choice and the variable the sphere of necessary truth as is the case with the speculative reason, whose aim is demonstrable truth, whereas the aim of the practical reason is the good, the prudent, the desirable. The content of the conclusion as knowledge is the essential matter for the former; the content of the conclusion as motive is the essential matter for the latter. The main business of the former is with the understanding, of the latter, with the will; the principle of ' sufficient reason' is related to the understanding as the principle of ' final cause' or motive is related to the will. In the practical syllogism obligation is vested in the conclusion, and the particular or minor premise is more cogent than the major, i.e. it is not the general law, but the application of the general law to a particular person, that stimulates to action. The virtue characteristic of the practical reason is prudence or practical insight. \\"Prudence is neither a science nor an art; it cannot be a science because the sphere of action is that which is variable; it cannot be an art, for production is generically different from action;\\" and although Aristotle rejects the Socratic doctrine that virtue is knowledge (the sphere of moral life is pleasure and pain, rather than knowledge), he goes on to say that the \\"presence of the single virtue of prudence implies the presence of all the moral virtues. Prudence, however, is not itself the whole of moral virtue: \\"moral virtue makes us desire the end, while prudence makes us adopt the right means to the end.\\" Although men act on general principles and laws, they do not perform general acts; all acts are particular; and so Aristotle, in describing the practical reason and its characteristic moral quality of prudence, further differentiates it from the theoretic reason by saying it is concerned immediately with particulars.Aristotle's Psychology: A Treatise on the Principle of Life (De Anima and Parva Naturalia) by William Alexander Hammond (1861-1938), published in 1902 and out of copyright References Category:Aristotle Category:Reasoning ","title":"Practical syllogism"},{"id":"22820661","text":"Alfort may refer to: *√âcole nationale v√©t√©rinaire d'Alfort, school of veterinary medicine in Val-de-Marne, √éle-de-France, France **Jardin botanique de l'√âcole nationale v√©t√©rinaire d'Alfort, botanical garden operated by the √âcole Nationale V√©t√©rinaire **Mus√©e Fragonard d'Alfort, museum of anatomical oddities located at within the √âcole Nationale V√©t√©rinaire *Alfort Smith (1846‚Äì1908), English cricketer *Maisons-Alfort, commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, France ","title":"Alfort"},{"id":"22820672","text":"Ingvald may refer to: *Hans Ingvald Hansen Ratvik (1883‚Äì1966), Norwegian politician for the Liberal Party *Ingvald Anker Andersen (born 1866), Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party *Ingvald Bjerke (1907‚Äì1990), Norwegian boxer who competed in the 1928 Summer Olympics *Ingvald Eriksen (1884‚Äì1961), Danish gymnast who competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics *Ingvald Godal (born 1934), Norwegian politician for the Centre Party and later the Conservative Party *Ingvald Haugen (1894‚Äì1958), Norwegian labour union leader and politician for the Labour Party *Ingvald Huseklepp (born 1949), former Norwegian footballer who played four seasons for SK Brann *Ingvald Johan Ulveseth (born 1924), Norwegian politician for the Labour Party *Ingvald Johannes Jaklin (1896‚Äì1966), Norwegian politician for the Labour Party *Ingvald Svins√•s-Lo (1897‚Äì1980), Norwegian politician for the Liberal Party *Ingvald T√∏ndel (1887‚Äì1952), Norwegian politician for the Christian Democratic Party ","title":"Ingvald"},{"id":"22820699","text":"Kronig or Kr√∂nig may refer to: People: *Alfred Kronig (born 1928), Swiss cross country skier who competed in the 1950s *August Karl Kr√∂nig (1822‚Äì1879), German chemist and physicist *Ralph Kronig (1904‚Äì1995), German-American physicist noted for the discovery of particle spin and his theory of x-ray absorption spectroscopy Mathematics and Science: *Coster Kronig transition, special case of the Auger process in which the vacancy is filled by an electron from a higher subshell of the same shell *Kramers‚ÄìKronig relations, mathematical properties connecting real and imaginary parts of any complex function which is analytic in the upper half plane See also *K√∂nig (disambiguation) ","title":"Kronig"},{"id":"22820700","text":"Andreas Vgenopoulos (10 December 1953 ‚àí 5 Œùovember 2016) was the chairman of Marfin Investment Group and was a major shareholder of Panathinaikos FC.

Life and career Although he was born into a well-known family, times were difficult and he had to leave school at 14. The family suffered through a number of disasters and, as the oldest son, Wu left Guangdong to seek work in Hong Kong to help support his family in the 1920s. In 1933, he and some friends established \\"Wing Lung Money Exchange\\" (later Wing Lung Bank) in Central, Hong Kong.About Dr. Wu Yee Sun In later years contributions towards setting up or improving hospitals, clinics, universities and schools in Mainland China and Hong Kong were made in the name of Wu or his father.Naming Ceremony of the Dr. Wu Yee Sun Lecture TheatreWu Yee Sun College On 11 May 2005, Dr. Wu died in Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital at the age of 105. A minor planet was discovered at the Purple Mountain Observatory at Nanking, China in 1979. Provisionally designated as 1979 XO, in 1998 this 3,570th known asteroid was named 3570 Wuyeesun after Wu.Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) Penjing Wu's father, Wu York-Yu (), and grandfather, Wu Yee-Hong (), were both practitioners of the \\"grow and clip\\" method of training trees into artistic forms (penjing), which came to be known as the \\"Lingnan School\\". In 1967 Wu and his friends established the Man Lung (\\"scholar-farmer\\") Garden as a place to meet, discuss, study, and exhibit. Two years later, he published and distributed Man Lung Garden Artistic Pot Plants, the definitive book on Chinese penjing of the Lingnan style, \\"fearing that the Chinese art of training pot plants might [otherwise] someday be lost.\\" In 1974 an enlarged edition of the book came out as Man Lung Artistic Pot Plants with the addition of the history and evolution of artistic pot plants, notes from presentations, and over 100 additional photographs. Some 10,000 copies were donated to leading libraries, universities, and bonsai lovers all over the world to commemorate Wu's retirement from the chairmanship of Wing Lung Bank. Over the years, Wu's personal collection grew to nearly 400 specimens of penjing. Many of these he donated to public institutions in Europe and North America, including the Seventh University of Paris (France, five trees in c.1982), Montreal Botanical Garden (Canada, thirty trees in 1985, over twenty more in 1987), and the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in Vancouver (Canada). Other trees have gone to the Botanical Park of the Nanjing Institute of the Chinese Academy of Science, the Hong Kong Baptist College (2000) and the Former Government House, Hong Kong. All of these penjing exhibitions are open to the public. (In the 1970s Wu had offered the U.S. fifty of his penjing on the condition that the usual importation procedure of bare-rooting and fumigation be forgone, as this would have been fatal to these very old trees. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture refused to make an exception to its rule, although the Bicentennial trees from Japan had been excepted earlier. The Japanese trees harbored twenty-three identifiable pests. After a few years of negotiation, the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada did issue a special phytosanitary certificate for Wu's trees, although two of his Japanese black pines could not be imported. The U.S received 24 of Wu's trees in 1986 to begin a two-year quarantine before being exhibited. The Wu Chinese Garden Pavilion at the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum on the grounds of the U.S. National Arboretum was opened in 1996.) Wu occasionally hosted individuals and groups from around the world who travelled to see his garden on the beautifully raised terrace fronting his house, which itself was built on a steep mountainside overlooking Hong Kong public Man Lung Garden was opened at Hong Kong Baptist University in the year 2000. A website for the garden (http://www.manlungpenjing.org) was set up for discussion and exchange of information. Wu instructed his son Norman Po-Man (one of thirteen children) to take color photographs and publish a hardcover souvenir volume; this comprehensive collection of penjing in full color called Man Lung Penjing was published in 2002, covering over seventy years of study and is a record of Wu's creative style.Bonsai Book of Days, May 11-20  See also  *Wu Yee Sun College References Category:1900 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Hong Kong centenarians Category:Hong Kong businesspeople Category:Hong Kong billionaires Category:People from Foshan Category:Chinese centenarians Category:Hong Kong bankers Category:Businesspeople from Guangdong Category:Billionaires from Guangdong Category:20th-century businesspeople ","title":"Wu Yee-sun"},{"id":"22820750","text":"The G√≥mez Residence () is a historic house in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico.

The 350 cc flat twin engine in the Douglas Mark III was based on a Second World War electricity generator. As well as the 1948-9 Douglas Mark III, Douglas also produced a Mark III \\"De Luxe\\", a Mark III Sports, and a rigid-framed motorcycle trials Competition version. History During the Second World War the Bristol-based Douglas motorcycle company produced stationary generator engines using their 348 cc overhead valve flat twin. One of these Douglas generators was used at Winston Churchill's wartime summit meeting held next to the Sphinx in Giza. By the end of the war in 1945, Douglas restarted motorcycle production ‚Äì much to the surprise of the industry, as it was generally expected that the war had led to other interests, with the company being taken over by Aero Engines Ltd, so there were not many engineering staff left for the development of new motorcycles. The Douglas T35 used the same flat-twin 350 cc as the generator, mounted in a duplex fame with torsion bar rear suspension. The T35 was an unexpected export success; 1947 factory records show them being exported to Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, Santiago, and Russia. Development In 1948, the company developed a series of motorcycles based on the T35. Designed by George Halliday, these featured Douglas \\"Radialraulic\\" forks with the front wheel spindle carried on short leading links pivoted at the rear of the fork stanchions ‚Äì with springs and a damping mechanism inside the stanchions. Although the frame and suspension were innovative, the engine was essentially a generator, designed to run for long periods at a steady speed and it did not cope well with the varying engine speeds of motorcycling. There was also a tendency to sideways shaking at low engine speeds which was a feature of the horizontally opposed engine. Douglas hired former Sunbeam motorcycles designer Erling Poppe as Technical Director, Freddie Dixon as their specialist engine tuner and Walter Moore (who designed the Norton CS1) as Works Superintendent. The result was the 1949 Douglas Mark III, which had improved performance through an uprated cylinder head, combustion chambers, and pistons. Douglas also produced a Mark III \\"De Luxe\\", a Mark III Sports, and a rigid-framed motorcycle trials Competition version with high-level exhausts and a less deeply valanced front mudguard. There never was a Douglas Mark II, and the Mark IV was short-lived, so the end of the line of development was the Mark V produced between 1951 and 1954, when it was replaced by the Douglas Dragonfly. Competition success Douglas Mark III Competition version Motorcycle trials rider David Tye worked for Douglas as a sales rep, competing at weekends in the factory trials team. In 1950, he won the Nevis Trophy and the Special First Class Award in the demanding Scottish Six Days Trial riding the Douglas Mark III Competition model. The low centre of mass of the flat twin was useful for trials control but it did have a clearance problem over the rough ground. Occasionally one of the carburettors would be knocked off, but the team developed a \\"quick change\\" replacement and always kept spares ready. Works rider Don Chapman on the Douglas Mark III Sports gave Douglas their only major successes in motorcycle racing by winning at the Silverstone Circuit in 1950. Securing a win by 19 seconds, Chapman was awarded the Motor Cycling magazine prize for \\"most meritorious\\" performance in the Clubmans races.

He was deeply influenced by the progressive intellectual currents of the Bengal Renaissance. He was among the few Assamese publicists who had formally entered the Brahmo Samaj. All his life he propagated its liberal ideas through his writings. Biography Barua completed his college education from Presidency College, Calcutta and became an assistant commissioner under the colonial government. He remained in the job for the next 30 years. After his first wife's death, his 1879 marriage with a Brahman widow, Bishnupriya Devi, created a sensation in the orthodox society of Assam. Bishnupriya and their daughter Swarnalata Barua were encouraged by him to write and publish their work in magazines and newspapers. Barua advocated the cause of women's education and took the bold step of sending his daughter Swarnalata Devi to a boarding school in Calcutta when he was working in the small town of Nagaon in Assam as an Extra Assistant Commissioner. His son Jnanadabhiram Barua went on to become a well-known lawyer and leader of the Indian National Congress. Gunabhiram wrote a number of tracts for children, published under the heading Lara Bandhu (Friend of Boys) in Arunodoi, the first Assamese newspaper, published by American missionaries. Lara Bondhu was also named as the first children's magazine in Assamese literature. Gunabhiram Barua was a cousin of Anandaram Dhekial Phukan. In fact, Gunabhiram grew up under Anandaram's tutelage, as his parents died when he was a child. Literary works The first social drama in Assamese - Ramnabami-Natak - was written by Gunabhiram in 1857 and published as a book in 1870. The play tells the tragic story of a young widow, Nabami, and her lover, Ram, both of whom were compelled to commit suicide because of social disapproval of their relationship. Gunabhiram is also remembered as a historian and biographer. In 1887 he published an Assam Buranji, which went on to become a school textbook. He also wrote regularly on issues such as women's education and marriage reforms. Kathin Shobdor Rohasyha Bakhya is a humorous work by Barua, published posthumously in 1912. . Gunabhiram Barua published and edited the short-lived but hugely influential literary journal Assam-Bandhu(1885-1886). Famous conservative intellectuals such as Ratneshwar Mahanta and Rudraram Doloi also contributed to its pages. Trivia Hindi film actor Sharmila Tagore is the granddaughter of Gunabhiram's son Jnanadabhiram on her maternal side.

Career Before moving to Arizona in 1988, he was an administrator, researcher, and consultant with the California court system where he served as Court Management Consultant for the National Center for State Courts, California Supreme Court, Los Angeles Municipal Court, Sacramento Municipal Court and San Diego Superior Court from 1976 through 1986. Newman served three terms as an Arizona state representative, representing Santa Cruz, Greenlee, Cochise, and Graham counties from 1993-1998.http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=3101 Subsequently, he was elected to as a Cochise County Supervisor while living in Bisbee, Arizona.

He lost re-election to the post in 2012. = 2008 Corporation Commission Race = Paul Newman's name on the campaign sign for the Solar Team During Newman's first campaign for Corporation Commission in 2008, he and 3 other Democrats advanced past the primary election. Along with Sam George and Sandra Kennedy, Newman campaigned on bringing renewable solar energy to Arizona. Newman was endorsed by The Arizona Republic and the Tucson Citizen and by multiple elected officials such as Congressmen Harry Mitchell and Ed Pastor. Newman and Kennedy ran as clean candidates under Arizona's Clean Elections system while George ran a traditional campaign. Under Arizona's Clean Elections system, the state is required to match funds raised by traditionally funded candidates up to a certain amount. The three were dubbed The Solar Team. George contributed nearly half a million dollars of his own money and pooled this money with Newman's and Kennedy's Clean Election funds. With this strategy, the Solar Team was able to run numerous television ads and post signs all over the state of Arizona. This brought more attention than normally paid to the Corporation Commission race. Although George donated much of his own money, only Newman and Kennedy won in the General Election.http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2009/01/05/daily14.html =Later campaigns= Newman lost re-election to the commission in 2012.

The Lord President was subject to the chief governor, but had full authority within the province, extending to civil, criminal and church legal matters, the imposition of martial law, official appointments, and command of military forces.Theodore William Moody, F. X. Martin, William E Vaughan, F. J. Byrne, J R Hill, Art Cosgrove, D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, A New history of Ireland (1984), p. 534. Some appointments to military governor of Munster were not accompanied by the status of President. The width of his powers led to frequent clashes with the longer established courts, and in 1622 he was warned sharply not to \\"intermeddle\\" with cases which were properly the business of those courts. He was assisted by a Council whose members included the Chief Justice of Munster, another justice and the Attorney General for the Province. By 1620 his council was permanently based in Limerick. The post was suppressed in 1672. Early history The position was created at the suggestion of Sir Henry Sidney in the late 1560s. Filling it proved troublesome initially, since the nomination in 1566 of Warham St Leger failed to get royal approval. John Pollard turned down Sidney's offer, ultimately, for financial reasons. Later in 1569 Sir Edward Fitton accepted the position of Lord President of Connaught.Penry Williams, The Later Tudors: England, 1547‚Äì1603 (1998), p. 269. The first President to be appointed was Sir John Perrot (1568) but it took several years for him to arrive in Munster.

Structurally innovative, only one was built. Development The Vickers Type 207 was often known as the Vickers M.1/30, for it was built to Air Ministry specification for a carrier-based torpedo bomber to replace the Blackburn Ripon. The Air Ministry paid Vickers for a single prototype; its competitors were the Blackburn M.1/30 and the Handley Page H.P.46. Like Blackburn, Vickers chose the 825 hp (615 kW) Rolls Royce H10 engine, later called the Buzzard IIIMS, a liquid cooled V-12 to power their aircraft. The Type 207 was a single-bay biplane, without sweep or stagger and with wings of almost equal span. The upper wing carried Handley Page slots and Frise ailerons; the lower wing alone had dihedral. Both wings used the relatively thick and still novel Raf34 airfoil section; they folded for storage. The rudder was balanced and the braced tailplane carried aerodynamic servo-assisted elevators operated via trailing edge tabs. Barnes Wallis had recently been appointed chief structural engineer for Vickers aircraft and he brought to the Type 207 new methods of duralumin construction in both wings and fuselage from his previous work on airships. Typically, these structures were complicated but light. The aircraft was fabric-covered throughout. The upper wing was well above the fuselage, braced to it by two pairs of V-form struts on either side; two single struts from the same points on the upper fuselage braced each lower wing. The pilot sat below the wing leading edge and the observer, equipped with a Lewis gun, sat well aft. The split-axle undercarriage allowed torpedo dropping from under the aircraft and was fitted with wheel brakes as its shipborne role required, together with an arrestor hook and tailwheel. The Buzzard's underslung radiator was positioned between the forward undercarriage legs. The Type 207 flew for the first time on 11 January 1933, with Mutt Summers at the controls. The only notable modification was the addition of 2o of dihedral to the previously flat upper wing.

He was also appointed US Economic Stabilizer in the last months of World War II, though Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, soon eliminated this potentially powerful position. Davis also helped draft the National Labor Relations Act (the Wagner Act) of 1935, which gave labor unions the right to organize.Richard Magat, Unlikely Partners: Philanthropic Foundations and the Labor Movement (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1999), p. 68 Early life Born and raised in Bangor, Maine, Davis was the brother of Pulitzer Prize winning playwright Owen Davis. He graduated from Bangor High School and received a law degree from George Washington University in 1901. His first job was in the U.S. Patent Office, but he soon left to become a successful New York patent attorney. He returned to government service briefly in World War I, working in the War Department.Benjamin F. Shearer, Home Front Heroes (Greenwood Press, 2007), p. 213 New Deal and wartime service When Franklin Roosevelt formed the National Recovery Administration (NRA) early in the New Deal, Davis was tapped as Deputy Administrator. The NRA was declared unconstitutional and disbanded in 1937, and Davis returned to New York to head the state's Labor Mediation Board. He developed such a good reputation as a mediator between management and labor that Roosevelt brought him back to Washington in 1941 to join (and soon chair) the National Defense Mediation Board (NDMB), which became the War Labor Board (WLB) in early 1942. Davis ran the Board until March 1945, when, seeing the end of the war in sight, Roosevelt named him Director of Economic Stabilization, to manage the return to a peace-time economy.Shearer, p. 213 The NDMB-WLB Chairmanship was an important yet difficult position, Davis having to walk the line between management and organized labor. Though generally trusted by both sides, his main job was to strongly discourage strikes for the duration of the war. A frequent figure in news articles of the 1940s, Davis' success was often ascribed to his personality and appearance. The news magazine Time described him variously as \\"rumple-haired\\", \\"dry-humored\\", \\"shaggy\\", \\"humane\\", \\"tendacious\\", \\"chunky\\", and \\"grizzled\\", but above-all patient and fair- minded.Time, June 28, 1943; Nov. 20, 1944, Mar. 19, 1945 A 1941 Time article praised his \\" record' of \\"peacably unraveling the most tangled wrangle\\", and declared him \\"one of the brightest hopes of the US had in the murky field of industrial disputes.\\"Time, December 1, 1941 From Roosevelt to Truman While Roosevelt seemed to set up Davis as the 'czar' of post-war recovery by appointing him Economic Stabilizer, Harry Truman fired him within months of taking office, and eliminated his potentially powerful role. Davis became an open critic of Truman's labor policies, but the two must have reached some degree of accommodation by 1949, when Truman appointed Davis to head the Atomic Energy Commission's Labor Relations Panel.Time, May 9, 1949 Other activities Davis was involved with progressive New York philanthropic and cultural organizations throughout his career. While on the Labor Committee of Edward A. Filene's Twentieth Century Fund in the early 1930s, he worked closely with the office of Sen. Robert F. Wagner to craft the National Labor Relations Act.

It occurs from Tathra, New South Wales to Imbil in southeastern Queensland, and is very common at Dorrigo National Park and other rainforest walks in eastern Australia. The habitat of the giant stinging tree is subtropical, warm temperate or littoral rainforest, particularly in disturbed areas, previously flattened by storms or cyclones.  Sting  The hairs of the tree exist on all aerial parts, and can cause a severe reaction when in contact with human skin, so it is a hazard to livestock, travelers and campers. Even so, the tree is an important member of the ecosystems of eastern Australian forests. The sting is considered more severe than Dendrocnide photinophylla (shining-leaved stinging tree), but not as severe as Dendrocnide moroides (gympie stinger). Researchers discovered that the tree delivers neurotoxin proteins, which they named gympietides, similar to toxins found in spiders and cone snails. It was postulated that the long-term pain from the gympietides may be due to permanent changes in the sodium channels in the sensory neurons. Leaf surface of giant stinging tree showing the stinging hairs. Minor stings can last for an hour or two. However, severe stinging can last for months. First aid for the sting is to apply wax hair-removal strips and then yank them off to remove the hairs.Hurley M (2000) Foliage Attributes and Growth Dynamics of Stinging Trees (Dendrocnide spp.) in northern Australian upland tropical rainforest: implications for herbivores. Australian Journal of Botany, 48:191-201. Dendrocnide stings have been known to kill dogs and horses that have brushed against them. It was found that even heavy welding gloves did not protect researchers from stings while studying the tree.  Description  Dendrocnide excelsa is a medium to large-sized tree with a buttressed base, sometimes over 40 metres tall and in excess of 6 metres wide at the butt. The trunk can be fluted or flanged. The outer bark is grey and smooth, with minor corky markings. The trunk and buttresses are shaped in even curves. The leaves are alternate and toothed, heart-shaped and very large in positions of shade, exceeding 30 cm in length and a similar width. The sun leaves are smaller. The leaves are replete with stinging hairs, and are eaten by various insects and mammals, such as the chrysomelid beetle. Flowers appear from November to April, forming in short panicles. The fruit is a purple or blackish nut, maturing from March to August. The flesh is edible, but the danger of stinging hairs precludes human consumption. The fruit is eaten by many rainforest birds, including the regent bowerbird and the green catbird.  Uses  Indigenous Australians used the fibres to make nets and lines.

Sortal terms are considered a species of general term that are classified within the grammatical category of common or count nouns or count noun phrases. This is based on the claim that a perceptual link allows perceptual demonstrative thought if it enables sortal classification.  Overview  The simplest property of a sortal is that it can be counted, i.e., can take numbers as modifiers. It can also be used with a definite or indefinite article. For example, \\"pea\\" is a sortal in the sentence \\"I want two peas\\", whereas \\"water\\" is not a sortal in the sentence \\"I want water\\". It cannot be applied to an object that does not permit arbitrary division. Countability is not the only criterion. Thus \\"red thing\\" in the sentence \\"There are two red things on the shelf\\" is not treated as a sortal by some philosophers who use the term. There is disagreement about the exact definition of the term as well as whether it is applied to linguistic things (such as predicates or words), abstract entities (such as properties), or psychological entities (such as concepts). Differing perspectives According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, the sortal/nonsortal distinction can be characterized in at least six different ways. It is said that a sortal: *gives a criterion for counting the items of that kind *gives a criterion of identity and non-identity among items of that kind *gives a criterion for the continued existence of an item of that kind *answers the question \\"what is it?\\" for things of that kind *specifies the essence of things of that kind *does not apply to parts of things of that kind History While some philosophers have argued that the notion of a sortal is similar to that of the idea of a \\"secondary substance\\" in Aristotle, the first actual use of the term 'sortal' did not appear until John Locke in his 1690 Essay Concerning Human Understanding: Gottlob Frege is also named as an antecedent to the present debate over sortals. Frege pointed out that in counting things, we need to know what kind of thing it is that we are counting; that is, there needs to be a \\"criterion of identity\\". In contemporary philosophy, sortals make a return with the work of P. F. Strawson, W. V. O. Quine, Peter Geach, and David Wiggins. Strawson holds that sortals are universals, Quine thinks they are predicates, and Wiggins sees them as concepts. Geach did not use the exact term \\"sortal\\"; however, his idea of the \\"substantival expression\\" is identical or nearly so to that of \\"sortal\\". According to him, identity is relative in a sortal concept, which he described as one that answers the question \\"Same what?\\". See also * Taxonomy (general) References * Further reading * E. J.

When she married, rather than dropping her maiden name she added her husband's surname Ames on to the end of her name, and called herself variously 'Grace Greenwood', 'Grace Ames', or (as she has become known) 'Grace Greenwood Ames'. Later in life she became known as 'Grace Crampton'.  Biography  Grace Greenwood was born in Brooklyn, New York on January 15, 1905 to Walter Greenwood and Kathryn Boyland. Her father was a painter and her younger sister Marion Greenwood was also an artist. Ames studied at Art Students League of New York, alongside her sister. She went on to study art in Italy in the 1920s. In 1929, both of the Greenwood sisters participated in the famed Bohemian event, the Maverick Festival (1915‚Äì1931) at the Maverick Art Colony in Woodstock, New York. Between 1933 to 1936, Ames worked on five murals with her sister Marion, serving as her painting assistant while in Mexico. One of the murals was at the Aberlardo L. Rodr√≠guez market in the historic center of Mexico City and the Museo Regional Michoacano, commissioned by the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol√°s de Hidalgo in Morelia, Mexico. Grace Ames painted murals together with Diego Rivera, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Pablo O'Higgins, Leopoldo M√©ndez, and other well-known Mexican \\"muralista\\". Her work includes the oil on canvas murals titled Progress of Power in the Lexington, Tennessee post office, commissioned by the Treasury Section of Fine Arts, and completed in 1940. Later in life Ames eventually decided not to follow an art career, instead she moved to Woodstock, New York and went by the name Grace Crampton. Ames work is found in public art collections including the National Gallery of Art, amongst others.

The two men sit \\"on a park bench like bookends,\\" and ponder how strange it feels to be nearing the end of their lifetime. In \\"Old Friends,\\" the title generally conveys the introduction or ending of sections, and the song builds upon a \\"rather loose formal structure\\" that at first includes an acoustic guitar and soft mood. An additional element is introduced midway through the track: an orchestral arrangement conducted by Jimmie Haskell, dominated by strings and glockenspiel notes.

(MTI) that implemented the MIPS III instruction set architecture (ISA). It was also known as the VRX during development. The microprocessor was licensed to NEC, and the company fabricated and marketed it as the VR4200. The first VR4200, an 80 MHz part, was introduced in 1993. A faster 100 MHz part became available in 1994. The R4200 was developed specifically for low-power Windows NT computers such as personal computers and laptops. MTI claimed the microprocessor's integer performance was greater than that of a high-end Intel i486 and 80% of a P5-variant Pentium microprocessor. The R4200 ultimately did not see any use in personal computers and was repositioned as an embedded microprocessor that competed with the R4600. The R4300i variant was used in the widely popular Nintendo 64 video game console. Description The R4200 is a scalar design with a five-stage classic RISC pipeline. A notable feature is the use of the integer datapath for performing arithmetic operations on the mantissa portion of a floating point number. A separate datapath was used for the exponent. This scheme reduced cost by reducing the number of transistors, the size of the chip, and power consumption. It also impacted floating point performance negatively, but the R4200's intended applications did not require high floating point performance. The R4200 has a 16 KB instruction cache and an 8 KB data cache. Both caches are direct-mapped. The instruction cache has a 32-byte line size, whereas the data cache has 16-byte line size. The data cache uses the write-back write protocol. The R4200 has a 32-entry translation lookaside buffer (TLB) for data, and a 4-entry TLB for instructions. A 33-bit physical address is supported. The system bus is 64 bits wide and operates at half the internal clock frequency. The R4200 contained 1.3 million transistors and had an area of 81 mm2. NEC fabricated the R4200 in a 600 nm CMOS process with three levels of interconnect. It was packaged in a 179-pin ceramic pin grid array that was compatible with the R4x00PC and R4600, or a 208-pin plastic quad flat pack (PQFP). It used a 3.3 V power supply, dissipating 1.8 W typically and a maximum of 2 W at 80 MHz. R4300i The R4300i is a derivative of the R4200 designed by MTI for embedded applications announced on 17 April 1995. It differs from the R4200 by featuring an improved integer multiplier with a lower latency and a cut-down 32-bit system bus for reduced cost. The chip had an area of 45 mm2 and was fabricated in a 350 nm process. It was packaged in a 120-pin PQFP. It uses a 3.3 V power supply and dissipates 1.8 W at 100 MHz and 2.2 W at 133 MHz. The R4300i was licensed to NEC and Toshiba, and was marketed by those companies as the VR4300 or TX4300, respectively. Both companies offered 100 and 133 MHz versions. A derivative of the VR4300 was developed by NEC for the Nintendo 64 game console, clocked at 93.75 MHz and labeled NUS-CPU. Although development boards for the Nintendo 64 used stock NEC VR4300 CPUs, the final CPU has been found to be not pin- compatible. This singular use of a MIPS implementation produced significant royalties for MTI, sales for NEC, and made MIPS the highest volume mixed 32/64-bit RISC ISA in 1997. NEC produced two other derivatives of the R4300 for the general embedded market, the VR4305 and VR4310, announced on 20 January 1998. The VR4310 was available at 100, 133 or 167 MHz. It was manufactured in a 250 nm process and packaged in a 120-pin PQFP. References * \\"MIPS, NEC will launch 64-bit device\\". (17 April 1995).

Gockel was born in R√∂nsahl, a small town in North Rhine-Westphalia. After completing his schooling in Bochum, he began an apprenticeship as a machinist. He soon left the apprenticeship to qualify as an able bodied seaman, with which he traveled the world (1963‚Äì1969). It was during this time that he began his interest in archaeology. Gockel served in the German Bundeswehr (1969‚Äì1975), eventually becoming a helicopter pilot. In 1975, he completed his university qualifying examination and began his studies of archaeology in Cologne, Bonn and G√∂ttingen, with a concentration on the near east, Assyriology and classical archaeology. He completed his M.A. in 1979 with a thesis on sculpture in Mesopotamia and Elam from the early Sumerian to the early dynastic period. During his studies of \\"Altamerikanistik\\" (pre-Columbian ethnology) at the \\"V√∂lkerkunde-Institut\\" in Bonn (1975‚Äì1977), he was introduced to the problem of reading the Mayan hieroglyphs, which would occupy him till the end of his life. After completing his degree, Gockel was engaged as a tour guide and free-lance archaeologist working on excavations and special projects for museums and private collectors. While working on one such (totally unrelated) project at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence in the Spring of 1987, Gockel spent his evenings puzzling over the Mayan hieroglyphs. He quickly developed a new approach which he found extremely promising http://www.gockelmayatheory.com/ and commenced work on a decipherment of the dynastic inscriptions at the ruined Mayan city of Palenque in Chiapas, Mexico. Gockel's work, which was ready for publication in the Fall of 1988, created a furor - partially because his results disagreed radically with those of other scholars Riese, Bertold, Rese√±a bibliogr√°fica a Wolfgang Gockel, La historia de una dinast√≠a maya: El desciframiento de los glifos clasicos con base en las inscripciones de Palenque [Die Geschichte einer Maya-Dynastie, Mainz 1988].

Early life Walmisley was the son of John Angus Walmisley of Westminster and Anna Maria Lambert, daughter of Col. W. Lambert of the East India Company.Francis Family website accessed 14 October 2013Old Francis Family website accessed 14 October 2013 He was educated at Westminster School. Professional career Walmisley became a solicitor in the City of London and was appointed Clerk to the Vestry and Commissioners for Paving of the Parish of St John the Evangelist, Westminster. He held the latter post for over 45 years, though its importance diminished as local government developed in the later 19th century. He was also a Commissioner to Administer Oaths in Chancery, and a Fellow of the Statistical Society. Sporting career Walmisley rowed for Thames Club and in 1846 he stroked the Thames Club eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.R C Lehmann \\"The Complete Oarsman Also in 1846, he challenged unsuccessfully for the Wingfield Sculls. He won the Wingfield Sculls in 1847 beating H Murray and C Harrington. However he fouled so badly that no one would challenge him in the following year and he won in 1848 by a row over. In November he was a member of the committee that revised the rules of the race.Wingfield Sculls Record of Races John Walmisley and his youngest brother Walter Milbanke Walmisley (1831‚Äì1915) were also noted cricketers for Surrey Club and Ground and for the Honourable Artillery Company. Military career In 1850, Walmisley was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Honourable Artillery Company, London's oldest Volunteer regiment. He resigned as a captain four years later.London Gazette, 30 May 1854. An invasion scare in 1859 led to the rise of the Volunteer movement, with the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need. The following year Walmisley served as vice-president of a committee to establish the 'Royal National Rifles' as a 'Brigade for the Defence of the Metropolis ... formed of Artisans and other respectable persons'.Grey, p. xxv. Nothing came of this, but on 15 April 1863 the 1st London (City) Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC) was raised in the City of London Beckett, Appendix VIII. and Walmisley was commissioned as captain in command.

In 1873 the 1st London AVC became part of the 1st Administrative Brigade of Middlesex Artillery Volunteers under the command of Walmisley, now promoted to lieutenant-colonel.London Gazette, 12 September 1873. AVCs proved expensive to maintain, and the Secretary of State for War, Edward Cardwell refused to pay for the upkeep of horses, harness and field-guns from the annual capitation grant. As a result, many Volunteer artillery units were wound up in the 1870s, but the 1st Londons continued strongly and absorbed the 1st Middlesex (Hanover Square) AVC.Beckett, p. 179.

First explored in 1963, the cave contains traces of early prehistoric art from between 43,000 and 30,000 years ago. In 2017 the site became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura. Overview It is one of a number of caves where early modern humans in the Aurignacian, between 43,000 and 30,000 years ago left traces of early artwork, including the Vogelherd, Brillenh√∂hle, Grosse Grotte, Hohle Fels and Hohlenstein-Stadel caves. Geissenkl√∂sterle was first archaeologically explored in 1963. Systematic excavations began in 1973, from 1974 to 2002 sponsored by the State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. A 1983 monographic publication summarizes the excavation results up to that time. The cave contains sediments, that were divided into six levels belonging to the Aurignacian and seven levels of the Gravettian. Levels below are accredited to the Middle Paleolithic and those on top reach from the Western European Magdalenian (between 17,000 and 12,000 years ago) to the Middle Ages. The Aurignacian levels date to between 43,000 and 32,000 years ago, and yielded stone tools, artefacts made from antlers, bones and ivory. Among the most notable items are a sculpture of a flutes of bird bone and mammoth ivory, the oldest known musical instruments with an age of 42,000 to 43,000 years. UNESCO World Heritage Site In January 2016, the federal government of Germany applied for the status of World Heritage Site for two valleys with six caves named H√∂hlen der √§ltesten Eiszeitkunst (\\"Caves with the oldest Ice Age art\\"). The site would encompass areas in the Lonetal (valley of the Lone) and the Achtal (valley of the Ach) both in the southern Swabian Jura. The former includes the caves Hohlenstein-Stadel, Vogelherd and Bocksteinh√∂hle, the latter Geissenkl√∂sterle, Hohle Fels and Sirgenstein Cave. Each valley would contain a core area of around length, surrounded by a buffer zone of a least width. In the argument why these sites deserve recognition as a part of the universal human heritage, the area is described as the source of the currently oldest known (non-stationary) works of human art in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines as well as the oldest surviving musical instruments. Their creators lived, were inspired and worked in and around these caves. The caves also served as the repositories of the figurines which may have been used in a religious context. In addition, they were the venue where performers used the excavated musical instruments and where the social groups lived from which the artists sprang. The committee awarded the status of WHS in July 2017.

The Pandya Kings and the Royal Sethupathi kings made many contributions to this temple. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams. Legend Temple entrance One day a wedge, or 'aappu', is said to have miraculously transformed into a shivalingam to allow the Pandya King Solandhagan to cross the flooded Vaigai River to reach the Meenakshi Amman Temple, and it is from this event that the Thiru Aappanoor temple takes its name. On another occasion, Shiva is also believed to have miraculously caused the sand of the river here to turn into rice during a famine. Temple structure The Pandya kings were the first to begin building the temple, which was further expanded by the Nayak kings. The shrine of the presiding deity, Lord Shiva faces east. A shrine to Subrahmanyar is situated between the shrines of Shiva and Ambal. Thus, the temple is said to be of the Somaskanda type. The Lord Hanuman is found on a pillar, and there is a fig tree (Ficus religiosa) in between the two shrines, with a vinayagar statue beneath it. This tree is considered to be a Shtala Virutcham or temple tree. Sambandar composed the Tevaram Pathigam on Thiru Aappanoor. Festivals Bhrammotsavam is celebrated at Thiru Aappanoor for the Tamil month of Maasi. Navaratri is also celebrated at the temple. On the day of Panguni Uththiram, images of Meenakshi and Sundareswarar are brought to Thiru Aappanoor from the Meenakshi Amman temple across the river, and return on Rishabha Vaahanam. The festival idols at the temple are made of silver, and are taken in procession during the bimonthly Pradosham festival.

She is most well known for her powerful murals, but she also practiced easel painting, printmaking, and frescoes. She traveled to Mexico, Hong Kong, Burma, and India depicting peoples of different cultures and ethnicities and paying special attention to oppressed people in underdeveloped locations, which has at times resulted in critical reception in the modern-era due to issues of ethnic and racial stereotypes. Early life and education Marion Greenwood was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1909. Born to Walter Greenwood and Kathryn Boyland, her father was a painter and her older sister Grace Greenwood Ames was also an artist. She exhibited artistic talent at a very young age and left high school at the age of fifteen to study with a scholarship at the Art Students League of New York. There she studied with painters John Sloan and George Bridgman. She also studied lithography with Emil Ganso and mosaic with Alexander Archipenko. At age eighteen, she made multiple visits to Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, New York. There, she painted portraits of intellectuals-in-residence and gained experience and knowledge through conversation. In the mid-1920s, Greenwood studied with Winold Reiss, a German-born artist and designer which had contributed to the Harlem Renaissance movement. In 1929, both of the Greenwood sisters participated in the famed Bohemian event, the Maverick Festival (1915‚Äì1931) at the Maverick Art Colony in Woodstock, New York. Still in her teens, Greenwood used the proceeds from a portrait of a wealthy financier to begin her travels through Europe. While she was there she studied at the Academie Colarossi in Paris. Career She returned to New York in 1930, but continued to travel extensively over the next four decades, mostly throughout the United States, Mexico, and China. In her work she employed multiple mediums: oil paint, fresco, lithography, etching, charcoal, and ink. Her first trip to the Southwest began a theme in her work which involved depicting ethnicity and culture in different parts of the world. As she visited different locales throughout her life, Greenwood would spend time learning about the people there and use them as subjects for drawings and paintings. When creating large murals later on, Greenwood would often use these studies to place figures in a larger composition. = Mexico = The first visit to Taxco, Mexico in 1932 marked a crucial turning point in her career, she worked on fresco murals for the Mexican government. Between 1933 and 1936, Greenwood and her sister painted five separate murals in Taxco and Morelia, Mexico. Her older sister Grace served as her painting assistant while working in Mexico. There she met the artist Pablo O'Higgins, who introduced and taught her fresco painting. As a result, she began focusing her efforts on fresco-mural painting. Greenwood's first fresco mural was Mercado en Taxco (1933), located in the stairwell in the Hotel Taxque√±o in Guerrero. The success of this piece led to commissions from the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol√°s de Hidalgo in Morelia, and the Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market in the historic center of Mexico City. An example of her process is evident in the preparation for the decoration at Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol√°s de Hidalgo in Morelia, Greenwood spent a year studying and immersing herself in the Pur√©pecha indians culture before completing this project. Her work during her Mexican mural period had revolutionary themes and was influenced by the stylization of Jos√© Clemente Orozco and Diego Rivera in its figures and dynamic compositions. = Commissions, murals, and other work = Greenwood was the first woman to receive a mural commission from a foreign government. Shortly after these projects, she returned to the United States to create a mural for the social hall of the Westfield Acres Housing Project in Camden, New Jersey. In 1937 she was hired to teach fresco painting at Columbia University, and a year later was commissioned by the Section of Fine Arts to paint an oil mural, The Partnership of Man and Nature for the post office in Crossville, Tennessee. Greenwood's murals were often large dramatic scenes with groups of people engaged in cultural practices or in the case of a social works project, workers in their environment. Often the murals had themes of optimism, democracy, and diversity. For example, Rehearsal for African Ballet depicts a group of African-Americans playing music, singing, and dancing together. In Blueprint for the Living, workers are laying bricks and building while a family looks upon the construction. In 1939, she married British-born Charles Fenn. In 1940, she was commissioned by the Federal Art Project to paint frescoes for the Red Hook housing project in Brooklyn. This project, titled Blueprint for Living, was meant for low-income citizens in government housing and expressed optimism for a more harmonious future. Around 1940, Greenwood began to focus on easel painting and printmaking, generally depicting powerful, gritty scenes of working classes or insightful portraits. The subjects from the 1940s work were mainly portraits of people, often lower class individuals toiling in work or squalor from foreign regions as well as in America. Greenwood was applauded by critics for \\"her profound sympathy with the poor and the oppressed of all lands, her natural democratic feeling\\" and \\"her disregard of difficulties and class barriers\\". She was seen as an advocate for these struggling figures in the same way that she supported social movements with her social realist murals. = World War II = At the start of World War II (1939‚Äì1945), Greenwood was one of only two women appointed as an artist war-correspondent with the World War II United States Army Art Program. During this time she painted the reconditioning of wounded soldiers. This sometimes involved being present at surgeries to sketch and following the patient through to occupational therapy. The paintings, drawings, and etchings from this series are in the official archives of the United States War Department. Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceutical company helped fund aspects of the program. = Hong Kong = In spring 1946, she travelled with her husband Charles Fenn to lived and worked in Hong Kong, with a journey stopover in London, Burma, and India Fenn had lived in Hong Kong prior to World War II and was starting a job with the United States Marines for the Office of Strategic Services, and at this time, Hong Kong was heavily influenced by British colonists. Greenwood's travels included a four day trip to Guangzhou (formally known as Canton), China and a weekend trip to Macau. She returned to New York City by herself in June 1947. In December 1947, she made her solo debut with art pieces from her stay in Hong Kong at the Associated American Artists (AAA) gallery in New York City, and another art exhibition was held in March 1948. Greenwood and Fenn divorced. = Knoxville mural = In 1954, Greenwood received a large commission for a 6-by-29-foot oil-on-linen mural, \\"The History of Tennessee\\" nicknamed \\"The Singing Mural\\", in the University Center student center auditorium at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. It took a year to complete the painting, and during which Greenwood taught art courses at the university while she worked as an artist-in-residency on the mural. The mural was designed to depicted the folk traditions and music of Tennessee. There are four thematic sections to the mural. When the painting was completed and unveiled in June 1955, it was vandalized, hidden, and debated mostly due to images that have been perceived as of racial stereotyping. One of the panels showed an adult black man farming cotton (it is unclear from the mural if he is being depicted as a slave, a sharecropper or a farmer) and he is smiling. In 1972, the mural was hidden away and covered with paneling. In 2006 the mural was uncovered due to the student's requests and the ‚ÄúGreenwood Mural Project‚Äù was formed on campus to discuss censorship and race. In 2013, the University Center building that held the mural was removed and the mural was restored put into storage. Later life She was exhibited in numerous solo shows at the American Contemporary Artists Gallery in New York City. She also exhibited her work at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the New York World's Fair. Her last mural was made in 1965 at Syracuse University, this mural was dedicated to women of the world and combined drawings and paintings from her studies and world travels. At the end of her life she lived in Woodstock, New York with her second husband Robert Plate. She died on August 20, 1970, in Kingston, New York after a long illness and a cerebral hemorrhage.  Art collections  Her works are represented in the public art collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met), the Library of Congress, New York Public Library (NYPL), Smithsonian American Art Museum, National Gallery of Art, Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, National Museum of Women in the Arts, Currier Museum of Art, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF), Indianapolis Museum of Art, Cleveland Museum of Art, Wichita Art Museum (WAM), Maier Museum of Art, amongst others.

The most common form is Birkat Hamazon often titled - Seder Birkat HamazonArtscroll Illustrated Birchon - English Translation, Artscroll, 1996 (Order of Grace after Meals) in Hebrew. Some editions actually have the Birkat Hamazon prayer in the back, appearing almost as an afterthought. (Zemirot Shabbat) by Feldheim Publishers, 1984, Israel, p. (last page).Frum Satire blog entry about difficulty finding Birkath Hamazon. Birchonim are commonly known as bentchers in Yiddish in the Ashkenazi community, and in places heavily influenced by Ashkenazi Jews. Birchonim are used widely in the various religious and traditional communities of Jews, such as Orthodox, Sephardic, Conservative, Reconstructionist, Mizrahi, Chassidic, Orthodox Feminist,Shaarei Simcha, Adena Berkowitz and Rivka Haut, Ktav Publishing. as well as other communities. Birchonim are often decorated with scrollwork, illuminations, pictorial backgrounds on each page, photo pages and by other means. This is in the tradition of hiddur mitzvah, or beautification of the mitzvah. There are several services currently available that customize the bencher using graphics, logos and/or photographs. Let's Bench - Custom Photo Benchers Made In Israel  Common features  Birchonim, particularly those of the common Birkat Hamazon variety often share in common prayers which are said on a daily, weekly, annual, or intermittent basis, such as * Hadlakat Nerot of Shabbath - Sabbath eve candle lighting * Hadlakat Nerot of Yom Tov - Holiday eve candle lighting * Shalom Aleihem * Eisheth Hayil - Proverbs 31 * Birkath Habanim - Blessing the Children * Sabbath Eve Kiddush * Sabbath Morning Kiddush * Kiddush for various occasions * Zemiroth for Sabbath Eve * Zemiroth (Songs) for Sabbath Day * Zemiroth (Songs) for Seudah Shelishith (The Third Meal) * Zemiroth (Songs) for Melaveh Malkah * Habdala - Ending the Shabbath or Yom Tob * Birkath Hamazon (Grace) at the banquet of Circumcision * Birkath Hamazon (Grace) at the Wedding Banquet * Sheba Berakhoth - The Seven (Nuptial) Blessings * Blessings before all foods * Blessings after foods without bread  Common varieties  Birchonim come in a very wide variety of styles, and types, all of which are based on the nusach and minhag of the community. Birchonim are generally printed in Hebrew only, Hebrew plus vernacular translation, or Hebrew plus vernacular translation and Hebrew transliteration for participation by those unfamiliar Hebrew. Common Birchon A common birchon may contain the Birkat Hamazon prayer, as well as the kiddush for Ereb Shabbath (Sabbath Eve - Friday night), Sabbath morning, various prayers after foods and drinks, and Sabbath table songs. Sefer HaKidush Sefer HaKidush is a special birchon, which is often hard cover and may be leather bound, and especially decorated. This birchon contains all of the kiddush prayers for the eves and mornings of Shabbath, and the hagim or yomim tobim, the Jewish holidays, and is most used by the head of the household (usually the father) or a rabbi. It is frequently given as a wedding gift to the groom. Sheba Berahoth / Sheva Brachot A sefer Sheba Berahoth is a birchon which is especially printed for the occasion of a wedding and/or the week after a wedding. This birchon contains the seven blessings recited by family and friends of the bride and groom under the huppah at a Jewish wedding, and after birkat hamazon at the end of special meals in the week following the wedding. The sefer Sheva Brachot may contain special commentary on the meaning of the blessings. Shiron or Zemirot A shiron is a birchon with an emphasis on songs. A shiron may typically have extra selections of Sabbath table songs, as well as songs for the Holidays and weddings. A special section, perhaps at the end of the shiron may contain a table of contents introducing extra songs, such as is found in widely popular benchers in the OrthodoxThe NCSY Bencher: A Book of Prayer and Song, 1982, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America / OU/NCSY Publications. and ConservativeB'kol Echad USY Songster, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, 2001 movements. Simchon A simchon is a shiron which features prayers and songs specific to a simcha or happy event such as a Bar or Bat Mitzvah, wedding or Brit Milah. The Card Variety Some birchonim are made to be portable, or are made primarily for use in cafeterias and restaurants. These birchonim are printed on laminated cards that either fold in half, in thirds, or do not fold at all.  Novelties  Birchonim are often printed as souvenirs of special occasions, such as a Bar Mitzvah or wedding. A common practice in North America is to create a specially designed Jewish monogram which is composed of an artistic rendition of the celebrants' names in Hebrew in the shape of something recognizable such as a flame, the trick being to try to make out the actual letters. Some times the names are written in micography. In North America, special \\"bencher pens\\" have a pull tab which reveals a scrolled paper containing the text of the Birkat Hamazon prayer.

It belongs to the Leonhard Moll AG Group and is one of the world's leading manufacturers of silicate paints. Buildings such as the White House, Mariyinsky Palace, Buckingham Palace, Sydney Opera House and the Bolshoi Theatre are painted with Keimfarben paints. Company founder Adolf Wilhelm Keim is seen as the inventor of silicate paints (mineral paints), which revolutionised the builders' and painters' trade at the end of the 19th century. History The reign of King Ludwig I of Bavaria was a time of intensive research into water glass (potassium silicate). The king loved the colorful lime frescoes in North Italy and longed to enjoy the typically splendid colors produced by lime paints in his own kingdom. But the harsh German climate was not suitable for the technique used in Italy. Adolf Wilhelm Keim Eventually, the skilled craftsman and researcher Adolf Wilhelm Keim succeeded in mixing liquid water glass and mineral color pigments to create a paint that could withstand the climate north of the Alps while at the same time offering brilliant colors. The paint's durability results from the chemical bond formed by the binding agent with the substrate (silification). Keim obtained a patent for his mineral paints in 1878, thus laying the foundation stone for today's company KEIMFARBEN GMBH. The first production site was near to the limestone quarry in Offenstetten (which belongs to Abensberg today) in Lower Bavaria. Group structure Headquarters in Diedorf Subsidiary in Alteno Keimfarben has two German sites in Diedorf (headquarters) and Alteno/Luckau and altogether eleven foreign subsidiaries in Europe (Austria, Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia, Poland, the Czech Republic) and the United States. Authorised dealers are responsible for sales in countries where Keimfarben does not have its own subsidiary (Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, Malaysia and Russia). On 6 September 2012, KEIMFARBEN GMBH & Co KG changed its legal form and now operates under the name of \\"KEIMFARBEN GMBH\\". Product range Keim laid the foundation for the success of Keimfarben in 1878 with KEIM Purkristalat, a two-component pure silicate paint. The second generation of Keim paints followed in 1962 with Keim Granital, the first silicate emulsion paint; in contrast to Purkristalat, this is a one-component paint which makes it easier to apply. In 2002, Keimfarben then launched Keim Soldalit, a sol-silicate or colloidal silicate paint (binding agent: colloidal silica and water glass), which makes it much easier to apply silicate paints so that they are suitable for universal use. Keimfarben produces paint systems for external and internal use, mineral renders and fillers, natural stone repair systems and thermal insulation composite systems, together with concrete repair and surface protection systems. A new item in the product range is silicate paint for wooden substrates.

Photo by Jan Howard, 2007. The Mystery Orchid, Cooktownia robertsii, discovered and illustrated by Lewis Roberts The Striped Snake Orchid, Serpenticaulis bowkettiae, previously Bulbophyllum bowketiae. Illustration by Lewis Roberts. Lewis Roberts, OAM, (born 1950) is a distinguished naturalist and botanical illustrator. Lewis and his brother, Charlie Roberts, are probably the leading experts on the flora and fauna of south-eastern part Cape York Peninsula and the northern Wet Tropics area. For three generations his family has lived at Shipton's Flat, about 45 km south of Cooktown, where he and Charlie were home-schooled. His father, Jack Lewis, was a tin miner and self-taught naturalist.  Background  Since about 1960, most of the botanists and zoologists who have conducted research in their area have sought advice or field assistance from the Roberts brothers. Both are \\"Honoraries\\" to the Queensland Museum. Lewis Roberts has a particular interest in orchids, especially the species of Cape York Peninsula and the Wet Tropics. He commenced serious study in 1973. Since then, he has collected many specimens, and discovered seven new species, including an unusual orchid, known only at Shipton's Flat, for the National Herbarium in Canberra. This ground orchid, which has been listed in a new genus of its own, was named Cooktownia robertsii, in Lewis' honour. Lewis discovered this rare ground orchid in the 1980s and it was formally described by David Jones, one of Australia's leading orchid taxonomists, in 1997.Jones DL (1997) \\"Cooktownia robertsii or, a remarkable new genus and species of Orchidaceae from Australia.\\" Austrobaileya (1997), 5, 71-8.A complete Guide to Native Orchids of Australia, including the island territories, p. 340. David L. Jones. 2006. New Holland Publishers, Frenchs Forest, N.S.W. 2086 Australia. . Many of the local orchid species are rare and have very specific and limited ranges, occurring only in remote, inaccessible places such as particular mountain peaks, swamps or types of rain forest accessible only on foot. Additionally, most orchids flower seasonally, and some for only one or two days a year! In 1993, Lewis began to draw the orchids he found. He is a self-taught botanical illustrator. His early works were in pencil done purely as an aid to identification. He was fastidious about showing the most minute details. He showed some of his penciled works to visiting fellow naturalists, and prompted by them, Lewis began colouring and highlighting his illustrations. He has devised his own techniques to capture the scale and complexity of his subjects, many of which are barely visible to the naked eye. Lewis works in pencil to outline his subject using a magnifying glass, when necessary. He captures the colour of the subject in watercolour, then highlights and shades with pen and ink. Lewis hopes to illustrate a specimen of every orchid species found in north-eastern Queensland. There are over 250 species known in the region and he has completed illustrations of well over 100. Once he has finished the series, Lewis hopes to publish them, along with his field observations on each species, but it will take many more years to illustrate them all. Following the conventions of botanical illustration, Lewis records his subjects comprehensively ‚Äì plant, flower and fruit. He also dissects the flowers of each to show its various parts ‚Äì petals, sepal, column, labellum, anther and pollinia. The process is exacting and time-consuming. Not allowing for time taken to find suitable specimens of particular species ‚Äì some take years ‚Äì each illustration takes between 2 and 3 days to complete, depending on the complexity and size of the plant. Lewis leads many groups of naturalists and hikers and is renowned for his knowledge and bush skills. He always goes bushwalking (hiking) barefoot, and has only worn shoes a few times in his life mainly on special occasions, such as when he was married, at the opening of his first exhibition at Nature's Powerhouse, and when presented with the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 2005. A species of Australian lizard, Saproscincus lewisi, is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Lewis\\", p. 157).  Exhibitions  Over 80 prints of his orchid illustrations are held at Nature's PowerHouse Environment and Interpretive Centre in the Cooktown Botanic Gardens, where some are on display. The collection was exhibited at the opening of the Mackay Botanic Gardens and travels to other galleries. There was a major exhibition of prints of Lewis' work was held in Nature's PowerHouse from 24 October 2004, which lasted for a month. Another exhibition of his prints was displayed at the Foyer Gallery in Atherton, Queensland from 3 to 28 May 2010.

The test employs the Trinder reagent, and is a colour change test resulting from the Trinder reaction. The Trinder reagent, named after P. Trinder of the Biochemistry Department of the Royal Infirmary in Sunderland (see the article listed in further reading), comprises an aminoantipyrine (such as 4-aminoantipyrine) and phenol (p-hydroxybenzene). The Trinder reaction is the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the phenol and aminoantipyrine to form a quinone (quinoneimine), catalyzed by the presence of a peroxidase (such as horseradish peroxidase). The hydrogen peroxide is itself produced by an initial reaction where the glucose is oxidised in the presence of the glucose oxidase catalyst into H2O2 and gluconic acid. The quinone is red-violet in colour, with the intensity of the colour being in proportion to the glucose concentration. The colour is measured at 505 nm, 510 nm, or 540 nm. Diagnostic kits containing the Trinder reagent are available, including one from Sigma-Aldrich. The Stanbio Single Reagent Glucose Method is based upon the Trinder technique.

Municipally, the village is a part of Chulkovsky Rural Settlement, the administrative center of which is the village of Chulkovo. Postal code: 606149. Krasno is located on the right side of the Dobrushka River (Tuzha's tributary, which itself flows into the Oka), south of the left side of the Oka River and north-east of Vacha, the administrative center of the district. Before 1929, Krasno was administratively a part of Bolshezagarinskaya Volost of Muromsky Uyezd of Vladimir Governorate. Krasno. Trinity Church, 1860-1867 History17th century= Zechariah. One of the few remaining wall-paintings. The date when the church was built in Krasno is not known. However, the records indicate that a wooden church already existed there in the 17th century. The 1676 tax books of the Ryazan eparchy describe the village as having the Saint Nicholas Church and several homesteads. The same book also states that a number of villages were included in the Krasno parish. =18th century= The church existed in Krasno until 1776, by which time it had fallen into decay. Due to that, local landowner Senyavin petitioned bishop Ieronim of Vladimir for a blessing to construct a new, stone church. The church was built and consecrated in honor of Saint Nicholas, but it was small and cold. Since 1797, the liturgy was conducted in a warm wooden church in honor of the Theotokos of Vladimir, which has been obtained from Murom. =19th century= In 1860-1863, the stone church was dismantled and re-built in a larger size. In 1866-1867, the refectory of the church was also disassembled and re-built. The architecture of the new five-domed church was described as magnificent and graceful. The church had three side chapels‚Äîthe main one being the Trinity altar, located in a warm refectory. The other two were the chapels of Saint Nicholas and the Theotokos of Vladimir.

History Founded in 1980, the festival features a competition for original plays that premier during the festival, along with local and foreign theatre productions, street theatre and open-air performances. There are also concerts, arts and crafts workshops, and lectures. The majority of the Festival's plays come from outside the mainstream of establishment Israeli theatre, some having avantgarde characteristics and subjects giving outlet to their creators' personal statements. Some combine media and genres such as pantomime, clowning, video, dance, and performance art rarely seen in the conventional theatre. Many are staged in historic venues within the Old City of Acre, such as its Crusader-era citadel and knights' halls that have undergone conservation. The Festival has been produced by the Municipality of Akko since the year 2000. It is supported by the Israel Ministry of Culture, the Old Acre Development Company and overseas philanthropic foundations. The Acre Festival has become a symbol of coexistence between the city's Jewish and Arab inhabitants. Each year's program features works by Arab playwrights and troupes along with performances by music ensembles. Performance projects led by theatre professionals provide training for local Arab and Jewish teens, including immigrant youth. The Festival has been postponed and scaled down twice due to interethnic disturbances: during the October 2000 events of the Second Intifada, and in 2008 due to the Yom Kippur riots, after which the Festival was held during the Hanukkah holiday week.

He was responsible for raising public awareness of inner-city poverty and leading the campaign for improved housing conditions. Early life Born on 28 September 1883 in Brunswick a suburb of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, Barnett was the son of working class parents. He attended the Albert Street Primary School until 1898 when he joined the Education Department, initially as monitor, and eventually as student-teacher. He resigned in 1902, to become a clerk in the civil service. By 1920 he had qualified as a public accountant and established his own practice. On 6 January 1909 he married Elizabeth Hyett, with whom he was to have four daughters and a son.  Career  Throughout his life, Barnett was influenced by the Christian socialist tradition of the Methodist Church. In 1923, shocked after a visit to a slum mission, he joined with a group of other young Methodists which resulted in the foundation of the Methodist Babies Home in South Yarra in 1929. In 1928 he had graduated a Bachelor of Commerce from Melbourne University; in 1931 he completed a master's degree with the thesis ‚ÄúThe Economics of the Slums‚Äù in which he correlated the physical condition of housing with the social condition of its residents. In 1934 he formed a study group of about 40 members comprising the lawyer Oswald Burt, several notable architects and a surveyor/town planner, Fr Tucker of the Brotherhood of St Lawrence and representatives of other church and charitable institutions. The group held weekly meetings to receive and discuss papers about housing reform and soon attracted the attention of the major evening newspaper, The Herald.Reform and Social Responsibility: The Establishment of the Housing Commission. New Houses for Old: Fifty Years of Public Housing in Victoria 1938 - 1988. R. Howe. Melbourne, Ministry of Housing and Construction: 20-44 In 1935, a new government was elected, led by Albert Dunstan of the Country Party, with the support of the Australian Labor Party. Heavily influenced by Barnett‚Äôs study group, the new government appointed a Slum Abolition Committee (SAC). At the same time, Barnett and his group formed their own Housing Reform Council, which went on to become the Slum Abolition and Better Housing League. In 1936 the SAC became the Housing Investigation and Slum Abolition Board (HISAB); Barnett was its Deputy Chairman and other members of his group, including Burt, were prominent on it. The Board initially embarked on two initiatives: Firstly, to conduct a survey of housing within a five-mile radius of the GPO and secondly to make recommendations to the government on rehousing persons displaced by slum reclamation schemes. In the course of the survey, Barnett came to the realisation that slums were a result of poverty, rather than social condition and that such people would not be suitable for a house purchase scheme, but rather should be given rented accommodation at subsidized rates. In 1937 the board reported to the government; amongst other things, the report contained a list of slum landlords, causing a storm of protest. The report was subsequently criticized for concentrating on housing conditions, rather than issues of poverty, housing shortage and excessively high rents. Nevertheless, the government was pressured into passing the Housing Act of 1937 which enabled the constitution of the Housing Commission of Victoria (HCV). The new Housing Commission was required to (i) Improve existing housing conditions; (ii) provide adequate and suitable houses for letting or leasing to people displaced from reclamation areas, people living under unsatisfactory housing conditions, and other eligible people; (iii) sell houses to eligible persons and make advances to eligible persons to enable them to become the owners of their own homes; (iv) Develop land for housing and related purposes.State Housing: (The Work of the) Housing Commission Victoria. Melbourne. Housing Commission of Victoria The Commission, with a full-time Chairman, John O‚ÄôConnor and three part-time commissioners, Barnett and Burt from HISAB and a woman, Frances Pennington, met for the first time on 1 March 1938. The HCV proceeded to purchase land and develop low-cost (low-rental) housing for the poor, with the first projects constructed in Port Melbourne and Carlton. The early years of the HCV were marked by the conflict of the reformers‚Äô desires with the social, economic and political realities. Some HCV proposals were later constrained by the passing of the Town and Country Planning Act of 1944 which stipulated minimum house block sizes. In February 1948, after repeatedly clashing with the Minister for Housing, B. Barry, both Barnett and Burt declined reappointment to the HCV. Barnett became a vocal opponent of the new HCV multi-storey housing tower schemes.From Rehabilitation to Prevention: The War Years. New Houses for Old: Fifty years of Public Housing in Victoria 1938 - 1988. R. Howe. Melbourne, Ministry of Housing and Construction: 46-68  Later life  For the remainder of his life, Oswald Barnett retained a strong interest in social reform. He remained an important figure in the Methodist Church, as a lay preacher and author of religious tracts. He also wrote several volumes of poetry and a book of revised nursery rhymes. In 1959 Barnett married Florence Fowles, his first wife having died in 1956. He formally retired from his accountancy firm in 1962, and died at Box Hill on 3 May 1972. An annual oration has been instituted in memory of him. The first F. Oswald Barnett Oration was delivered by Associate Professor Renate Howe of Deakin University at St Kilda on 21 October 1994. The oration seeks to acknowledge the contribution Barnett made to eliminating poor housing conditions and is organised by Housing Choices Australia, a national not-for- profit housing provider who creates safe, quality, affordable housing for people who are struggling to find a home in Australia's challenging private rental market. Prior to Housing Choices Australia, it was jointly sponsored by Ecumenical Housing, (a commission of the Victorian Council of Churches) and Copelen Child and Family Services (formerly Methodist Babies‚Äô Home).

After two seasons at Millwall where he played six times in the league, he spent the 1925‚Äì26 season with Reading, but without playing for the league side. A brief spell with Rhyl Athletic preceded a few months at Worcester City playing alongside former Birmingham forward Moses Lane. In February 1927, Birmingham paid a fee of ¬£300 for Oakes' services, but he played only once for their first team, shortly after joining the club, as deputy for Joe Bradford.Matthews, p. 169. At the end of the 1927‚Äì28 season Oakes returned to Rhyl Athletic. A year later he made a more successful return to the Football League, scoring 15 goals from 54 games for New Brighton in the Third Division North. He began the 1927‚Äì28 season with Wigan Borough. After twelve matches, the club folded and its results were expunged from official records. Oakes had played in all but one of those twelve, including the club's last ever Football League match, a 5‚Äì0 defeat at Wrexham on 24 October 1931, and scored four goals. Oakes finished his football career back in non-league with Frickley Colliery and Stalybridge Celtic. Oakes died in Bristol in 1967 at the age of 66. Personal life His son Donald was also a professional, playing for Arsenal. Notes A. Wigan Borough folded during the 1931‚Äì32 season following the match on 24 October 1931, a 5‚Äì0 defeat at Wrexham in which Oakes played. Although the team's results from that season were expunged, Joyce includes the players' appearances in his totals.

Andrews, p. 167 was established at the end of the 16th century and the early 17th century between the kingdoms of England and Morocco. Commercial agreements had been reached by Queen Elizabeth I of England and the Moroccan Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur on the basis of a common enmity to Philip II of Spain. The arms trade dominated the exchange, and numerous attempts at direct military collaboration were also made. The alliance was maintained for some time by their successors. Background After 1578, Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur developed relations between England and Morocco into a political alliance. The alliance between the two states developed during the 16th century on the back of regular commercial exchanges, largely thanks to the work of the Amphlett family of merchants.Srhir, p.13 European trade with Morocco had been at the command of Spain, Portugal and Genoa,A history of the Maghrib in the Islamic period by Jamil M. Abun-Nasr, p.219 but in 1541 the Portuguese suffered the loss of Safi and Agadir, loosening their grip on the area. Following the sailing of The Lion of Thomas Wyndham in 1551,Atlas of British overseas expansion by Andrew N. Porter p.18 and the 1585 establishment of the English Barbary Company, trade developed between England and the Barbary states, and especially Morocco.Vaughan, Performing Blackness on English Stages, 1500-1800 Cambridge University Press 2005 p.57 Nicoll, Shakespeare Survey. The Last Plays Cambridge University Press 2002, p.90 Sugar, ostrich feathers and saltpeter from Morocco were typically exchanged for English fabrics and firearms, in spite of the protests of Spain and Portugal. Elizabeth I had numerous exchanges with Sultan Abd al- Malik to facilitate trade and obtain advantages for English traders.Srhir, p.13 The sultan could speak Spanish and Italian as well as Arabic. In 1577 he wrote to the queen in Spanish, signing himself AbdelMeleck in Latin script.Europe Through Arab Eyes, 1578-1727 by Nabil Matar p.75 That same year, the queen sent Edmund Hogan as ambassador to the Moroccan court.Abun-Nasr, p.218 Alliance Elizabeth was initially reluctant to develop an arms trade with Morocco, for fear of criticism by other Christian powers, as was communicated by Hogan to the Sultan in 1577. Contacts however soon developed into a political alliance as a result of further diplomatic exchanges between Elizabeth I and Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur, after the defeat of Portugal at the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir in 1578. =Anglo‚ÄìSpanish War= Dom Ant√≥nio's claim to the Portuguese throne against Philip of Spain. Relations intensified with the acclamation of Philip II of Spain as King of Portugal in 1580, and the advent of the Anglo‚ÄìSpanish War in 1585.Abun-Nasr, p.218 In 1581, Elizabeth authorized the exportation of naval-grade timber to Morocco in exchange for saltpeter, a necessary ingredient in gunpowder. The establishment of the Barbary Company in 1585 further gave England a monopoly on Morocco trade for 12 years.Srhir, p.13 In 1585‚Äì1588, through the embassy of Henry Roberts, Elizabeth tried to obtain the Sultan's help in backing Dom Ant√≥nio.Abun-Nasr, p.218 In 1588, Al-Mansur granted special privileges to English traders. In her letters to Al-Mansur, Elizabeth, over a period of 25 years, continually described the relationship between the two countries as \\"La buena amistad y confederaci√≥n que hay entre nuestras coronas\\" (\\"The great friendship and cooperation that exists between our Crowns\\"), and presented herself as \\"Vuestra hermana y pariente seg√∫n ley de corona y ceptro\\" (\\"Your sister and relative according to the law of the Crown and the Scepter\\").Shakespeare Studies by John Leeds Barroll, p.89 In January 1589, Al-Mansur through his ambassador to the Queen,Shakespeare and Renaissance Europe by Andrew Hadfield, Paul Hammond p.225 Marzuq Rais (Mushac Reyz),Shakespeare Studies by John Leeds Barroll, p.102 requested the supply of oars, carpenters and shipwrights, as well as transportation on English ships, in exchange for his a contribution of 150,000 ducats and his military help for an Anglo-Moroccan expedition against Spain in favour of the Portuguese claimant. He also requested English military assistance in case of a conflict with neighbouring non-Christian countries. Elizabeth could not meet these demands completely, especially the transportation of Moroccan forces, and negotiation drew on until the death of Dom Ant√≥nio in 1595.Details of the letters in The Stukeley plays by Charles Edelman p.32-33 The 1589 English expedition to Portugal moved ahead nonetheless, and ended in failure with the English fleet hoping in vain for reinforcements from England or Morocco.The Jews in the history of England, 1485-1850 by David S.

Queen Elizabeth and king Ahmad continued to discuss various plans for combined military operations, with Elizabeth requesting a payment of 100,000 pounds in advance to king Ahmad for the supply of a fleet, and Ahmad asking for a tall ship to be sent to get the money. Elizabeth \\"agreed to sell munitions supplies to Morocco, and she and Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the Spanish\\".The Jamestown project by Karen Ordahl Kupperman Discussions however remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy.Nicoll, p.96 =James I and Charles I= James I of England from the period 1603‚Äì1613, standing on an Oriental carpet, by Paul van Somer I (1576‚Äì1621). Morocco had been falling into a state of anarchy following the death of Ahmed al-Mansur in 1603, and local warlords had been on the rise, making the alliance with the Sultanate less and less meaningful. James I also made peace with Spain upon his accession in 1603, with the Treaty of London. Relations continued under James I however, who sent his ambassador John Harrisson to Muley Zaydan in 1610 and again in 1613 and 1615 in order to obtain the release of English captives in Morocco.Britain and Morocco during the embassy of John Drummond Hay, 1845-1886 by Khalid Ben Srhir, p.14 English privateers such as Jack Ward continued to prosper in collaboration with the Barbary states, including Morocco. Moroccan ambassador Jawdar, 1637. During the Thirty Years' War under the rule of Charles I, England sought Moroccan military help against Spain in Tetouan and Sal√©. England had hoped to obtain Moroccan cooperation after the 1625 English attack on Cad√≠z, but the campaign proved disastrous and ruined the prestige of England. On 10 May 1627, England passed an agreement with one of these local warlords, the Mujahidin leader Sidi Al-Ayyashi to obtain his help in releasing English captives, in exchanges for the supply of provisions and arms. England and Al-Ayyashi collaborated for a period of about 10 years, as in the attempted coordinated liberation of Al Ma'mura. In 1632, the city of Sal√©, a major harbour to piracy, was jointly taken by an English squadron and Moroccan forces, permitting the pacification of the city and the release of Christian prisoners.A manual of dates by George Henry Townsend, p.869An Historical and Chronological Deduction of the Origin of Commerce by Adam Anderson, William Combe, p.1631 On May 13, 1637, a Convention was signed between Charles I and Sidi Mohammed el-Ayachi, master of Sal√©, allowing for the supply of military armament to the Sultan. =Embassies of Mulay Ismail= Mohammed bin Hadou, Mulay Ismail's Moroccan ambassador to England in 1682.In the lands of the Christians by Nabil Matar, back cover Relations continued under the Moroccan ruler Mulay Ismail. In 1682, he sent Mohammed bin Hadou as Moroccan ambassador sent to the English court of Charles II.Wild enlightenment: the borders of human identity in the eighteenth century by Richard Nash p.54- Mohammed spent six months in England, in a highly commented visit. He visited Oxford, Cambridge and the Royal Society among many other places. These exchanges forty years of shifting alliances between England and Morocco, related to European conflicts, trade issues, Barbary Coast pirates and the exchange of captives. Ambassador Admiral Abdelkader Perez, 1723‚Äì1737. One of the high points of these contacts occurred in 1720‚Äì21, when English ambassadors John Windus and Commodore Hon. Charles Stewart visited Morocco. They succeeded in signing a diplomatic treaty with Morocco for the first time, and returned home with 296 released British slaves. Moroccan ambassadors were again sent to England in 1726 (\\"Mahomet\\" and \\"Bo-ally\\"), and in 1727 a new treaty was signed by John Russel with Mulay Ismail's successor. A further treaty was signed by John Drummond-Hay in 1865. Impact on literature Shakespeare's Othello and Desdemona in Venice, by Th√©odore Chass√©riau. These intense relations between England and Morocco are thought to have had a direct impact on the literary productions of the age in England, especially the works of Shakespeare, or The Battle of Alcazar by George Peele.Ungerer, p.103 These contacts possibly influenced the creation of the characters of Shylock, or the Prince of Morocco in The Merchant of Venice.Ungerer, p.103 It has even been suggested that the figure of Abd el- Ouahed ben Messaoud may have inspired the character of Shakespeare's Moorish hero Othello.Vaughan, p.59 See also * Morocco‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations * List of Ambassadors of Morocco to the United Kingdom * Islam and Protestantism * Islam in England NotesReferences * Khalid Ben Srhir, Malcolm Williams, Gavin Waterson Britain and Morocco during the embassy of John Drummond Hay, 1845-1886 Routledge, 2005 * Jamil M.

Leonard and starring Barbara Stanwyck and Van Heflin. It is adapted from John P. Marquand's 1946 novel of the same name, about a prominent couple whose marital tensions come to a boiling point during World War II. The book was controversial for its treatment of social conflicts and adultery, but the film is a sanitized and fairly conventional love story. The film was released in the UK as Polly Fulton because \\"B.F.\\" is a euphemism for \\"bloody fool.\\" Plot Polly Fulton is the only daughter of rich industrialist B.F. Fulton. She is involved in a long engagement to family friend Bob Tasmin, an affable, scrupulously honest lawyer. Then she meets brash intellectual Tom Brett, who blames many of the world's problems on the rich. Tom and Polly heartily dislike each other at first, but she finds him exciting compared to the likable but predictable \\"stuffed shirt\\" Bob. Soon Tom and Polly fall passionately in love and get married. Tom has a tense relationship with Polly's family from the start. And when he gradually realizes that his in-laws are using their connections to advance his career, he is not grateful but bitter. Polly is painfully torn between her strong-willed husband and her devoted father, whom everyone calls \\"B.F.\\" When World War II arrives, Tom takes a high-level civilian position in Washington, doing work that he cannot discuss. He and Polly rarely see each other and begin to lead separate lives. Two wartime developments eventually bring the relationship to a crisis point. First, Polly hears a rumor that Tom is having an affair. Then she is stunned by a news report that Bob Tasmin, now a dashing military officer happily married to Polly's best friend, has apparently been killed on a mission behind enemy lines. As the truth about both situations is revealed, Polly and Tom confront their own problems and learn what they mean to each other.

These ships are designed and built by Fincantieri on the bay of La Spezia to Muggiano and Riva Trigoso shipyards. Italian Coast Guard (Saettia Mk1 and Mk2) Based on the earlier experimental Saettia class (Saettia MK1), the Diciotti class (Saettia MK2) is an advanced and improved version with a longer length, more power and hence greater patrol endurance. Malta - Maritime Squadron AFM (Saettia Mk3) P61 in 2006 P61 at Hay Wharf, with the rear launching ramp visible. In 2003, the Armed Forces of Malta ordered a replacement for the former East German Kondor class patrol boats P29, P30 and P31, due to the increase in flow of refugees from North Africa to Europe. The design for P61 (Saettia MK3) provides a clear rear half to the ship, providing sufficient space with reinforcement to land a helicopter, up to the size of an AW139. P61 has the capability of carrying out patrols up to Sea State 5, and withstand sea conditions up to Sea State 7. It can launch a rib patrol boat via a rear launch ramp up to Sea State 4. This combination of modifications increases vessel weight to 450-tonnes, and reduces standard crew capacity to 25. Maximum unrefueled patrol length at is . The ‚Ç¨17m Euros contract, financed entirely from the 5th Italo-Maltese Financial Protocol, covered the construction of the vessel together with an associated training and logistic support package. The ship was commissioned on October 1, 2005 and operational from November 5, 2005. P61 acts as the flagship of the Armed Forces of Malta. The vessel has been updated in 2017 with overhaul and engine refit (Caterpillar engines replace Isotta Fraschini engines), by Fincantieri, to a cost around ‚Ç¨7 million. On the 5th of June 2019 the P61 rescued the lives of 147 migrants after they‚Äòve been sending distress calls in the Maltese SAR area. In total AFM vessels rescued 370 immigrants on one of the busiest days in recent history for the navy. The other migrants were rescued by the P52 and the P21. On the 11th of June 2019, P61 rescued 97 migrants and brought them safely to Malta. This rescue comes less than a week after 147 migrants were rescued by this same vessel. https://lovinmalta.com/news/local/97-migrants- including-two-women-one-pregnant-and-two-children-rescued-by-afm-in-maltese- waters https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/97-migrants-disembarupdated-2-afm- rescues-97-immigrants-president-vella-discusses-immigrationk-in-malta-after- an-armed-forces-search-and-rescue-operation/ On the 24th of August 2019, P61 brought to Malta a group of migrants totalling 356. This happened after Malta finally decided to give a safe port to these souls that were aboard the NGO vessel Ocean Viking for 14 consecutive days. The Maltese government said that all of the migrants will be relocated to other EU countries. This group happens to be the biggest arrival of the year to date. https://www.tvm.com.mt/en/news/watch-ocean-viking-migrants-brought-to-malta- last-night/ Iraq (Saettia MK4) In 2006, the new Iraqi Navy signed a contract with the Italian Government to purchase four modified Diciotti class vessels to patrol its 58 kilometre coast line. The vessels are to be built by Fincantieri at Riva Trigoso, with modifications including increased crew capacity of 38. The contract also comprises the provision of logistical support and crew training with each crew completing a 7-week training course. In cooperation with the Marina Militare (Italian Navy), each commissioning crew is provided with a week‚Äôs bridge simulator course at the Naval Academy in Livorno. In May 2009, the first vessel, Patrol Ship 701 named Fatah (Arabic for Victory), was handed over at the Muggiano, La Spezia shipyard. The crew had been training since January 2009, and now headed for Umm Qasr, a 20 day/5,000 nautical mile journey via the Mediterranean, Suez Canal and Red Sea. There, additional training was completed, before the vessel took over duties from the British Royal Marine patrols, who then reverted to training the new crew. The vessels are used to patrol the exclusive economic zone, control maritime traffic, for search and rescue and fire fighting. Panama - SENAN, National Air and Navy Service of Panama (Saettia Mk2) Following an agreement reached in June 2010, Italy delivered CP 902 Ubaldo Diciotti and CP 903 Luigi Dattilo to SENAN - National Air and Navy Service of Panama as P 901 and P 902 in April 2014.

It is one of the oldest botanical gardens in Germany, and one of the oldest scientific gardens in the world. It is associated with the University of Greifswald in Greifswald, Germany. History The Botanic Garden was formerly situated beyond the white administrative building on the left, but it was moved to its current place in the 1880s. The Botanic Garden in Greifswald was founded in 1763 by Samuel Gustav Wilcke als hortus medicus, i.e. as a physic garden growing plants for medicinal research. Within a short period of time, the plants in the botanic garden served both a medical and a scientific purpose, and the garden was renamed to hortus academicus one year later. Originally, the Botanic Garden was situated near the University of Greifswald's main administrative building, but extensive building activity in the 19th century made a relocation necessary. Professor Julius M√ºnter arranged for the move to a two hectare area west of the city centre, which was completed in 1886. Sixteen greenhouses are situated across the garden today, about half of which are open to the public. The Botanic Garden and the Arboretum are used by the university and students for research and teaching purposes to this very day. Botanic Garden The Botanic Garden consists of 16 greenhouses () and the adjacent outdoor area (). The total area of the Botanic Garden is two hectares. The Botanic Garden is located at Grimmer Str. 88. It contains about 7,000 plants. Arboretum A hut with information panels about mushrooms. The arboretum has a total size of seven hectares, and is situated at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Str., which is near Greifswald University Library and Greifswald University Hospital.

The vessel collided with the corvette on 23 December which meant that the next two months were spent in repair on the Clyde and later in Southampton. =1942= The vessel was finally ready for service again on 2 March 1942 and returned to Scapa Flow for working-up. On 15 April 1942 Tetcott joined convoy WS18 at the ocean escort Clyde Assembly point. The ship escorted this convoy to Cape Town, detaching briefly to call into Freetown on the way. At Cape Town, Tetcott headed into the Indian Ocean and on to Alexandria via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, arriving in early June 1942 where she joined the 9th Destroyer Flotilla. On 10 June the ship sailed with carrying supplies to the garrison at Tobruk. Grove was torpedoed on 12 June during the return journey and Tetcott picked up the survivors. On 16 June the ship came under heavy Axis air attack whilst defending of ships returning to Alexandria following the termination of Operation Vigorous. In July the ship operated as part of Operation Exporter off Palestine and Syria. On 4 August, with the destroyers and the ship attacked the German submarine and forced the U-boat to the surface. 16 German crew and a Lebanese civilian were rescued. In September 1942, the ship was assigned with to convoy duties in the Red Sea, but returned to the Mediterranean in October. In November 1942, the ship formed part of the close escort for Convoy MW13, from Alexandria to Malta. This convoy succeeded in reaching Malta, and the ship formed part of the close escort on the return journey. In December, Tetcott was one of the escorts in the Alexandria to Malta convoy, MW14, after which she joined the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla at Algiers. =1943= In January 1943 the ship escorted from Malta to Alexandria during cover for passage of a Malta and on 1 February rescued survivors from the minelayer which had been torpedoed off Sollum. She continued patrol and escort duties in the eastern and central Mediterranean for the next two months. In July she took part on Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, and in September the Salerno landing, Operation Avalanche. =1944= In January 1944, the ship was assigned to the Northern Attack Force for Operation Shingle, the Anzio Landings, and provided shore bombardment in support of the landings. From February until August 1944, the ship operated in the Adriatic Sea providing shore bombardment and operating as a convoy escort. In September she supported the invasion of the Aegean islands, and then worked as part of the liberation of Greece. Deployments off Greece and Albania continued until March 1945. =1945= Tetcott then operated off the Italian coast, and was slightly damaged in April during the bombardment of Genoa. The ship returned to the UK, arriving at Portsmouth on 21 May before heading to Gibraltar in June for a refit, which started on 5 July. Post-war The ship was due to be assigned to the Indian Ocean following the refit but this was cancelled with the surrender of Japan and instead the refit was cut short and the ship placed in reserve on 17 January 1946 before heading back to the UK. In November 1952, it was announced that the ship would be preserved at the Penarth Docks, but this plan failed. Instead the ship was towed to Gibraltar where she remained until September 1955 when she was towed back to the Barrow in Furness, in Extended Reserve, having had much of her equipment removed and the vessel no longer maintained and placed on the Disposal List. In January 1956 Tetcott was reclassified as a hulk and in August transferred to BISCO for scrapping. References * ReferencesPublications * * English, John (1987).

In his first two years of college football at Texas Tech Hadnot played tight end where he was a capable pass-catcher and solid blocker. In need of a running back, coach Rex Dockery switched his big receiver to fullback. Running from the veer formation, Hadnot used his considerable size and surprising speed to rush for a school record 1,369 yards as a junior in 1978, then 1,371 yards as a senior, leading the Southwest Conference both years. He was selected to the 1978 College Football All-America Team (2nd team). He was also chosen Southwest Conference offensive player of the year in both 1978 and 1979. During his spectacular 1979 season at Texas Tech and in his subsequent Hula Bowl and Senior Bowl appearances, NFL scouts from the Kansas City Chiefs had taken notice of Hadnot's speed and power. They made him their third round pick in the 1980 NFL Draft. In his rookie year he made a solid contribution alternating time with Tony Reed and Horace Belton at running back. Hadnot took over the starting fullback position in 1981, leading the way for the dazzling Joe Delaney while contributing 603 yards rushing and 215 yards receiving of his own. In addition to his four-year NFL career with the Chiefs, Hadnot caught 19 passes for 214 yards at tight end for the San Antonio Gunslingers of the USFL in 1985. After retirement from football, Hadnot returned to his beloved college town of Lubbock where he resided until his death. In 2005, he was enshrined in the Texas Tech Athletic Hall of Honor.

Henry Danvers, 1st Earl of Danby, KG (28 June 1573 ‚Äì 20 January 1643/4) was an English soldier. Outlawed after a killing, he regained favour and became a Knight of the Garter. Life He was the second son of Sir John Danvers, Knt., of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, by his wife Elizabeth Nevill, the youngest daughter and coheiress of John Nevill, 4th Baron Latymer. He was born at Dauntsey on 28 June 1573, and at an early age became a page to Sir Philip Sidney, whom he accompanied to the Low Countries, and was probably present at the battle of Zutphen in 1586. After his master's death he served as a volunteer under Maurice, Count of Nassau, who appointed him at the age of eighteen to the command of a company of infantry. Danvers took part in the siege of Rouen in 1591, and was there knighted for his services in the field by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, in command of the expedition. His father died on 19 December 1593, and on 4 October 1594 Henry Long, son of Robert Long and brother of Sir Walter Long, was killed. A feud had existed between the Long and Danvers families for some time past. According to one account, Henry Long was dining in the middle of the day with a party of friends in Corsham, when Danvers, followed by his brother Charles and a number of retainers, burst into the room, and shot Long dead on the spot. The brothers then fled on horseback to Whitley Lodge, near Titchfield, the seat of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. With Southampton's assistance they succeeded after some days in making their way out of the country. A coroner's inquisition was held, and the brothers were outlawed. Another version of the story asserted that Henry Long was killed by Sir Henry Danvers in defending his brother Sir Charles against Long and his company. The brothers joined the French army, and became known to Henry IV of France for their conspicuous bravery. In 1597, Henry Danvers served under Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, apparently as a captain of a man-of-war in the expedition of that year to the coast of Spain. Arms of Sir Henry D'Anvers, 1st Earl of Danby, KG After Henry IV had interceded with Elizabeth I, and Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury with Sir Robert Cecil, the brothers were pardoned on 30 June 1598, and they returned to England in the following August; but it was not until 1604 that the coroner's indictment was found bad on a technical ground and the outlawry reversed. Henry was, soon after his return, employed in Ireland under the Earl of Essex, and Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, successive lords-lieutenant of Ireland. In September 1599 he was appointed lieutenant-general of the horse, in July 1601 governor of Armagh, and in July 1602 sergeant-major-general of the army in Ireland. By James I he was created Baron Danvers of Dauntsey, Wiltshire, in 1603 for service during the victory at Kinsale in Ireland, and two years afterwards was restored in blood as heir to his father, notwithstanding the attainder of his elder brother Charles, who had been beheaded in 1601 for his share in Essex's insurrection. On 14 November 1607, Danvers was appointed lord president of Munster, a post which he retained until 1615, when he sold it to Donogh O'Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond. On 15 June 1613 he obtained the grant in reversion of the office of keeper of St. James's Palace, and on 23 March 1621 he was made governor of the isle of Guernsey for life. By Charles I he was created Earl of Danby on 5 February 1626, and on 20 July 1628 was sworn a member of the privy council. In 1630, Danby succeeded to the estates of his mother, who after her first husband's death had married Sir Edmund Cary. He was made a councillor of Wales on 12 May 1633, and was installed a knight of the Garter on 7 November in the same year. He was included in a number of commissions by Charles I, formed one of the council of war appointed on 17 June 1637, and acted as commissioner of the regency from 9 August to 25 November 1641. He never married, and upon his death the barony of Danvers and the earldom of Danby became extinct. Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds, best known to history as the Earl of Danby, was his great-nephew. Towards the close of his life he suffered from bad health and lived principally in the country. He died at his house in Cornbury Park, Oxfordshire, on 20 January 1644, and was buried in Dauntsey Church, where there is a monument of white marble to his memory. On the east side of the monument are lines ostensibly written by his kinsman, George Herbert, who paid a long visit at Dauntsey in 1629. If they are genuinely by him the epitaph must have been written many years before Danby's death, as Herbert died in 1633. Herbert's biographer, John Drury, has however, questioned the accuracy of the attribution. Herbert was the stepson of Danvers' younger brother, John. See Drury pp.188‚Äì9 The Danby gateway to the University of Oxford Botanic Garden built in 1633. On 12 March 1622 Danvers conveyed to the university of Oxford five acres of land, opposite Magdalen College, which had formerly served as a Jewish cemetery, for the encouragement of the study of physic and botany. He had the ground raised and enclosed within a high wall. The gateway of the Oxford Botanic Garden, designed by Nicholas Stone, a master mason who frequently worked with Inigo Jones, still bears the following inscription, 'Gloriae Dei Opt. Max. Honori Caroli Regis, in usum Acad. et Reipub. Henricus comes Danby DD. MDCXXXII.' By his will he left the rectory of Kirkdale in Yorkshire towards the maintenance of the gardens.

These degrees are closely related to fixed-point-free (DNR) functions, and have been thoroughly investigated in recursion theory.  Background  In recursion theory, \\\\phi_e denotes the computable function with index (program) e in some standard numbering of computable functions, and \\\\phi^B_e denotes the eth computable function using a set B of natural numbers as an oracle. A set A of natural numbers is Turing reducible to a set B if there is a computable function that, given an oracle for set B, computes the characteristic function œáA of the set A. That is, there is an e such that \\\\chi_A = \\\\phi^B_e. This relationship is denoted A ‚â§T B; the relation ‚â§T is a preorder. Two sets of natural numbers are Turing equivalent if each is Turing reducible to the other. The notation A ‚â°T B indicates A and B are Turing equivalent. The relation ‚â°T is an equivalence relation known as Turing equivalence. A Turing degree is a collection of sets of natural numbers, such that any two sets in the collection are Turing equivalent. Equivalently, a Turing degree is an equivalence class of the relation ‚â°T. The Turing degrees are partially ordered by Turing reducibility. The notation a ‚â§T b indicates there is a set in degree b that computes a set in degree a. Equivalently, a ‚â§T b holds if and only if every set in b computes every set in a. A function f from the natural numbers to the natural numbers is said to be diagonally nonrecursive (DNR) if, for all n, f(n) ot = \\\\phi_n(n) (here inequality holds by definition if \\\\phi_n(n) is undefined). If the range of f is the set {0,1} then f is a DNR2 function. It is known that there are DNR functions that do not compute any DNR2 function.  Completions of Peano arithmetic  A completion of Peano arithmetic is a set of formulas in the language of Peano arithmetic, such that the set is consistent in first-order logic and such that, for each formula, either that formula or its negation is included in the set. Once a G√∂del numbering of the formulas in the language of PA has been fixed, it is possible to identify completions of PA with sets of natural numbers, and thus to speak about the computability of these completions. A Turing degree is defined to be a PA degree if there is a set of natural numbers in the degree that computes a completion of Peano Arithmetic. (This is equivalent to the proposition that every set in the degree computes a completion of PA.) Because there are no computable completions of PA, the degree 0 consisting of the computable sets of natural numbers is not a PA degree. Because PA is an effective first-order theory, the completions of PA can be characterized as the infinite paths through a particular computable subtree of 2<œâ. Thus the PA degrees are exactly the degrees that compute an infinite path through this tree.  Properties  The PA degrees are upward closed in the Turing degrees: if a is a PA degree and a ‚â§T b then b is a PA degree. The Turing degree 0‚Äò, which is the degree of the halting problem, is a PA degree. There are also PA degrees that are not above 0‚Äò. For example, the low basis theorem implies that there is a low PA degree. On the other hand, Anton√≠n Kuƒçera has proved that there is a degree less than 0‚Äò that computes a DNR function but is not a PA degree (Jockusch 1989:197). Carl Jockusch and Robert Soare (1972) proved that the PA degrees are exactly the degrees of DNR2 functions. By definition, a degree is PA if and only if it computes a path through the tree of completions of Peano arithmetic. A stronger property holds: a degree a is a PA degree if and only if a computes a path through every infinite computable subtree of 2<œâ (Simpson 1977).

He died on February 3, 2018 at the age of 88.In Memoriam: Michael J. Harner (1929-2018) Development of core shamanism After traveling to the Amazon where he ingested the hallucinogen ayahuasca, Harner began experimenting with monotonous drumming. In the early 1970s he started giving training workshops to small groups in Connecticut. In 1979 he founded the Center for Shamanic Studies in Norwalk, Connecticut. In 1980, Harner published The Way of the Shaman: a Guide to Power and Healing.

(2004) \\"Individualist Religious Movements: Core and Neo-shamanism\\" Anthropology of Consciousness vol. 15(1), pp. 1-9. However, most authors in the field, especially Harner's critics, consider Harner's core shamanism to be the primary influence on, and foundation of, the Neoshamanic movement.Hobson, G. \\"The Rise of the White Shaman as a New Version of Cultural Imperialism.\\" in: Hobson, Gary, ed.

On May 29, 1947, while attempting to take off on runway 18, the aircraft failed to get airborne, overran the end of the runway, ripped through an airport fence onto traffic on the Grand Central Parkway, and slammed into an embankment, ultimately plunging into a pond and exploding. Ten people escaped the flaming wreckage; only five of them survived. It was the worst commercial aviation disaster in United States history at the time. Its record stood for less than 24 hours before an Eastern Airlines DC-4 crashed near Baltimore, Maryland, killing all 53 aboard. Investigation The Civil Aeronautics Board concluded the report on the accident by citing pilot error. The report read: \\"The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was either the failure of the pilot to release the gust lock before take-off, or his decision to discontinue the take-off because of apprehension resulting from rapid use of a short runway under a possible calm wind condition.\\" Although the board came to the conclusion that pilot error was likely the cause, the May 31, 1947, edition of The New York Times told a different (albeit preliminary) tale: \\"The United Air Lines DC-4 that crashed and burned at La Guardia Field Thursday night never got into the air and the pilot, after using up about two- thirds of the 3,500-foot runway, was trying to halt his giant craft by braking and ground looping. All night, on-the-scene inquiries by both the company and officials of the Civil Aeronautics Board established these facts yesterday. They agreed also that the wind shift, described by a company official as 'of almost unbelievable suddenness,' led Capt. Benton R. Baldwin, the pilot, to decide against proceeding with the take off, but they differed on whether the pilot had been apprised of approaching wind shifts before the take-off.\\" It seemed, at least early on, the cause may have actually been wind shear (although it is referred to as \\"wind shift\\" in the article).

He advanced some fundamental theories on religion during the Reformation, and criticized corruption in the Catholic church. Biography Josephus was born in Mosul, in present-day Iraq. He apparently came from a family of Assyrian Catholics. After his parents died in 1606, relatives sent Josephus to be brought up in Jerusalem. Until 1613, he lived and was educated in Palestine in a monastery of the Friars Minor, a Franciscan Order. He was made a Deacon in 1632 under Pope Urban VIII. Five years later, in 1637, he earned the title of Doctor of Theology at the Collegium Bononiensis in Bologna. After periods in Vienna, Prague and Dresden, he moved to Wittenberg, which he saw as the \\"new Jerusalem\\". Above all, in Wittenberg, he turned against the Catholic Church. On October 23, 1643, in the Grand Auditorium of Wittenberg University, Adjutus gave his Oratio-revocatoria, a declaration of renunciation of the Roman Church. He denounced the contention of the Roman Catholic Church that Scripture does not contain everything necessary for healing. The Church of the time believed it necessary to explore the mysteries of faith allowed by the Bible. Adjutus criticized the Catholic reverence for the rule of the Pope, which he saw as a source of errors and an impediment to the understanding of the Word of God. He accused the Catholic Church of three main sins: # Contempt for the Holy Scripture # Erroneous beliefs # The tyranny of church superiors Adjutus was made a professor of theology, and remained at Wittenberg until his death.

In 1900, he received a PhD from Yale University for a dissertation on The Birds in Old English Literature. In the same year, he completed a translation of Cynewulf's The Christ, a companion to Yale professor Albert Stanburrough Cook's critical edition of the poem. Whitman went on to take an Assistant Professorship at Lehigh University. He was invited to Rutgers University in 1906, and accepted the Chair of the Rutgers University English Department in 1911, a position he maintained until his death. His tenure saw many reforms, most importantly the creation of a graduate program, the doubling in size of the faculty, and a transition from declamation to composition and analysis. At the time of this death he was considered \\"one of the most popular professors at the university\\". Whitman was married to Rachel Jones Foster in 1902, and they had three children: Hilda Trull (b. 1908), Alan Foster (b. 1909), Dunbar (b. 1912), and Esther Huntington (b. 1917).

The film stars Jeanne Crain, Edmund Purdom, and Vincent Price. Purdom had previously starred in The Egyptian (1954), which has a similar plot and characters. Plot synopsis In ancient Egypt, Tumos (Edmund Purdom), an apprentice sculptor, is in love with Tenet (Jeanne Crain), a beautiful girl who is to be dedicated to the gods as a priestess. Tumos and Tenet intend to elope, but the high priest Benakon (Vincent Price) learns of their plans. He has Tenet taken into custody and Tumos is condemned for violating religious laws. Tumos flees to the desert to join his friend prince Amenophis (Amedeo Nazzari), the heir to the throne. Amenophis is an effective warrior who has just defeated the Chaldeans. Among the Chaldean prisoners is Seper (Carlo D'Angelo), the priest of a new God Aten, who he claims to be the one true god. Seper proclaims a religion of love, and prophesies the imminent death of the old Pharaoh and the coming reign of Amenophis. The prophecy comes true. Before he returns to Thebes to become pharaoh Amenophis agrees to the marriage of Tenet and Tumos, and makes Seper one of his advisers. In Thebes, Benakon reveals to Tenet that he is her father. He also tells her that she is not to be a priestess; the old pharaoh had agreed that she should marry Amenophis on his death. He gives her the new name Nefertiti and says she is to be the Queen of the Nile. Amenophis accepts her as his wife, unaware that Nefertiti is the same person as the \\"Tenet\\" he had given to Tumos. Tumos, an obstacle in the whole plan, has been arrested by Benakon. He eventually escapes from prison, but is attacked and mauled by a lion. He survives and is nursed by Merith (Liana Orfei), an artist's model who is in love with him. Nefertiti is told he is dead. Tumos soon learns that Tenet is now called Nefertiti and is married to the pharaoh. He gets drunk and sleeps with Merith. When Nefertiti learns that Tumos is alive, she asks Amenophis to make him the court sculptor and order him to sculpt a bust of Nefertiti. While he works on it, the couple renew their love. Meanwhile Benakon is disturbed by the growing influence of Seper's god. His men burst into the Atenist church, killing Seper and many of the worshipers. Nefertiti is among them, but escapes with Tumos' help. Amenophis is disgusted by the killing. He proclaims that all idols are to be destroyed and the old priesthood abolished. However, he forgives Benakon, to emphasise his devotion to the values of the new faith. Benakon and his followers plan a rising against the new religion, but Nefertiti learns of their plans. Tumos leaves to collect an army to defend the city. Benakon's followers surround the royal palace, and paralysed by his new pacifist ideals, Amenophis has a mental breakdown. Nefertiti assumes command of the defence of the palace while waiting for Tumos to bring reinforcements. Horrified by the violence the religious conflict has unleashed, Amenophis kills himself. Nefertiti and her guards make a last stand around the sculpture of the queen, but are overwhelmed. Tumos and Merith arrive just in time with the army, but Benakon nearly stabs Tumos before Merith kills him with an arrow shot. The army restores Nefertiti to the throne. The famous bust of Nefertiti survives the centuries to prove the queen's magnificent beauty and Tumos' love for her.

The Aweti inhabit two villages in the region. One is called Tazu‚Äôjyretam, and the other is unnamed. Tazu‚Äôjyretam is the main village of the Aweti people, and has been inhabited since at least the 19th century. Tazu‚Äôjyretam also has a small port. Both of these villages are located in an area between the Curisevo and Tuatuar√≠ rivers, which feed into the Xingu further upstream. Their population was 196 in 2011, up from 140 in 2006. Name The Aweti are also known as the Arauine, Arauite, Aueti, Aueto, Auiti, Awet√∂, Awytyza, Anumani√°, Auet√∂, or Enumani√° people. History The Aweti people likely formed from several other tribes which entered the Xingu region in the 17th or 18th century. It wasn't until the late 19th century that the Aweti and other tribes in the region were documented by European explorers, coming from Germany. Although there was not much communication between the Aweti and European settlers from then onward for several decades, the brief expeditions into the jungle from explorers were enough to introduce diseases into the community to which the Aweti and their neighbors had no immunity. By the time of the 1950 census, the Aweti counted only 23 people. Despite this, the Aweti did not become extinct or merge with other tribes like some of their neighbors. When the Xingu Indigenous Park was set up in the 1960s, the Aweti population recovered significantly, to 176 people in 2010. This was a result, largely, of better medical care being offered to the people in the region by the Brazilian government. Contact with the outside world increased as well, however, threatening the native language and culture of the Aweti. At some point after the year 2000, the second Aweti village was set up by an extended family and some of their allies who wished to split from the main Aweti tribe. This included some 35 people, causing the population of the main village to drop from 125 people to 90. Culture Aweti villages are built with several huts surrounding a central plaza, which is used for rituals, including funeral rites. This is characteristic of villages built in the area around the Xingu headwaters. A men's hut is also located in the center of the village, and is used for holding ritual flutes which are not allowed to be seen by women. Chiefs, decided by heredity, lead the Aweti villagers and serve as diplomats with other upper Xinguan groups. Currently, the chief of the Aweti is a man named Yalakumin. Inter-tribal trade and rituals among the people of the upper Xingu are common, with the Aweti trading goods such as vegetable salts and hammocks, made from Burit√≠ palm trees. The Huka-huka wrestling contest is a popular intertribal sport. Many tribe members from the upper Xinguan cultural groups also choose to find husbands or wives from other tribes. Language The Aweti language is a member of the Tupian language family, although it is unique and distinctive. Because of contact with outsiders, however, some Aweti tribal members can also speak Portuguese, the majority language of Brazil. Children are educated in Portuguese at an Aweti tribal school. In the new village created in the Aweti tribal area, many people, especially younger individuals, speak Kamayur√° better than Aweti. All of the people in the new village speak at least one language other than Aweti. Subsistence The Aweti fish, hunt, and farm. Their primary crops are maize and manioc.
