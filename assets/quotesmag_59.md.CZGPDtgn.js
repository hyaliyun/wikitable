It was formed by Martin Fisher in 1915, soon joined by his brothers Larry (born 1907), and Zachary (born 1910). The Fisher family has substantial real estate holdings in New York City and elsewhere and are considered one of the \\"royal families\\" of New York real estate, alongside such clans as the Dursts, Roses, Rudins, and Tishmans. The family's fortune was estimated at $800 million in 1988.Forbes magazine, cited in History The Fisher family construction company was founded in 1915 by Martin Fisher. Later, his brothers Larry and Zachary joined to form Fisher Brothers. They worked as contractors building homes in Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, Riverdale, and Mount Vernon. By the mid-1950s, they had branched out into commercial construction and management. In the 1960s, Fisher Brothers continued to diversify, developing Midtown Manhattan office buildings at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 605 Third Ave., and 299 Park Ave. Second generation partners Richard, Anthony, and Arnold Fisher led the firm in the 1980s, brokering deals which included the acquisition of a nine- acre parcel south of the United Nations Headquarters, one of the city's largest available development sites, and the expansion of the Securities and Exchange Commission headquarters in Washington. The family invested in other businesses including banking, and once owned a stake in CBS. The company has been listed in the Fortune 500. In 2004, Fisher Brothers partnered with Morgan Stanley to form the $770 million City Investment Fund, intended to stimulate investment in Manhattan in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The firm is currently led by second generation partner Arnold Fisher as well as third generation partners Kenneth, Steven, and Winston Fisher. Properties The firm manages 6.5 million square feet in commercial property in New York City, including Park Avenue Plaza, 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 299 Park Avenue, 49 East 52nd Street, and 605 Third Avenue.

According to Ars Technica, he is considered to be one of the \\"best designers of polyhedral interlocking puzzles in the world.\\"  Biography  Coffin majored in electrical engineering in college at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where he graduated in 1953. He worked at the Lincoln Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) building computers from 1953 through 1958. In 1964, he left electronics to start building canoes and other boats. He and his family moved to a farm in Lincoln, Massachusetts. Coffin currently lives in Lexington, Massachusetts, where he moved to in 2011. He has three daughters, all of whom are very good at solving his puzzles. Work Coffin began creating puzzles in 1968, after quitting the design and manufacture of canoes and kayaks. One of the puzzles he created, made of 12 hexagonal sticks and cast in epoxy, was brought to school by one of his three daughters. This event led to Coffin meeting Thomas Atwater who was a business agent for inventors of games and puzzles. When 3M showed an interest in his work, he decided to quit making boats and concentrate on puzzles. Hectix, one of his designs, was patented in the United States in 1973 and then manufactured by 3M. When they were manufactured, the design was so complex that factory workers were unable to assemble them. The parts were shipped to his house where he, his daughters and neighborhood children all put them together, making 20,000 puzzles in two weeks. Later, Coffin stopped patenting his puzzles because he did not feel he could make a living by designing products for mass production. Instead he turned to woodworking and selling his puzzles as an art or a craft. Coffin has designed more than 500 original puzzles, most of which are polyhedral. Some have been commercially produced, such as the Hectix. Most of his designs are crafted in wood, some of which use exotic woods such as cocobolo, bubinga and rosewood. In creating his wooden puzzles, Coffin selects beautiful types of wood, cuts and glues the work and then adds his own finish to the piece. Coffin has had no formal training in puzzle making and designs his works intuitively. Coffin's puzzles have several rules, including that each piece be dissimilar, have different axes of symmetry and only one solution. He has freely shared his designs for reproduction, making his puzzles widely produced and sold internationally. Coffin has called his work \\"AP-ART,\\" \\"the sculptural art that comes apart\\" and he feels that the \\"ultimate object in puzzle design is amusement.\\" Curator, Amy Slocum, has highlighted the artistic effort that Coffin puts into his work when she exhibited several pieces at the Katonah Museum of Art. Jerry Slocum, the founder of the International Puzzle Party, has called Coffin's puzzles \\"beautiful three-dimensional sculptures.\\" In 2000, Coffin was the winner of the Sam Loyd award. In 2006, he won the Nob Yoshigahara Award for his lifetime contribution to creating mechanical puzzles. In 2007, Coffin spoke at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Boston, where he discussed his puzzle making and demonstrated his puzzles. Books He is the author of several books and articles about puzzles, puzzle design and memoirs of his life:    AP-ART, A Compendium of Geometric Puzzles (2014) Excerpts The Universal Book of Mathematics provides the following information about him: A leading designer of mechanical puzzles. He is also the author of The Puzzling World of Polyhedral Dissections, one of the most significant works produced on this subject.

Functionality REGO Payment Architectures, Inc.'s service works by allowing a parent to register an account, which can then set up parameters for child accounts. Because the parent account stores all personal information, a child is able to make a purchase without providing any of their personal information. A parent first registers their own account. The parent can then assign individual child accounts to multiple children. Within each child account, the parent is able to control how much money is available to the child, how often they receive new funds (a monthly allowance), which merchants the child is allowed to buy from, and any desired spending limits. The parent is also able to \\"turn off\\" the child accounts, and request notifications when purchases are made. The child is able to log into their account, which tracks recent purchases, funds available, savings goals and charitable donations. In June 2015, Oink updated their app to include P2P payments functionality between users and family and friends. User experience Upon checkout, the child chooses the Oink payment option. The child is then prompted to enter their Oink username and password. If there are sufficient funds in the account, and the purchase matches the parameters set up by the parent, the transaction is completed. Because the child never provides any personally identifiable information as a part of the purchase process (such as a name, residential address, email address or credit card), the transaction is COPPA compliant. The merchant is able to ship any physical items to the child using the mailing address provided in the parent account.

New York, 523 U.S. 767 (1998), was a United States Supreme Court case in which it was determined that roughly 83% of Ellis Island was part of New Jersey rather than New York. History The circumstances which led to an exclave of New York being located within New Jersey began in the colonial era, after the British takeover of New Netherland in 1664. An unusual clause in the colonial land grant outlined the territory that the proprietors of New Jersey would receive as being \\"westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river\\", rather than at the river's midpoint, as was common in other colonial charters. Attempts were made as early as 1804 to resolve the status of the state line. The City of New York claimed the right to regulate trade on all the waters. This was contested in Gibbons v. Ogden, which decided that the regulation of interstate commerce fell under the authority of the federal government, thus influencing competition in the newly developing steam ferry service in New York Harbor. In 1830, New Jersey planned to bring suit to clarify the border, but the case was never heard. The matter was resolved with a compact between the states, ratified by U.S. Congress in 1834, which set the boundary line between them as the middle of the Hudson River and New York Harbor, but granted all the islands in the channel to New York. This was later confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in other cases which also expounded on the compact. Map of Ellis Island showing New York in dark green surrounded by New Jersey The federal government began expanding the island by land reclamation in the late 19th century to accommodate its immigration station, and the expansions continued in stages until 1934. New Jersey contended that the artificial portions of the island were part of New Jersey, since they were outside New York's border. Jurisdictional disputes reemerged in the 1980s with the renovation of Ellis Island, and then again in the 1990s with the proposed redevelopment of the south side. New Jersey sued in 1997.Sheahan, Matthew. \\"My Grandmother Is the Greatest\\" Knot Magazine, May 4, 2004. Since the land added by the federal government was not expressly granted to New York by the interstate compact, and was placed in water that had been expressly granted to New Jersey, the majority ruled that this \\"new\\" land (decades old by this time) must belong to New Jersey. The minority dissent used historical reasons and \\"common-sense inference\\" as their basis for supporting New York's claim. Aftermath According to the court decision, all land originally given to New York by the compact (the original, natural Ellis Island) remains under the jurisdiction of New York, but any and all land reclaimed from the waters after that point is under the jurisdiction of New Jersey. The island covers a land area of . The two states jointly negotiated a post-trial settlement to decide exactly where and how to draw the lines in accordance with the Supreme Court decision. The original island and other areas negotiated in that post-trial settlement, totaling , to this day remains part of New York that is a landlocked enclave within New Jersey. The case is possibly the first to use GIS in determining a Supreme Court decision. Although the court decision has changed the state territorial sovereignty of most parts of the island, the actual current landowner (holder of the title of Ellis Island) is the federal government. Very few activities on the island were directly affected by the transfer of sovereignty, but the decision did affect some instances of sales taxes.

In 1622, Rubens painted the first twelve oil sketches that were used as guides, and the tapestries themselves were woven in the workshop of Marc Comans and Fran√ßois de la Planche in the Faubourg Saint-Marcel in Paris by 1625, transforming each small sketch (perhaps two feet per side) into a sumptuous creation of wool, silk, and gold and silver threads that could easily fill a wall. An additional five designs were painted by Cortona in 1630 and woven in the atelier of Cardinal Francesco Barberini in Rome over the next decade. Historical information The series was commissioned in 1622 when Rubens was in Paris discussing the paintings he was designing for the Luxembourg Palace for Marie de M√©dicis. Although the popular consensus has long been that the tapestries were commissioned by Louis XIII, based upon a 1626 letter by Rubens, art historians have begun to question this conclusion in recent decades. New evidence, such the fact that the designs were listed as the property of de la Planche upon his death, establishing a weak form of copyright, has muddied the issue. One theory is that Rubens only cited the king as the commissioner of the tapestries in the aforementioned letter in order to increase their perceived importance because his payment was overdue. Financial evidence strongly indicates that Rubens himself ordered the cartoons from which the tapestries would be woven at the personal expense of 500 livres, making him a primary mover behind the project. Louis XIII's lack of investment in the project is indicated by the fact that he immediately gave the first seven tapestries completed to the papal legate Cardinal Barberini in 1625, even though Barberini was at first unwilling to accept so princely a gift. Barberini eventually acquiesced, and commissioned an additional five tapestries from Pietro da Cortona, another Baroque master who happened to be the artistic director of Barberini's newly founded atelier. He repeated only one design from the Rubens set, the apparition of the cross. Cortona also designed several smaller tapestries such as portieres and a baldachin to furnish an entire room, and painted the ceiling of the salon where they were displayed. The dossal he designed, featuring an immense golden statue of Constantine, hung behind the throne of Urban VIII, Barberini's uncle. The life of the first Christian monarch would have special relevance for a king whose own father experienced such a notable conversion to Catholicism. While the subject matter could plausibly have been chosen by Louis XIII himself, it also may have been selected by Comans and de la Planche to appeal to him and earn Rubens a royal appointment. Rubens himself may have had a hand in deciding the theme, since his intense study of the classical era, including the acquisitions of many antiquities, made him very well suited to tackle the historical intricacies of the subject. Rubens drew on Cardinal Cesare Baronio's Annales Ecclesiastici (1588‚Äì1607) for inspiration and historical detail. Baronio based his writings on the contemporary accounts of Eusebius. This third-hand information, coupled with his deep historical knowledge, enabled Rubens to craft scenes that were so accurate that Louis' inspectors lauded him for portraying so precisely \\"even the nails of the boots\\". Rubens' designs proved highly popular and were woven several times by the Comans-La Planche workshop over the next decades, although they tended to evolve away from the originals. Cortona's tapestries were only woven once. The sole complete set remained with the Barberini collection in Rome until 1889. The tapestries were split up and passed through various hands before being reunited by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation and given to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1959. The sketches remain widely scattered, many of them in private hands. Rubens' designs =The Marriages of Constantine and Fausta and of Constantia and Licinius= 250px 250px sketch: private collection, 18.625\\" x 25.375\\" (47.3 x 64.4 cm.) tapestry: Philadelphia, Philadelphia Museum of Art 15' 11\\" x 19' 11.5\\" (485.14 x 608.33 cm.) (all tapestries unless otherwise noted are held by the PMA) Although the weddings depicted actually occurred six years apart, most scholars accept the anachronism as an attempt to create a stronger link between Constantine and Louis XIII, whose own marriage to Anne of Austria was a double wedding also featuring the union of his sister to Anne's brother, Philip IV of Spain. The event occurs in a temple of Jupiter and Juno, who preside in the form of statuary. The main difference between the sketch and the tapestry can be seen in the depiction of Jupiter, who wears a stern countenance and brandishes his thunderbolt in the former, quite suitable considering the conflict that would soon arise between the Constantine and Licinius. However, in the final tapestry, Jupiter wears a more beneficent mien and holds his thunderbolt less threatening, as befits the happy union between the royal houses of France and Spain. =The Emblem of Christ Appearing to Constantine= 250px sketch: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 18.186\\" x 22.063\\" (46.2 x 56 cm.) tapestry: Paris, Mobilier National In this scene, the Chi-Rho monogram of Christ appears before Constantine in the sky at noon just prior to his battle with Maxentius. In a dream, he learns that placing this emblem on his banner assures him of triumph over Maxentius, his co-emperor. Rubens follows Eusebius quite closely, but replaces the flaming cross he described with the monogram in Lactantius' chronicle. One soldier, looking at Constantine rather than the vision, points with the labarum, or military standard, to the next scene. =The Labarum= 150px sketch: private collection, 13.9\\" x 10.8\\" (35.4 x 27.5 cm.) tapestry: Paris, Mobilier National This episode depicts the moments just before the Battle of Milvian Bridge, as Constantine (already crowned with a victor's laurels) presents his labarum. This has been emblazoned with Christ's symbol, as he was instructed. The monogram of Rubens' usual panel maker, Michiel Vrient, is impressed on the back of the panel, along with a branded \\"A\\" that indicates the panel was prepared about 1621-22. =The Collapse of the Milvian Bridge and the Death of Maxentius= 250px sketch: London, Wallace Collection, 14.5\\" x 25\\" (36.83 x 63.5 cm.) tapestry: 15' 11\\" x 24' 5\\" (485.14 x 744.22 cm.) This tapestry depicts Constantine's defeat of his co-emperor Maxentius in 312 at the Battle of Milvian Bridge. The stone bridge's right arch is interrupted by wooden beams, indicating that Rubens followed Baronio's suggestion that Maxentius tampered with the bridge to trap Constantine. Instead, he was hoist on his own petard when it collapsed early, sending him plummeting into the river, where the weight of his own armor drowned him. Rubens also drew heavily on his own 1615 depiction of the battle of the Greeks and the Amazons, another bridge battle. =The Triumphant Entry of Constantine into Rome= 250px 225px sketch: Indianapolis, Indianapolis Museum of Art, 19\\" x 25.5\\" (48.26 x 64.77 cm.) tapestry: 15' 11.75\\" x 17' 10.313\\" (487.054 x 544.355 cm.) This tapestry depicts Constantine returning to Rome in triumph after defeating his co- emperor, Maxentius. Having called upon the Christian God at Milvian Bridge, Constantine legitimized the Christian religion, offering it new status and protection. Accordingly, the Greek symbol for Christ can be seen on the imperial banner, and pagan priests are pushed aside by a personification of Roma honoring Constantine. Rubens used the Arch of Constantine as inspiration, mimicking the form and presentation of its triumphal procession relief. The semi-derelict state of the architecture may refer to the imminent rebirth of the battered city. Constantine's legitimacy is relentlessly pounded home by the heralding of Fame and Victory, as well as the presence of a lictor bearing the fasces that symbolize his authority. In transforming the work from sketch to tapestry, the composition was horizontally compressed, decreasing the gap between Constantine and Roma and so diminishing the sense of movement. Additional architectural detail and foliage were added. =The Trophy= 150px sketch: private collection, 15\\" x 11.5\\" (38.1 x 29.21 cm.) tapestry: Paris, Mobilier National Again following Eusebius, Rubens depicts Constantine setting up a trophy of victory in Rome after his defeat of Maxentius. A winged Victory crowns him in front of a collection of implements of war. A bearded head on a pole likely is Maxentius himself, whose head was cut off and carried back to Rome on a spear according to Baronio. =The Baptism of Constantine= 250px sketch: private collection, 17.75\\" x 22.813\\" (45.085 x 57.945 cm.) tapestry: 15' 8\\" x 17' 10.75\\" (477.52 x 545.465 cm.) In order to maintain a safe distance from the Arian Heresy condemned by the Council of Nicaea, Rubens ignored Eusebius' account for once and instead used the much later Vita Silvestri, a medieval collection of legends. Thus, Constantine is here safely baptized by Pope Sylvester in Rome, rather than Nicomedia as actually occurred. The main difference between sketch and tapestry is the fact that the later includes Constantine's crown on a nearby cushion, a reference to a legend that a spontaneous flame appeared over the baptismal font and would not be extinguished until Constantine removed his crown. =Constantine Investing His Son Crispus with Command of the Fleet= sketch: Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, 14.4\\" x 11.9\\" (36.576 x 30.226 cm.) tapestry: Paris, Mobilier National Crispus was Constantine's eldest son, borne by a concubine. Legend states that he assumed command of the imperial fleet before the campaign against Licinius, the land-based half of which is depicted in the next tapestry. The seaside setting and inclusion of Neptune plus the rudder with which he is presented, symbolizing government, add up to a clear reference to Crispus' naval command. Baronio went further, comparing the moment to God entrusting Jesus with mankind's salvation. =Constantine Defeating Licinius= sketch: Kansas City, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, 14.625\\" x 22.625\\" (37.15 x 57.47 cm.) tapestry: Paris, Mobilier National Constantine's brother-in-law and co-ruler Licinius was defeated not once but twice by Constantine for continuing to persecute Christians. This tapestry depicts the first battle, fought on land and led by Constantine himself, in a laurel wreath. =Constantine Worshiping the True Cross= 150px 200px sketch: private collection, 13.9\\" x 13.3\\" (35.306 x 33.782 cm.) tapestry: 16' 3\\" x 16' 6\\" (495.3 x 502.92 cm.) According to legend, Constantine's mother St. Helena discovered the true cross in Jerusalem and was rejuvenated, explaining her youthful appearance in Rubens' depiction. The tapestry differs from the sketch in the enlargement of the background architecture, apparently to give greater emphasis to the environment of the scene. =The Founding of Constantinople= 200px 200px sketch: private collection, 6.3\\" x 16\\" (16.002 x 40.64 cm.) tapestry: 15' 10.5\\" x 15' 9\\" (483.87 x 480.06 cm.) The building of Constantinople occurred 324-330. The eagle flying overhead with a branch of broom depicts the legend of how the emperor chose the site for his city. It was taken as a good omen since broom was used to mark the enclosure of the city. In the sketch, the workman's displayed paper is blank, but the tapestry sketches in the ground plan of the Pantheon. =The Death of Constantine= 200px 200px sketch: private collection, 13.4\\" x 13.2\\" (34.036 x 33.528 cm.) tapestry: 16' .5\\" x 16' 4\\" (488.95 x 497.84 cm.) Constantine's death in 337 at Nicomedia, was not in fact attended by any of his three surviving sons Constantius II, Constantine II, or Constans as depicted here. All three did inherit part of his kingdom, represented here by the orb of sovereignty being handed over by Constantine. =The Triumph of Rome= 200px sketch: The Hague, Mauritshuis, 21.3\\" x 27.2\\" (54 x 69 cm.) This thirteenth sketch was completed by Rubens, but replaced by The Death of Constantine when the tapestries were manufactured, having been deemed unsuitable. It is full of allegorical figures, like liberated Rome, two winged Victories, and Romulus and Remus, which is likely why it was rejected in a series focusing on real, historical elements of Constantine's life. Cortona's designs Unlike Rubens, Cortona crafted both the initial sketch and the enlarged cartoon from which the tapestries were actually woven. The surviving cartoons are now held by the Corsini Gallery in Florence. =Apparition of the Monogram of Christ= tapestry: 16' 2\\" x 11' 5\\" (492.67 x 347.98 cm.) This is the sole repeated incident between the two artists. When depicting the same event as Rubens, Cortona opted to display the fiery cross described by Eusebius instead of the Chi-Rho monogram. =Constantine Fighting the Lion= 100px cartoon: 10' 6.375\\" x 8' 5.5\\" (320.993 x 257.81 cm.) tapestry: 16' 5\\" x 9' 9\\" (500.38 x 297.18 cm.) This image of a young Constantine thrusting his sword through a lion's mouth while onlookers admire is based on a legend illustrating his bravery even when a mere boy. =Constantine Burning the Memorials= cartoon: 10' 9.5\\" x 10' 4.375\\" (328.93 x 315.913 cm.) tapestry: 16' 3\\" x 15' (495.3 x 457.2 cm.) This tapestry illustrates the tax concessions instituted by Constantine in favor of the Christian church. =Constantine Destroying the Idols= cartoon: 10' 5.5\\" x 7' 5.313\\" (318.77 x 226.855 cm.) tapestry: 16' 6\\" x 12' 4\\" (505.968 x 375.92 cm.) During the increased efforts to quash paganism following 323, laws prohibited sacrifices to their gods and ordered their temples destroyed. Here, the violent smashing of pagan statuary is immediately followed by the placement of a statue of Jesus on the vacated pedestal. =Campaign Against Licinius, Sea Battle= 250px cartoon: 10' 7.5\\" x 19' 7.25\\" (323.85 x 597.535 cm.) tapestry: 16' 8\\" x 23' 4\\" (508 x 711.2 cm.) This tapestry complements Rubens' by depicting the second half of the campaign against Licinius. In this second confrontation, Crispus' victory at sea cemented his father as the supreme ruler in both east and west.

Eventually the family moved to Baku (Azerbaijan) where Garibian got his general education. In 1943 he graduated from school in Baku and went to Moscow. Physical science was Garibian's passion in life. Even at a very young age he followed news in the world of physics and was very excited when in 1942 he learned about the Alikhanian brothers‚Äô expedition to Mount Aragats (Armenia) in order to search for protons in cosmic rays. Garibian was accepted into the Department of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow State University which he graduated from in 1948 immediately to leave for Yerevan and join the Yerevan Physics Institute, which was founded by Artyom Alikhanian in 1943. After that time Garibian dedicated himself to scientific research in Theoretical physics, in the fields of Quantum electrodynamics, Cosmic rays, and High energy particles. ,\\"Health Physics Division annual progress report\\", Oak Ridge National Laboratory, p.137,1959 Garibian G.M, Chi Y.,\\"THEORY OF RADIATION GENERATED BY CHARGED PARTICLES PASSING THROUGH CONTINUOUS PERIODIC MEDIUM\\",\\"Nasa Technical Documents\\",1973 \\"PHENIX TRD Simulation\\", 2003 All his life he worked at the Yerevan Physics Institute consecutively as Researcher, Scientific Secretary of the Institute, Deputy Director and Head of Laboratory.

One of the problems bothering experimental physicists working with cosmic rays at that time were measurements of very high energies of the relativistic particles in the cosmic radiation, as with the increase of energy levels of the particles the available methods of registration of their energies were becoming less and less effective. Garibian tried to develop methods that would help to resolve that problem. As a starting point of his research, he used results published in the article written by Ginzburg and Frank in 1946, where the theoretical existence of Transition Radiation was predicted. The new type of radiation appearing as a result of charged particle passing through the boundary between two layers of matter. In 1959, Garibyan discovered X-Ray Transition Radiation, the intensity of which had a linear dependence on the Lorentz factor of the particle. Due to this feature, X-ray Transition Radiation received immediate practical implementation, as it made it possible to identify ultra- relativistic charged particles and to measure their energies .R A Sardaryan, Y.G. Shahnazaryan, Yang Chi \\"Gregory Markarovich Garibian\\", AS of ASSR, Matherials to the Bibliography of Scientists of the ASSR, v.40, p.31-32, Publisher AS ASSR, Yerevan, 1987 (in Russian and Armenian) In following years Garibian with his disciples continued the development of the Theory of Transition Radiation.

The research of TR became more powerful after the Yerevan Synchrotron started its work in 1967. Here, theoretical investigation of TR headed by Garibian was correlated with the experimental research headed by A. Alikhanian. Those studies played a decisive role in prompting similar work throughout the world: in the Brookhaven National Laboratory (by prof. Luke Chia-Liu Yuan), at Stanford Accelerator, and in different research centers of Europe .R A Sardaryan, Y.G.

In the years 1965-1969 he worked also as a Chief of the Theoretical Department of Institute of Radiophysics and Electronics, Armenian AS. Under his leadership many of his disciples achieved their Doctoral degrees and became prominent scientists. He was also interested in documenting the history of progress of physics in Armenia.

Jan Seklucjan (born either in 1498 or around 1510, died 1578) (also known as Jan from Siekluki, Seclucian, Seclucianus) was a Polish Lutheran theologian, an activist in the Protestant Reformation in Poland and Ducal Prussia (a Polish fief), translator, writer, publisher and printer. Biography Little is known about his early life. According to his name he perhaps was born or came from the village of Siekluki in the Duchy of Masovia, near Radom. Originally Seklucjan was a Dominican. After studying at Leipzig he moved in around 1543 to Pozna≈Ñ, where he served as a Lutheran preacher. Threatened by the local bishop with a charge of heresy, in 1544 he found refuge at K√∂nigsberg (Kr√≥lewiec, today Kaliningrad) in Ducal Prussia, at the time a fief of the Kingdom of Poland. There he lived under the protection of Duke Albert of Prussia and began publishing and printing Lutheran literature in the Polish language. He was encouraged in his endeavors by Duke Albert, who wanted to have the Bible and catechism translated into the vernacular language of the many refugees from Poland, who became his subject. Seklucjan was in charge of the parish of the church in Steindamm (part of K√∂nigsberg), which served as a local center for Lutheran Poles. In many of his works he cooperated with the Polish Lutheran theologian Andrzej Samuel. Works Seklucjan focused mostly on translations into Polish. In 1544 or 1545 he published a Polish language catechism, entitled Wyznanie wiary chrze≈õcija≈Ñskiej (Profession of the Christian Faith), most likely based on Martin Luther's Small Catechism, a second edition of which was printed in 1547. Also in 1547 he published a hymnal, Pie≈õni duchowne a nabo≈ºne (\\"Holy and divine hymns\\"), which included 35 religious hymns, including eight written by Luther. In 1544 Albert of Prussia issued an edict requiring that the Bible be read in Polish to the growing number of Polish Protestants in the Duchy. To that effect he sought to procure a Polish language translator. His first choice was the theologian Rapagelanus, chair at the University of K√∂nigsberg. However, Rapagelanus died in 1545 before completing the task. Albert's second choice was the theologian Stapelage, who soon became embroiled in controversy and ended up converting back to Catholicism. It was at this point that Albert commissioned Seklucjan. As a result, in 1551 Seklucjan began publishing translations of the New Testament into Polish. First, in that year, he published the Gospel of Matthew, then the other Evangelists, and in 1553 the complete New Testament. In these translations, Seklucjan collaborated with and relied on Stanis≈Çaw Murzynowski, and it is likely that most of the translation work was done by Murzynowski, with Seklucjan merely taking the credit. Additionally, the translation of the New Testament into Polish was delayed by a dispute between Seklucjan and another Polish translator, Jan Sandecki- Malecki. While the origins of the dispute concerned the usefulness of the Czech language as an aid in translating the New Catechism (with Sandecki- Malecki extolling the usefulness of Czech and Seklucjan insisting on purely \\"Polish words\\"), it quickly evolved to include doctrinal matters. Ultimately, thanks to support from Andreas Osiander, Seklucjan was given the exclusive right to the translation for four years, although he was forbidden from including his own commentary (aside from a preface). Seklucjan also wrote original works, including Rozprawa kr√≥tka a prosta o nikt√≥rych ceremonijach i ustawach ko≈õcielnych (A short and simple treatise on some ceremonies and practices of the church\\"), a poetic dialog between a \\"student\\" (the author) who had just come back from travels abroad, and his elders who had stayed home. He also translated the works of the vernacular Polish poet and the founder of Polish literary language and literature, Miko≈Çaj Rej.

With origins in the Domesday manor of Hantone, it was first recorded as belonging to the Yeo family in the mid-14th century and was then owned successively by the Rolle, Walpole and Trefusis families. The mansion house was destroyed by fire in 1795. In 1812 Lord Clinton purchased the manor and mansion of nearby Huish, renamed it Heanton Satchville, and made it his seat. The nearly-forgotten house was featured in the 2005 edition of Rosemary Lauder's \\"Vanished Houses of North Devon\\".Lauder (2005), pp. 3, 49‚Äì50. A farmhouse now occupies the former stable block with a large tractor shed where the house once stood. The political power-base of the Rolle family of Heanton Satchville was the pocket borough seat of Callington in Cornwall, acquired in 1601 when Robert Rolle (died 1633) purchased the manor of Callington.Hunneyball (2010) Description of mansion The mansion was at one time \\"one of the most imposing houses ever to exist in Devon\\".Lauder (2005), p. 49. The Hearth Tax return of 1674 recorded 26 hearths for the house, making it the second largest house in Devon after Werrington.Lauder (2005), pp. 49‚Äì50. It was described by Rev. John Swete in 1789. Referring to it as a \\"vast pile built at different times\\", he noted a carved date of 1639 which he concluded was not the earliest date of the building but only served to date the portal above which it was located. The parapet walls, the mullions of the windows and the pavement were all made of moorstone. The south side of the house had a \\"most noble terrace\\" of 130 paces in width, with a bowling green and adjacent walks. The property afforded views of several churches and the house of Sir James Innes in Huish to the east of the property.Gray (1997), pp. 25-27.

Montague-Smith, Debrett's Peerage (1968), p. 265 & see Baron Clinton In 1795, the house was destroyed by fire and Rev. John Swete reported in his journal of 1797, when he was visiting John Inglett Fortescue at nearby Buckland Filleigh, that he had seen a painting by Rubens that Baron Clinton had himself rescued from the fire and had sent to Fortescue to look after while he was still homeless. Swete also reported that in the same fire Mr Fortescue had lost a much-valued family portrait of an ancestor which he had sent to Heanton Satchville to be restored by Lord Clinton's picture restorer.Gray (1999), p. 113. In 1797, the 17th Baron died, leaving his son and heir Robert Cotton St John Trefusis, 18th Baron Clinton (1787‚Äì1832) a minor aged ten. Next, George Cholmondeley, 4th Earl of Cholmondeley (1749‚Äì1827), later 1st Marquess, who was heir to the Walpole estates, launched a legal suit against the young Robert Trefusis for possession of the former Rolle estates. Although the legal case took nine years to resolve, it was decided in favour of Baron Clinton.Lauder (2002), p. 69. The house at Petrockstowe was never rebuilt, but in 1812 the 18th Baron purchased the contiguous manor of Huish to the east together with its capital mansion Innes House, made it the new family seat, and renamed it Heanton Satchville. Stone pillar in cow barn at Heanton Barton Samuel Lysons wrote in 1822: \\"Heanton Sachville, which was some time a seat of the Rolles, and afterwards of the Earls of Orford, was burnt down several years ago. A farm-house has been fitted up out of the ruins. The deer-park is still kept up\\". The only remnant of the original mansion is the stable block, now the site of a modern farmhouse called Heanton Barton. A large modern tractor shed occupies the flat site of the former mansion house.Lauder (2005), p. 53.

History Detail of the statue Following the fire which destroyed parts of the Palace of Westminster in the 19th century, the question whether or not Oliver Cromwell should have a statue in the reconstruction of the Palace was debated in the pages of The Times, and Punch magazine satirised the issue. The question was raised once more in the House of Commons in 1856, with John George Phillimore saying \\"any man who could object to a statue of Cromwell must be imbued with bigotry and party spirit in the highest degree\\". It was raised several more times over the following years by supporters of a statue. The government publicly proposed a statue of Cromwell for the first time in 1895, which immediately resulted in members of the public questioning the decision due to the divided opinions about Cromwell. The proposal ended in a parliamentary debate and vote, in which the Government narrowly avoided defeat when the Unionists sided with them while the majority of the Conservatives and the Irish National Party voted against the measure because of Cromwell's history in Ireland. The decision was condemned by newspapers in Ireland. Following further opposition from the Irish National Party, the proposal was withdrawn on 17 July 1895. Herbert Gladstone, First Commissioner of Works, approved the statue with the funding coming from an anonymous private donor. In 1899 his successor Aretas Akers-Douglas confirmed the statue's proposed location as the sunken garden next to Westminster Hall. The statue, cast in bronze by Singer of Frome, was unveiled on 31 October 1899, followed by a speech on Cromwell by former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, who was later revealed as the anonymous donor who paid for the statue, and whose wife was the sole heir to the Rothschild's family fortune. In 2004, a group of Members of Parliament including Tony Banks proposed a motion that the statue should be removed and melted down. The move was not supported, and other MPs suggested that the statue should be moved somewhere else. Restoration work took place in August 2008, removing dirt and a coat of black wax which had been previously applied to the bronzework. This changed the colour of the statue from black to a more natural brown, and potassium sulphide was applied in order to even out the colour of both Cromwell and the lion. It was coated in a clear wax in order to ensure that the natural finish remained. The conservation work was completed in time for the 350th anniversary of Cromwell's death on 3 September 2008.

Biography He was a member of a family which at the date of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) came from Dauphin√© to Geneva to seek protection for religious reasons. The most prominent member of the family was the Radical statesman James Fazy, his great uncle, whose biography he wrote in 1887. Henri Fazy studied at Geneva for his doctorate in philosophy and law, became a member of the Genevese cantonal parliament in 1868, and was a member of the cantonal executive from 1897 until his death. He was a Radical in politics, but of a more moderate type than his great uncle, and founded a Radical group opposed to the more extreme section which his great uncle led. Carteret, the successor of James Fazy as leader of the latter, died in 1889, and henceforward Henri Fazy played a more and more prominent part in Radical Genevese politics. As a member of the canton of Geneva's executive, Fazy had charge of the department of finances and was much criticised by Gustave Ador, the leader of the Democrats or Whigs. In 1880, his proposal to separate church and state in Geneva was rejected by the people but was finally accepted by them in 1907. He was a member of the Swiss Conseil National from 1896 to 1899, and from 1902 onwards. After the Radical defeat of 1918, Fazy was the only member of his party who was not turned out of office, but he became more and more conservative as time went on. Tomb of Henri Fazy, Cimeti√®re des Rois, Geneva. For many years, Fazy was the archivist of Geneva, and also a professor of Swiss history at the University of Geneva (1896-9 and from 1902). Writing As professor of Swiss history, he wrote much on the history of Geneva. Among his works are: *Life of James Fazy (1887) *Constitutions de Gen√®ve (1890) *L'Alliance de 1584 entre Berne, Zurich et Gen√®ve (1891) *Les Suisses et la Neutralit√© de Savoie (1895) *La Guerre du Pays de Gex et l'Occupation genevoise, 1589-1601 (1897) *Histoire de Gen√®ve a l'Epoque de l'Escalade, 1589-1601 (1902) *Gen√®ve et Charles Emmanuel (1909) He published many papers in the Proceedings of the Institut National Genevois.

It is an essential component in the process flow for using the Experience API (xAPI) standard by ADL or the Caliper standard by IMS Global. The Experience API is also known as the \\"Tin Can API\\" and is an Open Source e-learning specification developed after AICC and SCORM. The concept of the LRS was introduced to the e-learning industry in 2011, and proposes a shift to the way e-learning specifications function. History SCORM has been the e-learning industry software specification for interoperability from 2001 until the present. The governing body of SCORM, Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL), realized that the specification was not keeping up with advancements in technology, and that it needed to be updated. ADL issued a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) asking for assistance with updating the SCORM specification. The BAA was awarded to Rustici Software, and the result was a one-year research and development project called Project Tin Can. The final result of Project Tin Can was the Experience API along with the concept of the LRS. Overview xAPI-enabled learning activities generate statements, or records of e-learning in the form of \\"I did this\\" or \\"Actor verb object\\". These statements are transmitted over HTTP or HTTPS to an LRS. The main function of an LRS is to store and retrieve the data that's generated from Experience API statements. An LRS can exist inside a traditional learning management system (LMS), or on its own. LRSs can communicate learner data with other systems, such as LMSs, sensor-enabled devices, mobile technology, and other LRSs. Systems sending data to an LRS are known as \\"Activity Providers.\\" Individual learners can have their own LRSs, or Personal Data Lockers, in which they store all of their learning data for their own personal records. xAPI statements are capable of being sent to multiple LRSs at once. With traditional LMSs, a learner's data stays with the organization that administers the LMS. When the LRS is introduced, the sharing of learning data is possible, and the learning data can follow the learner wherever the learner goes (for example, from job to job or from school to school.) LRSs offer the ability to create very in-depth e-learning analytics because of the large amounts of learning data they record and store. Traditional e-learning specifications like SCORM are limited to storing simple data points such as a final score, or that a course has been started or completed. With the statement structure that the LRS records, there are many data points that can be reported against. Reports can be pulled on any number of combinations of \\"actor\\", \\"verb\\" and \\"object\\". However, an LRS that is built strictly to the Experience API specification doesn't have a built-in reporting mechanism. The LRS administrator (or the administrator of the LMS in which the LRS exists) must provide means to access the data in the LRS, and in turn create a reporting system for the data.

Its design and ongoing implementation is described in a blogParaSail blog and on its official website.ParaSail website ParaSail uses a pointer-free programming model, where objects can grow and shrink, and value semantics are used for assignment. It has no global garbage collected heap. Instead, region-based memory management is used throughout. Types can be recursive, so long as the recursive components are declared optional. There are no global variables, no parameter aliasing, and all subexpressions of an expression can be evaluated in parallel. Assertions, preconditions, postconditions, class invariants, etc., are part of the standard syntax, using a Hoare-like notation. Any possible race conditions are detected at compile time. Initial design of ParaSail began in September 2009, by S. Tucker Taft. Both an interpreter using the ParaSail virtual machine, and an LLVM-based ParaSail compiler are available. Work stealing is used for scheduling ParaSail's light-weight threads. The latest version can be downloaded from the ParaSail website. Description The syntax of ParaSail is similar to Modula, but with a class-and-interface-based object-oriented programming model more similar to Java or C#. More recently, the parallel constructs of ParaSail have been adapted to other syntaxes, to produce Java- like, Python-like, and Ada-like parallel languages, dubbed, respectively, Javallel, Parython, and Sparkel (named after the Ada subset SPARK on which it is based). Compilers and interpreters for these languages are included with the ParaSail implementation.

They make friends including a literature teacher named Dexter and his girlfriend Suzanne. As they try to adjust to the New York city atmosphere, they become disillusioned with America, eventually buying a firearm for self-defense.

It premiered on Eleven on 22 June 2011. The episode was written by Sarah Mayberry, directed by Jonathon Dutton, and executively produced by Susan Bower. \\"Episode 6188\\" revolves around Mark Brennan's (Scott McGregor) departure from the soap. The storyline sees Mark tell his girlfriend, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), that he is going into witness protection. He reveals that she has just 30 minutes to decide whether to stay behind in Erinsborough or leave with him. However, when she makes the choice to leave, she has trouble convincing her younger sister to come too. The soap's executive producer, Susan Bower, revealed that the team wanted Mark \\"to go out with a bang\\" and they took inspiration from the US drama 24 to create a special real- time episode. The show's script producer thought the technique was \\"the best way to do justice\\" to the character and his exit, although it proved to be a challenge for the crew as it was different from the normal storytelling process. \\"Episode 6188\\" focused on a 30-minute timeframe between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm, which is when Neighbours is broadcast in Australia. The episode was filmed over two nights and extra effort went into ensuring the continuity was right throughout. The episode received generally positive attention. A TV Week writer stated that it was \\"unmissable\\". The Sydney Morning Herald's Andrew Murfett believed the real-time aspect was \\"a clever device\\" for fans of the show who may have fallen out of touch with it. Cameron Adams from the Herald Sun chose the episode for his feature on the best television programs being broadcast on 22 June. Channel 5 included the episode in their \\"Top 20 Aussie Soap Moments of 2011\\" program, while Inside Soap proclaimed the episode was one of \\"The Best Bits of July\\" in their annual yearbook. Dutton earned a nomination for Best Direction in a TV Drama at the 2012 Australian Directors' Guild Awards. Plot Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) waits nervously for an answer from his girlfriend, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), about going into witness protection with him. He states that it is too dangerous for him to stay in Erinsborough and that she can bring her younger sister, Sophie (Kaiya Jones), with them. Kate tells Mark that she does not want to lose him and agrees to go. Mark reveals that they only have half an hour and heads over to his house to pack. Sophie returns home and Kate tells her that they are leaving town that night. An upset Sophie explains that she cannot pack her life up in a bag and refuses to go. Kate tells her the decision has already been made and they are leaving. As Mark is wondering whether to call his parents, his housemate, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), arrives home unexpectedly. When she enquires about his bag, he tells her he needs a change of clothes for a double shift. Kate finds Mark and asks for more time, but Mark tells her they do not have any. He gives her the details of the meeting point and they kiss, before Kate leaves him. Mark's other housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), gets in from work and realises Mark is leaving because of the harassment he has received due to exposing the corruption within the police force. Mark admits he is going into witness protection and he and Kyle say their goodbyes. Sophie decides to go with Kate and they hurry to meet Mark. At the meeting point, Mark's boss, Duncan Hayes (Paul Ireland), arrives and asks if Mark is ready. He replies that Kate is on her way, as he hands his wallet and phone over. Sophie struggles to keep up with her sister and tells her to go to Mark, as they can collect her on the way. Kate continues running, just as it starts to rain. Hayes tells Mark that they need to leave, but Mark asks him to wait for a few more minutes. When Kate reaches the meeting point, she finds no one there. Sophie questions whether Mark changed his mind and Kate runs home to Ramsay Street. She enters Mark's house calling his name and then receives a text message saying \\"I love you\\", which Mark sent from Hayes' phone. Kyle comforts Kate while she cries about Mark. Production =Conception and development= Scott McGregor called the episode \\"really intense and dark\\" and believed viewers would be on the edge of their seats waiting to find out what happens. In February 2011, McGregor announced his departure from Neighbours and a Herald Sun reporter stated that he would film his final scenes in April. On screen, his character was seen exposing corruption within the local police force and then receiving threats from some of his colleagues. McGregor later explained to a Press Association reporter that Mark's exit storyline would not be a happy one, as he is forced out of Ramsay Street. Mark is asked to enter a witness protection program and the night before he leaves, he realises he is still in love with his ex- girlfriend, Kate (Brewer). McGregor told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap \\"He hasn't been able to tell Kate that he's leaving before now ‚Äì but he just can't say goodbye, and asks her to come along with him. It's such a very big ask, so of course she has to give it a lot of thought.\\" Mark's departure was shown during a special real-time episode, which focused on a 30-minute timeframe. Executive producer Susan Bower revealed that the team wanted Mark \\"to go out with a bang\\" and commented that while the episode features about half a dozen people, it is mostly about Mark and Kate. The show's script producer, Emma Gordon, agreed that the real-time episode was \\"the best way to do justice\\" to the character and his exit. McGregor explained that while the producers were planning his character's exit, they took inspiration from the US drama 24. Gordon admitted to Tiffany Fox from The West Australian that the technique was a real challenge for Neighbours. She said \\"It is a bit different and a bit out of our normal storytelling process but it gives such a sense of tension which is exactly the feeling we wanted to create. When you have half an hour to make a decision that will affect the rest of your life, every excruciating minute counts.\\" =Filming= The episode sees Mark reveal that he only has 30 minutes before he has to leave for witness protection. He then tries to convince Kate to come with him. The storyline takes place between 6:30pm and 7:00pm, which is when Neighbours airs in Australia. The episode was filmed over two nights and Gordon told Fox that extra effort went into ensuring the continuity was \\"perfect.\\" Every minute had to be accounted for, including the commercial breaks and the time taken up by the actors walking from one house to another. Gordon commented that clocks and watches are used throughout the episode to keep the tension high. During an interview with a Channel 5 website reporter, Brewer said that filming the episode was similar to filming a regular episode of the soap, as the scenes were still shot out of order. She thought it was nice working in a short time period that did not jump from day to day. During the filming of the final scenes on location, the weather took a turn for the worse and it began to rain. However, Gordon added that it looked \\"spectacular and adds such an atmosphere.\\" Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer that the rain was the biggest challenge of the night shoot, as it was \\"beyond freezing\\". She also revealed that she ran in shoes that she had not broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added \\"It was incredibly stressful but I guess it was stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it.\\" McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed \\"The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other ‚Äì with the cast and crew watching!\\" Reception The real-time episode was broadcast on 22 June 2011 in Australia and on 20 July in the UK. It was watched by 408,000 Australian viewers upon its first airing, making Neighbours the highest rated show on digital multi- channels that night. In the UK, an audience of 1.30 million watched the episode. For his work on \\"Episode 6188\\", Dutton earned a nomination for Best Direction in a TV Drama at the 2012 Australian Directors' Guild Awards. A TV Week website writer called the episode \\"an edge-of-your-seat special\\", which was \\"unmissable\\". The Sydney Morning Herald's readers gave the episode three out of five stars, while the paper's television critic, Andrew Murfett, commented \\"The clock is omnipresent in tonight's 'real-time' Neighbours episode. The gimmick of the formatting ‚Äì the episode unfolds in real time over an action-packed 30 minutes on Ramsay Street ‚Äì means the clock appears almost every minute to remind us of what is a pressing deadline. It's a clever device for fans who have perhaps fallen out of touch with the folks at Erinsborough. In fact it's almost impossible not be at least mildly interested about the future prospects of Scott McGregor and Ashleigh Brewer in the aftermath of this 24-style ep.\\" A reporter for PopSugar Australia said \\"We love it when our favourite, long-running TV soapies surprise us with something new and a little different.\\" Cameron Adams from the Herald Sun included the episode in his feature on the best television programs being broadcast on 22 June, saying \\"Brooding cop Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) has 30 minutes to leave Erinsborough before the poop goes down with the dodgy police investigation that's been dragging on for months. Girlfriend Kate plans to leave with him, but her sister Sophie's not so keen on a life change.\\" Channel 5 included the episode in their \\"Top 20 Aussie Soap Moments of 2011\\" program, where it came second overall. A writer for the channel's website believed that it was clear from the start that Mark would be worthy of a memorable send-off, during a feature on the character's \\"best bits\\". A writer for the Inside Soap Yearbook, which was published at the end of 2011, proclaimed the episode was one of \\"The Best Bits of July\\". A reporter for the Daily Record stated \\"Goodbye Brennan ‚Äì we enjoyed having you and your hunky good looks around, but all good things must come to an end.\\" References External links *\\"Episode 6188\\" at the Official AU Neighbours website *\\"Episode 6188\\" at the Internet Movie Database Category:Neighbours episodes Category:2011 Australian television episodes Category:Works about witness protection ","title":"Episode 6188"},{"id":"36619328","text":"Kalateh-ye Zanganeh (, also Romanized as KalƒÅteh-ye Zanganeh) is a village in Zaveh Rural District, in the Central District of Zaveh County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

He met Sim√≥n Bol√≠var at the Guayaquil conference, resigned from his political offices in Peru and handed him the command of the Army of the Andes. San Mart√≠n returned to Argentina, and then left for Europe. He spent his later life in France, and died in Boulogne-sur-Mer on August 17, 1850.Galasso, p. 569 Departure After his retirement, San Mart√≠n intended to live in Cuyo, modern Argentina. The Argentine theater of the Spanish American wars of independence had ended, and by that point the conflict was restricted to northern South America. However, the Argentine Civil Wars had begun, between the unitarians, who wanted to organize the country as a unitary state centered on Buenos Aires, and the federals, who preferred a federation of provinces. San Mart√≠n had good relations with the federal caudillos Juan Bautista Bustos, Estanislao L√≥pez and Facundo Quiroga, and a personal feud with the unitarian leader Bernardino Rivadavia. However, he tried to stay neutral in the conflict. L√≥pez offered him his military support to depose the government of Buenos Aires, so that San Mart√≠n would rule instead, but he declined the offer. Aware of San Mart√≠n's influence, the government of Buenos Aires kept him under surveillance, intercepted his mail, and urged him to leave the country.Galasso, pp. 453‚Äì456 After San Mart√≠n's wife Mar√≠a de los Remedios de Escalada died in 1823, he returned to Buenos Aires. He wanted to take his daughter, Mar√≠a de las Mercedes, who was living with her mother's family, and spend some time with her in Europe, but the Escaladas did not give him a good reception. They resented the fact that he had not been present when Remedios died, and that he had refused to aid the city at the Battle of Cepeda. As the elections for a new governor were approaching, the government rushed through a law requiring that all candidates be natives of Buenos Aires, thus preventing San Mart√≠n from standing as he was born in Corrientes. San Mart√≠n left Buenos Aires and sailed to Europe.Galasso, pp. 457‚Äì465 European visit San Mart√≠n arrived in Le Havre, in France. The country was under the rule of Louis XVIII as a result of the Bourbon Restoration that followed the defeat of Napoleon. San Mart√≠n's books were deemed too liberal, so he was not allowed to enter the country. He therefore sailed on to Britain. He disembarked in Southampton and went to London. After a brief stay there, he moved to Brussels, where he enrolled his daughter in a school and stayed for some years. He joined the lodges \\"La Parfaite Amiti√©\\" and \\"Les Amis Philanthropes\\".Galasso, pp. 467‚Äì468 San Mart√≠n intended to stay in Brussels until his daughter finished her education and then retire to a farm in Argentina. During this time he got news of the final victory of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var in the war. He also received the news that the government of Buenos Aires had disbanded the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, and that Bernardo Monteagudo had been assassinated in Peru. Rivadavia visited Brussels and San Mart√≠n intended to challenge him to a duel, but was dissuaded by Diego Paroissien.Galasso, pp. 470‚Äì476 Attempted return The execution of Manuel Dorrego convinced San Mart√≠n to return to Europe. Brazil invaded and annexed the Banda Oriental in 1816. The Thirty-Three Orientals began the liberation of the province in 1825, which led to the Argentine-Brazilian War. Despite his feud with Rivadavia, San Mart√≠n wrote to Manuel Escalada instructing him to offer his military services to the government. He received no response; it is unclear whether Rivadavia rejected him or whether the Escaladas did not pass on his offer because of his known hostility toward San Mart√≠n. Rivadavia was ousted from power shortly after, as the provinces rejected the 1826 constitution, and Manuel Dorrego became head of government instead. This convinced San Mart√≠n to move back to the Americas, but the war ended during his journey home after British diplomacy forced Dorrego to sign the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo. San Mart√≠n had intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have been subjected to from the unitarians.Galasso, pp. 477‚Äì488 San Martin's plans were disrupted after his ship docked in R√≠o de Janeiro (where he used the pseudonym \\"Jos√© Matorras\\") and learned that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego. When he reached Montevideo San Martin received news that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego, and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. San Martin remained on board the ship after it docked in Buenos Aires, and returned with it to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable to put down the federal rebellion against him, and offered San Mart√≠n the government. The conditions of this offer, if any, are unknown. San Mart√≠n declined and returned to Europe.Galasso, pp. 489‚Äì495 Return to Europe San Mart√≠n returned to Brussels. He stayed in touch with the news from Europe and South America, and began to face economic problems. By this time the federal Juan Manuel de Rosas had begun to pacify the civil war started by Lavalle, and earned San Mart√≠n's admiration. They began to exchange letters, in friendly terms.Galasso, pp. 497‚Äì513 The Belgian Revolution against the Netherlands began in 1830. Lacking notable military leaders, the rebels requested San Mart√≠n to lead them, and offered him the command of their troops. He declined the offer, as when he settled in the country he had agreed to obey its laws. To avoid taking part in the conflict, he left Belgium and moved to Paris. He was also concerned by the cholera epidemic of 1831, but the disease was also present in Paris, where both San Mart√≠n and his daughter Mercedes became ill. They were helped by Mariano Balcarce. Mariano married Mercedes, and they had a daughter, Mar√≠a Mercedes.Galasso, pp. 513‚Äì521 In 1837 France began a blockade of the Rio de la Plata against Rosas. San Mart√≠n offered his military services to Rosas, but Rosas declined the offer: he thought the conflict would be resolved quickly, and did not want to disturb San Mart√≠n at his advanced age. San Mart√≠n condemned the role of the unitarians in that conflict, as they had allied themselves with France against their own nation.Galasso, pp. 523‚Äì538 San Mart√≠n wrote his will on January 23, 1844. He declared his daughter his heir, and bequeathed his curved saber to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The conflict between France and Argentina renewed in the Anglo-French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata, which San Mart√≠n also condemned. During this time he met Florencio Varela and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento.Galasso, pp. 545‚Äì558 During the 1848 revolution, San Martin left Paris and moved to Boulogne-sur-Mer, a small city in northern France. He was almost blind and had many health problems because of his advanced age, but continued to write letters and keep in touch with the news from South America. He died at three o'clock on August 17, 1850, shortly after receiving news of the Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade.Galasso, pp. 559‚Äì570 Bibliography * * References San Martin Category:Jos√© de San Mart√≠n ","title":"Later life of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n"},{"id":"36619362","text":"Kang-e Zeytun (, also Romanized as Kang-e Zeyt≈´n) is a village in Zaveh Rural District, in the Central District of Zaveh County, Razavi Khorasan Province, Iran.

He played on two undefeated national championship teams at UCLA. He did not lose a game in college until his final season, helping the school to a record 88-game consecutive win streak. Curtis was the first African American to play basketball at his high school in Florida, where he won two state championships and was named the state's basketball player of the year in 1969. He left his home state of Florida to attend college at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). A small but quick point guard, he helped the Bruins establish a national collegiate record of seven consecutive national titles under coach John Wooden. After earning a Master of Business Administration (MBA) at UCLA, Curtis returned to Florida and worked for the state's Department of Commerce and later a Florida business council assisting minorities. Early life Curtis was born in Tampa, Florida into an affluent family. His mother was a social activist and a co-founder of the Florida chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and his father worked for Central Life insurance company. Curtis' grandfather was the founder of the insurance company, which in 1986 was one of the largest black-owned insurance companies in the country. After Curtis' parents divorced, his mother became a professor at Florida State University. Curtis was one of the first 50 black students to attend Leon High School in Tallahassee. He was the first black to play on Leon's basketball team, and he was named the state's Prep/High School Basketball Player of the Year in 1969. Leon had a record of 79‚Äì3 during Curtis' career, winning two state championships. On April 10, 2015, the school retired his No. 33. College Curtis considered attending University of Florida or Florida State, but his mother encouraged him to be independent and move away from home. His uncle in Compton, California contacted UCLA about Curtis attending the school. Curtis earned a scholarship to UCLA, where he played basketball under Wooden. Curtis began at UCLA along with Larry Farmer on the freshman squad; players were not allowed to play varsity basketball their first year in college, a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) limitation at the time. He did not play his second year, having redshirted, as the Bruins won the national championship. He started playing varsity ball on the 1971‚Äì72 team, which also included first-year players Bill Walton, Keith Wilkes (later known as Jamaal Wilkes), and Greg Lee. UCLA again won the national championship that season, their sixth consecutive title. The Bruins outscored opponents by an NCAA-record 30.3 points per game during an undefeated 30‚Äì0 season, extending the school's winning streak to 45 consecutive games; UCLA had last lost in 1971 to Notre Dame. Wooden that season started Lee over Curtis. Lee was bigger than the small, Curtis, and he was more effective than Curtis at getting the ball into the high post and complementing Walton, who was also close friends with Lee. Wooden also believed Curtis would be more valuable providing a needed spark to the team off the bench, a role the coach did not believe Lee could fill. Curtis played a large role with eight points and six assists in the championship game as UCLA defeated Florida State, 81‚Äì76. Wooden in the first half replaced Lee with the quicker Curtis, which along with a strong performance by Walton helped turn an early deficit into an 11-point halftime lead. UCLA team after their seventh consecutive championship in 1973 Curtis continued a Wooden tradition of quick, strong-shooting, black point guards at UCLA, established earlier by Walt Hazzard, Lucius Allen, Mike Warren, and Henry Bibby. Wooden said he was best in a fast-paced running game and commended his defensive skills. Curtis became a starter his junior year, beating out the incumbent, Lee. He started the first 10 games of the season before becoming ill with the London flu. He was out for two weeks, and his weight dropped from . When he returned, Lee had re-established himself as the starter, and Curtis became a key reserve. He did not brood over his new role, and Wooden called him a good team player. Curtis sparked the team with 12 points off the bench in a 54‚Äì39 win over San Francisco in the quarterfinals of the 1973 NCAA tournament. His play was cited by both Wooden and opposing coach Bob Gaillard as keys to the game's outcome. In the semifinals, he led the team in scoring with 22 points to help defeat Indiana 70‚Äì59. UCLA defeated Memphis, 87‚Äì66, to complete another perfect 30‚Äì0 season and win an NCAA-record seventh straight title. During the season, the Bruins eclipsed San Francisco's NCAA record of 60 consecutive victories, defeating Notre Dame for No. 61. In his senior year, Curtis became a starter again.UCLA Athletic Department 2011, p.114 The Bruins started the season ranked No. 1 and won their first 13 games. On January 19, 1974, then-No. 2 Notre Dame ended UCLA's record 88-game win streak with a 71‚Äì70 victory in South Bend, Indiana. The Bruins led 70‚Äì59 with 3:32 remaining in the game, but the Fighting Irish scored the final 12 points of the game as UCLA missed six straight shots and committed four turnovers, including two by Curtis. Curtis and Walton missed jumpers in the final seconds, and there were four unsuccessful attempts to tip in a miss. Wooden did not call a timeout late in the game, as was his custom in the final two minutes. Curtis, who trash-talked during games, was accused afterwards by Notre Dame's Dwight Clay of taunting. Until that loss, Curtis had not lost a basketball game since he was a 14-year-old high school freshman. A week later, the Bruins beat Notre Dame, 94‚Äì75, in a rematch at home at Pauley Pavilion. UCLA lost three more times that season. Their bid for an eighth consecutive championship ended after an 80‚Äì77 defeat in double-overtime to North Carolina State in the 1974 NCAA tournament semifinals. In his 2016 autobiography, Walton blamed Curtis for both the tournament loss as well as earlier defeats in the season. He criticized Curtis for his overdribbling and trash-talking, and lamented Lee's lack of playing time. Curtis majored in sociology in college. He later earned an MBA degree at UCLA as well. Post-college Curtis was drafted in the seventh round of the 1974 National Basketball Association Draft by the Buffalo Braves, but he did not play in the NBA. He became a mortgage broker with First Interstate Mortgage Company in Pasadena, California. He moved back to Florida in 1984 because his grandmother was ill. He became an international trade representative in Tallahassee with the state Department of Commerce. His job put him into contact with the Central Space Coast Minority Purchasing Council, which assisted minority businesses in working with purchasing agents for government agencies and private industries. After the group merged with a similar Tampa-area group to form the Greater Florida Minority Development Council, Curtis became the council's first full- time executive director. Personal Curtis learned to practice Transcendental Meditation during college from Walton, his UCLA teammate. Curtis was also a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.

Originating from a tropical disturbance on 15 January 2002 near the Chagos Archipelago, the precursor to Dina quickly developed within a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis. By January 17, the system had developed enough organized convection as it moved southwestward to be declared a tropical depression. Rapid intensification occurred shortly thereafter, with the system attaining winds in excess of 120 km/h (75 mph) on January 18\\\\. Dina achieved its peak intensity on January 20 as an intense tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). Hours after reaching hits strength, the storm bypassed Rodrigues Island about to its north. On January 21, the storm brushed Mauritius and R√©union as an intense tropical cyclone before turning southward. Once on a southward course, steady weakening ensued and the system eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on January 25\\\\. The remnants of the storm accelerated southeastward and were last noted on January 28 before being absorbed into a polar trough. Across Mauritius and R√©union, torrential rains and destructive winds from the cyclone resulted in extensive to \\"catastrophic\\" damage. The entire island of Mauritius lost power during the storm and widespread structural damage took place. Agricultural and property damage amounted to US$47 million and US$50 million respectively in the republic. Nine fatalities were attributed to the storm in Mauritius: five off the coast of Rodrigues Island and four on the main island. More extensive damage was seen on R√©union where up to of rain fell over three days. Record to near-record flooding destroyed many homes, washed out roads, and caused catastrophic agricultural damage. Destructive winds, measured up to also crippled communications. In all, six people died on the island and losses were estimated at ‚Ç¨200 million (US$190 million). Meteorological history On January 15, a tropical disturbance began organizing near the Chagos Archipelago in the South Indian Ocean convergence zone, which is an extended area of convection connected to the monsoon. The thunderstorms gradually organized, associated with a weak circulation and located within an area of moderate wind shear. A distinct low pressure area developed on January 16, about east of Diego Garcia. The thunderstorms were primarily located along the western periphery due to continued shear, and ordinarily would prevent significant development. The system moved to the southwest along the north side of a ridge, and despite the shear it developed into a tropical disturbance late on January 16\\\\. Subsequently, the system rapidly organized, developing rainbands as the convection increased. At 0000 UTC on January 17, M√©t√©o-France (MFR) upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression, and six hours later upgraded the system further to Tropical Storm Dina. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and later that day initiated advisories about 425 km (265 mi) south of Diego Garcia. Dina quickly intensified, and its T-numbers using the Dvorak technique increased by 0.5 every six hours during the storm's development phase. An eye began developing late on January 17, and at 1200 UTC on January 18, MFR upgraded Dina to a tropical cyclone, or the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. This was only 36 hours after it was first classified as a tropical disturbance, which is much less than the five days most tropical cyclones take. About three hours earlier, the JTWC had also upgraded the storm to tropical cyclone status. The small eye of Dina, only in diameter, quickly became well-defined, although it became obscured by the central dense overcast on visible satellite imagery. On January 19, the cyclone slowed as it turned to the west-southwest, after the ridge to its south intensified. The intensification rate briefly slowed, before Dina rapidly intensified late on January 19, becoming an intense tropical cyclone early the next day. Surrounded by an eyewall of deep convection, Dina intensified to reach its peak intensity on January 20\\\\. Based on satellite intensity estimates between , the JTWC estimated peak one-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), about north-northeast of Rodrigues Island. At around the same time, MFR estimated peak ten-minute winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). While at its peak, Dina had a very symmetrical structure, and gusts were estimated to have reached . On January 20 while near peak intensity, Dina slowed its movement further and moved more toward the west. After previously being in the projected track of the cyclone, Rodrigues Island was bypassed by the cyclone passing about to its north. After passing by the island, Dina underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, which resulted in an outer eyewall forming and replacing the previous, smaller one. This resulted in the cyclone weakening slightly, although it retained much of its intensity while tracking toward Mauritius and R√©union. Late on January 21, Dina passed about north of Cape Malheureux in Mauritius, with 10-minute winds estimated at 185 km/h (115 mph); however, the strongest winds remained offshore. At the time, the storm's eye became asymmetric with a diameter of . Late the next day, Dina also passed about off the north coast of R√©union, and although the island was in the forecast track, the cyclone accelerated to the west in the final hours and spared the island from the strongest winds. This abrupt shift in tract took place as the cyclone interacted with the high terrain of R√©union. Additionally, Doppler weather radar showed the highest reflectivity values to be from the center. On January 23, Dina weakened below intense tropical cyclone status while it accelerated to the southwest; the change in movement was due to the ridge moving further to the southeast. Increased wind shear due to an approaching trough contributed to the weakening, and by late on January 23 the eye dissipated. The next day, Dina weakened into a tropical storm, after the convection diminished around the center. Late on January 24, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and about 24 hours later, MFR classified Dina as an extratropical cyclone. The system accelerated to the southeast and was absorbed by a polar trough on January 28. Preparations, impact, and aftermath =Mauritius= Cyclone Dina on January 23 near R√©union Less than a day prior to Cyclone Dina's arrival in Mauritius, officials in the nation closed schools, government offices, businesses, and ports. A state of alert was issued for the entire country, meaning that those at greatest risk should seek shelter. All flights to and from the nation were canceled \\"until further notice.\\" Across the island, 259 people sought refuge in shelters. According to NASA, there was potential for a storm surge as the cyclone moved over the region. The first island to be affected by the storm was Rodrigues. There gusts reached . Rainfall was light on the island, reaching at Roche Bon Dieu. The cyclone killed five fishermen offshore Rodrigues. Numerous areas across Mauritius recorded hurricane-force winds. On the republic's main island, gusts reached at Le Morne Brabant. A station near the capital city of Port Louis reported a gust of . Torrential rainfall affected much of Mauritius during Dina's passage, with a maximum of falling in Pierrefonds. This was more than the average monthly rainfall, and most of the precipitation fell in about 24 hours. A barometric pressure of 935.9 mbar (hPa; 27.64 inHg) was recorded in Vacoas-Phoenix. Flooding and mudslides greatly disrupted the public water system, with most people losing running water. Power and communications across Rodrigues and the island of Mauritius were crippled by the storm, with the entirety of the former and 90 percent of the latter losing electricity. For approximately ten hours, the country was cut off from the outside world, with all communications disrupted. About 50,000 of the nation's 280,000 telecommunication lines sustained serious damage, resulting in prolonged power outages. Repair crews estimated that it would take until January 27, nearly a week after the storm's passage, for power to be fully restored. Widespread areas also lost water on Mauritius. Schools across the region sustained significant damage and as a precautionary measure, all classes were canceled until January 29. Agriculture sustained considerable losses as a result of the storm. Approximately 15 metric tons of flour and 20 metric tons of rice were damaged and preliminary estimates for sugarcane losses across the island reached US$47 million. Property damage from the storm amounted to US$50 million, and there were four deaths on the island; three were caused by traffic accidents, and the other was a man who died while making storm preparations. In the wake of the storm, a special mobile force was dispatched by officials to assist in relief operations. Red Cross distribution centers were set up on Mauritius and served food and clothing to more than 500 by January 25. Despite the severity of damage, government officials declined to appeal for international aid. Although no requests for aid were made, the Government of Norway provided US$10,000 worth of funds to the nation. Owing to the effects of Cyclone Dina and several other meteorological factors, the economy of Mauritius suffered significantly in 2002 as a whole. Annual growth dropped to about 1.9 percent from approximately 5 percent in 2001. The sugarcane industry suffered greatly from the storm, experiencing a 19.3 percent decrease. =R√©union= A downed tree and street flooding from the storm in Saint-Leu, R√©union. Due to the storm's close passage to the island, much of R√©union experienced hurricane-force winds. The strongest observed gust was on Ma√Ødo; however, based on the destruction of Meteo-France's Doppler weather radar, winds could have exceeded . Plaine des Cafres reported gusts of over for at least 15 hours. These winds caused extensive damage, crippling communications, devastating infrastructure, and left more than 160,000 families, about 70 percent of the island's population, without power. Some areas were without power for nine days. Additionally, about 25 percent of the island was left without running water. Damaged transmitters interrupted radio and television broadcasts for several days. In Saint-Denis, two people were seriously injured after a wall collapsed on them. Although winds were strong, the majority of damage was limited to broken windows, removed sheet metal, broken gutters, and removed siding. The most severe damage took place in exposed areas at higher elevations or where tunneling of the wind occurred. Heavy rains produced by Dina triggered flash flooding and many landslides, further crippling travel and forcing at least 2,500 people to seek refuge in public shelters. Some areas recorded more than in a 24‚Äëhour span, notably the Bellecombe resting place (a volcano lodge) which measured in 24 hours as well as a two-day total of . The heaviest rainfall was measured in La Plaine des Chicots at . With the ground already saturated from previous rain events, the torrential rains caused numerous rivers across the island to burst their banks. The Ravine des Cabris reached an all-time record flood while three other rivers reached their second-highest levels, behind the flood event caused by Cyclone Firinga in 1989. Heavy rains occurred in the typically dry western portion of the island, which resulted in significant flooding. Many ecosystems suffered from these floods with water quality greatly degraded and flow disrupted. However, in post-storm surveys in July 2002, it was found that the impact was not catastrophic and the ecosystems would eventually recover. Significant runoff also prompted fears of algae blooms that would damage coral reefs. Numerous roads were damaged or washed out by the floods, leaving approximately ‚Ç¨42.9 million (US$37.6 million) in losses. In Lengevin village within the Saint-Joseph department, 35 families were forced to evacuate. Many landslides took place in addition to flooding, further hampering travel and isolating hundreds of residents. Catastrophic agricultural damage occurred across the island, with losses reaching an estimated ‚Ç¨76 million (US$66.7 million). The entire fruit and vegetable crop was lost during the storm while the vanilla and geranium crops sustained heavy damage. Additionally, about 15 ‚Äì 20 percent of the sugarcane crop was destroyed. Horticulture sustained about 50 percent losses; however, much of this resulted from lost work hours. Poultry farms suffered about 70 percent losses, from lost animals and destroyed buildings. Along the coast, large waves measured up to caused moderate damage. Additionally, an estimated storm surge of impacted the island. Some buildings were flooded, roads washed out, and other roads were left covered in debris. In all, about 15,000 damage claims were filed across R√©union, with a total of 3,251 homes damaged and about 850 condemned or destroyed. Property damage from the storm amounted to ‚Ç¨95 million (US$83.4 million). Collectively, losses on the island were estimated at ‚Ç¨200 million (US$190 million). Although there were no fatalities directly related to the storm, six people died in various events indirectly caused by Dina. In the wake of Cyclone Dina's devastation on January 23, then French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ordered a relief team of 200 personnel to be dispatched to the island. He also expressed \\"deep personal sympathy\\" to the residents of R√©union. The following day, the Catholic Relief Services released immediate funds of ‚Ç¨16,000 (US$14,000). An estimated 50,000 tonnes of debris was cleaned up across the island, the majority of which was in the Northwest Department, and cost waste management crews approximately ‚Ç¨4.5 million (US$4 million) to process. Initially, the national disaster program was slow to react, with funding first being available on February 5\\\\. The first payments were made starting a month later. In the five months following the storm, the Government of France provided about ‚Ç¨10.6 million (US$12 million) in aid to farmers, accounting for an overestimation of about 20 percent in needs. Based on meteorological statistics regarding wind speed and rainfall, Cyclone Dina was regarded as a 1-in-30 ‚Äì 50 year event in R√©union.

However some historians -like Gilbeto Oneto and Rosaria Quartararo- expressed a criticism about this supposed Italian plan to annex Majorca. History Prior to all-out intervention by Italy, Benito Mussolini authorized \\"volunteers\\" to go to Spain, resulting in the seizure of the largest Balearic island of Majorca by a force under Fascist Blackshirt leader Arconovaldo Bonaccorsi (also known as \\"Count Rossi\\").

However the lack of resolve by the British and French to Italy's strategy in the region, encouraged Mussolini to deploy twelve more bombers to be stationed in Majorca, including one aircraft flown by his son, Bruno Mussolini.Reynolds Mathewson Salerno.

Criticism of supposed plan The existence of a supposed Italian plan to annex Majorca has received harsh critics. Indeed, Gilberto Oneto, an Italian historian, wrote the following about Bonaccorsi and the Italians in Majorca: In Oneto's opinion, the Italians only supported (initially, when Bonaccorsi landed in the island) the possibility of promoting a semi-independent Majorca (under Italian influence) in case of Republican victory in the Spanish civil war. But with Franco's victory, they understood that this project of \\"partial\\" independence was impossible.

He was exiled from Syria by the government in 2012 for meeting with members of the opposition and criticizing the actions of the Syrian government during the Syrian civil war. He was kidnapped by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant on 29 July 2013. Before his kidnapping, he had served for three decades at the Deir Mar Musa, a 6th-century monastery north of Damascus. He has been credited with the reconstruction of the Mar Musa complex and its reinvention as a centre of interfaith dialogue. In February 2019, news emerged that he may still be alive inside Deir ez-Zor Governorate, Syria. Biography In 1975, Paolo Dall'Oglio joined the Jesuit order. He spent his novitiate in Italy before starting university studies of Arabic language and Islamic studies in Beirut, Lebanon, and Damascus, Syria. In 1982, he explored the ruins of the old Syriac Monastery of Saint Moses the Abyssinian (Deir Mar Musa) that can be traced back to the 6th century and had been abandoned since the 19th century. Paolo Dall'Oglio - The Syrian tradition of coexistence and the present scenario of confrontation 17px ‚áí playlist In 1984, Dall'Oglio was ordained priest in the Syriac Catholic rite. In the same year, he obtained a degree in Arabic language and Islamic studies from Naples Eastern University \\"L'Orientale\\" and in Catholic theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University. In 1986, he obtained another master's degree in Missiology from the Pontifical Gregorian University. In 1989, he obtained a PhD degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the topic \\"About Hope in Islam\\". In 1992, he established the mixed monastic and ecumenical Community al-Khalil (\\"the Friend of God\\" - Biblical and Qu'ranic byname of the patriarch Abraham in Arabic language), dedicated to Muslim-Christian dialogue and located firstly in the refurbished Deir Mar Musa. In 2009, Dall'Oglio obtained the double honorary doctorate of the Universit√© catholique de Louvain and the KU Leuven. He contributed regularly to the magazine \\"Popoli\\", the international magazine of the Italian Jesuits, established in 1915. Role in the Syrian civil war In 2011, Paolo Dall'Oglio wrote an article pleading for a peaceful democratic transition in Syria, based on what he called \\"consensual democracy\\". He also met with opposition activists and participated in the funeral service for the 28-year- old Christian filmmaker Bassel Shehadeh, who had been murdered in Homs. The Syrian government reacted sharply and issued an expulsion order. Paolo Dall'Oglio ignored the order for a couple of months and continued living in Syria. However, following the publication of an open letter to UN special envoy Kofi Annan in May 2012, he obeyed his bishop who urged him to leave the country. He left Syria on 12 June 2012 and joined in exile the newly established Deir Maryam al-Adhra of his community in Sulaymaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan. In December 2012, Paolo Dall'Oglio was awarded the Peace Prize of the Italian region of Lombardy that is dedicated to persons having done extraordinary work in the field of peacebuilding. In late July 2013 Paolo Dall'Oglio entered rebel held territory in eastern Syria but was soon kidnapped by the militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, while walking in Raqqa on 29 July. Opposition sources from Raqqa said that Paolo Dall'Oglio has been executed by the extremist group Paolo Dall'Oglio killed and his body thrown into a ground hole in the city of Raqqa, called ‚ÄúAl- Houta‚Äù. Dead Assad loyalist soldiers would have often been thrown into the same hole. The claims are not yet confirmed.

While Renny managed to escape, Arbaiyah was hit in the neck and died. Wirjo then entered the home of Maskur, a neighbour, where he first killed Mrs Maskur with the sickle, before turning on her 80-year-old husband, who tried to help her. Afterwards he made his way through the village, assaulting people at random. Then the people from the village tried to find Wirjo but failed, only to be greeted by a lot of dead bodies spreading across the field. By the end of the day Wirjo had hacked a total of 32 people, most of them farmers on the way to their fields and students going to school. 18 of his victims died at the scene, while two others later succumbed to their wounds in hospital. As the culprit was nowhere to be found authorities temporarily suspended classes at local schools, while people locked themselves in their homes. After an extensive manhunt, including police, dogs, and the army, Wirjo was found the next day just 3 miles west of his house, dangling from the roots of a tree growing over a riverbank. He had committed suicide by hanging himself with his belt.Sekali mengamuk 20 nyawa melayang, Tempo magazine (April 25, 1987)Crazed farmer's rampage leaves 18 dead, New Straits Times Malaysia (17 April 1987)Dogs join hunt for man who killed 18, New Straits Times Malaysia (18 April 1987) =Victims= Among those killed were: { style=\\"background-color: transparent; width: 500px\\"  width=\\"150px\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Arbaiyah, 4 *Isah, 40 *Istianah, 15  width=\\"150px\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Maskur, 80 *Mrs. Maskur, 40  width=\\"200px\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Mbah Taman, 75 *Mbok Suwendah, 73 } Tales around the murder Several tales around the murder had been circulating at the time of the murders.

Background Wirjo, a 40 year old farmer was the fifth of nine children. According to his wife, Indarah, he loved to drink and gamble and also complained a lot about his inheritance. Reminded of his shortcomings he would get angry and threaten his wife and his mother with sickles (He tried to stab his mother once but his mother managed to dodge and lived). His uncle, Sutedjo, also reported that Wirjo displayed a lot of unnatural behavior. This behavior, such as eating an unnatural amount of rice (He had once eaten a whole 5 kg worth of fried rice and 5 wraps worth of rice) he also loved to eat fried cow blood or also known as \\"dedeh\\". The day before the murder Wirjo is reported to have beat his wife during an argument with a whip. It was reported that prior to the massacre Wirjo had fasted for a month and that he had also dug up his mother's corpse in the graveyard to gnaw on her bones and 2 days before the massacre began, Wirjo kept on polishing his own sickle for unknown reason. Fasting man runs amuck, Manila Standard (17 April 1987) though other reports indicated no such thing had happened, instead relating that she was still alive at that time.

The society is named after Willi Hennig, a German systematic entomologist who developed the modern methods and philosophical approach to systematics in the 1940s and 1950s. The society is also involved in reconstructing the tree of life. The current president, Ward Wheeler of the American Museum of Natural History, was elected in 2016, succeeding Dr. Jyrki Muona. Founding The Willi Hennig Society was founded on a philosophical division among systematic biologists in the late 1970s. A debate created the rift between pheneticists who advocated for statistical or numerical methods that grouped taxa by overall similarity in taxonomy and systematic biologists who adopted a strict cladistic approach to taxonomy, recognizing groups by shared, derived characters alone. The last public clash occurred at the 13th Annual Numerical Taxonomy Conference at the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Harvard University in October 1979. Twelve months later, the Willi Hennig Society was founded through invitation by Professor Edward O. Wiley and founding president James S. Farris. Seventy eight systematists from Great Britain, Sweden, Canada, and the United States gathered at the University of Kansas, to inaugurate the Willi Hennig Society. Membership doubled to over 150 by the second meeting. Background The Willi Hennig Society is primarily involved in projects aimed at the study and classification of biodiversity using the original methods and philosophy outlined by Willi Hennig in his book \\"Phylogenetic Systematics\\". In 1994, the society teamed up with the Society of Systematic Biologists and the American Society of Plant Taxonomists to organize the Systematics Agenda 2000. The Systematics Agenda 2000 is ongoing and has set out to deliver on the following mission statements: #Mission 1: To discover and document past and present life on earth #Mission 2: To analyze and synthesize the information derived from this global discovery effort into a history of life and predictive classification system #Mission 3: To understand the evolutionary mechanisms that explain the origin, maintenance, and loss of biodiversity #Mission 4: To communicate and apply this knowledge to science and society Publishing The Willi Hennig Society publishes the journal Cladistics.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1096-0031 References External links Category:1980 establishments in Kansas Category:Scientific societies based in the United States Category:Scientific organizations established in 1980 Category:Phylogenetics ","title":"Willi Hennig Society"},{"id":"36619818","text":"In graph theory, an orientation of an undirected graph is an assignment of a direction to each edge, turning the initial graph into a directed graph. Oriented graphs A directed graph is called an oriented graph if none of its pairs of vertices is linked by two symmetric edges. Among directed graphs, the oriented graphs are the ones that have no 2-cycles (that is at most one of and may be arrows of the graph).. A tournament is an orientation of a complete graph. A polytree is an orientation of an undirected tree.. Sumner's conjecture states that every tournament with 2n ‚àí 2 vertices contains every polytree with n vertices.Sumner's Universal Tournament Conjecture, Douglas B. West, retrieved 2012-08-02. The number of non-isomorphic oriented graphs with n vertices (for n = 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶) is : 1, 2, 7, 42, 582, 21480, 2142288, 575016219, 415939243032, ‚Ä¶ . Tournaments are in one-to-one correspondence with complete directed graphs (graphs in which there is a directed edge in one or both directions between every pair of distinct vertices). A complete directed graph can be converted to an oriented graph by removing every 2-cycle, and conversely an oriented graph can be converted to a complete directed graph by adding a 2-cycle between every pair of vertices that are not endpoints of an edge; these correspondences are bijective. Therefore, the same sequence of numbers also solves the graph enumeration problem for complete digraphs. There is an explicit but complicated formula for the numbers in this sequence.. Constrained orientations A strong orientation is an orientation that results in a strongly connected graph. The closely related totally cyclic orientations are orientations in which every edge belongs to at least one simple cycle. An orientation of an undirected graph G is totally cyclic if and only if it is a strong orientation of every connected component of G. Robbins' theorem states that a graph has a strong orientation if and only if it is 2-edge-connected; disconnected graphs may have totally cyclic orientations, but only if they have no bridges.. An acyclic orientation is an orientation that results in a directed acyclic graph. Every graph has an acyclic orientation; all acyclic orientations may be obtained by placing the vertices into a sequence, and then directing each edge from the earlier of its endpoints in the sequence to the later endpoint. The Gallai‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìRoy‚ÄìVitaver theorem states that a graph has an acyclic orientation in which the longest path has at most k vertices if and only if it can be colored with at most k colors.. Acyclic orientations and totally cyclic orientations are related to each other by planar duality. An acyclic orientation with a single source and a single sink is called a bipolar orientation.. A transitive orientation is an orientation such that the resulting directed graph is its own transitive closure. The graphs with transitive orientations are called comparability graphs; they may be defined from a partially ordered set by making two elements adjacent whenever they are comparable in the partial order.. A transitive orientation, if one exists, can be found in linear time.. However, testing whether the resulting orientation (or any given orientation) is actually transitive requires more time, as it is equivalent in complexity to matrix multiplication. An Eulerian orientation of an undirected graph is an orientation in which each vertex has equal in-degree and out-degree. Eulerian orientations of grid graphs arise in statistical mechanics in the theory of ice-type models.. A Pfaffian orientation has the property that certain even- length cycles in the graph have an odd number of edges oriented in each of its two directions. They always exist for planar graphs, but not for certain other graphs. They are used in the FKT algorithm for counting perfect matchings.

It is black, and one of the largest ants. A nest has about ten to thousands of individuals, and it can be a pest when it enters households or protects aphids. There are several subspecies of this ant in different areas of Asia, with the largest of the species being located in Northern China. Appearance The queen is black, but has microscopic brown hair protruding from the thorax and abdomen. They are 17 millimeters long. Before mating, the queen has four transparent brown wings supported by brown veins. The 12-millimeter-long male has a longer and straighter antennae and a slimmer body. Unlike the workers, both the queen and the male has three ocelli. The workers are divided into three subcastes based on their size, which varies from 6 to 15 millimeters. The largest subcaste of workers is also called the soldier. Range Camponotus japonicus inhabit a wide range, including Japan, Korea, Myanmar, the Philippines, China, Mongolia and Siberia. Parasitism This ant serves as a host species for the parasite, Niphanda fusca. The butterfly species will release cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) that mimic the CHC of the adult male ant. The ant will then adopt the third instar larva of N. fusca into its nest, feed it mouth-to- mouth, and raise it on its own. This behavior is an example of brood parasitism and obligate parasitism.Masaru K Hojo, Ayako Wada-Katsumata, Toshiharu Akino, Susumu Yamaguchi, Mamiko Ozaki, Ryohei Yamaoka (2009).

In the study of language and other phenomena, including other semiotic phenomena, what can be observed is an instance of an underlying potential. Halliday borrows the distinction between \\"weather\\" and \\"climate\\" to explain the relation. The weather can be observed day by day; over time, a picture of a climate is built up. Weather and climate are not distinct phenomena but different perspectives on the same phenomenon.Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the \\"architecture\\" of human language.

Halliday argues that this dichotomy has done considerable harm to linguistics as a discipline.Halliday Linguistics as Metaphor p. 259. Halliday follows Louis Hjelmslev in seeing linguistics as the study of both instances of language and the linguistic system.

Several of the team later went on to play leading parts in the revival of South Africa‚Äôs cricket fortunes in the 1960s. Background South Africa's tour of England in 1960 had been a failure. \\"From nearly every point of view the ninth South African tour of England proved disappointing,\\" Wisden began its report.Norman Preston, \\"South Africans in England, 1960\\", Wisden 1961, p. 264. First, it was a wet summer, and many matches were disrupted by rain. Second, the young fast bowler Geoff Griffin was no-balled for throwing on several occasions, effectively ending his career. Third, anti-apartheid demonstrations were held outside most venues. Fourth, none of the young players showed signs of developing into good Test players. Fifth, South Africa lost the first three Tests and drew the other two. Sixth, the tour showed a financial loss. Seventh, apart from McLean the South Africans \\"found themselves short of enterprising batsmen\\".Norman Preston, \\"South Africans in England, 1960\\", Wisden 1961, p. 265. The effect in South Africa was immediate. \\"Interest in South African domestic cricket waned alarmingly during the 1960-61 season,\\" reported Wisden. \\"It became increasingly obvious as the season progressed that the disappointment at the Springboks' Test performances in England added to lack of enterprise and an 'avoid-defeat-at-all-costs' attitude had left a deep-seated scar which only a complete volte face would heal.\\"Geoffrey Chettle, \\"Cricket in South Africa, 1960-61\\", Wisden 1962, p. 907. A cricket lover, E. Stanley Murphy, stepped in with an offer to sponsor a team of young players on a tour of England. Murphy had made his fortune as a leading figure in the sugar industry at Umfolozi in Zululand.\\"South African Fezela Tour of Britain 1961\\", Wisden 1962, p. 727.See various reports of the South African Sugar Technologists' Association, http://www.sasta.co.za/publications/congress-proceedings. He provided all the money for the tour and asked McLean to select the side. Murphy named the team fezela, the Zulu word for the water scorpion, an aquatic insect that can deliver a wasp-like sting. The tour A tour of 21 matches in England, Scotland and Ireland was arranged, and McLean selected the following team (with their ages at the start of the tour): * Roy McLean (Natal) 30, right- hand batsman (captain) * Kim Elgie (Natal) 28, right-hand batsman, slow left- arm orthodox bowler (vice-captain) * Eddie Barlow (Transvaal) 20, right-hand batsman, right-arm medium-pace bowler * Colin Bland (Rhodesia) 23, right-hand batsman * Jackie Botten (North-Eastern Transvaal) 22, right-arm fast bowler * Graham Bunyard (Transvaal) 21, right-arm fast bowler * Christopher Burger (Natal) 25, right-hand batsman * Ian Fullerton (Transvaal) 25, right-hand opening batsman * Ray Gripper (Rhodesia) 22, right-hand opening batsman * Denis Lindsay (North-Eastern Transvaal) 21, right-hand batsman, wicketkeeper * Lynton Morby-Smith (Natal) 25, right-hand batsman * Peter Pollock (Eastern Province) 19, right-arm fast bowler * Colin Rushmere (Western Province) 24, right-hand batsman, right-arm medium-pace bowler * Peter van der Merwe (Western Province) 24, right-hand batsman, slow left-arm orthodox bowler (David Pithey was originally selected, but had to withdraw just before the tour began, and was replaced by Barlow.)Peter van der Merwe, quoted in J. McGlew & T. Chesterfield, South Africa's Cricket Captains, Southern, Halfway House, 1994, p. 133. The team was managed by C.O. Medworth, who at the time was sports editor of the Natal Mercury.Peter Pollock, The Thirty Tests, Don Nelson, Cape Town, 1978, p. 5. Of the 21 matches played in June and July 1961, the team won 12 and drew the rest. It won all three first-class matches (against Essex, Combined Services and Gloucestershire) easily. \\"The fellows really learned to hit the ball. I gave them free rein ... There was none of this push and prod,\\" McLean said.Luke Alfred, Testing Times: The Story of the Men Who Made SA Cricket, New Africa Books, 2003, p. 159. Wisden's brief report noted that \\"The batting was aggressive, bowling keen and fielding splendid\\", and that nearly two-thirds of the runs were scored in fours and sixes.\\"South African Fezela Tour of Britain 1961\\", Wisden 1962, p. 727. Influence of the tour Barlow, Pollock, Bland and Elgie played their first Test matches in the series against New Zealand a few months later in 1961-62; Lindsay and van der Merwe against Australia in 1963-64; Botten against England in 1965. When van der Merwe captained South Africa to victory in England in 1965 (South Africa‚Äôs first series victory since 1953-54, and first in England since 1935), Wisden praised the South Africans' new-found \\"willingness to hit the ball\\" and their \\"enterprising methods\\". It continued: \\"Much of the credit for the transformation must go to that exuberant character R. A. McLean, who ... moulded the new Springboks when he brought the Fezela side to England in 1961.\\"Norman Preston, \\"South Africans in England, 1965\\", Wisden 1966, p. 298. Of the 30 Tests South Africa played between the Fezela tour and isolation after the 1969-70 series against Australia, Barlow played all 30, Pollock 28, Bland 21, Lindsay 19 and van der Merwe 15 (eight as captain). Only Trevor Goddard, who was too experienced to be considered for the Fezela tour, and Graeme Pollock, who was too young, played as many Tests in that period.

'System' in systemic functional linguistics ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù is used in two related ways in systemic functional linguistics (SFL). SFL uses the idea of system to refer to language as a whole, (e.g. ‚Äúthe system of language‚Äù). This usage derives from Hjelmslev.Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xv. In this context, Jay Lemke describes language as an open, dynamic system. There is also the notion of ‚Äúsystem‚Äù as used by J.R. Firth, where linguistic systems are considered to furnish the background for elements of structure.Firth, J.R. 1968. Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952-1959. London: Longman. p183.

In this use of the term ‚Äúsystem‚Äù, grammatical, or other features of language, are considered best understood when described as sets of options. Thus, ‚Äúthe most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.Halliday, M.A.K. 1992.

London and New York: Continuum. p 40 In adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics can be seen as part of a more general 20th and 21st century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought after within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (‚Äòwhat does it construe?‚Äô ‚Äòwhat effect does it have in a context of use?‚Äô), below (‚Äòhow is this function realized?‚Äô) and round about (‚Äòwhat else is in the neighbourhood?‚Äô ‚Äòwhat other things does this thing have to interact with?‚Äô). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of complex systems.

Two orientations are shown as adjacent when they differ in the direction of a single edge. In graph theory, an acyclic orientation of an undirected graph is an assignment of a direction to each edge (an orientation) that does not form any directed cycle and therefore makes it into a directed acyclic graph. Every graph has an acyclic orientation. The chromatic number of any graph equals one more than the length of the longest path in an acyclic orientation chosen to minimize this path length. Acyclic orientations are also related to colorings through the chromatic polynomial, which counts both acyclic orientations and colorings. The planar dual of an acyclic orientation is a totally cyclic orientation, and vice versa. The family of all acyclic orientations can be given the structure of a partial cube by making two orientations acyclic when they differ in the direction of a single edge. Orientations of trees are always acyclic, and give rise to polytrees. Acyclic orientations of complete graphs are called transitive tournaments. The bipolar orientations are a special case of the acyclic orientations in which there is exactly one source and one sink; every transitive tournament is bipolar. Construction Every graph has an acyclic orientation. One way to generate an acyclic orientation is to place the vertices into a sequence, and then direct each edge from the earlier of its endpoints in the sequence to the later endpoint. The vertex sequence then becomes a topological ordering of the resulting directed acyclic graph (DAG), and every topological ordering of this DAG generates the same orientation. Because every DAG has a topological ordering, every acyclic orientation can be constructed in this way. However, it is possible for different vertex sequences to give rise to the same acyclic orientation, when the resulting DAG has multiple topological orderings. For instance, for a four-vertex cycle graph (shown), there are 24 different vertex sequences, but only 14 possible acyclic orientations. Relation to coloring The Gallai‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìRoy‚ÄìVitaver theorem states that a graph has an acyclic orientation in which the longest path has at most vertices if and only if it can be colored with at most colors.. The number of acyclic orientations may be counted using the chromatic polynomial \\\\chi_G, whose value at a positive integer is the number of -colorings of the graph. Every graph has exactly \\\\chi_G(-1) different acyclic orientations,. so in this sense an acyclic orientation can be interpreted as a coloring with colors. Duality For planar graphs, acyclic orientations are dual to totally cyclic orientations, orientations in which each edge belongs to a directed cycle: if G is a planar graph, and orientations of G are transferred to orientations of the planar dual graph of G by turning each edge 90 degrees clockwise, then a totally cyclic orientation of G corresponds in this way to an acyclic orientation of the dual graph and vice versa.. Like the chromatic polynomial, the Tutte polynomial T_G of a graph G, can be used to count the number of acyclic orientations of G as T_G(2,0). The duality between acyclic and totally cyclic orientations of planar graphs extends in this form to nonplanar graphs as well: the Tutte polynomial of the dual graph of a planar graph is obtained by swapping the arguments of T_G, and the number of totally cyclic orientations of a graph G is T_G(0,2), also obtained by swapping the arguments of the formula for the number of acyclic orientations.. Edge flipping The set of all acyclic orientations of a given graph may be given the structure of a partial cube, in which two acyclic orientations are adjacent whenever they differ in the direction of a single edge.. This implies that when two different acyclic orientations of the same graph differ in the directions of edges, it is possible to transform one of the orientations into the other one by a sequence of changes of orientation of a single edge, such that each of the intermediate states of this sequence of transformations is also acyclic. Special cases A polytree, the result of acyclically orienting a tree Every orientation of a tree is acyclic. The directed acyclic graph resulting from such an orientation is called a polytree. . An acyclic orientation of a complete graph is called a transitive tournament, and is equivalent to a total ordering of the graph's vertices. In such an orientation there is in particular exactly one source and exactly one sink. More generally, an acyclic orientation of an arbitrary graph that has a unique source and a unique sink is called a bipolar orientation.. A transitive orientation of a graph is an acyclic orientation that equals its own transitive closure. Not every graph has a transitive orientation; the graphs that do are the comparability graphs.. Complete graphs are special cases of comparability graphs, and transitive tournaments are special cases of transitive orientations.

The orientation with the shortest paths, on the left, also provides an optimal coloring of the graph. In graph theory, the Gallai‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìRoy‚ÄìVitaver theorem is a form of duality between the colorings of the vertices of a given undirected graph and the orientations of its edges. It states that the minimum number of colors needed to properly color any graph G equals one plus the length of a longest path in an orientation of G chosen to minimize this path's length.. The orientations for which the longest path has minimum length always include at least one acyclic orientation.. An implication of the theorem is that every orientation of a graph with chromatic number k contains a simple directed path with k vertices;. this path can be constrained to begin at any vertex that can reach all other vertices of the oriented graph... Examples A bipartite graph may be oriented from one side of the bipartition to the other; the longest path in this orientation has only two vertices. Conversely, if a graph is oriented without any three-vertex paths, then every vertex must either be a source (with no incoming edges) or a sink (with no outgoing edges) and the partition of the vertices into sources and sinks shows that it is bipartite. In any orientation of a cycle graph of odd length, it is not possible for the edges to alternate in orientation all around the cycle, so some two consecutive edges must form a path with three vertices. Correspondingly, the chromatic number of an odd cycle is three. Proof To prove that the chromatic number is greater than or equal to the minimum number of vertices in a longest path, suppose that a given graph has a coloring with k colors, for some number k. Then it may be acyclically oriented by numbering colors and by directing each edge from its lower-numbered endpoint to the higher-numbered endpoint. With this orientation, the numbers are strictly increasing along each directed path, so each path can include at most one vertex of each color, for a total of at most k vertices per path. To prove that the chromatic number is less than or equal to the minimum number of vertices in a longest path, suppose that a given graph has an orientation with at most k vertices per simple directed path, for some number k. Then the vertices of the graph may be colored with k colors by choosing a maximal acyclic subgraph of the orientation, and then coloring each vertex by the length of the longest path in the chosen subgraph that ends at that vertex. Each edge within the subgraph is oriented from a vertex with a lower number to a vertex with a higher number, and is therefore properly colored. For each edge that is not in the subgraph, there must exist a directed path within the subgraph connecting the same two vertices in the opposite direction, for otherwise the edge could have been included in the chosen subgraph; therefore, the edge is oriented from a higher number to a lower number and is again properly colored. The proof of this theorem was used as a test case for a formalization of mathematical induction by Yuri Matiyasevich.. Category-theoretic interpretation The theorem also has a natural interpretation in the category of directed graphs and graph homomorphisms. A homomorphism is a map from the vertices of one graph to the vertices of another that always maps edges to edges. Thus, a k-coloring of an undirected graph G may be described by a homomorphism from G to the complete graph Kk. If the complete graph is given an orientation, it becomes a tournament, and the orientation can be lifted back across the homomorphism to give an orientation of G. In particular, the coloring given by the length of the longest incoming path corresponds in this way to a homomorphism to a transitive tournament (an acyclically oriented complete graph), and every coloring can be described by a homomorphism to a transitive tournament in this way. Considering homomorphisms in the other direction, to G instead of from G, a directed graph G is acyclic and has at most k vertices in its longest path if and only if there is no homomorphism from the path graph Pk + 1 to G. Thus, the Gallai‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìRoy‚ÄìVitaver theorem can be equivalently stated as follows: > For every directed graph G, there is a homomorphism from G to the k-vertex > transitive tournament if and only if there is no homomorphism from the (k + > 1)-vertex path to G. In the case that G is acyclic, this can also be seen as a form of Mirsky's theorem that the longest chain in a partially ordered set equals the minimum number of antichains into which the set may be partitioned.. This statement can be generalized from paths to other directed graphs: for every polytree P there is a dual directed graph D such that, for every directed graph G, there is a homomorphism from G to D if and only if there is not a homomorphism from P to G.. History The Gallai‚ÄìHasse‚ÄìRoy‚ÄìVitaver theorem has been repeatedly rediscovered. It is named after separate publications by Tibor Gallai,. Maria Hasse,. B. Roy,. and L. M. Vitaver.. Roy credits the statement of the theorem to a conjecture in a 1958 graph theory textbook by Claude Berge.

Originally from Kerala (he was born in Thalassery),Jan Kuhlmann, Subhas Chandra Bose und die Indienpolitik der Achsenm√§chte, page 170, 2012 (in German). Nambiar spent much of his life serving the Indian independence movement in Europe.Bose, Sugata. His Majesty's Opponent. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 2011.  In Europe  Nambiar had been working in Europe as a left-wing journalist for some time when the Second World War broke out. In the 1930s he had been beaten up by Nazi stormtroopers, imprisoned, and then deported, at first to Prague. At the outbreak of war he was working in Paris.Romain Hayes, Bose in Nazi Germany, Random House India . According to MI5 documents that remained classified until 2014, the British believed Nambiar was a Soviet spy before the war. The documents show that a Soviet defector in the 1950s said Nambiar had been an agent of the GRU in the 1920s. Nambiar had visited Moscow in 1929 while active in Indian communist organisations. (The declassified documents also included correspondence between Nambiar and Bose captured after the surrender of German submarine U-234.) In January 1942 he joined the Free India Centre as second in command to Bose. This organisation was set up by Bose to promote Indian independence and to assist the enemies of the British Empire, namely Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan, and the other Axis powers. Nambiar was a reluctant recruit; his anti-Nazi politics put him in an uncomfortable position, but he finally succumbed to Bose's persuasiveness and moved to Berlin. Nambiar established a branch of the Free India Centre in Paris before leaving. The Berlin Centre was given the status of a foreign mission by Germany and ran a propaganda radio station. It also controlled and recruited the Indian Legion. This had been founded by Bose and was mainly recruited from Indian prisoners of war and officered by Germans. It was originally intended to use it to fight the British in India, but it was eventually deployed to defend the French coast. It was never a significant military force, never consisting of more than a few thousand men.Hugh Toye, Subhash Chandra Bose: The Springing Tiger, Jaico Publishing House, 2007 . In January 1943 Bose secretly transferred by submarine to the Japanese theatre of war, leaving Nambiar in charge in Germany. There was more potential there for recruitment to Bose's cause amongst Indian prisoners; large numbers had been taken in the Fall of Singapore. The attitude of Bose and Nambiar towards Nazi Germany slowly transformed from seeing it as a convenient way of obtaining material support for their cause to believing that German victory was essential for them to succeed. As a consequence, they more and more accepted use of the Legion in the German cause as opposed to exclusively in India. In April Nambiar had to deal with a mutiny in the Legion, who were reluctant to move to the Netherlands as ordered. They had believed they would be fighting in India or somewhere from where they could attack towards India such as North Africa. By August the Centre's operations became severely disrupted by Allied bombing and Nambiar's own house was destroyed. Most activity was moved out of Berlin, but Nambiar remained there as Bose's official representative. In March 1944 Nambiar was appointed Minister of State in Bose's Provisional Government. In August 1943 the Legion, now with a strength of three battalions, was moved from the Netherlands to Bordeaux where they found the climate more agreeable. However, as the threat of Allied invasion started to loom morale severely deteriorated. In a tour in April and May 1944 Nambiar concluded that morale could only be improved by action. He persuaded the reluctant German commander of the Legion (Lieutenant Colonel Krappe) to allow a small contingent into action as an experiment. The 9th Company was sent to Italy, where some Legion personnel were already being used in intelligence and propaganda roles. The experiment was a complete failure. They were positioned opposite a Polish force. The initial reconnaissance party immediately deserted, followed by the entire company refusing to go into action on the grounds that the Poles were not their enemy.  Post-war  Nambiar was imprisoned after the war for collaboration with the enemy. He escaped to Switzerland and, against the wishes of Britain, was given an Indian passport by Nehru's Interim Government.Joanne Miyang Cho, Eric Kurlander, Douglas T McGetchin, Transcultural Encounters Between Germany and India, page 148, Routledge, 2013 . He then worked as a counsellor at the Indian Legation in Berne. He was appointed Indian ambassador to Scandinavia,dna, \\"Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose deputy, Jawaharlal Nehru aide was Soviet spy: British documents\\", 25 October 2014 then, in 1955 he was appointed the second Indian Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, succeeding Subimal Dutt. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1958. Nambiar finished his career as European correspondent of the Hindustan Times.  Personal life  He was the fourth son of writer Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar and Arathil Kandathil Kallyani Amma. He married Suhasini Chattopadhyay, the sister of Sarojini Naidu, and the first woman Communist member of India in 1919. Later they separated.  References   External links  *A.C.N.

Casablancas is remembered for his development of the supermodel concept and has also been criticised for having sexual relations with young clients. He married three times and died in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 70. Early life John Casablancas was born in Manhattan, New York City, on December 12, 1942. He was the youngest of three children of Ferran and Ant√≤nia Casablancas, a banker and former model respectively, and grandson of Catalan textile machinery inventor Ferran Casablancas Planell. His parents had left Spain during the 1930s to escape the Spanish Civil War, and the family subsequently lived in Argentina, Mexico, and France, among other countries. At the age of 8, he began attending Le Rosey boarding school in Switzerland. He continued his education at several universities in Europe without graduating.  Career  After pursuing several career options, Casablancas was offered a job in Brazil by a family friend, namely working as a marketing manager for a Coca-Cola factory. After several years he returned to Europe and worked at an architecture company. In collaboration with a fellow Le Rosey alumunus, Casablancas founded Elite Model Management, a modeling agency, in Paris in 1972. He had previously run the Paris-based agency Model Agency Elys√©e 3, which he founded in 1969. Clients of Elite included Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Andie MacDowell and Claudia Schiffer. Casablancas is credited for developing the concept of supermodel in the popular culture, turning models into celebrities that were featured in mainstream media.John Casablancas obituary: Agent whose company, Elite, ushered in the era of the supermodel ‚Äì The Independent He was also criticised for his habit of having sexual relations with young clients. During the years that Casablancas ran the operations, Elite grossed over $100 million in annual model bookings. It also generated controversy, with investigative reporter Donal MacIntyre making a BBC television expos√© which resulted in the resignation of two Elite executives. Casablancas gave an \\"unconditional apology\\" for their behaviour. A sales director sued for unfair dismissal and was awarded $4.3 million. The annual Look of the Year events (later Elite Model Look), at which young women could win a $150,000 modeling contract with Elite, were later criticised by The Guardian newspaper for providing an opportunity for Casablancas and other judges such as David Copperfield and Donald Trump to proposition contestants. In 2003, the Los Angeles County Superior Court dismissed a case of sexual abuse brought against Casablancas by a former Look of the Year contestant because he was not resident in California. Having sold his shares in Elite in 2000, Casablancas set up the Star System management agency and Illusion 2K, a cyber model agency. Personal life and death At age 22, Casablancas married Marie- Christine from France. The two lived in Rio de Janeiro for much of their marriage. Casablancas had one child with Marie-Christine, C√©cile, who was born in 1969 in France. The two split soon after her birth. Casablancas met Jeanette Christiansen, a Danish model and the 1965 Miss Denmark, and the first model Casablancas ever represented, in 1967. They married in 1979 after the birth of their son, Julian Casablancas, lead vocalist of the American bands, The Strokes and The Voidz, in 1978. Casablancas and Christiansen divorced in 1983, as he was having a public affair with Stephanie Seymour, then 16 years old. In 1993, the 50-year-old Casablancas married his third wife, 17-year-old Aline Mendon√ßa de Carvalho Wermelinger, winner of Elite Model Look 1992 in Brazil. Wermelinger was close to the same age as Casablancas‚Äôs children, who were 22 and 14 at the time. The couple eventually had three children, John Jr., Fernando Augusto, and Nina. Alberto.

Citiled was the company chosen by the project initiators in view of their expertise and their prestigious past achievements (e.g. the Agbar Tower designed by architect Jean Nouvel in Barcelona, the Hermes Building in Singapore, the Cocor luxury shopping centre in Bucharest, etc.). 21 floors on the north and south fa√ßades and 16 floors on the west fa√ßade have been equipped with LED screens developed by Citiled, i.e. a total of 9,850 sq m and more than 5 million LEDs, making this structure the largest Media Fa√ßade in the world installed on an inhabited building. It took more than 6 months to produce the 10,000 sq metres of this media fa√ßade, occupying a team of around twenty engineers and craftsmen for three months during the project design phase and then 6 months for installation and testing.

According to the patriarch, for such an action, the laity should be excommunicated, and clergymen are to be expelled from the dignity. To substantiate his opinion, the patriarch referred to the 73 canon of the apostlesCanon LXXIII: ¬´Let no one convert to his own use any vessel of gold or silver, or any veil which has been sanctified, for it is contrary to law; and if anyone be detected doing so, let him be excommunicated¬ª. ‚Äì The Canons of the Holy and Altogether August Apostles and the 10 canon of the Protodeutera Council.Canon 10: Those who appear to be victims of their own passions not only do not shudder at the thought of the punishment provided by the sacred Canons, but have actually dared to laugh them to scorn. For they distort themselves, and in conformity with their venomous nature they forge their will awry; in order that thanks to the magnanimity of their venom, according to St. Gregory the Theologian, not only may the evil be kept from affecting their responsibility, but may even be thought something divine. For this holds true in the case of the Apostolic Canon which says that no one shall appropriate any golden or silver vessel that has been sanctified, or any piece of cloth, to his own use. For that would be unlawful. If anyone be caught doing so, let him be disciplined with excommunication. Taking this Canon to be in effect an advocacy of their own unlawful deeds, they allege that one must not deem those men worthy of deposition who employ the venerable tablecloth of the Holy Table to make a tunic for themselves or reshape it into any other vestment. Not only so, but not even those who employ the holy chalice. Oh, what impiety! or the venerable paten; or things akin to these, because they expend them for needs of their own, or defile them outright. For the Canon says that those who become guilty of this are to be punished with excommunication, but has made no one liable to deposition for such an act. But who would tolerate the magnitude of any such perversion and impiety? For notwithstanding that the Canon inflicts excommunication upon those who merely use what is sanctified, but do not appropriate it to the extent of purloining it entirely, they, on the other hand, exempt from deposition those who plunder and sacrilege the equipment of the Holies of Holies, and as for those who pollute the venerable patens or sacred cups by putting them into use for the serving of food, so far at any rate as they rely upon their own judgment, they rank them as undeposed, notwithstanding that the contamination has become apparent to all, and it is plain that those who do such things not only incur liability to deposition from office, but even become subject to charges of committing the worst kind of ungodliness. Wherefore the holy Council has decreed that (those who purloin for their own profit, or who misuse for some unsacred purpose, in general any one of the sacred and holy vessels or utensils in the sacrificial altar, or of the vestments, or the holy chalice, or the paten, or the tongs, or the venerable tablecloth, and the so-called ‚Äúair‚Äù),i are to be compelled to undergo total and complete deposition. For one charge is that of having profaned, and the other charge is that of having plundered the holies. As touching those, however, who convert to an unsacred use for themselves, or bestow upon another person, consecrated vessels or vestments outside of the sacrificial altar, the Canon excommunicates them and we join in excommunicating them. But as for those who utterly purloin them and take them away we make them liable to condemnation as sacrilegists. ‚Äì The Canons of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Tankeu No√© was from the Bamileke community. He became a commander of the UPC's Arm√©e de lib√©ration nationale Kamerounaise (ALNK) in the Littoral Province. The ALNK in Cameroon was poorly organized and very weakly armed, but was pragmatic, knew the country well and was very mobile, using guerrilla tactics. At first, the UPC rebels were fighting against the French colonial forces. After Cameroon gained independence in 1960, they continued to fight the government of President Ahmadou Ahidjo, whom they considered to be a puppet of the French. On the 27 and 28 of June 1959 forty of Tankeu No√©'s fighters attacked the military camp of Mboppi in Douala and took 19 guns. In the counter-attack, UPC documents were taken that let the French arrest about 100 suspects. As a result of this action, the French high command of Cameroon decided to call for five companies of troops and five squads of gendarmes as reinforcements. Starting in 1960, troops from the newly formed Cameroonian army worked closely with French colonial forces under general Max Briand in suppressing the rebellion. On 24 April 1960 the Congo quarter of Douala, Tankeu's fief, was burnt by security forces, Officially there were 19 deaths and 5,000 made homeless. Tankeu No√© was captured and found guilty on 9 September 1963. The law of 30 October 1963 gave the government increased powers to deal with opponents. Tankeu No√© and Makanda Pouth, accused of terrorism but not of any other crime, had been sentenced to hard labor. Using the powers of the new law, the government brought them before a military tribunal that condemned them to death. Tankeu No√© was executed on 3 January 1964 in Douala. He was shot in public, tied to a power pole in the Congo quarter of the city.

On 13 October 1972, the Ilyushin Il-62 airliner operating the flight crashed on approach to Sheremetyevo, with the loss of all 164 passengers and crew of 10. The fatalities include 118 Russians, 38 Chileans, 6 Algerians, one East German and one Australian. At the time, it was the world's deadliest aviation disaster, until it was surpassed by the Kano air disaster in 1973. As of 2020, the accident remains the second-deadliest one involving an Il-62, after LOT Flight 5055, and the second-deadliest on Russian soil, after Aeroflot Flight 3352.  Crash  Shortly before the expected landing, the plane was flying at the altitude of 1200 m and received the ATC instructions to descend to 400 m. The crew confirmed and started to descend, but later there was no action to return to the horizontal flight. The plane passed the 400 m mark with 20 m/s vertical velocity, no expected report to ATC and engines still running at low thrust. It crashed shortly afterwards, with landing gear up, spoilers retracted and horizontal speed about 620 km/h. Investigation The cause of the crash could not be determined. Investigators did believe the most probable cause was the 'psycho- physiological incapacitation of the crew for reasons unknown'. Somewhere at the 500 ‚Äì 600 m. elevation, 30 ‚Äì 25 seconds before impact, the pilots either have been incapacitated or lost control of the plane.

Causes A number of situations may interfere with the natural process that would antevert a retroverted uterus during pregnancy. Such situations include pelvic adhesions, endometriosis, uterine malformations, leiomyomata, and pelvic tumors. Development When the uterus is tilted backwards, it is considered to be retroverted; this situation is common and regarded a normal variation. It has been estimated that about 15% of pregnancies begin in a retroverted uterus. Normally, during the first trimester, the growing uterus changes spontaneously to an anteverted position, thus allowing expansion of the enlarging uterus into the abdomen. The cervix is then inferior to the body of the uterus. Thus, the presence of an early pregnancy in a retroverted uterus is not considered a problem. On rare occasions the uterus fails to become anteverted, and the pregnancy continues to expand the retroverted uterus within the confines of the pelvis. By about 14 weeks the size of the uterus fills out most of the pelvis, pushing up the cervix. At this point the uterus may get trapped below the sacral promontory and symphysis. With further growth the pregnant woman may experience lower abdominal and pelvic pain, back pain, and difficulty, even inability to void, as the bladder is pushed upward and its outflow becomes obstructed. Constipation may be encountered. The frequency of this complication has been estimated to be about 1 in 3,000 pregnancies. Diagnosis A transvaginal ultrasonography showing a retroverted uterus during pregnancy. The cervix lies posteriorly to the urinary bladder, and the uterus normally extends superiorly from it, but the direction of the body of the fetus reveals that the uterus extends backwards. In a pregnant woman who is entering her second trimester, the combination of urinary difficulties and pelvic pain may alert the physician to consider uterine incarceration as a possibility. On physical examination, the cervix is pushed up and anterior, and the pelvis entirely filled by the soft mass of the body of the pregnant uterus. Sonography may indicate the retroverted position of the uterus, check on the viability of the fetus, and demonstrate the location of the bladder being pushed cranially and unable to be emptied. Also magnetic resonance imaging has been found to be helpful in the diagnosis of the condition. Sequelae Spontaneous resolution of the condition can occur during the second trimester. An unresolved incarcerated uterus can lead to further pain, vaginal bleeding, loss of pregnancy or premature delivery. Also, the uterus may develop a uterine sacculation, that is a part of its back wall softens like an aneurysm and allows expansion of the fetus into the abdomen with a risk of uterine rupture. Further, urinary complications may develop such as cystitis, and bladder distention could eventually lead to rupture of the bladder. Management A pregnant woman with an incarcerated uterus may present in the emergency room because of pain, bleeding, inability to void and constipation. Upon diagnosis steps can be taken to manually position the uterus into an anteverted position. The bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter and the obstetrician may attempt to manipulate the uterus if necessary using general or spinal anesthesia. Rarely will a woman with an incarcerated uterus reach term, - if so, a cesarean delivery is called for.

It is located on the southeastern tip of the island of Skogs√∏ya. It is one of the churches for the √òksnes parish which is part of the Vester√•len prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of S√∏r- H√•logaland. The white, wooden church was built in a cruciform style in 1703 by an unknown architect. The church seats about 450 people. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1381. Not much is known about the medieval church or the buildings on the site over the centuries. The present church was possibly built in 1703. In 1716, it underwent some repair work and then again in 1754-1755 there was another renovation. By 1788, the church was in \\"fragile\\" condition so a massive renovation was planned. In 1794-1795, the church was totally renovated. The building was virtually rebuilt from the foundation up, reusing all of the materials that were still in good condition. In 1864, the roof of the church was taken off and rebuilt. It is quite possible that parts of the present-day church still include materials that were present in the church several hundred years ago. The altarpiece is a replica of a painting made by Gottfried Ezekiel (ca. 1719-1798) in 1759. The original is in the Bergen Museum. A native of K√∂nigsberg, Gottfried Ezekiel received a commission as a painter in Bergen during 1744. In 1751, he arrived in northern Norway, where he painted a number of church altarpieces.

History The newspaper was established in June 1890 as the weekly Killeen Herald, owned by W.E. Bennett. Bennett sold the newspaper in 1893, and ownership of the newspaper changed several times before Bennett repurchased it in 1903. After a failed transition to a daily, William H. Carter bought it that year and reverted it to a weekly format. Shortly thereafter, Bennett also formed semi-weekly newspaper called the Killeen Messenger. Carter bought the Messenger a year after its founding and merged the pair into the Killeen Daily Herald and Messenger, which remained its name until 1953, when the newspaper was renamed the Killeen Daily Herald upcoming becoming a daily newspaper. Carter was publisher of the paper for 43 years, until 1950. In 1953, Temple Daily Telegram owner Frank W. Mayborn purchased the Daily Herald. The new daily afternoon format was published Monday through Friday, with a weekly option called the Messenger preserved for legacy readers. A Sunday edition was added in 1969 and the paper went to 7-day publication in 1982, switching to a morning release at that time. Mayborn died in 1987 and his widow, Sue Mayborn, took over editor and publisher duties, continuing until . Terry Gandy has been the general manager of the paper since 1998.

Hirsch, a 6'4\\" forward from Northridge High School in Dayton, Ohio, played for future Hall of Fame coach Adolph Rupp at Kentucky. During his time at UK, Hirsch was a part of three championship teams, in 1948, 1949 and 1951. As a freshman in 1947‚Äì48, Hirsch appeared in 13 regular-season games for the Wildcats. As a sophomore and junior, Hirsch moved into the Wildcats regular rotation, and as a senior was the captain of UK's 1950‚Äì51 championship team. While he made the SEC All-tournament team in 1951, he was declared ineligible for the 1951 NCAA Tournament as he was a fourth year varsity player (prohibited at that time). After his career was over, Hirsch became embroiled in a point shaving scandal that implicated player from seven different schools across the nation. Hirsch, along with teammate Bill Spivey and assistant Jim Line, was accused of taking money to affect the outcome of several games during the 1950‚Äì51. Hirsch and Line admitted to shaving points and implicated Spivey as well. However, Hirsch was never formally charged. Hirsch's involvement with gamblers led to a ban from minor league baseball for the promising first baseman prospect. He was coming off a strong 1952 season for the Danville Dans of the Mississippi‚ÄìOhio Valley League, but Minor League president George Trautman (a former college basketball coach himself at Ohio State) declared him permanently banned from minor league baseball.

History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1589, but the church was not new at that time. In the 1770s, the church was described as a log building in a cruciform design. In 1794-1795, the church underwent a massive renovation, virtually rebuilding the whole church, reusing as much of the old materials as possible. The church was renovated in 1882 and again in 1929. Based on the building's history, it is not unlikely that parts of the present church consist of materials from the late Middle Ages.

A year later, after finding little success, the company said it was leaving the casino industry, and would seek to acquire a business in a less risky field. In January 1996, the company changed its name to National Lodging, and paid $98 million to buy 16 Travelodge hotels and joint venture interests in 96 more from Forte, as part of a deal that also saw HFS acquire the Travelodge trademark and franchise operation. In August, the company was renamed Chartwell Leisure after taking a $57 million investment from groups affiliated with the Fisher family, the Gordon Getty family, and the de Gunzburg family, giving them a total 52 percent stake in the firm. In March 1998, the company was acquired by a partnership of Whitehall Street Real Estate (a Goldman Sachs affiliate) and Westmont Hospitality Group for $349 million, including $77 million in assumed debt. Westmont received a minority share, and took over operations of the company's 124 properties, under the new name WW Leisure.

On 15 March 1933 Straffner tried to withdraw his resignation and reconvene the parliamentary session but Dollfuss had ordered the police to prevent this \\"undeclared meeting\\" ( ‚Äûnicht angemeldete Versammlung‚Äú) or to disperse it if it occurred, even though many members of the Greater German and Social Democrat parties were already present in the chamber. Handed a copy of Dollfuss' order, Straffner filed a criminal complaint against Dollfuss under ¬ß 76 Criminal Code (public violence).

He has performed with national acts, including rock musician James Blunt, alternative country musician Brandi Carlile, pop-rock musician Gavin DeGraw, the rock band Goo Goo Dolls, the rock band Heart, R&B; artist John Legend, indie-rock musician Edwin McCain and rock musician Grace Potter. Additionally, Baker has headlined six sold-out appearances at Knoxville's Bijou Theatre. Early life and education He was born in Halls. Career Baker started his career in a local rock band known as Down From Up with Baker as the front man/lead vocalist. They released a live album in 2006 titled Live: Far From the Bottom and then their first full-length album A Terrible Beauty in 2007. In early 2008 Baker was replaced by bandmate Matt Brewster as the lead vocalist, the reasons why are still unknown. The band disbanded in late 2010 after another album. Baker's breakthrough came as an opportunity to support Legend. On February 29, 2008, Baker released his debut extended play, It's Getting Too Late to Say It's Early, produced by Travis Wyrick. Baker recorded his first full-length studio album, Holding the Pieces in Place, in 2010. After the album's release in April of that year, he toured with Heart. His concert repertoire began to expand around this time, and included a cover version of the song \\"Fight For Your Right To Party\\" by the hip-hop band Beastie Boys. Later that year, he also released a live album, Erick Baker: Live at the Bijou Theatre (recorded and mixed by Ben McAmis), as well as Stay Awhile, a live DVD containing footage of Baker performing and discussing his music (also mixed and edited by Ben McAmis). Baker began work on his next studio album in early 2011 with producer Ken Coomer. He ended the year performing at the official Belk Bowl FanFest in Charlotte, North Carolina, along with McCain and the rock band Daughtry, as well as at a New Year's Eve show for the U.S. troops stationed at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Baker's second studio album, Goodbye June, was released on June 26, 2012, followed by his first European tour. The album's lead single, \\"In Love with a Lie\\", was influenced by a phone conversation Baker had with a friend about a failed relationship. Baker's third album, Dear Amanda, was released on May 27, 2016. =Musical style= His genre-bending approach has resulted in crossover appeal, according to Underground Music Reviews in 2010.

Plot Taylor and Scott Dolan (Jaimie Alexander and Frank Grillo) are on their honeymoon in Morocco where Taylor plots to kill her rich husband with help from her lover, Travis (Charlie Bewley). The plan goes awry when all parties are involved in a bloody car accident on a remote desert road. They escape the multi-car pileup at a desert intersection and encounter the group of survivors, including a wanted smuggler, Omar (Moussa Maaskri), a French woman, Audrey (Marie-Jos√©e Croze), with a sick baby and Saleh, a mysterious \\"repairman\\" (Roschdy Zem). They embark on a journey of deceit and revelation that culminates in the medina of Essaouira.

Brooklyn Decker and Gemma Arterton were considered for role of Taylor but lost out to Jaimie Alexander. =Filming= Filming started in February 2012 on location in Merzouga and Essaouira, Morocco and lasted a month and a half, with most of the shooting done in sequence. The film was shot mainly in English, however there is also a substantial amount of Arabic dialogue between Moussa Maaskri and Roschdy Zem's characters as well as a some French dialogue, involving Zem's, Marie-Jos√©e Croze's and Carlos Leal's characters. The key car crash scene was filmed practically, without visual effects, using DSLR cameras in the cars.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Richard Horowitz https://soundcloud.com/richard-horowitz/sets/intersections The opening sequence tracks are sung by Sussan Deyhim. Release Initially set for November 2012, the film was eventually released in France on January 30, 2013 in 304 theaters, after a premiere on January 25 at the UGC Cin√©-Cit√© Rosny outside of Paris, attended by Roschy Zem and Marie-Jos√©e Croze. In Belgium the film was released a week later, on February 6, in 15 theaters. Reception =Box office performance= The film fizzled at the French box-office, debuting at the twelfth spot, behind five of that week's other new releases (which included Lincoln, Silver Linings Playbook and Seven Psychopaths) and making a little over 260,000 euros with an 871 euros per theater average, attracting 52,485 film goers. It fared even worse in its Belgian release where it debuted at the nineteenth spot, behind five of that week's other new releases (which included Hitchcock and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters) and making a little over 26,000 euros with a 1,750 euros per theater average. As of March 3, 2013, Intersections has made a little over 300,000 euros. =Critical response = The film received an overwhelmingly negative critical response in France. Writing for Critikat, Vincent Avenel calls the script \\"incoherent\\", a sentiment echoed by Les Fiches du Cin√©ma's Fran√ßois Barge- Prieur. Avenel goes on to call the film \\"absurd\\" and \\"empty\\", all the while criticizing the abundance of product placement and finding Jaimie Alexander's beauty to be the picture's sole saving grace. In Le Monde, Jacques Mandelbaum says the film a \\"reality TV version\\" of a survival film while in Version Femina, Anne Michelet laments the lack of tension. A rare positive review came from Staragora, which praised the film's numerous twists and flawed characters while stating the film was of the kind \\"one remembers for weeks after having seen it\\".

If it is operational, it would be run by the Russian Space Forces and complement the Okno station in Nurak, Tajikistan. Very little is known about the facility, including its precise location. There has been speculation on the differences between Okno and Okno-S but there has been no confirmation from official sources. Okno Okno is described as an optical-electronic facility which uses telescopes to track satellites and spacecraft between and above the Earth. It is located at high altitude, above sea-level near the civilian Sanglok astronomical observatory. Plans Little is known about Okno-S. The project started at Krasnogorsk mechanical plant in 1980, under the direction of V S Chernova, and the initial design was completed in 1985. In 1989 Russian military contractor Vympel released a draft design of a number of space surveillance complexes including Okno-S. One analyst, Sean O'Connor, says that the original plan was for four Okno installations and four Okno-S installations. This was later reduced to one in Ukraine and one in Eastern Russia. A report by Lenta.ru in 2004 said that one Okno-S was under construction. Location Sources agree on the rough location of the site in Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East. It is described as being on Gora Lysaya () 'Bald Mountain' near Spassk-Dalny, north of Vladivostok.. A location estimated by Allen Thomson is but there are also two other mountains called Gora Lysaya closer to Vladivostok at and .. Panoramio photos in Google Earth show a Lysaya Gora at 44.380 N, 132.946 E, quite close to Spassk Dalny. Sean O'Connor states that the lack of good satellite photography is stopping open source intelligence researchers identifying the precise location. Facility There is speculation on the differences between Okno and Okno-S and what the facility actually consists of. Sean O'Connor says that it only covers the region between and above the Earth, providing information on satellites in geostationary orbit. Something in the FAS sourcebook says that the site has two components. This says that equipment with the GRAU index 60Zh6 covers craft in higher orbits and 59Zh6 and 57Zh6 covers craft in lower orbit.. The whole facility is given the name Object 2327S. Other facilities Primorsky Krai is mountainous and has other space and astronomical facilities. Krona-N, another military space surveillance facility is near Nakhodka at .

Levels range from the conventional Prehistory setting of the first four levels to feudal Japan and even some futuristic levels inspired by science fiction.Overview of Booby Kids at allgame There are 21 levels in this game with five different bonus levels to gain extra points in. Objects to acquire in the other time zones include coconuts (in the prehistoric era), ancient Japanese scrolls (in feudal Japan), radios (in the World War II era), bags of money (in the modern era), and computer monitors (retrieved in the future era).Advanced overview of Booby Kids at Something Awful See also *Cratermaze References External links *Booby Kids at GameFAQs Category:1987 video games Category:Action video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Nihon Bussan games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Video games about time travel Category:Top-down video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Booby Kids"},{"id":"36620661","text":"≈Ωarko Draga≈° (Cyrillic: –ñ–∞—Ä–∫–æ –î—Ä–∞–≥–∞—à, born on 15 June 1971) is a Montenegrin retired football midfielder.

Prometheus, 566 U.S. 66 (2012), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that unanimously held that claims directed to a method of giving a drug to a patient, measuring metabolites of that drug, and with a known threshold for efficacy in mind, deciding whether to increase or decrease the dosage of the drug, were not patent-eligible subject matter.Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., . The decision was controversial, with proponents claiming it frees clinical pathologists to practice their medical discipline, and critics claiming that it destabilizes patent law and will stunt investment in the field of personalized medicine, preventing new products and services from emerging in that field.C&E; News on SCOTUS Prometheus ruling: Patent Ruling Dismays Biotech Parties to the case The case arose in a dispute between Mayo Collaborative Services and Prometheus Laboratories concerning a diagnostic test. Mayo Collaborative Services is a for-profitBusiness Record about \\"Mayo Collaborative Services, Inc.\\" at Minnesota Secretary of State diagnostic testing lab offering diagnostic services that operates as a subsidiary of Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research,Company Overview of Mayo Collaborative Services, Inc. at Bloomberg Businessweek which is a nonprofit corporationBusiness Record about \\"Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research\\" at Minnesota Secretary of State affiliated with the Mayo Clinic. Mayo Collaborative Services does business as \\"Mayo Medical Laboratories\\", has 3,200 employees working in 58 laboratories and offers services worldwide.Mayo website Prometheus is a specialty pharmaceutical and diagnostics company in the fields of gastroenterology and cancer; it was bought by Nestl√© in 2011.Prometheus website Prometheus sells diagnostic kits and also offers diagnostic services as a diagnostic testing lab. Patents at issue The two US patents in the case are 6,355,6236,355,623 at Google Patents and 6,680,302,6,680,302 at Google Patents which are owned by Hospital Sainte- Justine in Montreal. The patents concern the use of thiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Different people metabolize these drugs differently, so doctors have to work with patients to find the right dose. If the dose is too high there are too many side effects, while if the dose is too low the drug does not work. When the patents were filed, the metabolites of these drugs were known, most importantly, 6-thioguanine, but the \\"right\\" level of these metabolites was not known. The scientists at Hospital Sainte-Justine identified the threshold level for effectiveness, and filed for patent protection on methods to use that threshold level to determine dosage. The Supreme Court took claim 1 of the '623 patent as exemplary: > A method of optimizing therapeutic efficacy for treatment of an immune- > mediated gastrointestinal disorder, comprising: *(a) administering a drug > providing 6-thioguanine to a subject having said immune-mediated > gastrointestinal disorder; and *(b) determining the level of 6-thioguanine > in said subject having said immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder, > wherein the level of 6-thioguanine less than about 230 pmol per 8x108 red > blood cells indicates a need to increase the amount of said drug > subsequently administered to said subject and wherein the level of > 6-thioguanine greater than about 400 pmol per 8x108 red blood cells > indicates a need to decrease the amount of said drug subsequently > administered to said subject. The dispute Prometheus is the exclusive licensee of these patents and sells diagnostic kits based on them. Mayo bought and used these kits until 2004, when it decided to offer its own diagnostic tests to its clients at Mayo and worldwide, without buying the kit from Prometheus. In June 2004 Prometheus sued Mayo for infringement in the Southern District Court of California, and in March 2008 the district court held the patents invalid under ¬ß101 (the section of US law governing patentable subject matter.)Cases of Interest‚ÄîPrometheus v Mayo The debate between the two companies is based on a certain diagnostic test, specifically concerning the use of thiopurine drugs, which are used to treat autoimmune diseases. The problem with thiopurine drugs is that different patients metabolize them differently, which causes difficulty in determining whether a patient‚Äôs dosage is too high or too low. While too low of a dosage is simply ineffective, too high of a dosage can cause various toxic effects including pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, and myelosuppression (reduction in the ability to produce blood cells). Prometheus had a patent on how to properly treat patients using thiopurine drugs that included an administering step in which a doctor would administer the drug to the patient, a determining step in which the doctor measures the metabolite levels in the patient‚Äôs blood, and a step to either increase or decrease the dosage based on the results. According to the patent, if the level of thiopurine metabolite is less than about 230 picomoles (pmol) per 8x10^8 red blood cells, then the dosage needs to be increased, whereas if the level of thiopurine metabolite is greater than about 400 pmol per 8x10^8 red blood cells, then the dosage needs to be decreased. Prometheus sold diagnostic tests based on the patent, and Mayo bought and used those diagnostic tests. However, in 2004, Mayo announced it would begin to use and sell their own test. This caused Prometheus to sue Mayo for patent infringement. District Court ruling The District Court characterized the claims as having three steps: (1) administering the drug to a subject, (2) determining metabolite levels, and (3) being warned that an adjustment in dosage may be required. All parties acknowledged that the first two steps, by themselves, were already known, and that the third step contained the novel matter that drove the patent filing. Mayo argued that only the third step mattered, and that the claims covered unpatentable subject matter. Prometheus argued that all the steps in the claims had to be considered, and that the whole process was new and was patentable subject matter. The court found that the first two steps were just \\"data-gathering\\", leaving the third step as merely an unpatentable mental step, comprising the correlation, because no step required a change in administered dose.Patent Docs on Fed Circuit second decision Further, the court found that the inventors of the patents did not invent the correlation, because the metabolites detected according to the patent claims \\"are products of the natural metabolizing of thiopurine drug, and the inventors merely observed the relationship between these naturally-produced metabolites and therapeutic efficacy and toxicity.\\" Having determined that the claims encompass the correlations themselves, the District Court held that the claims \\"wholly preempt\\" the correlations.Patent Docs on Fed Circuit original decision These two findings‚Äîthat the claims cover only natural phenomena, and that the claims cover any application of the natural phenomena‚Äîled squarely to a rejection under ¬ß101, just as if someone tried to claim Einstein's equation \\"E=mc2\\" as opposed to, for example, an innovative machine that made use of that law of nature. First Federal Circuit decision Prometheus appealed, and in September 2009 the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court, finding that the claims were patentable.Patently-O on First Fed Circuit Decision The Federal Circuit found that the District Court erred in its analysis of the first two steps. The Federal Circuit found that these steps were not just \\"data gathering\\", but rather that they called for two physical transformations‚Äîfirst administering the drug to the patient, which transforms the patient, and secondly measuring the metabolites, which involves several concrete, transformative steps. The Federal Circuit relied on its own decision In re Bilski in this analysis; in that decision, the court stated that if a method requires a specific machine for its implementation, or involves a physical transformation, it is patentable. The Federal Circuit also found that the District Court erred in not treating each claim as a whole. The decision said: > [I]t is inappropriate to determine the patent eligibility of a claim as a > whole based on whether selected limitations constitute patent-eligible > subject matter. After all, even though a fundamental principle itself is not > patent-eligible, processes incorporating a fundamental principle may be > patent-eligible. Thus, it is irrelevant that any individual step or > limitation of such processes by itself would be unpatentable under ¬ß 101. Finally, the Federal Circuit found that because the claims are directed to an entire process, and not just the correlation itself, the claims do not preempt all applications of the correlation. Remand and second Federal Circuit decision Mayo appealed to the Supreme Court,Petition for writ of certiorari and in June 2010 the Supreme Court granted certiorari and immediately vacated the Federal Circuit decision and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's ruling on the Bilski case (in other words, it issued a GVR Order).Supreme Court Order granting Certiorari The Supreme Court's Bilski decision made the machine-or- transformation test less absolute, calling it only an \\"important clue\\" to patentability. In December 2010, the Federal Circuit issued its new ruling on the case. The Federal Circuit essentially re-iterated the arguments it had made the first time.Patently-O on 2nd Fed Circuit Decision Its decision acknowledged the Supreme Court's Bilski decision, but still found the first two steps were transformative and that the claim as a whole was patentable. The Federal Circuit went into more depth on the third step, the \\"mental step\\", noting that: > a subsequent mental step does not, by itself, negate the transformative > nature of prior steps. Thus, when viewed in the proper context, the final > step of providing a warning based on the results of the prior steps does not > detract from the patentability of Prometheus's claimed methods as a whole. Supreme Court decision Mayo again appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to take the case. It was argued on December 7, 2011 and the court handed down a unanimous decision on March 20, 2012. The Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit and basically reiterated the findings of the District Court.Patently-O on DecisionPatents Docs What SCOTUS Said The court called the correlation between the naturally-produced metabolites and therapeutic efficacy and toxicity to be an unpatentable \\"natural law\\" and found the first two steps to be not \\"genuine applications of those laws[, but] rather ... drafting efforts designed to monopolize the correlations.\\" The court said, \\"Because methods for making such determinations were well known in the art, this step simply tells doctors to engage in well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field. Such activity is normally not sufficient to transform an unpatentable law of nature into a patent-eligible application of such a law.\\" A commentator on the ruling wrote: \\"The conclusion here is that (1) a newly discovered law of nature is itself unpatentable and (2) the application of that newly discovered law is also normally unpatentable if the application merely relies upon elements already known in the art.\\" The court seemed to be aware of the impact its decision would have on the diagnostics industry, as it ended its decision by writing: > In consequence, we must hesitate before departing from established general > legal rules lest a new protective rule that seems to suit the needs of one > field produce unforeseen results in another. And we must recognize the role > of Congress in crafting more finely tailored rules where necessary.... We > need not determine here whether, from a policy perspective, increased > protection for discoveries of diagnostic laws of nature is desirable. Reactions and aftermath =Opinions critical of the decision= The decision was controversial. Those opposed to it found the reasoning poor, considered the decision to be destabilizing of patent law, and expressed concern about long-term effects on medicine. Gene Quinn, a well-known pro- patent spokesman, blogging in IP Watchdog, stated one view of the decision: \\"The sky is falling! Those who feel the Supreme Court's decision in Mayo is terrible are right.\\" He added: > Those in the biotech, medical diagnostics and pharmaceutical industries have > just been taken out behind the woodshed and summarily executed by the > Supreme Court this morning. An enormous number of patents will now have no > enforceable claims. Hundreds of billions of dollars in corporate value has > been erased. Quinn then called for the Federal Circuit to overrule Mayo, as he asserted it had done with other erroneous precedents and predicted that it would do so with Mayo: > How long will it take the Federal Circuit to overrule this inexplicable > nonsense? . . . Those well acquainted with the industry know that the > Supreme Court is not the final word on patentability, and while the claims > at issue in this particular case are unfortunately lost, the Federal Circuit > will work to moderate (and eventually overturn) this embarrassing display by > the Supreme Court. This will eventually be accomplished the same as it was > after the Supreme Court definitively ruled software is not patentable in > Gottschalk v. Benson, and the same as the ruling in KSR v. Teleflex will be > overruled. . . . [T]here is still a lot of work left to be done by the > Federal Circuit to finally overrule the Supreme Court's KSR decision. It > took almost 10 years to overrule Gottschalk v. Benson, so we are likely in > for a decade of work to moderate the nonsense [Mayo] thrust upon the > industry this morning.Gene Quinn, Killing Industry: The Supreme Court Blows > Mayo v. Prometheus (March 20, 2012). Kevin Noonan, a biotech patent lawyer and editor of the Patent Docs blog, criticized this decision and the Supreme Court broadly, for undermining precedent and the stability of patent law, thus broadly undermining the biotech industry. Noonan wrote: > It is also clear that the Court has little time for the specifics of patent > law generally, not surprising from a Court who characterized obviousness law > as \\"gobbledygook\\" not so many years ago. . . . [T]he Court also signaled its > willingness to credit their theories of what drives and sustains innovation > against the arguments, based on actual experience, from groups and > individuals who have created companies and been involved in innovation in > the biotechnology industry.

Prometheus > Laboratories‚ÄîWhat the Court's Decision Means, (March 22, 2012). Another patent lawyer commentator wrote: > The Court's analysis creates a framework for patent eligibility in which > almost any method claim can be invalidated. . . .

Sachs, Punishing > Prometheus: The Supreme Court‚Äôs Blunders in Mayo v. Prometheus, (March 26, > 2012). Hans Sauer, an attorney for the biotech industry trade group, BIO, said, \\"We are troubled that the Court's opinion fails to appropriately recognize the importance of personalized medicine, and of the research and investment incentives needed to develop new individualized therapies for untreated diseases.\\"Hans Sauer, quoted in Early Reaction to Supreme Court Decision in Mayo v. Prometheus, (March 20, 2012). Kendrew H. Colton, a Chicago patent attorney, said that, because the ruling applies to the thousands of diagnostic patents that have already issued and puts them at risk of being invalidated, investors in personalized medicine \\"may revisit the value proposition for investments already made and may curtail or redirect future investments in new projects.\\" =Opinions supportive of the decision= On the other hand, those in favor of the decision found it \\"a very high quality piece of legal craftsmanship\\" that \\"may well be the Supreme Court's finest work in the patent-eligibility field.\\"See Richard H. Stern, Mayo v Prometheus: No Patents on Conventional Implementations of Natural Principles and Fundamental Truths, [2012] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 502, available at GW Law. Dr. Robert Wah, Chairman for the American Medical Association, said that the Supreme Court had \\"prevented irreparable harm to patient care with today's unanimous decision to invalidate two patents that gave Prometheus Laboratories exclusive rights over the body's natural responses to illness and medical treatment\\", and said that the decision was \\"a clear legal victory that ensures critical scientific data remain widely available for sound patient care and innovative medical research.\\"Robert Wah, quoted in Early Reaction to Supreme Court Decision in Mayo v. Prometheus, (March 20, 2012). Another commentator, Professor Richard H. Stern, who teaches computer law at The George Washington University Law School, praised the decision because in it \\"the court for the first time agreed upon a full harmonisation of its prior and at times seemingly inconsistent judgments on patent-eligibility and how to determine it.\\"See Richard H. Stern, Mayo v. Prometheus: No Patents on Conventional Implementations of Natural Principles and Fundamental Truths, [2012] Eur. Intell. Prop. Rev. 502, available at GW Law. In the same vein, this commentator praised the decision for reaffirming earlier precedents such as O'Reilly v. Morse and Neilson v. Harford, which the lower court in the Mayo case had ignored or seemingly misunderstood. A business-oriented commentator viewed the decision as seeking to strike a balance between competing policy considerations: > While the collective groans of patent professionals the world over are hard > to ignore after the decision in Prometheus, it was a necessary evil to > safeguard against the likely potential for financial posturing of companies > with exclusive rights over processes of the human body. Ultimately, the > conclusion in Prometheus is premised upon the public policy consideration > that certain types of medical and diagnostic findings should not be afforded > patent protection, as the need for unencumbered access to critical > scientific data and study in the medical community overwhelms any alleged > monetary disincentive suffered by the patent applicant. The Court recognized > that patent protection should not serve as a stumbling block for continued > scientific innovation and improvement in medical treatment > methodologies.William J.

They meet three New Germanians who have survived the virus released in the inner world and, along with them and a Bushman called Woody, they go to explore one of the Pyramids from the jungle. Also, they find out that the Bushmen are part Styx (because they speak the Styx language at a much higher pitch). After they get into the Pyramid, something unexpected happens as Elliott touches a trident sign (like the ones that Dr. Burrows and Will found on their first exploration of the Pyramid). The Pyramid vanishes into thin air and an enormous tower appears out of nowhere in the jungle. Elliott senses that there is something missing from the tower, then she and Will find out that at the top of the tower there is a portal to Topsoil, and so they teleport themselves to London. Meanwhile, Chester is Topsoil with Stephanie, Old Wilkie, and Parry. Still grieving over the deaths of his parents during Professor Danforth's betrayal in the previous book, he discovers that Parry is still allied with Danforth and the death of his parents was being part of a plan. He then runs away from the others with Martha. Danforth is infiltrated within the Styx, but he soon finds out that, after he is no longer needed, he is sentenced to death by the Styx. He manages to save his life, taking prisoners Rebecca Two and her crush (Franz, the New Germanian driver). Now that they are finally Topsoil, Will and Elliott go to the British Museum because Elliott feels that she might find something very important there. She proves to be right and she finds a sceptre emanating a blue glow. When she and Will want to get out of the museum, they find themselves surrounded by Armagi. A tank driven by Drake and Jiggs suddenly appears. Elliott is saved, but Will is caught by the Styx. Elliott senses that she has to go to St. Paul's Cathedral, as she somehow knows that by doing this she might put an end to the threat of the Armagi, who seem to be moving towards the rest of the world to conquer it. While Elliott, Drake and Jiggs are inside St. Paul's, Parry, Danforth and his team are watching them from the buildings around. As Danforth goes towards St. Paul's, trying to get through the Armagi, he is surrounded by Chester, Stephanie and Martha. Chester tries to kill Danforth but he is stopped by Stephanie and Martha. He gets angry and says some rude words to Martha, who kills him with her crossbow, then is elevated in the air and taken away by the Brights. Elliott uses the sceptre and the dome of St. Paul's disappears just like the Pyramid from the inner world. Some Styx (including Rebecca Two and Alex) appear, carrying Will as a prisoner. Alex lays her eggs inside Will, in the view of everyone. As he tries to save Will, Drake gets shot and killed by two Limiters. Saving the situation, Elliott strikes the ground with the sceptre and all of the Armagi and Styx (including Elliott) get teleported inside the inner world, where they will all be killed by the virus, except for the vaccinated Elliott. At the end of the book, Will finds himself inside a topsoil hospital, reunited with his mother and with Bartleby, one of the original Bartleby's kittens, who resembles his father. Elliott, who was trapped inside the Tower from the inner world, puts the sceptre in its place in the tower and suddenly the earth starts to move and get away from the Solar System. It is revealed that the Earth is a huge spaceship sent on a mission and, because the sceptre was stolen, the spaceship remained trapped in the Solar system. Now that the sceptre is again in its place, Earth starts its journey again towards Home.

In 2012, his name was added to the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of most wanted Nazi war criminals. Life Csat√°ry was born in M√°ny in 1915. In 1944 he was the Royal Hungarian Police assistant to the commander in the city of Kassa in Hungary (now Ko≈°ice in Slovakia). He was accused of organizing the deportation of approximately 15,700 Jews to Auschwitz and of having inhumanely exercised his authority in a forced labor camp. He was also accused of brutalizing the inhabitants of the city. He was convicted in absentia for war crimes in Czechoslovakia in 1948 and sentenced to death. He fled to Canada in 1949, claiming to be a Yugoslav national and settled in Montreal, where he became an art dealer. He became a Canadian citizen in 1955. In 1997, his Canadian citizenship was revoked by the federal Cabinet for lying on his citizenship application. He left the country two months later but was never charged with war crimes in Canada. An extensive criminal reference check was done on him with no evidence of war crimes there. In 2012, Csat√°ry was located in Budapest, Hungary, based on a tip received by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in September 2011. His address was exposed by reporters from The Sun in July 2012. He was reportedly taken into custody on 18 July 2012 by the Hungarian authorities for questioning. On 30 July 2012, Slovak Justice Minister Tom√°≈° Borec announced that Slovakia was ready to prosecute against Csat√°ry and asked Hungary to extradite him. A file prepared by the Simon Wiesenthal Center about Csat√°ry implicated him in the deportation of 300 people from Kassa in 1941. In August 2012 the Budapest Prosecutor's Office dropped the charges, saying Csat√°ry was not in Kassa at the time and lacked the rank to organize the transports. In January 2013 it was reported that Slovak police had found a witness to corroborate other charges relating to the deportation of 15,700 Jews from Kassa from May 1944. Czechoslovakia had abolished the death penalty in 1990. Accordingly, on 28 March 2013, the Slovak County Court in Ko≈°ice changed the 1948 verdict in Csat√°ry's case from the death penalty to life imprisonment. War-crimes indictment On 18 June 2013, Hungarian prosecutors charged Csat√°ry with war crimes, saying he had abused Jews and helped to deport Jews to Auschwitz in World War II. A spokesperson for the Budapest Chief Prosecutor's Office said, \\"He is charged with the unlawful execution and torture of people, (thus) committing war crimes partly as a perpetrator, partly as an accomplice.\\" The Budapest higher court suspended his case on 8 July 2013, however, because \\"Csat√°ry had already been sentenced for the crimes included in the proceedings, in former Czechoslovakia in 1948\\". The court also added that it is necessary to examine how the 1948 death sentence could be applied to Hungarian legal practice. In 2014, a book was published by S√°ndor Verbovszki titled Kassa √Årny√©k√°ban: A Csat√°ry-√ºgy a dokumentumok t√ºkr√©ben (English: \\"In the Shadow of Ko≈°ice: The Csat√°ry Case In the Light of Documents\\"). The book states, based on records in the National Archives of Hungary, that Csat√°ry was stationed elsewhere when the crimes occurred, and thus should be exonerated of war crimes. Reaction Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said about his finding: Yishayahu Schachar, Jewish survivor who encountered Csat√°ry, said: L√°szl√≥ Karsai, a Hungarian Holocaust historian and the son of a Holocaust survivor, said: Death Csat√°ry died on 10 August 2013 from pneumonia at a hospital in Budapest, aged 98. According to daily Bors, Csat√°ry had been hospitalized for a long time, where he caught pneumonia. Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center stated that he was \\"deeply disappointed\\" that Csat√°ry had died without facing trial.

He has Sean Penn quote Kierkegaard and Mike Tyson quote Nietzsche. Discovery Marie Claire sought out Kummer for an interview at the height of his success. He told the magazine that his secret was to demand no less than 45 minutes with his subject.

Holger Hoetzel, a journalist with Focus magazine, uncovered Kummer's fraud. Hoetzel was suspicious of Kummer's access to such famous celebrities, and along with many of his foreign correspondent colleagues, he was being hounded by his editors to match Kummer's efforts.

June 3, 2000. Kummer's profile of Courtney Love, in particular, struck Hoetzel as too outlandish to be true. \\"That did it for me. We all know Courtney Love is far out, but this was something else. This woman has been so controlling about all press and all interviews were conducted under extremely restrictive circumstances. And yet this guy seemed to have this incredible access.\\" Hoetzel translated Kummer's profile of Love and sent it to her publicist, which began the cascade of denials from publicists who insisted their clients had never even met Kummer. One of the chief editors of S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Christian Kaemmerling, said the paper began to suspect Kummer's work was false in 1999. They also discovered that Kummer had been fired for writing a fabricated story in another paper in 1990. Kammerling and his colleague Ulf Poschardt were both fired for publishing Kummer's hoaxes.Meza, Ed. \\"Faker Fired,\\" Variety. June 5-11, 2000. Claus Lutterbeck, one of the foreign correspondents who was also being pressured to match Kummer's success, explained how such an elaborate and sustained fraud could happen among the foreign press in Hollywood. \\"The problem is that no one, not even our bosses, knows how Hollywood really works. They don't know how hard it is to get any access at all. They think we spend our time at cocktail parties with movie stars. So someone like Kummer can come along and they have no control over him.\\" Aftermath Kummer has maintained a largely unapologetic stance about his fraud.

SZ-Magazin, the Friday section of S√ºddeutsche Zeitung where his profiles appeared would frequently feature satirical articles and graphics. Even some of his publishers came to his defense. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung went on record as dismissing the celebrity profile genre as \\"tedious\\", concluding: \\"No exclusive interviews blossom behind the hedges of Malibu, and the people who live there are paying a lot of money to make sure things stay that way.\\" In the preface for a 1997 compilation of Kummer's interviews, Ulf Poschardt actually outlines Kummer's gonzo journalism as a \\"stylistic honing during the transcription of the tapes\\", where Kummer \\"decided to add his authorship into the framework of classical journalism, to inject it with fun and intelligence, taking no prisoners.\\" Kummer is the subject of a 2011 documentary called Bad Boy Kummer by Mikl√≥s Gimes.

V. Prasad and S. Naga Ashok Kumar under the Sri Sai Deva Productions banner and directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao. It stars Jagapati Babu, Ravali, Raasi in the lead roles and music jointly composed by Koti & S. A. Rajkumar. The film is remake of the 1996 Tamil movie Poove Unakkaga.https://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies/slideshow/10-vijay-super- hits-that-were-remaked-in-other-languages-oriyakannada/poove-unakkaga- subhakankshalu-ee-hrudaya-ninagagi-baadhai-ho-baadhai.html Plot The film begins with a story between two families, Christians and Hindus: Stephen (Nagesh) and Seetaramaiah (Satyanarayana) have been best friends since college and so have their respective sons, Moses (Anand Raj) and Balaramaiah (Devan). Moses' younger brother, Robert (Maharshi Raghava) and Balaramaiah's younger sister, Janaki (Rajitha) fall in love with each other. Against their families' wishes, they elope. Ever since then, a feud has been going between the two families. 25 years later, Chandu (Jagapati Babu) comes to the village and announces that he is the son of Robert and Janaki along with his friend Gopi (Sudhakar). He wants to reconcile the feuding families. Chandu stays in the house of the loud and frightful Nadabrahmam (AVS). He gradually endears himself to both families. Later, both his grandmothers suggest marriage. To avoid the situation, Gopi suggests that Chandu tell them that he is married. Chandu decides that this is the only way, thus lying that he is married to a Hindu-Christian like himself, Nirmala Mary. Suddenly, Nirmala Mary (Ravali) arrives. Chandu is confused, as she was just a figment of his imagination. After several encounters, Nirmala Mary comes clean with Chandu, telling him that she is the only child of Robert and Janaki. She then confronts Chandu, asking him why he wants to unite the two families. Then Chandu reveals his past. Chandu while living in the city, he lived next to a ladies' hostel, where Nandini (Raasi) daughter of Balaramaiah, was his resident. As she and her friends were trying to find a good song for a competition, Chandu indirectly helps her and falls in love with her. However, she treats him as only a good friend. When Chandu was about to confess his love for her, Nandini instead tells him about her love for Lawrence, Moses' son. Hearing their plan to marry without their parents' consent due to the Robert-Janaki problem, Chandu volunteers to unite the families so that they can marry with the blessings of their families. After listening to this Nirmala respects Chandu's character of making his lovers marriage with her lover and she also volunteers him and they carry out the mission. Meanwhile, Balaramaiah learns of Nandini and Lawrence's love. The news spreads quickly like wildfire and both families now think they have run away and want to kill the members of the other family. Meanwhile, Chandu has reconciled the grandparents of the two families. Only the fathers and the lovers are his main concern. In the end, he manages to unite the lovers and their families in a logical manner. After the marriage, the truth of Chandu's appearance is revealed, by the arrival of Robert and Janaki. Later, the families ask him to marry Nirmala (whose actual name is Priyadarshini) to make him a member of their family. However, he refuses, telling them that he loved a girl and does not want to think of anyone else.

Cover page of The Castlereagh, 13 January 1905 The Back to Gilgandra ‚Äì Souvenir Booklet states that The Castlereagh was produced as a four-page weekly, but the first issue of the newspaper was 12 pages long. The last digitised issue of the paper which is available via Trove, is Vol. 3 ‚Äì No. 51, and was published on Friday, 20 December 1907. It was 17 pages long and included a four-page Christmas supplement. By this stage, the masthead bore the subtitle \\"Circulating throughout Gilgandra, Curban, Collie, Gular, Armatree, Tooraweenah, Balladoran & Mundooran Districts\\". J.Foley According to the authors of \\"Back to Gilgandra ‚Äì Souvenir Booklet\\" September 20‚Äì26, 1937, on 11 May 1906, P.J. MacManus and J. Foley, formerly of the Orange Leader, assumed control of The Castlereagh. Later, Foley disposed of his interests. Rival paper A rival newspaper, The Castlereagh Liberal, was established in 1910 by the Farmers and Settlers Association, under the management of P.J. Donelly, who was later succeeded by A.E. Perkins. The Castlereagh Liberal was printed for approximately one year before commercial pressures forced its owners to sell. In 1911, the plant and goodwill were sold to the editor A.E. Perkins, who continued to print a paper under The Castlereagh Liberal masthead. Gilgandra Weekly In October 1915, the masthead changed to Gilgandra Weekly, with a short note underneath reading, \\"with which is incorporated 'The Castlereagh Liberal'\\". The volume and issue numbers continued in sequence from those first published on The Liberal.\\"The Gilgandra Weekly: Special edition: 100 years of The Gilgandra Weekly\\". 28 June 2011, p.4. In 1921, the Gilgandra Weekly was purchased by H.E.O. (Harold) Campbell, who began his career as an apprentice on the Gilgandra Weekly in 1914, and went on to own many regional newspapers.Kirkpatrick, Rod. Country Conscience: A History of the New South Wales Provincial Press, 1841‚Äì1995. Infinite Harvest Publishing, 2000, p.292. P.J. MacManus In 1925, The Castlereagh was purchased from P.J. MacManus by Harold Campbell. Between 1925 and 1929, the Gilgandra Weekly and The Castlereagh were both printed, with The Castlereagh providing more hard news content, while the Gilgandra Weekly became more like a tabloid newspaper in content. In November 1929, the titles were amalgamated and produced under the combined masthead of The Gilgandra Weekly and Castlereagh. The Castlereagh tag was dropped in the 1940s, and the paper became known as The Gilgandra Weekly.

Dallin, born David Yulevich Levin –î–∞–≤–∏–¥ –Æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –î–∞–ª–∏–Ω (24 May 1889 ‚Äì February 21, 1962 ) was a one-time Menshevik leader and later a writer and lecturer on Soviet affairs, who helped Victor Kravchenko defect in the 1940s. Youth Dallin was born in Rogachev, White Russia, in 1889. He studied at the University of St. Petersburg from 1907 to 1909, when he faced arrest and imprisonment for anti-tsarist political activity. After two years of imprisonment, he fled Russia to Germany. He studied at the University of Berlin and obtained his doctorate in Economics from the University of Heidelberg in 1913. Career =Menshevik Politician= Following the February Revolution of 1917, Dallin returned to Russia. He won election to the central committee of the Menshevik group of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and represented the group on the Moscow City Soviet from 1918 to 1921. The Bolsheviks arrested him a first time in 1920, and he avoided a second arrest in 1922 by fleeing back to Germany. He stayed in Germany until the Nazis forced him to leave in 1935, when he settled in Poland. He stayed in Poland until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, when he moved to the United States. =Kravchenko affair= Through a friend of his wife Lilia, Dallin came to welcome Victor Kravchenko in their home in New York in January 1944. The next day, Kravchenko revealed his wish to defect from the Soviet embassy. Dallin encouraged Kravchenko to defect. He approached the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, William C. Bullitt, whom he had known in Moscow, for advice. (Bullitt had also been involved with another Soviet defector, Walter Krivitsky.) Bullitt called Attorney General Francis Biddle and then extricated himself from the matter. Biddle brought in the FBI. In March, Dallin met Kravchenko in Pennsylvania, where the latter had an official trip. Dallin advised Kravchenko about his contact with the FBI. Kravchenko followed his advice and contacted the FBI, who interviewed him three times in Washington before the end of the month. Dallin and his wife then met Kravchenko when he arrived in New York again in April as a defector. Dallin advised Kravchenko to tell his story to the New York Times as soon as possible: Kravchenko began drafting his story that first night. The next day, Dallin brought New York Times labor journalist Joseph Shaplen to meet Kravchenko. When Shaplen and Kravchenko did not get along, Dallin turned to a former United Press correspondent to Moscow, Eugene Lyons, by then editor of The American Mercury. He also introduced him to Isaac Don Levine and Max Eastman. (Levine had been Krivitsky's co-writer of the memoir In Stalin's Secret Service.) Lyons, Levine, and Eastman would form the core group of co-writers and co-editors of Kravchenko's best-selling memoir, I Chose Freedom; Dallin would form part of a second tier of supporters. =New Leader= Dallin joined the staff of the left-wing anti-communist magazine, The New Leader in New York, where he worked for nearly twenty years. (Founded in 1924 by the Socialist Party of America, The New Leader had come under executive editor Samuel Levitas, a Russian Menshevik, after which the magazine left the SPA but remained left. ) He wrote numerous books and newspaper and magazine articles on economic and political subjects, particularly Soviet affairs. Dallin also was a visiting professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania. Personal life =Family= Earlier in life, Dallin married a woman named Eugenia. In New York, he left Eugenia and lived with Lilia Ginzberg Estrin before marrying her by 1944 (when she became known as Lilia Estrin Dallin), when the Dallins became involved in Kravchenko's defection. Dallin and Eugenia had a son, Alexander Dallin, born overseas, who later became a prominent academic expert in Soviet studies. =Death= Dallin died in New York in 1962. He was survived by his second wife and son. Impact As American historian John Earl Haynes Jr., has written: > Dallin and Boris Nicolaevsky's 1947 Forced Labor in Soviet Russia (New > Haven: Yale University Press) had been a pioneering study of the Soviet > labor camp system, well received in the academic world at the time, but > again in 1960s it was retroactively discredited among most American scholars > due to its use of defector testimony and Dallin‚Äôs Menshevik origins. Indeed, > Dallin and Nicolaevsky's 1947 book was so thorough erased from American > academic memory that the appearance of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag > Archipelago in the mid-1970s came as an unexpected shock. However, New Left academics had come to dismiss Dallin's works by the mid-1960s due to his citations of testimony from defectors and exiles plus congressional and FBI investigations, all seen as anti-communist. \\"Such evidence was increasingly distrusted, and Dallin‚Äôs Menshevik past was taken as reason for skepticism as well,\\" Haynes has noted.

Geiger, 523 U.S. 57 (1998), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that debt arising from a medical malpractice judgment, attributable to negligent or reckless conduct is dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code..  Background  Margaret Kawaauhau sought treatment from Dr. Paul Geiger for an injured foot, and he hospitalized her for fear of infection. Even though he knew intravenous penicillin would be more effective in warding off infection, he gave he oral penicillin instead, realizing she was trying to cut down on her medical costs. Afterwards, Dr. Geiger left Kawaauhau in the care of other physicians at the hospital he worked at while he went off on a business trip. The physicians decided she should be transferred to a specialist for infections. However, before that could be arranged, Dr. Geiger returned, and not only did he cancel such a transfer, he ended the antibiotics treatments, believing the infection had passed. Over time, Kawaauhau's condition worsened and her entire leg had to be amputated below the knee. She and her husband sued Dr. Geiger for malpractice in federal district court, won, and were awarded $355,000 by the jury. Geiger had no malpractice insurance, and in an attempt to avoid paying the settlement, he moved to Missouri. His wages were then garnished by the Kawaauhaus, and Geiger subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The Kawaauhaus asked the bankruptcy court to hold Geiger's settlement debts non-dischargeable, which it did. Dr. Geiger appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court, which overturned the bankruptcy court's decision, saying the Bankruptcy Code's discharge exception of debts caused through \\"willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another\\" did not apply in this case because the injury was unintentional. The Kawaauhaus appealed to the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  In a unanimous decision delivered by Justice Ginsburg, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Dr. Geiger, saying unintentional malpractice torts were dischargeable by bankruptcy (that this instance did not fall under the exception provided for in ¬ß523(a)(6)), and thus upheld the decision of the Eighth Circuit Court.

The dam was about north of Edenville, mostly in the southeast corner of Tobacco Township in Gladwin County, with its southeastern end reaching into Edenville Township in Midland County. Its height was , the length was at its crest. The dam was built in 1924 for hydroelectric power and for flood control. The dam was equipped with two 2.4 MW turbines capable of generating 4.8 MW of electricity in total.FERC issues preliminary permit for 6-MW Edenville Dam Hydroelectric Project in Michigan, December 3, 2019 In May 2020, following heavy rains, the Edenville Dam breached and the Sanford Dam downstream overflowed, which caused major flooding in Midland County, including the city of Midland. History The dam was built in 1924 by Frank Isaac Wixom, after whom the reservoir formed by the dam is named. Wixom used to own a circus before he built the dam. The dam was privately owned and operated by Boyce Hydro Power, a company based in Edenville, which also owned three other hydroelectric facilities on the Tittabawassee: the Secord, Smallwood, and Sanford Dams. =Safety and lake level disputes= In a rarely used federal power, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) terminated Boyce Hydro Power's license in 2018, because of its \\"inability to pass the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF)\\", as well as seven other failures. The federal government was concerned that \\"the dam may not have the ability to pass enough water, if a severe flood were to hit, among other issues and violations.\\" Following the federal government's 2018 license revocation, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) took oversight of the dam.Wixom Lake drops more than 7 feet, abc12 News, Rebecca Trylch, October 29, 2018 EGLE determined that the dam was structurally sound. Edenville and the other former Boyce dams were taken over in 2019 by the Four Lakes Task Force, a county delegated authority, with title to transfer in early 2022. The State of Michigan appropriated $5 million for the purchase. The Four Lakes Task Force operates under the Four Lakes Assessment District in the State of Michigan, created in May 2019 by Judge Stephen Carras. In 2019, Michigan's 42nd Circuit Court was involved in determining if only the lakefront owners or all area residents would pay tax to the Four Lakes Assessment District. In October 2018, and again in mid-November 2019, the dam's operator lowered the water level, in what it called \\"a safety move.\\" It said it had requested a permit to lower the level from Michigan's EGLE, a permit that was not issued. The operator said it acted ‚Äúdue to concern for the safety of its operators and the downstream community,‚Äù and went on to sue EGLE in federal court, alleging \\"its safety concerns were paramount.\\" In December 2019, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a permit to investigate expanding the hydropower plant with a second powerhouse containing one 1.2 MW turbine-generator unit for a total of 6 MW.FERC issues preliminary permit for 6-MW Edenville Dam Hydroelectric Project in Michigan, Hydro Review, December 3, 2019 The dam's operator said it began to raise the lake's water level in April 2020, under threat of being sued by Michigan's EGLE, and that it reached \\"normal pond level\\" in the first week of May. Michigan's Attorney General confirmed EGLE had directed the operator to raise the water level, stating: \\"Michigan EGLE directed Boyce to follow the court-ordered lake level requirements,\\" but challenged that the operator had lowered it for safety reasons. In April 2020, EGLE sued Boyce, alleging it had lowered the water level without permission in 2018 and 2019, killing thousands of freshwater mussels. =Dam failure= Copernicus Programme image of the dam after failure, showing the new river channel east of the original spillway. On May 19, 2020, 5:46 p.m., due to massive inflow from heavy rains in the area, the eastern side of the dam collapsed, prompting immediate evacuations in the towns of Edenville and Sanford. The Sanford Dam, about downstream, subsequently overflowed, requiring evacuations in much of Midland further downstream. Governor Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency, and announced an investigation into the dam's operators for alleged neglect. Over 10,000 local residents were ultimately evacuated, as officials cautioned residents to maintain social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Tittabawassee River crested at late on May 20, resulting in extensive flooding throughout eastern Midland and low-lying parts of its downtown district, and severely damaging most of the village of Sanford. The extent of the floodwaters was visible from space on May 22. Dow Chemical's Midland operations were threatened by the flooding, but reportedly suffered no serious damage. As of the morning of May 20, no casualties had been reported as a result of the flooding. Lawsuits In the wake of the flooding, three class-action lawsuits were filed by the victims, of which two named Michigan's EGLE as defendant and two named the dam's operator as defendant.https://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw-bay-city/2020/05/after-edenville- dam-failure-lawsuits-pour-in-against-owners-state-regulators.html Michigan's Attorney General is also being sued.https://www.9and10news.com/2020/05/28/lawsuit-filed-against-ag-nessel- county-officials-for-edenville-dam-failure/ References Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1925 Category:Dams in Michigan Category:Reservoirs in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Gladwin County, Michigan Category:Earth-filled dams Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Michigan Category:Dams completed in 1925 Category:United States power company dams Category:Bodies of water of Gladwin County, Michigan Category:Dam failures in the United States ","title":"Edenville Dam"},{"id":"36621170","text":"Eko Purjianto (born on February 1, 1976) is a retired Indonesian footballer and current assistant manager of Bali United.

It belongs to the Taego Order although the Jogye Order claims possession over it.Yonhap Jan. 29, 2018 The name Seonam (\\"Xian's Precipice\\", ‰ªô Â∑ñ) is derived from the legend that a xian, an immortal, once played the game of Go here. About from the entrance towards the main temple grounds, two rainbow-shaped bridges appear; the second-larger one being Seungseon Bridge. Just beyond Seungseon Bridge is Gangseon Pavilion. Past the pavilion, the small oval-shape pond called Samindang comes into site. Inside the pond is a small islet with an evergreen, creating an attractive setting. Going further on the Ilju Gate appears, beyond which the various temple buildings emerge. The large timbers of the main temple buildings are impressive, blending elegantly with the surrounding Jogye mountains and harmonizing with the nature surrounding them. A hiking trail to the left of Seonam Temple leads to Maaeburi, a -high sculpture engraved on a rock. Seonamsa is beautiful throughout the year, especially in the spring when all the flowers are in bloom, as well as in the fall with all the autumn colors. With 19 National Cultural Properties in its halls and museum, there are few Korean Buddhist temples with more treasures than Seonamsa. History Legend states that in 529, the missionary monk Ado (ÈòøÈÅì) built a hermitage at this site on the eastern slope of Jogyesan and named it Biroam (). 350 years later in 861, Doseon constructed a grand temple here and named it Seonamsa. As the head temple of the samamsa trio (\\"three 'rock' temples\\") with Unamsa (Èõ≤Â≤©) and Yongamsa (ÈæçÂ≤©), Seonamsa played a fundamental role in the development of Seon Buddhism, and many masters have practiced, taught and attained awakening here. During the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98), many of Seonamsa‚Äôs buildings were destroyed, along with much of the country. Restoration came after the war, and a new plan to restore the temple to the original 11th century configuration has been underway since 1992. Treasures Main Hall (Main Hall) ceiling =Seungseongyo= Seungseongyo (ÏäπÏÑ†Íµê / Êòá‰ªôÊ©ã), Seungseon Bridge, is a granite stone bridge constructed in semi- circular arch configuration 14 meters/46 feet long and 3.5-meters (11.5 feet) wide. Seungseon means ‚Äòthe ascending immortals‚Äô. Monk Hoan built this Joseon Era bridge over a period of six years beginning in 1713. Seungseongyo is considered to be amongst the most beautiful of the old stone bridges in Korea. The protruding sculpture of a dragon's head below the midsection of the bridge, facing upstream, is intended to ward off evil spirits. The bridge's arch casts a magical reflection in the stream below with the image of the Gangseonru (pavilion) peeping out beneath, a short distance away. Because this charming bridge blends in so well with the valley below, it is often used as a location for shooting movies and TV shows. Seungseongyo is Treasure #400. =Iljumun= Seonamsa Iljumun Iljumun is the first gate at the entrance to many Korean Buddhist temples. Called the \\"One-Pillar Gate\\", because when viewed from the side the gate appears to be supported by a single pillar. This symbolizes the one true path of enlightenment which supports the world. It is the boundary between the Buddhist temple and a human's worldly life. The gate symbolizes ritual purification and one must leave all of their worldly desires before entering the temple. Seonamsa's Iljumun dates back to the Joseon Dynasty. According to the records from the \\"Message for the framework-raising ceremony of Jogye Gate\\" the original Seonamsa Iljumun was destroyed by fire and restored in 1540. It was also recorded that the gate was again destroyed during the Qing invasion of Joseon battle and rebuilt in 1719. Seonamsa's Iljumun harmonizes with the neighboring forest, radiating a soft elegance. Walls extend from both sides of the entry and stone steps are laid out in front. Its elaborate woodwork makes it uniquely magnificent. Seonamsa Iljumun is Cultural Treasure #96. =Palsangjeon= Palsangjeon (Hall of Eight Pictures) is a worship hall found on a Korean Buddhist temple complex that contains the \\"Palsang\\", the series of painted murals depicting the eight stages in the life of the historic Buddha, Sakyamuni. Seonamsa's Palsangjeon has five sections facing the front and three sections on the side. The hall is built in a style which has the brackets only on columns and a gabled roof. Records indicate the hall was built before the 18th century and has been restored twice, once in 1704 and again in 1707. Seonamsa Palsangjeon is Tangible Cultural Property #60. =Wontongjeon= Inside Seonamsa Wontongjeon Wontongjeon (Wontong Hall; ÂúéÈÄöÊÆø) is where the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy is enshrined. The name \\"Wontong\\" signifies \\"juwon-yungtong\\" (\\"The truth is omnipresent and passes through everything\\"). Seonamsa's Wontongjeon was built in 1660. This structure is quite different from the Wontongjeon found at other Korean Buddhist temples because it has three sections. The one section in the front, and the two sections on the sides, form the shape of a \\"T\\". Two renovations occurred, one in 1698 and again in 1824. Inside Wontongjeon there is a tablet that reads \\"Daebokjeon\\" (Hall of Great Luck), written personally by King Jeongjo (1752-1800). The King had asked the High Priest Nuram of Seonamsa to offer a prayer for a male heir, for 100 days. The prayer was answered with the birth of the King‚Äôs son, Sunjo (1790-1834). As a token of his gratitude, the King awarded the temple this tablet in his own handwriting. Seonamsa Wontongjeon Tangible Cultural Property #169. =Three-Storied Stone Pagodas= The Mahavira Hall (Main Hall) is the centerpiece of the temple, enshrining Gautama Buddha. On the east and west sides of the courtyard in front of the Mahavira Hall stand a pair of three-storied stone pagodas of nearly the same size and design. These stone pagodas were erected in the same year. Seonamsa's pagodas are typical of the stone pagodas of the Silla era, from the 9th century, that enshrine ≈õarƒ´ra (pearl or crystal-like bead-shaped objects that are purportedly found among the cremated ashes of spiritual masters). The main body of the pagodas and roof stones are cut from a single piece of stone. The double stylobate has three pillars carved in relief. Each side of the main body is carved with two simple pillars in relief. The roof stones are flat and broad on four layered supports with lifted corners. The pair of Three-Storied Stone Pagodas at Seonamsa have been designated as National Treasure #395. =Lavatory= Seonamsa Lavatory The Lavatory at Seonamsa is a rectangular wood building with an open entrance on the north side, built on elevated ground. One side is for male use and the other side is for female use. This wooden structure has ventilation lattices set high in the walls. Although it is a typical outdoor toilet, it is well kept and devoid of the usual odor. At the entrance of the lavatory, there is a stone basin for hand washing. There is no documentation indicating the origin of Seonamsa's Lavatory, but it is thought to have existed since before the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98). The Lavatory at Seonamsa has been designated as a Cultural Property Material #214, the first time a toilet has been recognized as a cultural asset. =Gakhwangjeon= Gakhwangjeon (hall; Í∞ÅÌô©Ï†Ñ / Ë¶∫ÁöáÊÆø), also known as Jangyukjeon, has a plaque in front identifying the \\"gakhwang\\" as Sakyamuni, who is \\"twice as tall as people who have (an) average height\\". It's not known when the hall was first built but it was renovated in 861 by Monk Daegak. Gakhwangjeon was destroyed during the Imjinwaeran war and was rebuilt in 1660. Renovations occurred in 1760 and again in 1801. Gakhwangjeon is a small hall with an area in the front and another on the side. The foundation is made of stone and large corner stones support the building's columns. The roof is hip-and-gable having double eaves with three brackets set between the columns. Seonamsa Gakhwangjeon is Cultural Property Material #177. =Monument to the Restoration of Seonamsa= Seonamsa Monument to the Restoration of Seonamsa Most of Seonamsa was destroyed during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98). This monument was erected in 1707 to commemorate the restoration of Seonamsa that was led by the monk Yakhyu. The monument has a turtle shaped base with the body and head of the base having the embellishments of a dragon. This monument is typical of those of the Joseon Era and is considered to be one of the best examples of that style. The monument measures , wide and deep. The inscription on monument the reads; \\"Seonam Temple, destroyed by fire during the second Japanese Invasion, was renovated by Monk Yakhyu and others\\". The Monument to the Restoration of Seonamsa is Tangible Cultural Property #92. =Seonam maes= The Seonam maes (Îß§ / Ê¢Ö ‚Äòmume trees at Seonamsa‚Äô), which could number about 50 trees, live along the tile-roofed fenced road leading to Unsouam (hermitage), Wontongjeon (hall) and Gakwhangjeon (hall). In the absence of any records, the exact ages of the trees is unknown. However, according to oral traditions of the temple, the trees were planted, together with the Wasong (the Reclined Pine tree) in front of the Cheonbuljeon (hall), around 600 years ago. These Seonam White Mume trees, in the back of Wontongjeon (hall) and long the tile-rooted fence road leading to Kakwhangjeon (hall), are known to be the most valuable of the Mume trees. Seonam White Mume trees were designated as Korean National Natural Monuments #488. =Samindang= Seonamsa Samindang, a little pond Just past the Gangseon Pavilion and before reaching Ilju Gate is a small oval pond called Samindang (ÏÇºÏù∏Îãπ / ‰∏âÂç∞Â°ò), \\"the pond of the three marks\\". In the middle of the pond, there is a small islet covered with vegetation. According to Seonamsa's historical records, Samindang was created by the monk Doseon in 862. A plaque at the pond reads, \\"the three marks represent Buddhist ideals: 'Everything changes and there is no being. When people realize it, they enter nirvana'\\". Seonamsa Samindang, a unique temple structure, is Monument #46. Special Features =Wild Tea Field= Seonamsa has a wild tea field which covers an area of over 18 square kilometers/7 square miles. There are tea plants as much as 300 to 400 years old in the wild tea field. Fertilizers or chemicals have never been used. The tea field has been maintained in its natural state throughout the years. The monks hand pick the modest harvest beginning in April. Due to the tea leaves rich sweet fragrance, the tea commands a high price. Legend says that long ago mothers who sent their daughters off to be married gave them a packet of these tea seeds as a perfume. =Stone Basins= Seonamsa's stone basins supply water to the temple using four basins, a square one and three circular ones. The stone basins are connected sequentially by tubes of bamboo. The four basins have a different function based on the order of water flow. The first basin is for water to be offered up to the Buddha, the second one supplies water to clean food for the Buddha, the third is for the use by humans, and the fourth basin is for all other purposes. The stone basins have become famous because they appear in the 2003 film Dongseung (A Little Monk).

Wellesley 1917 Eton Manor Boys' Club was a boys' sports club in London, England. History =Establishment= Eton Manor Boys' Club takes its name from Eton College, which from the 1880s had run a Christian mission to raise living standards in the Hackney Wick area of the East End of London, and from the Manor Farm, bought in 1912 to build a new sports clubhouse. The Mission Church, St Mary of Eton, is still the parish church, but combined with the bombed St Augustine after the Second World War. It is now called St Mary of Eton with St Augustine. In 1973 the connections with Eton College were severed. In 1909 four Old Etonian philanthropists founded Eton Manor Boys' Club to provide sporting facilities separate from the Eton Christian Mission. They were Gerald V. Wellesley; Arthur Villiers, the second son of Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey; Edward Cadogan, the sixth son of George Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan; and Alfred Wagg of the City of London Wagg banking family. Gerald Wellesley passed on the leadership of the club to Arthur Villiers after the Great War; Villiers remained the primary guiding force behind the club until its closure.Geraldine Bedell, \\"To the Manor Born\\", The Guardian, 28 July 2007. He lived at Eton Manor Boys' Club from 1913 until his death in 1969. The club only accepted boys who had been members of the Eton Mission Boys' Club. Additionally, under the club rules only boys between the ages of 13 and 16 could join. The club attempted to restricted some boys from interacting with girls through the short-lived Junior Bachelors Society. The club's coaches included well-known sportsmen such as Douglas Jardine and Alf Ramsey. Boys who passed the age of 18 were entitled to join the \\"Old Boys\\" club. In 1920 an old rubbish tip site at the eastern end of Hackney Marshes was converted into the Club's new sports ground; it became well known as \\"The Wilderness\\". Facilities included nine football pitches, two rugby pitches, cricket pitches, six tennis courts, a bowling green, a squash court and a running track.<, ref name=\\"Bishopsgate\\" /> In the 1950s, the club had a reputation as an elite boys sporting club as well as incorporating career advice to the club's list of activities. At its peak the Club had become a leading member of the London Federation of Boys' Clubs, with success in many sports. It produced double Olympic Gold Medal middleweight boxer Harry Mallin, successful at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics and 1924 Paris Olympics; and welterweight boxer Nicholas Gargano, a bronze medallist at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. A news article in 2010 stated that Gargano would strengthen his arms by chopping wood at the clubhouse and also learned how to box at the club. The 1948 London Olympic athletics track transferred to the Eton Manor Boys' Club on The Wilderness playing fields for continued legacy use. =Closure= In the mid-1960s, Arthur Villiers decided to close the Eton Manor. The reasons were unclear, although both costs and the changing nature of the surrounding population have been cited as possible explanations. The playing fields at Eton Manor fell into disuse by 2001, before being selected as part of the London bid for the proposed London 2012 Olympic Games. The site became the venue for the 2012 Summer Paralympics tennis venue Eton Manor. Eton College has a second connection to the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, as the rowing event venue was the College's own facility, Dorney Lake. The surviving archives of the Eton Manor Boys' Club are held at the Bishopsgate Library.  Villiers Park  After Eton Manor closed in 1967, The Manor Charitable Trust, which supported it, moved into the educational field and in 1968 renamed its Oxfordshire center Villiers Park. Its other educational center in Cambridgeshire, which opened in 1989, was also named Villiers Park. The Oxfordshire center was closed in the late 1990s, and all operations moved to Cambridgeshire. The trust's main buildings at the Cambridge site ‚Äì Cadogan House, Wellesley House, and Wagg House ‚Äì are named for colleagues of Villiers who were also involved in the establishment of the trust. In 2000 The Manor Charitable Trust changed its name to Villiers Park Educational Trust. Villiers Park Educational Trust is now focused on improving social mobility in the United Kingdom. They aim to address economic inequality in the UK by delivering evidence-based programs working with less advantaged young people in the UK between the ages of 14 and 19 to ensure they reach their full academic potential. . = Location = The charity's headquarters are in Foxton, Cambridgeshire. Their activities are delivered both at their residential site in this location and regionally by staff in multiple UK areas. = Programmes =  The Scholars Programme  The Scholars Programme was established in 2009 and has expanded to run in seven areas across the UK. The Programme supports highly-able less advantaged students aged 14 to 19, with the aim of helping them reach their full potential. The Programme provides a four-year course of enrichment activities for each student, focusing on raising aspirations, confidence and motivation. The programme aims to build essential skills and behaviours that empower young people to succeed. The University of Lancaster, UEA, and the University of Suffolk are all lead partners in the Villiers Park Scholars Programme.  Inspiring Excellence  The Inspiring Excellence program is a series of five-day subject-specific residential courses designed to introduce highly- able A-level students to university level study. The program aims to inspire state school students to pursue higher education at a leading university. The charity runs approximately 32 courses each academic year, supporting over 800 students. Eton Manor Association  There is an active group of Eton Manor Boys' Club Old Boys, the Eton Manor Association. It continued to honor the former club members who died during the two World Wars at a Remembrance Sunday service at the Memorials on The Wilderness. The Olympic Delivery Authority, LOCOG and the Olympic Park Legacy Company which in 2012 became the London Legacy Development Corporation successively combined to provide a safe storage area of the Memorials removed during the development and use of The Wilderness site for the London 2012 Olympics; they were due to be restored to the Eton Manor site in 2014. Sports clubs Six sports clubs originating from Eton Manor Boys' Club and the Eton Mission are still in existence: * Eton Manor R.F.C., now playing at The New Wilderness ground in Wanstead, * Eton Manor F.C., now playing at the Capershotts ground in Waltham Abbey, * Eton Manor A.C., meeting at Waltham Forest Track and Pool in Walthamstow (young athletes) and The Cottage, Marsh Lane, in Leyton (senior athletes), * The Otters Water Polo Club, meeting at Beacontree Heath Leisure Centre in Dagenham. * The Eton Manor Golf Society. * The Eton Mission Rowing Club, founded in 1885 and with its own boathouse since 1911, which was rebuilt in 1934, is still active as a private rowing club on the Hackney Cut canal, within sight of the London 2012 Olympic Stadium. Cultural references = Film = *The 2011 Alexandra Boyd short film You Don't Have to Fight to Win is set at Eton Manor Boys' Club. *The 2018 Alexandra Boyd feature film The Wilderness tells the story of Eton Manor Boys' Club from 1912 to 1924 and its star Olympian boxer Harry Mallin.

The site was chosen by Yosef Weitz, the director of the Land and Afforestation Department of the Jewish National Fund. The monument was sculptured by the artist Nathan Rapoport, who is a Holocaust survivor. The sculpture is made of bronze and is eight meters high. It is in the shape of two scrolls, a gesture to the Jewish nation being the \\"People of the Book\\". One of the scrolls describes the Holocaust and the other describes independence. In the scroll describing the Holocaust, there are sculptured among others Janusz Korczak and his children, a row of helmets symbolizing the Nazi soldiers, a member of The Ghetto Fighters holding a grenade, and other characters behind fences of concentration camps. This scroll ends with holocaust survivors immigrating to Israel in Aliyah Bet, people from Israel helping them get off the boats, and a Jewish man kissing the Land of Israel. In the scroll describing independence, there are sculptured symbols of Israel, such as: Olive trees, a child holding a cluster of grapes, a man blowing a shofar near the Western Wall, the menorah as described in the Arch of Titus, an old character representing Elijah, people dancing Hora and flags flying near an angel blowing a trumpet. In the space between the two scrolls, there are two rooms of memorial, and in each one is engraved a quote from the bible.Ezekiel 37:12+14, written in Hebrew and English: \\"Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, o my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of Israel. ...

In a racing career lasting from September 1969 until July 1971, the filly ran seven times and won six races. As a three-year-old she won the Oaks at Epsom and the Yorkshire Oaks at York before sustaining her only defeat in the Prix Vermeille. Lupe returned as a four-year-old and defeated colts to win the Coronation Cup and the Princess of Wales's Stakes. She was then retired from racing and became a successful broodmare. Background Lupe was a bay filly bred at the Snailwell Stud in Newmarket. The stud was owned by Stanhope Joel, and Lupe raced in the colours of Joel's wife, Gladys. The filly was bred for stamina: her sire Primera won the fourteen-furlong Ebor Handicap while her dam Alcoa, was an out-and-out stayer who won over two and a quarter miles and finished second in the Cesarewitch. As a descendant of the broodmare Tillywhim, Alcoa was a member of the same branch of Thoroughbred family 1-k which produced the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winners Levmoss and Three Troikas. Lupe was trained by Noel Murless at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket. Racing career Lupe did not appear on the racecourse until the autumn of 1969 and ran only once as a two-year-old. At Doncaster in September, she won a maiden race over six furlongs. On her three-year-old debut in May 1970, Lupe was moved up in class to contest the Cheshire Oaks, a race that served as a trial for the Epsom Oaks in June. She won the race impressively to establish herself as a leading Classic contender. At Epsom Downs Racecourse on 6 June, she was made favourite for the Oaks at odds of 100/30 after being the subject of heavy betting on the day of the race. The field of sixteen runners included challengers form Ireland and France. Ridden by the twenty-two-year-old Sandy Barclay, Lupe took the lead two furlongs from the finish and drew away from her opponents to win easily by four lengths from State Pension and Arctic Wave. The filly was rested before returning in the Yorkshire Oaks at York in August. She won comfortably from Highest Hopes, who had previously finished second in the Prix de Diane. In September, Lupe was sent to France for the Prix Vermeille. She sustained the first and only defeat of her career as she finished sixth behind Highest Hopes and Miss Dan. Unusually for a Classic winning filly at that time, Lupe remained in training as a four-year-old. She made her first appearance for nine months when she ran in the Coronation Cup at Epsom in June 1971. Ridden by Geoff Lewis, she won \\"readily\\" by a neck from the French-trained colt Stintino. A month later at Newmarket, Lupe won the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket, comfortably beating Sacramento Song. Retirement Lupe spent most of her breeding career in the United States, where she proved to be a highly successful broodmare. Her sons included Lascaux (Prix Jean de Chaudenay), Leonardo da Vinci (White Rose Stakes) and Legend of France (Earl of Sefton Stakes). Her daughter Louveterie won the Prix Vanteaux and was the dam of the Group One winners Loup Sauvage (Prix d'Ispahan) and Loup Solitaire (Grand Crit√©rium). She produced seven black-type winners in her career and had her last foal in 1988. Lupe died in 1989. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Lupe an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. Lupe was given a rating of 121 by Timeform in 1970, eight pounds below the leading three-year-old filly Highest Hopes and seventeen pounds below the top-rated horse of the year, Nijinsky. The Lupe Stakes, a trial for the Epsom Oaks, was run at Goodwood Racecourse between 1972 and 2007.

He was known for the development of naval gymnastics, which were meant to improve the alertness and flexibility of sailors in closed areas of warships and he was known for leading the paratroopers. He was the first jumper during the drop on an airfield 60 km south of Manado, Indonesia, in the Battle of Manado. Early life He was born in Kumamoto, Kumamoto Prefecture on 27 September 1900 in the house known as Mimageno Kadogoya, since his ancestors were heads of a small town. After graduation from a middle school in 1919, he entered the Naval school at Edajima, Hiroshima Prefecture and graduated in 1922. In the Naval school, he studied not only English but also Spanish and Portuguese. After graduation, he became a naval officer in September 1923, and was ordered to take a pilot student course. Unfortunately, he was struck by a whirling propeller and had to defer his training.Uehara[2011:71] He took another course and joined the crew of a destroyer. In December 1, 1927 he was promoted to lieutenant and took artillery. In 1928, he became a division officer in Japanese cruiser Natori and in 1929, he was a division officer in Japanese cruiser Ashigara. In 1930, he became a teacher at the Naval school. He was in charge of artillery and gymnastics. In October 1934, he was appointed as the teacher of artillery at Yokosuka. At the end of 1936, he sailed on the Japanese cruiser Isuzu as the artillery officer. Navy gymnastics He was known for the development of his own gymnastics based on the Denmark gymnastics. As a teacher of gymnastics at the Naval school, he had long felt a need that those in the navy should attain more alertness and flexibility of actions in the limited spaces of warships and he studied various methods; traditionally the Japanese Imperial Army had employed the Swedish gymnastics. Once, he had a chance of learning the Denmark gymnastics by visiting Danish gymnasts at Okayama, and developed his own system, based on the flexible movements of extremities; because of his peculiar movements, he was nicknamed octopus man. He revealed the superiority of this gymnastics by showing the team he taught won high marks in various games and finally the Ministry of the Navy employed his method of gymnastics. In 1944, he was awarded for his development of gymnastics by the Navy Minister.Koizumi[2009:7the chapter] Airborne commander Prior to the beginning of the Pacific War, he was appointed as a special commander, and on 11 January 1942, his troop successfully performed an airborne operation at Manado, North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Earlier, he had been the leader in training paratroopers at Tateyama, Chiba, during which a number of trainees died due to various reasons. On November 1940, the trainees were divided into the first special troop, headed by him numbering 750, another troop was headed by Fukumi. He jumped at 9:52 a.m. on 11 January 1942 from a height of 150 metres. His flight was recorded on film and was used for propaganda purposes. As an Administrator According to Japanese reports, Horiuchi treated the inhabitants of the island well, and was appreciated them. During his short tenure, he gave reportedly provided necessary goods such as salt, and reduced the tax to 1/4 of the previous amount. Horiuchi reportedly used the local language and according to one Japanese source, treated the prisoners of war (POWs) of the Netherlands fairly. On 11 January 1992, a goodwill meeting was held in commemoration of the 50th year of the parachute drop. Issai Horiuchi, the son of Horiuchi, carried the photograph of Horiuchi and several hundreds of the inhabitants attended the meeting.Uehara 2011:preface Hiroyuki Agawa, who later became a writer, was under Horiuchi when Horiuchi was transferred to Toukou of Taiwan in 1943 as a teacher of Naval students. Horiuchi said to Agawa that he was one of those who were loved by those in the occupied lands. He lost any desire or position when my assistant lieutenant died. To become a good commander, eliminate five desires, especially the sexual desire. Those who lost something will not kill others, but those whose lovers are taken by someone, may kill them. In the occupied lands, the Japanese army and navy made mistakes because of this.Uehara[2010:221] As a B-class war criminal On 29 January 1948, a written indictment was read at the Manado Temporary Military Court which presented charges against Japanese Navy Colonel Toyoaki Horiuchi by the order of the Prosecutor General (dated 19 January 1948). The charges were that Horiuchi ordered or allowed Dutch army officers to be subjected to systemic terrorism. He was in a position of knowing the terrorism and did not punish Japanese officers. In 1942, at least 30 Dutch officers were killed with swords. He was in a position of knowing this but did not take necessary preventive measures. These are against the rules dealing with wartime criminals. Lawyer Ide stated that Horiuchi did not know these facts. There were 9 witnesses, most from the Dutch side. Horiuchi sent a letter of testimony that he did not know these facts. However, he felt responsible as an officer of superior rank. For a long time, he believed that we should love enemies. In January 1942, when he set up the parachute troop center, he strongly banned violence to those on the Dutch side. We treated these officers with respect and courtesy. He was impressed by Van den Berg officer who asked for permission while he was responsible. He punished his officers who gave him some violence.

From the mid-1990s he worked closely with Chinese singer/actress Faye Wong as her stylist before moving to Paris to become a full-time designer in the early 2010s. Early life and education Titi Kwan's father was a tailor who worked from home, specialising in traditional Chinese garments. Aged 15, he moved to Paris to stay with his sister, where he was able to express his individual sense of style without feeling out of place. At the age of 18, Kwan enrolled in the Studio Ber√ßot in Paris, where he learned about the history of fashion, and developed his sewing, cutting and design skills under the eye of Marie Rucki. He worked as a waiter to pay his tuition fees, and also found additional work as a stylist, eventually leaving the Studio in order to focus full-time on this. As stylist During a trip back home to Hong Kong in the mid-1990s, Kwan met Faye Wong whilst looking for a performer to feature in a fashion magazine. This was the beginning of a long-running partnership between Wong and her new stylist, Kwan, who from that point on worked almost exclusively for her until she took a career break in 2004. Wong's first outfit was a Versace dress and flip-flops, whose modernity came as a surprise to many of her fans who were used to conservative, late 1980s styles. Wong and Kwan also looked at clothes by up-and-coming avant-garde designers such as Dries Van Noten and Martin Margiela. Whilst working with Kwan, Faye Wong became known as the \\"Madonna of the East\\". Though described as a fashion visionary and an \\"uber stylist\\", Kwan maintained an inscrutable, low-key personal profile, allowing his work to represent him. He has been compared to fellow celebrity stylists Nicola Formichetti and Rachel Zoe, and called \\"Asia's most infamous stylist\\". Fashion designer Faye Wong's four-year career break in 2004 enabled Kwan to pursue fashion design, and develop his vision. In 2008, he presented his first collection at the Hy√®res fashion festival, where it was shortlisted. The collection was taken up by Maria Luisa Poumaillou, who sold it through her Paris boutique. Despite this early success, Kwan chose not to design again until 2011, when he felt more confident about his skills. His label, which is titled Alibellus+, is divided into three separate ranges - separates and casual wear, a line of dresses with handmade finishing and detail, and unique pieces made from vintage textiles.Alibellus+ Menswear Fall Winter 2013 Paris Kwan's designs, which start with draping fabric on a form before sketching or devising a pattern, combine bias cutting and draping with folding techniques to create garments designed for movement and comfort. He cites the 1920s-30s designer Madeleine Vionnet, renowned for her bias cutting techniques and precision of finish, as an important influence on his work. The work of the photographer Richard Avedon and filmmakers Wim Wenders and Jim Jarmusch are also sources of inspiration. Kwan has collaborated with Christophe Lemaire of Herm√®s and Martine Sitbon. He also continues to work closely with Faye Wong, creating costumes for her 2011 world tour, including a goddess gown made from a single piece of fabric, and a dramatically flowing gown using over 100 metres of layered chiffon.

It is owned by MediaQuest Holdings, an investee company of Philippine telecommunications giant PLDT, through its Beneficial Trust Fund, and headed by business tycoon Manuel V. Pangilinan. Among its assets owns and operates two broadcast television networks (TV5 and One Sports channel), the national radio station (Radyo5 92.3 News FM), and the regional radio network (Radyo5). It also operates two international television channels (Kapatid Channel and AksyonTV International) along with subsidiaries such as TV film productions and originals (Studio5) a exclusive sales and marketing agent (Media5) as well as digital and online portals technology (D5 Studio; TV5.com.ph, News5 Digital, ESPN5.com, and GG Network). History =Origin= Joaquin \\"Chino\\" Roces, owner of The Manila Times, was granted a radio-TV franchise from Congress under Republic Act 2945 on June 19, 1960. He then founded the Associated Broadcasting Corporation and the channel \\"ABC 5\\" with the call sign DZTM-TV and its first studios along Pasong Tamo in Makati. ABC 5 was launched on March 19, 1962, becoming the fourth television network established in the country. ABC operated radio and television services from 1960 until September 23, 1972, when dictator Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law. Both ABC and The Manila Times were forcibly shut down as a result. =Revival= After the People Power Revolution in 1986, Roces made a successful appeal to President Corazon Aquino for the restoration of the network until his death on September 30, 1988. New stockholders led by businessman Edward Tan and Roces's son Edgardo then began the arduous task of bringing the network back on the air. The Securities and Exchange Commission granted their application for an increase in capitalization and amendments to ABC's articles of incorporation and by-laws. They were subsequently given a permit to operate by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC). ABC inaugurated its studio complex and transmitter tower in San Bartolome, Novaliches, Quezon City in 1990 and began test broadcasts by the end of 1991, officially returning on air as the Associated Broadcasting Company on February 21, 1992, with ABC Development Corporation as the new corporate name. Its radio counterpart, Kool 106 was launched at the same time. Later, it acquired a new franchise to operate on December 9, 1994, under Republic Act 7831 signed by President Fidel V. Ramos. In 1999, ABC was awarded the channel 47 frequency in Metro Manila, the last remaining UHF frequency in the market, christening it DWDZ-TV. However, has been inactive since 2003. =Cojuangco era= In October 2003, ABC was acquired by a group led by businessman Antonio \\"Tonyboy\\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. served as Chairman of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) from 1998-2004 and owner of Dream Satellite Broadcasting and Bank of Commerce, among other assets. Its biggest achievement was when its flagship channel, ABC, won as the \\"Outstanding TV Station\\" award at the 2005 KBP Golden Dove Awards, with several other programs on the network also earning honors in their respective categories. In early 2007, ABC suffered a setback when it implemented a series of budget cuts, primarily directed towards its news department, which laid off most of its employees. In 2008, ABC-5 was rebranded as TV5 as it enters a partnership with MPB Primedia Inc., a local company backed by Media Prima Berhad of Malaysia as part of a long- term strategy to make the station more competitive. This caused the revitalization of its ratings from 1.9% in July 2008 (before the re-branding) to 11.1% in September 2009.AGB-NMR =Acquisition by PLDT= On October 20, 2009, Media Prima announced that it would be divesting its 70% share in TV5/MPB Primedia and selling it to the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company's broadcasting arm, MediaQuest Holdings, Inc. as the company incurs losses in the midst of global financial crisis. MediaQuest also acquired Cojuangco-owned ABC Development Corporation and its television stations by the end of the year. The two acquisitions was completed on March 2, 2010, as announced by PLDT chairman Manuel V. Pangilinan. TV5 was reformatted on April 4, 2010, with a new lineup of programming and branding as the \\"Kapatid\\" (\\"sibling\\") network. ABC's radio arm Dream FM was retained under Cojuangco management after the latter had transferred its ownership to Interactive Broadcast Media. By July 2011, Dream FM Network was closed and its Manila station was sold to Ultrasonic Broadcasting System and relaunched as 106.7 Energy FM. Upon acquisition, TV5 expressed interest to acquire the 27.24% controlling share of Indosiar Karya Media, which operates Indosiar, by-then owned by PLDT affiliate Salim Group to transform the network as the pan- regional multimedia leader in Southeast Asia. The agreement was projected to be reached by 2011, but it was never conceptualized after Indosiar merged to Surya Citra Media, a subsidiary of Emtek in 2013.TV5 owner to invest in Indon broadcast firmMediaquest expects accord on Indosiar stake this year On October 1, 2010, TV5 took over the management of MediaQuest's Nation Broadcasting Corporation stations; DWFM was re-launched as a TV5-branded news radio station on November 8, 2010, Radyo5 92.3 NewsFM, and DWNB-TV was re-launched as AksyonTV on February 21, 2011, a news channel based on TV5's newscast Aksyon. In June 2011, Sports5 began a deal with the state-run Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation to produce sports programming for the network under the brand AKTV. The block time deal ended on May 31, 2013, although TV5 continues to use IBC-13's Broadcast City facilities for sports events as MediaQuest Holdings is a possible bidder for the privatization of IBC-13. Through co-owned Pilipinas Global Network Ltd., international channels Kapatid TV5 and AksyonTV International were launched in April 2011. The channels were available in Europe, Middle East, North Africa, Guam, and the United States. TV5 has also entered the social media space as it began its online lifestyle site Kristn.com, a Pinoy online music portal Balut Radio and news video content site News5 Everywhere. ‚ÄòKristn‚Äô paves way for TV5‚Ä≤s charge into digital revolution Kristn and Balut Radio are inactive since December 2014.

Once the Media Center is completed in 2016, it will house TV5, and their sister companies Cignal Digital TV, Voyager Innovations and Philex Mining. Upon failure of acquiring a stake on GMA Network, TV5's ultimate parent, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) pours more funds to TV5. PLDT's subsidiary, ePLDT, Inc., invests P6-billion in the form of Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDRs) in MediaQuest to sustain the growth momentum of TV5 as well as affiliate Cignal TV. PLDT will also install new platforms and technology that will suit consumers‚Äô preference. TV5 Chair Manny Pangilinan predicted that TV5 would \\"break even\\" by 2017. In response to the process of shifting to Digital Terrestrial Television, TV5 invested P500-700 million in the next four years as preparation for its shift to digital TV. Currently, TV5 and AksyonTV conduct digital test broadcasts on channels 42 and 51, operated by TV5 affiliates Nation Broadcasting Corporation and Mediascape, respectively. It also plans to convert its UHF stations that operate TV5 and AksyonTV, to DTV transmitters.

He created \\"magic theatres\\" for the aristocracy ‚Äì small boxes that use lanterns and slides to create an animated story. Guyot's work was influential in the development of magic lanterns and their use in phantasmagoria. In 1770 he detailed a method of simultaneously using two different slides in this early projection device. His example was a sea that would become increasingly stormy, throwing around the ships that were sailing on it. He advised that the slides would need to be very carefully painted in order to create a realistic and beautiful animation. His writings on the subject were translated into English and German and were widely circulated around Europe. His experiments led to the technique of projecting images onto smoke to create the appearance of ghostly apparitions. In 1779 Guyot described the use of transformation slides in magic lanterns to create simple animations. =Nouvelles recreations physiques et mathematiques= Guyot's four part book Nouvelles recreations physiques et mathematiques featured descriptions of experiments and examples of how various innovative mathematical and magical tricks could be performed. The book was first published in 1769 and included an explanation of Hooper's paradox, It also includes detailed, illustrated techniques for the performance of the cups and balls trick that is regarded as being greatly influential. The book was adapted into English by William Hooper, under the title Rational Recreations being released in 1774 without credit to Guyot. Medicine Guyot is credited with describing in 1724 the catheterization of the Eustachian tube, one of the first means of middle ear inflation.

In 1261 the idea of compiling histories for both the Jin and Liao dynasties was first mooted, and after the conquest of Southern Song, the project was expanded to compile all three histories. Issues with the format and rules of compilation, however, hampered progress, and it was only in 1343 that the imperial commission was finalised, with Toqto'a as the overseer, and a team of six, including the scholar Ouyang Xuan, as chief compilers. The work was completed in just over a year. For its material, the History of Jin drew heavily on the historical records of the Jin dynasty itself, while the events of its final years drew heavily on the private works and records of scholars such as Yuan Haowen, Liu Qi, Yang Huan and others. The History of Jin was translated into Manchu as (Wylie: Aisin gurun i suduri, M√∂llendorff: Aisin gurun i suduri). The Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty used the Manchu language to \\"correct\\" Chinese character transcriptions of Jurchen language names in the History of Jin in his \\"Imperial Liao Jin Yuan Three Histories National Language Explanation\\" (Ê¨ΩÂÆöÈÅºÈáëÂÖÉ‰∏âÂè≤ÂúãË™ûËß£) project. Qianlong's \\"corrections\\" ended up compounding the errors and making the transcription of some foreign words even worse. Marshall Broomhall wrote that \\"So unscientific was this work that the K'ien-lung editions of the Liao, Kin, and Y√ºan histories are practically useless.\\" Emil Bretschneider demonstrated how the etymologies in the Qianlong edition were incorrect. Layout The History of Jin contains a total of 135 scrolls, or chapters, divided as follows: *19 Annals or imperial biographies (Êú¨Á¥Ä), detailing the lives of Jin emperors *39 Treatises (Âøó), detailing facts of economic and social history during the period *4 Chronological tables (Ë°®) *71 Biographies (ÂàóÂÇ≥), detailing lives of important people during the period Within the Annals, volume 1 contains a description of the ancestral records of the founding Wanyan clan, their origin in the Heishui Mohe peoples of Outer Manchuria, and ancestral figures, including Hanpu, Wugunai, Shilu, Helibo, and Wuyashu. Tillman explains the background to this volume in English. Volume 19 includes some early figures of the Jin dynasty who were given posthumous titles, including Wanyuan Zongjun ÂÆåÈ¢úÂÆóÂ≥ª (d. 1124), Wanyan Zongyao ÂÆåÈ°èÂÆóÂ†Ø (1096-1135), and Wanyan Yungong ÂÆåÈ¢úÂÖÅÊÅ≠ (1146-1185) Within the Treatises, volumes 25-26 describe the geographic divisions of the Jin, organized by the primary level administrative division of circuit (Ë∑Ø). The section Finance and Economics (È£üË≤®) spans volumes 46‚Äì50, Selection of Officials (ÈÅ∏Ëàâ) spans volumes 51‚Äì54, Official Posts (ÁôæÂÆò) spans volumes 55‚Äì58. Volume 57 describes the unique meng'an mouke ÁåõÂÆâË¨ÄÂÖã social system of the Jurchen. Volume 2 confirms Aguda as dubojilie ÈÉΩÂãÉÊ•µÁÉà or supreme chief in this system. Biographies of a number of tribal unit chiefs with title bojilie ÂãÉÊ•µÁÉà are given in volume 76. One unusual feature of the text in comparison with other standard histories is the tabular descriptions of communication with neighboring states (‰∫§ËÅò) in volumes 60‚Äì62. A list of 125 Jurchen language words transcribed in Chinese characters can be found in the Jin Guoyu Jie (\\"Explanation of the national language of the Jin\\" ÈáëÂúãË™ûËß£), an appendix to the History of Jin. It is found in Chapter 135 - ÈáëÂè≤/Âç∑135. Alexander Wylie translated the list into English and Manchu. Researches on Manchu Origins contained a list of corrections of the transcribed Jurchen words found in the History of Jin in Chapter 135 - ÈáëÂè≤/Âç∑135, using the Manchu language to correct them, found in Chapter 18 - ÊªøÊ¥≤Ê∫êÊµÅËÄÉ/Âç∑18 Notes References *Franke, Herbert. 1971. \\"Chin Dynastic History Project\\".

He was the son of Edward, Lord Sanquhar. Robert is often styled \\"6th Lord Sanquhar.\\" Career Robert Crichton was rumoured to have been in Rome in the company of Jesuits and to have spoken with the Pope in 1593. The Jesuit missionary to Scotland, William Crichton, was his kinsman.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 261 Crichton was a noted swordsman. In June 1596 he challenged Patrick, Earl of Orkney to a duel. James VI of Scotland forbade him to issue the challenge, called a \\"cartel.\\" However, they arranged to fight, but the King was able to prevent their combat. The English diplomat Robert Bowes heard that Sanquhar alleged the quarrel was Sanquhar's loss of a court appointment, but according to rumour Sanquhar had been encouraged to fight the Earl by another powerful figure.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp.248-9 no.206 As a diplomat, Crichton took the letters of James VI of Scotland to Henry IV of France and Henri, Duke of Rohan at the siege of Amiens in 1597, and then travelled to Italy.Letters and Papers Reign of James Sixth from the collection of James Balfour of Denmylne (Bannatyne Club, 1838), pp. 36‚Äì37 On 27 May 1602 he returned from his travels and was welcomed by James VI at Dunfermline Palace, and attended the christening of Robert Stuart, Duke of Kintyre. Robert had met Elizabeth I of England at the insistence of the French diplomats in London. According to one who spoke to him there, Robert had resolved to serve the Spanish king. In June 1602 Robert, who was a friend of Anne of Denmark's favourite, Barbara Ruthven, was granted the Gowrie House lodging in Perth, which the Ruthven family had forfeited in 1600, with the offices of Constable and Keeper of the town.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.13 (1969), part 2, pp.982, 1003, 1012. In July he was appointed to attend the French ambassador, the Baron de Tour, who arrived before Lord Sanquhar knew it. Subsequently Sanquhar acted as an interpreter between the Baron de Tour and the English diplomat George Nicholson.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 1031, 1033-4. London, a fencing accident, and murder Lord Sanquhar followed King James to England after the Union of Crowns. On 10 August 1604, while staying with Lord Norreys, he went to practice swordsmanship with a fencing master called John Turner at Rycote. By accident, Sanquhar was hurt in the eye. On 9 February 1608 he performed in the masque The Hue and Cry After Cupid at Whitehall Palace as a sign of the zodiac, to celebrate the wedding of John Ramsay, Viscount Haddington to Elizabeth Radclyffe .Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1838), p. 223. After some years, and following teasing for his disfigurement by the King of France, Sanquhar's followers murdered the fencing master. Turner was killed by a pistol shot on 11 May 1612, while he was drinking with some of Lord Sanquhar's followers. One called Carlisle fired the fatal shot. After four days Lord Sanquhar went to the Archbishop of Canterbury and declared that he was innocent of the murder. King James issued a proclamation of a reward of ¬£500 for Sanquhar alive, and ¬£300 dead. For Carlisle, the reward was ¬£100 alive and ¬£50 dead. Soon afterwards, another of Sanquhar's servants, a Scotsman called Gray, was arrested at Harwich where he was embarking on a ship for Denmark. Gray confessed that Lord Sanquhar had previously asked him to kill Turner. Lord Sanquhar was brought before the justices of the King's Bench. Not being a peer of England, he was tried under the name of Robert Crichton, although a baron of three hundred years' standing. Francis Bacon delivered the charges against him. Bacon suggested his offence was caused by Italian manners he had picked up on his travels, rather than English or Scottish custom.Montagu, Basil, ed., Works of Francis Bacon, vol.2 (Philadelphia, 1841), pp. 311‚Äì312 His wife Anne Fermor divorced him, and later married the Irish nobleman Barnabas O'Brien, 6th Earl of Thomond. He was executed by hanging on 29 June 1612 in Westminster Palace yard, confessing that he had offended England and Scotland, and declared he was a Roman Catholic. His body was taken by Lord Dingwall and Robert Kerr, Lord Roxburgh to be sent to Scotland.Birch, Thomas, & Williams, Folkestone, ed., The Court and Times of James I, vol.1 (London, 1848), pp. 33, 167-8, 179-180. By his marriage at St. Anne's, Blackfriars, 10 April 1608, to Anne, daughter of Sir George Fermor of Easton, he had no issue. All his property was left to his natural son, Robert Crichton, but the heir male, William, seventh lord Sanquhar, disputed the succession, and on the matter being referred to James VI Robert Crichton was served heir of entail to him in the estate of Sanquhar 15 July 1619. He had another son, William, who was 21 or near that age in 1616, when the Earl of Roxburghe was one of his curators.Melros Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), pp. 264‚Äì5.

The Municipality of Vennesla decided in 2005 to relocate the library to the city centre, linking together an existing community house and learning centre into a cultural centre. A caf√©, open meeting places and a small scene were incorporated into the plan of the new building, making it a combined library and house of culture. With the new building, the municipality sought both to establish a public meeting place and to increase the quality of architecture in the urban area of Vennesla. An architectural design competition was initiated in 2008; it was won by the firm Helen & Hard from Stavanger and the new building was ready in 2011. The main building material is wood, and the building is dominated by the 27 glue-laminated timber arcs that support the roof and give associations to ribs of a whale skeleton.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez, from a story by Adam Muto. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on March 18, 2010 as a preview for the series; it later officially aired on May 17, 2010. The episode guest stars Erik Estrada as King Worm. The episode marks the first appearance of Marceline the Vampire Queen (voiced by Olivia Olson), who would go on to play a larger role in the series as a friend and companion to Finn and Jake. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake search the land of Ooo for a new home after Marceline claims the duo's treehouse as her own. Finn and Jake search all of Ooo for a new home, before settling temporarily in a cave. After a final confrontation, Marceline relents and gives Finn and Jake their house back because she finds them entertaining. The character of Marceline was present in the series' pitch bible, but she had not yet appeared in an episode prior to \\"Evicted!\\". Olson was cast as the character after she initially read for the part of Princess Bubblegum; she was later pleased with her casting, praising Marceline's varied design. \\"Evicted!\\" also features the first song that was produced for the series: \\"The House Hunting Song\\". \\"Evicted!\\" was watched by 1.88 million people and received largely positive critical attention, with Cam Shea of IGN naming the episode the fourth best episode of Adventure Times first season, and Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club noting that the episode is an example of the emotional complexity of the series. \\"Evicted!\\" also drastically increased Marceline's popularity with fans of the series. Plot During a rainy night, Jake tells Finn a story about a supposed vampire that used to live in their tree fort. Finn, scared by the sounds outside the house, goes downstairs to talk to Jake. Suddenly, their window is blown open and the lights go out. Finn and Jake soon discover that Marceline the Vampire Queen has sneaked into their house. Both Finn and Jake are terrified that Marceline will kill them and drink their blood, but she reveals that she has no intentions of killing them, noting that she really only eats the color red. However, she explains that the tree house used to belong to her, and she promptly evicts them from their residence. Finn and Jake then attempt to find new homes. After a string of failures, they soon stumble upon a cozy cave. They clean it up and throw a house-warming party, which Marceline crashes. She explains that the cave also belongs to her. Finn, having had enough, starts a fight with Marceline, who grows into a huge demonic bat. After she seemingly kills Jake, Finn goes into a rage and violently punches Marceline, who promptly shape-shifts into her regular form and then kisses Finn on the cheek, making him blush. Jakewho it is revealed used his shape-shifting powers to save himselfruns over to Finn, and Marceline states that the fight they had was fun. As a token of goodwill, she gives them their old house back. Once Finn and Jake return to the tree fort, they are promptly hypnotized by King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada). Production Marceline is voiced by Olivia Olson. \\"Evicted!\\" was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez, from a story developed by Adam Muto. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter, with Pat McHale serving as creative director and Nick Jennings serving as art director. The storyboard for the episode is substantially different from the finished episode. Major changes include the dialogue between Finn and Jake near the beginning being longer, and the \\"House Hunting Song\\" being absent from the script. Other changed scene include Finn and Jake's encounter with the Ice King (in the original version, Finn and Jake huddle in a group of penguins, which incites the Ice King's anger), the manner in which Finn and Jake discover the cave (Finn and Jake fall through the top and are nearly impaled by stalagmites), as well as the ending (which originally featured Jake and Finn dealing with a werewolf). The aforementioned \\"House Hunting Song\\" was the first musical piece produced for Adventure Time (with the exception of the theme song). The songwhich was originally called \\"Oh Marceline\\"was sung by Ward and Olivia Olson. The lyrics were written by Ward, who recorded a rough demo of the song a cappella. Patrick McHale later re-recorded the song with guitar, and Ward then recorded both a different, \\"high intensity\\" version and a more subdued variant. When the crew was deciding which version to use, Ward wanted to use McHale's recording, but Derek Drymon urged Ward to use his own. McHale later posted his demo for the song through his official Twitter account. In a 2016 Tumblr post, McHale explained: > When I was working on Season 1 of Adventure Time (2009? 2008?) we had to > write a montage song for the episode \\"Evicted!\\" while Finn and Jake are > looking for a new house. Pen wrote a bunch of lyrics, so I brought them home > and fine tuned them and put them to music. I recorded a demo that was too > long, so I just digitally sped it up to be the right length (which is the > recording above). [The song] was supposed to sound sort of... lame... like > sort of‚Ä¶ like a lame singer songwriter guy who‚Äôs into Dave Matthews but > isn‚Äôt nearly as talented. That was, like, a thing in the early 2000s‚Ä¶ a lot > of people played this certain acoustic guitar style, but I don‚Äôt know the > name for it. Maybe it has tinges of what was called \\"Emo\\"?

[...] In the end I didn‚Äôt want to sing the final version, > so Pen did the singing in the show. He did more of a Blink 182 style thing. > Blink 182? Is that right? Ashley Dzerigian played all of the bass in the episode. According to series composer Casey James Basichis, she is \\"classically trained as a bassist and can do just about anything\\". Ryan Conner recorded guitar feedback that Basichis later autotuned into melodies. The episode marks the first appearance of Marceline, one of the main characters in Adventure Time. Although she did not appear in the series' pilot, the groundwork for her design and character were present in the series pitch book, penned by Pendleton Ward. Ward purposely set out to make Marceline's character complex, as he explained in an interview that \\"with the female characters it‚Äôs easy to either write them as clich√©s or write them as the extreme opposite of those clich√©s [‚Ä¶] I just try to make them have faults and strengths just like Finn and Jake have.\\" Marceline is voiced by Olivia Olson; she had originally auditioned for the role of Princess Bubblegum. After her initial audition, she was asked to read for the role of Marcelline, and was \\"definitely impressed by the character\\" after seeing design drawings. Olson is also the character's singing voice. The artistic design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead character designer and prop designer for Adventure Time. Olson later related in an interview that she was impressed by her character because, \\"she has really cool style [‚Ä¶] I love what they come up with [in] every episode.\\" The episode also features the vocal talents of actor Erik Estrada as King Worm; Estrada would reprise the role for the eponymous fourth season episode \\"King Worm\\". Reception \\"Evicted!\\" was previewed on Cartoon Network on March 18, 2010. The episode officially aired on May 17, 2010. the episode was watched by 1.88 viewers, and scored a 1.2/2 percent Nielsen household rating. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 1.2 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode's airing. Critical reception to \\"Evicted!\\" was largely positive. Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline's introduction in \\"Evicted!\\" as the fourth best moment in the series' first season. He wrote that \\"sure, in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey, this is the first time we meet her and she's awesome.\\" He later wrote that \\"Marceline = best\\". Marceline has gone on to be one of the most popular characters with the Adventure Time fan base, and after the release of \\"Evicted!\\" her popularity grew enormously. Ward later noted that he felt \\"good about that. It's nice\\". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club named the episode one of the ten additional installments of the series that illustrates that \\"emotional complexity\\" lies \\"beneath Adventure Times weirdness\\". In the Ancient Psychic Tandem Warcast podcast, Zack Smith and the Supernatural writer and producer Jenny Klein reviewed the episode, both of whom expressed an appreciation for Marceline as well as her voice actress. Klein compared the relationship between Marceline and Finn in this episode to the interactions between Kim Kelly (Busy Philipps) and Sam Weir (John Francis Daley), characters from the short-lived sitcom Freaks and Geeks. Klein also commended the \\"House Hunting Song\\", applauding the fact that it was sung by Pendleton Ward and arguing that it was an example of the creator speaking directly to the audience. She likened this experience to listening to an audiobook read by the author. Media release The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2011 Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People DVD, which included 12 episodes from the series' first two seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete first season DVD in July 2012. In addition, the 2015 limited edition 12\\" vinyl record release Marceline the Vampire Queen Rock the Nightosphere included \\"The House Hunting Song\\" alongside other songs sung by Marceline.

The larvae feed on Primula, Bartsia and Saxifraga species. The larvae of the first generation mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a full depth mine. It starts as a long, slender corridor, widening into a blotch that may occupy most of the leaf, destroying the initial corridor. A single larva may make several mines. In the corridor, the frass is deposited in a broad central line, which becomes narrower later.

Originally commissioned as a free standing work of art within St. Peter's itself, the sculpture was finally unveiled in 1670 as an integral part of the Scala Regia - Bernini's redesigned stairway between St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican Palace. Unlike other large works by Bernini, art historians have suggested that this work was almost entirely undertaken by him - no other sculptors have been recorded as receiving payment. Bernini's overall fee was 7,000 Roman scudi. Rudolf Wittkower, Bernini, the Sculptor of the Roman Baroque, 1955 (1st ed.), p.252  Theme  As an early Christian ruler, the figure of Constantine the Great was particularly appealing to later popes, particularly in the seventeenth century. Bernini's sculpture adapted one particular moment of Constantine's life. Before a battle with the pagan Roman Emperor, Maxentius, Constantine was leading prayers with his army. After a while a cross appeared in the sky, above the sun, shining brightly and with the inscription In Hoc Signo Vinces or '\\"By this sign, you will conquer\\"'. The miracle astonished Constantine and his troops and gave them sufficient belief to overwhelm Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge, after which Constantine made a triumphal entry to Rome, with which he granted religious toleration, thus freeing the Christians from Roman persecution. Eusebius, Vita Constantini 1.28, tr. Odahl, 105. Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius, 43; Drake, \\"Impact of Constantine on Christianity\\" (CC), 113; Odahl, 105. Other classical writers give slightly different accounts of the vision.  Commissioning  Side view. The actual daylight from the original window purposely contributes to give the sense of \\"vision\\" The sculpture has a long history, beginning in 1654, when Bernini began the work, quite possibly commissioned by Pope Innocent X. All references in this section taken from Tod Marder, Bernini's Scala Regia at the Vatican Palace, 1996, 165-179 The original plan was to place the sculpture within St Peter's Basilica. However, when Alexander VII assumed the papal throne a year later, the project was reinvigorated, securing the arrival of a large block of marble which Bernini could use to put existing drawings and sketches into practice. However, for reasons that are unclear, the project was delayed again, and Bernini did not start work on the block until 1662. It was only at an undefined point in the 1660s that the location for the statue become the new Scala Regia that Bernini himself was designing. Bernini continued refining the equestrian sculpture, and changes were made to the design to cope with the new location on the Scala Regia. Huge clay models of the sculpture were placed within the niche, giving Bernini an idea of what the final composition would look like when placed in situ. Because of the tallness of the niche, overwhelming the sculpture, folding, dynamic drapery was added to the overall decorative effect, to be placed behind the marble horse. This allowed Bernini to make the final touches to Constantine, and it was declared ready at the end of 1668 Transporting the sculpture from Bernini's studio to Scala Regia took ten days and required guards to look after it during the night. A variety of straw, winches, planks and beams, plus sledges and oxen were needed to pull the massive sculpture. It finally arrived on 12 January 1669. Architectural and decorative work (such as the drapery) on the niche around the sculpture continued through 1669, as did polishing of the statue itself. Contemporary criticism Apart from a brief period of papal disgrace in 1640s, Bernini had enjoyed much acclaim from the population and aristocracy of Rome. All references in this section taken from Tod Marder, Bernini's Scala Regia at the Vatican Palace, 1996, 208-212 Yet the Constantine sculpture was criticised immediately after it was unveiled. A variety of published pamphlets attested to the weaknesses of sculpture - that the Cross which was inspiring Constantine's reaction was invisible to many viewers thus making the meaning of the story difficult to understand; that the sculpture seemed stuck between being a relief or a free standing sculpture;. there were also questions of the historical inaccuracy of presenting Constantine as a youthful figure with a short beard. It was also noted that Constantine was without any of the equipment of a rider, such as saddle or reins. The lack of realism in the sculpture - Bernini sacrificing representation accuracy in depicting the horse (\\"exaggerated length of the horse, the curvature of the body ... the long neck, immense tail .. the oddly shaped ears\\" ) in order to provide a greater sense of movement - was also keenly pointed out by the seventeenth-century writers. Modern criticism Perhaps because of its relative inaccessibility (unless one has special access to the Vatican, the sculpture is only visible from one viewpoint, under the portico of St Peter's), the statue of Constantine has received little art historical attention. This also may be due to the quality of received opinions about the quality of the sculpture of itself. Lavin passes over the work in his Bernini and the Unity of the Visual Arts, and Avery (in his \\"Bernini: Genius of the Baroque\\") says very little. Even Marder, the only art historian to concentrate an entire book on Constantine and the Scala Regia, admits that \\"We may never know what the equestrian statue of Constantine looked like before it was finished in situ, but one guess is that it possessed greater formal power in Bernini's mind\\". Tod Marder, Bernini's Scala Regia at the Vatican Palace, 1996, 210 Rudolf Wittkower is much more generous - \\"The monument is placed in front of an enormous wind-swept drapery, and this device enhanced the beholder‚Äôs belief in the sudden interruption of the rider‚Äôs progress and make his fascinated reclining and the reactions registered simultaneously by the animal an extraordinarily convincing experience.\\" Rudolf Wittkower, Bernini, the Sculptor of the Roman Baroque, 1955 (1st ed.), p.24 References Category:Sculptures by Gian Lorenzo Bernini Category:Sculptures in Italy Category:Cultural depictions of Constantine the Great Category:Equestrian statues ","title":"The Vision of Constantine (Bernini)"},{"id":"36622307","text":"Michael \\"Mike\\" Feduniak (June 1, 1914 - August 30, 1989) was a businessman and political figure in Saskatchewan.

It is under construction at 6121 Kirkstone Lane, Windermere, Florida, in the gated community of Lake Butler Sound in Orange County, Florida. Named and modeled after the Palace of Versailles in France, the completed project will be one of the largest single-family homes in the United States. It is designed as the primary residence of the Siegels and their children.  History  Construction began in 2004. Work stalled in 2009 with 60% completed as Siegel's company encountered financial difficulties. The house was subsequently listed for sale at $65 million. With Westgate Resorts' improved finances as of 2013, Siegel now owns the property outright and construction has resumed. Completion was scheduled for 2016, although the completion date has been pushed back to at least 2019. Expected to appraise at over $100 million, the project will be the fourth most expensive house in the United States.  Design  Versailles house in 2014 Constructed on a man-made hill on 10 acres of lakefront property, the residence will include 11 kitchens, 14 bedrooms, three indoor pools, two outdoor pools, a video arcade, a ballroom with a 500 to a 1,000 person capacity, a two-story movie theater with a balcony inspired by the Paris Opera House, a 20,000-bottle wine cellar, an exotic-fish aquarium, two tennis courts,, two lane commercial grade bowling alley, a baseball diamond, a formal outdoor garden, and an elevator in the master bedroom closet. Because the Siegels' children are older now, modifications to the original plans included turning playrooms into a yoga studio and a teenager‚Äôs cave with a second movie theater. Doors and windows are constructed using some of the last remaining, legal Brazilian mahogany at a cost of $4 million; cut before the Brazilian government banned trade in big- leaf mahogany, in 2001.

The Auburn 851 Speedster of 1935 was styled by designer Gordon Buehrig, who also was responsible for the Cord Model 810. History In 1924 Auburn output was down to six cars a day, Errett Lobban Cord‚Äîa successful automobile salesman‚Äîtook over the distressed company, and brought in James Crawford to design and develop a new range of vehicles. The first Auburn eight was launched in 1925, it was named \\"8-88‚Äú in 1926 equipped with a 4.8-liter side-valve 68 bhp Lycoming engine. That powertrain remained in use until 1930, when it developed 115 bhp, hence the \\"Speedster 115\\" model name. The car was of a straightforward and stout design. Suspension was by semi-elliptic springs all round, and after experiments with hydraulic brakes, Auburn opted for mechanical brakes. The three-speed gearbox was in unit with the engine. The impressive open two-seater body styled by Count Alexis de Sakhnoffsky featured a boat-tail and a vee windscreen. The \\"115\\" became the \\"125\\" in 1930, with a \\"cabin speedster\\" among the models, advertised as a \\"racing car with comfort of a closed car\\" with a 125 bhp version of the Lycoming eight giving it a top speed of over 100 mph. A V12 range, using a 6.4-liter engine designed by George Kublin and built by Lycoming was rather short-lived and eventually did not prove successful, 1934 marked its demise. However Auburn was to enjoy a memorable final run with the \\"851 speedster\\". This vehicle which would be the final production model of the manufacturer was introduced in 1931 with masterly bodywork by Gordon Buehrig that was ingeniously constructed and cost- effectively built. Its bespoke flat-head eight was powerful, reliable and of a strong and solid design. The sweeping body lines concealed some innovative and advanced technical features such as the Columbia dual-ratio rear axle that was achieved by interposing an epicyclic gear train between the axle and the crown wheel. When it was engaged, the final drive ratio became a \\"fast\\" 4.5:1. It was disengaged by moving a steering-wheel mounted lever and dipping the clutch, whereupon the ratio became a more leisurely 3:1. The three-speed synchromesh gearbox along with that dual ratio axle gave a six-speed transmission. In 1936 came the 852, identical to the earlier models with the exception of the \\"852\\" on its radiator grille. The final year of production was 1937 as Auburn ceased car production altogether in 1937. The Speedster's iconic \\"boattail\\" design would be replicated on cars from later decades, with the two most notable examples being the 1963‚Äì1967 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray and the 1971‚Äì1973 Buick Riviera.

Digital marketing  = Jingteng Plan = Joy & Heron - Animated promotional video by JD.com released under CC license In 2015, JD.com and Tencent announced the launch of the \\"Jingteng Plan\\" (), a portmanteau of the two companies' names, which will provide merchants with a complete solution to establish a brand and promote marketing effectiveness by linking JD.com consumption data with Tencent social data. The Jingteng Plan provides brand owners with accurate target consumer groups and diverse marketing channels, helping brand merchants achieve more effective and accurate marketing. JD.com provides online shopping and claims \\"authentic low price and quality assurance\\" and \\"customer first\\". The Jingteng Plan has made progress in three areas: Jingdong has ~170 million E-Commerce platform users, and Tencent has the largest WeChat and mobile QQ users in China. The plan integrates consumer behaviour data and social data. The Jingteng Plan integrates marketing solutions for shopping and social data. ‚ÄúThe precise orientation, closed-loop experience, user portraits, personalized creativity, unity of product and effect, and scientific measure of effectiveness‚Äù are said to be the six major aspects of the Jingteng Plan. = Partnership with Farfetch = Since the increasing mobile consumers in China, in 2017, Jingdong invested $397 million in Farfetch, which provided luxury e-commerce service based on the headquarters in London. The deal focussed on Farfetch's respect for intellectual property which has been contrasted with Alibaba's reputation. The Jingdong and Farfetch partnership aims to increase their market share in China. = Partnership with Ruyi = On 4 September 2018, JD.com signed a strategic agreement with Ruyi, a leading textile and fashion giant who owns global fashion brands including Aquascutum, CERRUTI1881, Sandro and Maje. As stated in the press release, JD would deploy its smart logistics, supply chain solutions, big data-enabled inventory management and membership systems for Ruyi's subsidiary brands. Based on this partnership, JD and Ruyi will jointly establish fashion and lifestyle concept stores in core cities, such as Shanghai and Beijing.  Price war with Dangdang  = Price war in physical books = On December 10, 2010, JD's founder Liu Qiangdong announced through his Weibo account that every book sold on JD.com would be priced at 20 percent cheaper than its competitors. Although Liu did not give a specific name of his opponent, journalists thought Dangdang was JD.com's obvious rival in the field of online book sale. Dangdang is an electronic business platform well known for its core business, selling books, and ranked first among all online B2C booksellers of 2010 in China. The price war between JD.com and Dangdang started on December 14; users of JD.com found out that the books were cheaper than from Dangdang. In response, Dangdang also began to offer discounts to customers such as 30 yuan off when they spend 199 yuan or more. On the morning of December 16, Dangdang stated that the company would invest 40 million Chinese yuan to give discounts to customers. As a result, JD.com launched the second promotion to sell books at a lower price than Dangdang that afternoon. On the same day, Liu Qiangdong posted through his Weibo account that JD.com would give coupons instead of reducing prices to protect the benefits of publishers, which marked a phase of the price war. Liu said that JD.com could not get supplies from some book publishers due to contracts between Dangdang and the publishers. From Liu's perspective, Dangdang were not allowing publishers to supply books to JD.com. However, the publishers refuted the allegation. Su Huiyan, a business consultant of iResearch pointed out that JD.com wanted to attract more customers by the price war. In November 2011, the second stage of the competition was triggered by Suning.com, a B2C shopping platform, announcing they would expand their business to include bookselling. JD.com and Dangdang competed with each other on lowering the prices of books again. JD.com provided its customers with a 10 percent discount on books while Dangdang, sent promotional messages to its users stating that they would be offered 200 yuan if they purchased books for more than 100 yuan total. Dangdang used the slogan ‚Äú‰∫âÂΩìË¥•ÂÆ∂Â≠ê‚Äù meaning 'striving to be a spendthrift' aiming to increase their website traffic. The sudden increase of orders not only caused network errors but also postponed transits of books, which fueled customers‚Äô complaints. = Price war in electronic books = On December 21, 2011, Dangdang launched its electronic book service online. More than 50,000 e-books were available on dangdang.com with over 90 percent of the e-books sold at 30 percent of the price of the physical books. JD.com started the e-book selling business online on February 20, 2012, and provided customers with more than 80,000 electronic books. JD.com also offered discounts to the buyers, this situation was the unfoldment of a new round of price war. On April 17, 2013, most of the e-books on Dangdang's website were free for users to download. Consequently, JD.com priced 50,000 electronic books at 0 yuan to match. Liu Zhenyou, an author, criticized that both of them had raised their brand awareness, but their actions caused damage to book publishers.

It was formed in 1915 as an instructors college - but expanded in 1916 into a full RFC training school. In 1917 technical skills were separated and moved to a nearby airfield, Coley Park, as the School of Technical Training. All training at the school was on the ground; ranging from theoretical subjects through to practical training (e.g. taxiing and artillery observation). History In December 1915 the RFC commandeered buildings belonging to the University of Reading, at first for the purpose of training flight instructors. On 27 October 1916 the school was expanded to include cadet pilot and observer training, and designated No 1 School of Military Aeronautics (at the same time, No 2 school was opened in Oxford). The school's headquarters were in Yeomanry House, while most of the lessons were taught at Wantage Hall (a recently built hall of residence belonging to the University). Practical classes were held in Upper Redlands Road and nearby playing fields. The school provided preliminary training for cadets and taught theoretical aspects of flight; including map reading, gunnery and mechanics. A small airfield was established at nearby Coley Park in around 1917. Technical trades were split off from the flight school, as the School of Technical Training, which operated from a jam factory adjoining the airfield. In September 1917 technical training was consolidated at Halton Camp, although Coley Park appears to have remained open for the rest of the war. Many of the instructors were veterans of the Western Front. Still young men, they often struggled to teach the cadets who were of a similar age. For the observers the school had a room mocked up for artillery observation: a light-studded map was painted onto the floor and a mock fuselage hung from the ceiling.

Life He graduated M.A. at the University of Paris in 1307, and became a master of medicine. He came under the influence of Radulphus Brito. Bartholomaeus served as physician to Guy I, Count of Blois until the count died. He was a reforming medical teacher, replacing the older curriculum based on the Articella by a new Galenism. Works Bartholomaeus wrote commentaries on Aristotle. His work on the Poetics is noted for its sympathy with mimesis as a poetical function, and so an opening towards classical drama (the original work of Aristotle not being available at the time in Western Europe, the basis was a Latin translation by Hermannus Alemannus from Averroes, the Commentaria Media). He engaged in controversy with John of Jandun on the sensus agens, an active perceptive faculty of the soul. The reply of John of Jandun has been dated to 1310. At the University of Montpellier he wrote also on the Ars Medicine. Some of the medical works that were attributed to him are considered to be by Bartholomew of Salerno instead. In 1348, at the time of the Black Death, he wrote on the plague.

Haughton was a veteran public health administrator, serving in numerous capacities across the country, most recently as medical director for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services from which he retired in 2004 at age 78. Haughton began his life in the United States as an immigrant student from Panama at Pacific Union College in the Napa Valley from which he graduated in 1948. He attended medical school at The Loma Linda University School of Medicine, where he was the only black student in his class, graduating in 1950. He later earned a masters in public health from Columbia University's School of Public Health. Completing medical school, Haughton had difficulty finding internships due to widespread discrimination against blacks. \\"I began to realize that the color of my skin, which had never been a problem for me in Panama ... was a problem for me,\\" he is quoted saying in the Los Angeles Times. In 1951, he was accepted as an intern at Unity Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. The Times reports that \\"he saw that poor people, who were often black, were more frequently used as 'teaching material' for interns and residents\\" while he trained at Unity as an obstetrician and gynecologist. After medical school, Haughton initially entered private practice in obstetrics and later became a medical administrative officer for the United States Navy. His career in public health began in New York City in 1965. In 1967, President Richard Nixon appointed Haughton to Department of Health, Education and Welfare task force overseeing Medicaid. Following his time at New York, Haughton became executive director of the Health and Hospital Governing Commission in Chicago, Illinois in 1971. In this position, he was the highest-paid public official in Illinois with compensation of $60,000 a year. In 1980, Haughton moved to Los Angeles to run operations at the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School. He left Los Angeles in 1983 to head the health department in Houston, Texas but returned to Los Angeles in 1987 to become chief of staff for the King/Drew Medical Center. He became health policy advisor to the Los Angeles County Health Department in 1993 and its medical director in 1996, holding that position until his retirement in 2004.

He is also a noted entrepreneur in the global health and fitness sector. He has been described as ‚Äú‚Ä¶London‚Äôs most networked man‚Äù by The Times and other newspapers. He has co-founded or served on the board of several large businesses, including Fitness First, 24 Hour Fitness, Zumba and GlobalFit. He is a trustee of Speakers4Schools and a board member of UK technology firm Smartmatic. In 2007 the Daily Telegraph listed him as one of the most influential Americans living in the UK. GQ Magazine placed him 6th on its list of the 100 Most Connected Men in Britain 2015. In 2016 he was made a member of The Maserati 100, a list of successful philanthropists and investors who work in support of new business talent, compiled by Maserati and The Centre for Entrepreneurs. Early life and career Born in Miami, Florida, Giampaolo spent his childhood in the city of Hollywood, FL. His father held several jobs simultaneously, including journalist, jazz musician and racetrack announcer. Giampaolo attended Cooper City High School, dropping out at age 16. He credits his decision to become an entrepreneur to his Italian immigrant family‚Äôs work ethic, particularly that of his father. Aged 15 Giampaolo started a lawn-cutting business in his local neighbourhood, a business which grew to employing two of his friends. He then took up weight training, becoming an instructor at his local gym. At 17, he sold his lawn- cutting business for $3,000, a sum which he used to set up a small gym aimed at fitness enthusiasts. His clients there included a trio of wealthy doctors whose medical practice was nearby. In an interview with Moneyweek, Giampaolo recounted: \\"One doctor said: \\"This place is a dump, it‚Äôs so hot. Why don‚Äôt you move to bigger premises?\\" And I said, flippantly, \\"Give me the money and I‚Äôll do it\\". And he said ‚Äòyou‚Äôre on‚Äô.‚Äù Over the next two years the trio backed Giampaolo in opening up two health clubs, investing $50,000 to capitalise on the then-new trend for Nautilus fitness machines. Fitness clubs In 1984, having sold his first three gyms, Giampaolo joined health club chain Chicago Health Clubs, then-owned by Bally Fitness. In 1987 Bally selected Giampaolo to set up and lead its business in the UK, beginning with The Barbican Health and Fitness Centre. In 1988 Giampaolo wrote to Diana, Princess of Wales with an invitation to perform the Barbican club's opening ceremony. She agreed, and the resulting press coverage helped to establish Barbican as Britain's first upmarket health venue. Giampaolo left Barbican Health and Fitness in 1989 and raised ¬£3m to found Espree Leisure, which subsequently developed two health clubs in London. In 1991 Giampaolo set up Forza, a European exercise equipment distributor for several fitness brands, including Reebok and Cybex. In 1998 he and Mark Mastrov co-founded Fitness Holdings Europe, a private-equity-backed investment vehicle, to open and acquire small chains of European health clubs. Fitness Holdings Europe was merged into the 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide, Inc. in 2000. Giampaolo left 24-Hour Fitness in 2001 to begin work on a management buy-in of investor club Pi Capital, which completed in 2002. Pi Capital Giampaolo is a major shareholder and chief executive of Pi Capital. Pi‚Äôs membership includes entrepreneurs and chairman/CEOs from the business community in the UK and from around the globe. Andrew Davidson, writing in The Sunday Times, describes Pi's membership as \\"... drawn from the business elite of Britain, [pooling] money and know-how to back fledgling firms.\\" Giampaolo and a team of in-house advisors filter investments before circulating them among members. Giampaolo claims 300 members for Pi. He and his partners co- invest on the same terms and on a peer-opt-in basis. Pi also invests in funds that are closed or invite-only, or have financial entry requirements beyond those of individual Pi members. Pi has co-invested with Apax, BC Partners, Cinven and Alchemy Partners. In 2013 Pi Capital's investment in Thomsons Online Benefits was replaced by ABRY Partners in a deal which valued Thomsons at around ¬£100m.Money Marketing January 2013 Giampaolo is reported as saying that wealthy investors are ‚Äú‚Ä¶sceptical of relying on third parties to invest their capital. They don‚Äôt want to be shown a product which a bank has created, and to which large fees are usually attached whether the investment does well or not.\\" He describes Pi as a ‚Äú...conservative investor‚Äù. The Independent reported in 2007 that Pi members have invested over ¬£150m since Giampaolo‚Äôs buy-out. Under Giampaolo the club has refocused to become more like a salon, arranging monthly events with speakers on intellectual as well as financial topics. Previous speakers include Bill Clinton, Kofi Annan, Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, Gillian Tett, Michael Lewis, Garry Kasparov and Dominic Barton, global MD of McKinsey. Giampaolo commented to the Financial Times in September 2012: ‚ÄúIntellectual capital is the focus.‚Äù The article drew parallels between Pi Capital‚Äôs events and those of non-financial salons in London, such the 14-10 club, Intelligence Squared and the 5x15 talk series. Pi Club has also begun participating in philanthropic initiatives under Giampaolo's leadership. Business philosophy The Financial Times quotes Giampaolo as believing that entrepreneurs should not hide behind a persona of success, but embrace their failures instead: \\"The best entrepreneurs talk about failure with pride and guts.\\" Giampaolo has invested in a personal capacity into various startups, including www.OneDome.com, a UK-based property technology firm. Current appointments Giampaolo is currently on the Board of Directors of Zumba Fitness and election technology group SGO, the parent company to Smartmatic. SGO is chaired by Mark, Lord Malloch Brown.

Life  Allen completed his military service, and after gaining farm experience at a farm near Prendwick (11 miles west of Alnwick), Northumberland, moved in 1950 to Redesmouth Farm, Redesmouth, near Bellingham, which was owned by his father Colonel Allen of Haydon Bridge. When he retired, he and his wife Angela, moved into a new house named \\"The Glebe\\" in Bellingham. Robert had always had an interest in his local dialect, which he called \\"Big hoose terk\\", the gentle and polite dialect used when talking to the vicar, rather than the more common and normal \\"village talk\\" and also in poetry, and his retirement allowed him the time to put the two together and write down the results.

Introduced in 2008, its main projected use is alongside measures of bone density in better predicting fracture risk in people with metabolic bone problems.  Need for a marker of microarchitecture  Microarchitecture of bone in health and in osteoporosis. To diagnose osteoporosis, despite the inclusion of bone mineral density (BMD), biological markers and clinical factors of fracture risk, many not detected patients are at risk and many fractures are not explained. Bone mineral density is an assessment of the quantity of bone. It does not provide information on bone quality, another important parameter to describe the bone. In addition, clinical risk factors for fracture are at best an indirect assessment of the bone quality. One way to describe the quality of the bone is to assess its microarchitecture. Bone microarchitecture is related to the mechanical strength of bone and hence its greater or lesser risk of fracture. Indeed, for the same quantity of bone, different mechanically resistant bone structures may exist (few large trabeculae or numerous thin trabeculae that are mechanically stronger). Actually, bone loss is often accompanied by a deterioration of bone architecture, resulted in a decreased number of trabeculae, increased inter-trabecular distances, and a loss connectivity of the trabecular meshwork. Moreover, reduction of cortical bone thickness and increased porosity accompany trabecular bone loss, and in particular promote the fragility of the femoral neck. Osteoporotic bone is called \\"porous\\".  Technical  Relative Risk of TBS expressed by standard deviation and compared with relative risks of major clinical risk factors for fracture The trabecular bone score is a textural parameter that can be applied to DEXA, which quantifies the local variations in gray level. TBS is derived from the evaluation of the experimental variogram, obtained from the grayscale DEXA. It was found that TBS is a reflection of the structural condition of the bone microarchitecture. TBS is strongly correlated with the number of trabeculae and their connectivity and negatively with the space between trabeculae. That is to say that a high TBS value means that microarchitecture bone is dense, well connected with little spaces between trabeculaes. Conversely, a low TBS value means that the microarchitecture of bone is incomplete and poorly connected with wide spaces between trabeculae. Clinical use From a clinical standpoint, TBS provides: * assessment the risk of fracture; * in combination with BMD, increase the number of patients at risk (correctly) identified; * improvement the management of patients with secondary osteoporosis; * follow-up of the evolution of microarchitecture of a patient over time; * monitoring of the effect of anti-resorptive or anabolic. All these studies have shown that TBS can be used as a clinical risk factor for osteoporotic fracture since it is reversible (with or without treatment), quantitative and independent of BMD. It should therefore be used as such in the same way that taking corticosteroids, rheumatoid arthritis or prevalent fracture after age 50.

It is an intelligent systemwide search engine, knowledge management- and analytics platform. The fifth generation focusses on Enterprise Search - Next Generation, Big Content Analytics, Knowledge Capturing and Social Intranet. It is developed by interface projects GmbH, a subsidiary of the interface business group with its head office in Dresden, Sachsen.  Development  In 2003 the first version of intergator was introduced into the IT market. The key functions were built on the program \`TextDog\`, which had been developed by Kristian Hermsdorf in the context of his diploma thesis in 2000. He wrote his thesis about the automated classification of documents with neural networks. The thesis became the starting point for the Enterprise Search Solution ‚Äúintergator‚Äù. The software was developed for the quick location of relevant information within an enterprise network (Enterprise Search). With the help of connectors, the system enables a comprehensive indexing of more than 550 file formats. The basic technology of intergator is Lucene and the programming language is Java. Responsible for the high scalability of the software are integrated modules like the Documentation Reader. intergator runs after installation on every Internet browser. A high degree of individualization is achieved with the freely adaptable Social Dashboard.  Features  = Social Dashboard = The intergator Social Dashboard is an individual unique tailor-made interface capturing all source of information needed. No need to always start a new search. Search queries are automatically saved. intergator retrieves proactively and permanently new information related to search queries. Fundament of the intergator Social Dashboard is a search throughout various systems. Results of preconfigurable search requests will be shown in free placeable apps on the dashboard. = Context-Dependent Search Suggestion = Suggestions coming up by relations are known since internet search engines have been used. These suggestions encourage more complex queries, which are not always of relevance. Data based applications offer support for filling forms and search fields, prepared by an exact list of waked feeds. Suggestions made by intergator are generated by an adapted combination of both methods. = Documentation Reader = Locate text within large documents quickly with visual highlighting, straight from the browser and without additional plug-in installations. = Analytics = Analytics offers extensive analysis and statistical functions about search behavior and document access. Data quality can be improved by detecting duplicates. = Thumbnail previews and knowledge network = The usability and flexibility in displaying search results and hit details is supported by dynamically rendered templates. So it is possible to show various attributes, like metadata of search results as well as links to continuative information to similar or connected documents. = Facets = Facets have become standard in modern enterprise search solutions. Their main use can be seen in filtering search results by considering the peculiarity of values of important hit attributes. Facets can be defined at every moment and are available without reindexing while business goes on. In many cases the user will not find documents, but the specification of particular meta data is the answer on a query. Therefore, facets are presented as results and not real search results. = OCR-Service = OCR is a text recognition module. Text is acquired from scanned documents or images in PDF files ‚Äì essential for full‚Äìtext search and automatic metadata extraction. = Navigator = The Navigator is an alternative to a standard search interface. Search results are visualized with a hypertree and a tabular view, which is particularly suitable for exploratory search. = Mobile Search = For mobile accessing of all enterprise information (list of employees, business contacts, documentations etc.) a special web interface is available. = Connectors = Connectors are the connection between intergator and the data sources. All connectors are in- house developments of interface projects GmbH. Standard connectors are free of charge. = Management Center = The Management Center is responsible for administration and monitoring the intergator server status. = Additional Features = * Combination between favorites and tags leads to individualization within the application * Facets serves as restriction for search terms and can be redefined every time * Dynamic grouping of search results leads to prioritization of parts of the result * Recognizing scanned text (OCR) for opening additional content and generation of metadata with help of text-identification service = Fields of application = * Enterprise Search * Social Intranet Solution * Knowledge Management * Content analysis of structured and unstructured data * Search Based Applications (e.g. Business Applications/Business Intelligence) * Website search * IT driven Knowledge Management for ISO 9001:2015 * Digital Workplace  Strategic Partnerships  * Since 2008 PPS Pre Press System GmbH from Oberusel/Taunes integrated intergator since 2008 as intelligent search in the digitalized achieves. * Since July 2011, the company cooperates with aexea GmbH from Stuttgart to collect knowledge together.

Contrary to the first report published in entertainment news website, PEP (Philippine Entertainment Portal), the series is not based from Lana's 2012 Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival entry, Bwakaw. Lana clarifies that the series is actually inspired from San Roque and his canine's moving story. San Roque, also known as Saint Roch or Saint Rocco, is the saint usually depicted in statue form in Catholic churches as the one with a walking stick on the left hand, while the other hand is pointing on to a wound on one of his knees with a dog sitting by his side. The Catholic Church named him patron of dogs, plague, pestilence and AIDS. He is also the patron saint of invalids. In the series, San Roque brought his dog come to life to save and be a guide to Fatima, the blessed child who prophesied to be the one who will end the existence of evil entities on earth. Using a saint as part of a drama series is actually not new for the network, as they already used the same formula/format [miracle, apparition] in their previous TV series like in 2007 television adaptation of the film, Mga Mata ni Anghelita (lit. Angelita‚Äôs Eyes) and in 2010 fantasy-dramedy series Magic Palayok (lit. The Magic Clay Pot). The series also highlights Pinoy mythology by putting aswang, manananggal, tikbalang, bruha and sirena as part [villains] of the story. Series' director, Don Michael Perez stated that, the network is aiming to enrich Filipinos [especially the young ones] knowledge of the country's rich culture, beliefs and mythology by using this kind of concept, just like what the network did in their past television series, in the likes of Darna, Dyesebel, Joaquin Bordado and Luna Mystika. In the story, the aswangs are divided into four classes: Aswang ng Hangin, most commonly known as the manananggals or the winged-vampires. It headed by the dreadful Kanlaon which played by Gardo Versoza; the Aswang ng Lupa or the land-based evil entities, who ruled by Sento, played by Paolo Contis, the heartless half-human, half- horse creature popularly known as the tikbalang; Aswang ng Tubig or the sea- based evil creatures. It headed by Queen Anaira, an evil mermaid which portrayed by Gwen Zamora; and the Aswang ng Apoy or the fire-powered witches ruled by Bulan, played by Angelika dela Cruz. =Casting= The cast was first presented during the series' story conference held on August 2, 2012 at GMA Network Center. Mona Louise Rey was chosen to play the role of Fatima, the protagonist. Rey, who rose in stardom after the successful drama series Munting Heredera, felt overwhelmed with the network's support for her career and at the same time, excited for the role assigned on her. Meanwhile, Princess, a two-year-old half Golden Retriever and half Cocker Spaniel, was chosen to be part of the series as Anghel, San Roque's dog who defend and guide the main character through her adventures. Don Michael Perez said, \\"Princess, is definitely born to be a star,\\" he says. The dog's trainer Ergie Estrella said that he did not encounter difficulty in training the star dog, saying that all it takes is positive reinforcement. TJ Trinidad and LJ Reyes shared equally important roles in the series. Reyes considered this series as her biggest break ever. After being typecast in villain characters [she's associated in her villainous roles in Time of My Life and The Good Daughter, the network assigned her to play one of the main characters in the series, as birthmother of Mona Louise Rey's character. In one of her interviews, Reyes said that it's her first time to play a mother role on TV but she doesn‚Äôt mind doing it as long as the story is good and the character, as well. Meanwhile, Trinidad is all praise for his screen partner, said that Reyes is nice and very committed. \\"And I think, it‚Äôs gonna be a good partnership for the show and, you know, with the whole cast, story, and the script, it‚Äôs so exciting. Very fast-paced\\", he added. The dark forces or the main antagonists of the story are portrayed by Angelika dela Cruz, Gardo Versoza, Gwen Zamora and Paolo Contis. Dela Cruz was cast as Bulan, an evil witch and the leader of the syndicate; Versoza playing Kanlaon, the king of the manananggals; Zamora playing the role of Anaira, an evil mermaid; while Contis playing the role of Sento, the leader of the tikbalangs. Rafael Rosell had a guest role in the series. He played Anton, the man who saved LJ Reyes' character from the wrath of manananggals. This served as his first project in GMA Network. Pen Medina was cast as mother Ben, an elderly gay and the adoptive parent to the lead character. Originally, the role was offered to Eddie Garcia but due to health concern, Garcia later requested the producers to give him less time-demanding character. He portrayed the role of Supremo, instead.

The tribes were moved onto unsuitable reservations after signing the Treaty of OlympiaTreaty of Olympia, . with the United States in 1855. In 1873 a reservation of was established by Executive Order along the Washington coastline, with most of the reservation being heavily wooded.Sisk, Gregory C. (2003), Yesterday and Today: of Indians, Breach of Trust, Money, and Sovereign Immunity, 39 Tulsa L. R. 313, Univ. of Tulsa. In 1905, the federal government began transferring or allotting land to individual tribal members under the Indian General Allotment ActIndian General Allotment Act, , as amended, , et seq. and the Quinault Allotment Act.Quinault Allotment Act, . By 1935 the entire reservation had been broken up into parcels. The timber resources on the allotted land was managed by the Department of the Interior and the Secretary of the Interior has statutory authority over the sale of timber from allotted trust lands. The Secretary has issued comprehensive regulations on the management of Indian timber resources.. =Prior court decisions= In 1971, 1,465 individuals who owned allotments filed a lawsuit in the Court of Claims alleging that the United States had mismanaged the timber resources on the reservation. Mitchell and the other plaintiffs alleged that the government had breached their fiduciary duty by failing to obtain proper value for timber sold, by failing to properly manage timber resources, and by excessive charges for administrative duties. After discovery had been conducted and a partial trial held in 1977, the government moved to dismiss the suit on jurisdictional grounds. The Court of Claims denied the motion, basing their jurisdiction to hear the case under the Indian General Allotment Act. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.Newton, Nell Jessup (1992) Indian Claims in the Courts of the Conqueror, 41 Am. Univ. L. R. 753, American Univ. The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Claims, holding that the Indian General Allotment Act did not create a trust relationship and that any grounds for recovery must be based on other grounds. The case then returned to the Court of Claims to consider the plaintiff's other claims, and the United States again moved for dismissal. The Court of Claims rejected the motion to dismiss, holding that three other federal laws gave the plaintiffs a cause of action. These three laws dealt with timber sales,. regulations and sustained yield,. and rights- of-way. and . The United States again appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case. Opinion of the Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, author of the majority opinion =Arguments= Joshua I. Schwartz argued the case for the United States. Charles A. Hobbs argued the case for the tribal members. The Shoshone tribe of the Wind River Indian Reservation filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the tribal members. The United States argued that the Court of Claims did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. =Majority opinion= Justice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of the court. Marshall noted that both the Tucker ActTucker Act, . and the Indian Tucker ActIndian Tucker Act, . waived the sovereign immunity of the United States and allowed the plaintiffs to bring a case to the Court of Claims. Marshall then examined the history of the three statutes that the Court of Claims held created a trust relationship with the plaintiffs. He concluded that the plain language of the statutes created a trust relationship between the United States government and the plaintiffs. Marshall noted that it is well established that a trustee is liable for damages in cases of a breach of fiduciary duties. He stated that it \\"naturally follows that the Government should be liable in damages for the breach of its fiduciary duties.\\" The decision of the Court of Claims was affirmed.Allen, Mark (1989), Native American Control of Tribal Natural Resource Development in the Context of the Federal Trust and Tribal Self-Determination, 16 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 857, Boston College. =Dissenting opinion= Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. dissented from the majority opinion. Powell stated that without explicit language establishing liability on the government, there can be no valid claim or subject matter jurisdiction. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims. Subsequent developments Mitchell was the first case where the Supreme Court ruled that the United States government could be liable for monetary damages for a trust relationship.Berkey, Curtis G. (2006), Rethinking the Role of Federal Trust Responsibility in Protecting Indian Land and Resources, 83 Denver L. R. 1, Denver Univ. As a result, Mitchell has been cited over 1,900 times by courts as of August, 2012. Since the fiduciary duty has been established, tribes have been using it to ensure that the Secretary of the Interior takes their needs into consideration, especially in the area of mineral and timber resources.

History The National Committee for the Hands off Russia Movement was elected at a conference in London in January 1919. Socialists like William Paul, W. P.

It holds the national reference collection (nl) in these areas. The permanent exhibition of the Amsterdam Pipe Museum displays over 2,000 items representing the variety of smoking pipes and utensils that have been used in all parts of the world over the past 25 centuries. History The Amsterdam Pipe Museum (Pijpenkabinet) was founded as a private collection in 1969. From 1975 to 1982 the collection was on display in an art gallery at Frederiksplein, Amsterdam. The focus was mainly on clay tobacco pipes for which Holland has been famous. In 1982 the Pijpenkabinet moved to Leiden, where it functioned as a public museum until 1995. The collection was enlarged with historic and ethnographic items. The museum actively published its scientific historic research. In 1995 the Pijpenkabinet moved to its present location in Amsterdam. It can be found in a typical Amsterdam canal house along the Prinsengracht, between the Leidseplein and the National Museum (the Rijksmuseum). The museum now shows all sorts of pipes, including works-of-art like the carved meerschaum pipes and hand-painted porcelain pipe bowls. When the Niemeyer tobacco museum in Groningen shut down in 2011, the Amsterdam Pipe Museum acquired some four hundred items from its collection before the rest was auctioned off, stating that its acquisition preserved the \\"core\\" of the former museum's collection. Collection Interior of the Amsterdam Pipe Museum, main room The collection of the Amsterdam Pipe Museum has been growing since the day of its establishment due to a policy of regular acquisitions. It now counts for more than 25,000 items, which are systematically arranged and stored in the museum's storage room. It includes artifacts of the cultural history of smoking from nearly all continents. A representative selection is displayed in tailor-made cabinets. The collection itself is the worldwide archive for pipes and serves as source of information for multiple scientific papers and publications. In 1993 it was awarded with the A-status within National Collections by the Ministry of Culture and Science of the Netherlands. This qualifies the Amsterdam Pipe Museum as the National Museum for the tobacco pipe and the smoking culture. The Amsterdam Pipe Museum‚Äôs collection can be described with the following categories: * pre-Columbian era: pipes dating back to the prehistoric times of smoking over 2500 years ago * archaeological: mostly clay pipes discovered during archaeological excavations in the Netherlands as well as in other parts of Europe * clay pipes: historical smoking pipes from the 19th and 20th centuries, including complete surveys of several manufacturers * porcelain pipes: artistically modeled and skillfully painted pipe bowls in European porcelain * meerschaum pipes: tobacco pipes and cigar holders with characteristic shapes and highly artistic carving * wooden pipes: early specimen from various types of wood as well as a survey of the popular briar pipe * other smoking pipes: smoking implements made of ivory, bone, stone, glass, metal, hard rubber etc. * ethnographic: indigenous pipes from Africa, Asia and America, including water pipes * opium pipes: original Chinese examples and counterparts from other countries, including opium paraphernalia * pipe makers tools: the technical aspect of the craft, including a large set of moulds for making clay pipes * tobacco curiosities: objects related to pipe smoking, such as tobacco boxes, pipe stands, etc. * prints and drawings: illustrations of smokers from all periods * records: original documents, manuscripts, ordinances and pamphlets on pipes and pipe production, tobacco trade, etc. * tobacco wrappers and vignettes: historic and modern wrappers and packages for pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarettes * library: international library with thousands of books and articles on pipes and smoking related issues { Carved meerschaum pipe, made in United States, 1890 An early wooden Congo pipe by the Mondombe tribe Figural porcelain pipe, Ludwigsburg, Germany, mid-18th century } Building Interior of the Amsterdam Pipe Museum, cabinet of curiosities The Amsterdam Pipe Museum is located in a historic building in the centre of Amsterdam. It is a typical Amsterdam canal house at Prinsengracht built around 1680. It was renovated around 1800: the windows were enlarged and the gable top was changed into a cornice, leaving the dark stone steps and the fan-light above the front door authentic. The interior still witness the history of three centuries, with its carefully restored stucco corridor with marble paneling, authentic beam ceilings with carved decorations, the use of original colors etc. The basement entrance leads to the museum shop Smokiana pipeshop. The various floors of the building hold the library and documentation centre. Research and publications The Amsterdam Pipe Museum holds a great deal of expertise on this specialized field of pipes and the culture of smoking. Historical research is an ongoing activity. All this knowledge is spread through publications in international magazines, issued as books or ready available on the website. The museum has issued books on the archeology of the clay tobacco pipes and its marks. More recently the 19th-century development of the clay pipe industry in Europe was published in a lavishly illustrated book: Century of Change: The European Clay Pipe, Its Final Flourish and Ultimate Fall. This includes the French fashion of the portrait pipes and its influence on other production centers. The curator of the museum also studied the history of the opium smoking, resulting in a book on opium and opium pipes with a full international bibliography on the subject. Many publications can be found searching the name of the curator: Don Duco. Services Interior of the museum shop of the Amsterdam Pipe Museum The museum staff is able to provide information and to identify pipes from archaeological excavations or kept as an antiquity.

Biography Born in May 1927, Charles Maxwell Hazelton, from a young age, aimed at becoming a pilot. He joined the Air Training Corps at the age of 16 but, when the Second World War ended in 1945, he saw his pilot career under threat since the Royal Australian Air Force already had too many pilots, seemingly leaving him without a future in the industry.Max Hazelton Australian Broadcasting Corporation ‚Äì Rural Legends, author: Bruce Reynolds, accessed: 5 August 2012 Working as an apprentice automotive engineer in Sydney, he continued his interest in becoming a pilot, eventually acquiring a private and, later, a commercial pilot's license.

In 1959 he moved operations to Cudal, where he operated his own airfield. Not afraid of controversy, he piloted the South African rugby union team during their tour in Australia and broke a union ban on Merino ram exports to Fiji in 1971 by flying them there. By 1968 his airline, Hazelton Airlines, operated 22 aircraft. By 1994, when he floated his company on the stock market, Hazelton Airlines carried 330,000 passengers a year.

It began broadcast on 14 January 2013. Mark Williams stars as the eponymous crime-solving Roman Catholic priest. The series is loosely based on short stories by G. K. Chesterton. Apart from soap operas, it is the third-longest-running daytime drama series on BBC TV, after Doctors and Moving On. The ninth series has been commissioned for broadcast in 2021. Plot The series is set during the mid-1950s, in the fictional Cotswold village of Kembleford, where Father Brown, priest at St Mary's Catholic Church, solves murder cases. A bumbling police inspector, who often arrests the wrong suspect, gets annoyed by Father Brown's success. Father Brown uses the distinctive skills of his close friends as well as his own wits to solve cases, occasionally to the neglect of his more mundane parish duties. His vocation as a priest often gives him an insight to the truth, so that justice (but sometimes, not the letter of the law) may be served. His commitment to obeying the Seal of the Confessional often presents unique circumstances. The time period is when Britain was still struggling with deprivations and other hardships in the aftermath of the Second World War. At that time the country still applied the death penalty as a sentence for capital crimes such as murder. Father Brown opposes capital punishment. Characters * Father Brown ‚Äì Mark Williams (2013‚Äìpresent): a slightly crumpled, shambolic and mild-mannered Roman Catholic priest who, by appearance, is easily forgotten. His apparent innocence belies a playful wit and a razor-sharp intellect. His greatest strength, both as a priest and as a detective of crime, is his love and understanding of other people. He's not there to judge, but to save souls. He is also a World War I veteran who served in the Gloucestershire Regiment. * Mrs Bridgette McCarthy n√©e Maguire ‚Äì Sorcha Cusack (2013‚Äìpresent): the Irish parish secretary at St Mary's. She checks the facts for Father Brown, acts as his confidante on official Church business and everything else, defends him from the ire of the congregation, and makes sure he eats. She has a tendency to brag about her award-winning strawberry scones. Mrs McCarthy is a frequent gossip ‚Äì though claims she is not ‚Äì and often at odds with Lady Felicia, although she and Lady Felicia eventually admit to being close friends. She is married, but leaves her husband after he returns from having lived with another woman following the war. * Felicia, Lady Montague n√©e Windermere ‚Äì Nancy Carroll (2013‚Äì2016 as a lead character): a bored socialite and Countess, apparently from an old recusant family, with a roving eye when her husband, Monty, is away. She is a staunch supporter of Father Brown and frequent nemesis of Mrs McCarthy, despite a grudging respect between the women. She left at the start of Series 5 after her husband was appointed Governor of Northern Rhodesia, but made a guest appearance in Series 6, The Face of the Enemy, in Series 7 in two episodes (The Great Train Robbery and The Honourable Thief), and in Series 8, The Celestial Choir. * Sidney \\"Sid\\" Carter ‚Äì Alex Price (2013‚Äì2016 as a lead character): An artful dodger, Sid is an occasional black marketeer, part-time crook and informant who becomes Lady Felicia's chauffeur. Father Brown makes him the church handyman while trying to keep him on the straight and narrow. His skills and links to the criminal underworld of Kembleford are often needed to solve a case. Originally a regular character, but made guest appearances in Series 5, The Sins of Others, 2016 Christmas Special, The Tree of Truth, Series 6, The Face of the Enemy and Series 8, The River Corrupted. * Zuzanna \\"Susie\\" Jasinski ‚Äì Kasia Koleczek (2013): Father Brown's part-time housekeeper, who lives in a nearby post-war Polish resettlement camp. Her true first name was revealed in the episode The Eye of Apollo. * Lady Penelope \\"Bunty\\" Windermere ‚Äì Emer Kenny (2017‚Äìpresent): the wayward niece of Lady Felicia seeking refuge after being photographed leaving a sleazy nightclub with a married man and cited in divorce proceedings. * Inspector Valentine ‚Äì Hugo Speer (2013‚Äì2014): head of the local police force, finds himself constantly torn between secret admiration for Father Brown and deep frustration with him. He would like to collaborate, but has been burnt once too often by Brown's unorthodox moral code. Nevertheless, he comes to respect his methods and even admits, upon his departure, that he might miss Father Brown. Valentine returns in the final episode of Series 8, The Tower of Lost Souls * Inspector Sullivan ‚Äì Tom Chambers (2014‚Äì2015): replaced Inspector Valentine, who was promoted to Detective Chief Inspector and went to London at the start of the second series. A somewhat arrogant, complacent man, Sullivan is even more exasperated by Father Brown's meddling but is eventually won over. He made a guest appearance as a Special Branch officer in Series 7, The Sacrifice of Tantalus under the alias of Inspector Truman. He also appears in the final episode of Series 8, The Tower of Lost Souls * Inspector Gerry Mallory ‚Äì Jack Deam (2016‚Äìpresent): the replacement for Inspector Sullivan. Like his predecessors, he is often exasperated by Father Brown, whom he sarcastically refers to as \\"Padre\\". However, he is a far more zealous (and occasionally resourceful) detective, and chases after leads with great enthusiasm, even when they lead him to the wrong conclusion. * Sergeant Albright ‚Äì Keith Osborn (2013‚Äì2014): played dogsbody to Inspectors Valentine and Sullivan. * Sergeant Daniel Goodfellow ‚Äì John Burton (2014‚Äìpresent): continued playing the dogsbody for the Inspector with increasing involvement. Credited in the opening beginning in series 5. * M. Hercule Flambeau ‚Äì John Light (2013‚Äìpresent): nemesis of Father Brown; jewel and art thief, seems to be without conscience. He and Father Brown have encountered each other at least once in every series; in series four he reveals he has a daughter, Marianne Delacroix, whom he had never met. =Recurring roles= * Bishop Talbot ‚Äì Malcolm Storry (2013‚Äì2015): he appeared in three episodes. Talbot is Father Brown's superior and doesn't like his sleuthing, but respects him for solving the mysteries. In The Daughter of Autolycus, his death was mentioned. He is succeeded by Bishop Reynard (Michael Pennington). * Harold \\"Blind 'Arry\\" Slow ‚Äì Alan Williams (2017‚Äìpresent): he appeared in four episodes. 'Arry is the rag and bone man for Kembleford and also a drunk. In The Darkest Noon he mentioned that he got the name \\"Blind 'Arry\\" after being gassed in World War I and he also mentions he was a Sapper. * Professor Hilary Ambrose ‚Äì James Laurenson (2014‚Äìpresent): he has appeared in two episodes. Ambrose is a theological scholar and friend of Father Brown. * Canon Damien Fox ‚Äì Roger May (2016‚Äìpresent): he appeared in two episodes. Fox is part of the Diocese and reports to Bishop Reynard. * Katherine Corven ‚Äì Kate O'Flynn (2017‚Äì2018): she appeared in two episodes. In The Eagle and the Daw, she was in prison for murdering her husband. Father Brown had helped to convict her and was awaiting her execution. In The Jackdaw's Revenge, she was cleared of the murder of her husband when someone else confessed to the murder; later in the episode she died from a gunshot. * Daniel Whittaker ‚Äì Daniel Flynn (2015‚Äìpresent): he appeared in two episodes. Whittaker is a ruthless MI5 agent who blackmails Lady Felicia. In The Man in the Shadows, he had Sid arrested on false charges after he entered a MI5 room. In The Face of the Enemy, he compelled Lady Felicia to steal (by substitution) a roll of film from one of her lovers, an alleged Soviet spy, and had her arrested on false charges. Father Brown persuaded him to let her go. * Marianne Delacroix - Gina Bramhill (2016‚Äìpresent). Flambeau's daughter equally adept at theft. Two episodes.

Oliver Ford Davies is the only actor to star in both the 1974 series and this series. Production The series is a BBC Studios Birmingham Drama Village production and filming for the first series of ten episodes of Father Brown began in the Cotswolds in summer 2012. The BBC renewed Father Brown for a second series of ten episodes in 2013. A third series of 15 episodes was commissioned in 2014. A fourth series of ten episodes was commissioned in 2015. Actor John Burton, who plays Sgt. Goodfellow, confirmed an eighth series on his Twitter account in April 2019. In 2014 Father Brown was shown on various public television stations in the United States and on the satellite \\"Film&Arts;\\" channel in South America. In some countries, Netflix was airing the programme in later years; by 2018, five series were available. =Conception= BBC Daytime wanted a home-grown detective show for the afternoons on BBC One. Initially, original ideas from writers were pitched, but the BBC wanted something that was less of a risk and was already well known. Father Brown had not been filmed for British television since the 1970s with Kenneth More. Executive Producer John Yorke came up with the idea after hearing a radio documentary about G. K. Chesterton presented by Ann Widdecombe. Writers were given the choice of adapting an existing story or coming up with an original idea. Half of the first ten episodes made were loosely based on Chesterton stories. The Chesterton stories were set all over the world and at different times, but a decision was made to anchor the stories in a fixed place and time. The Cotswolds was chosen because it had few modern buildings and was close to the production base in Birmingham. The 1950s was chosen because the detective could solve puzzles using his mind and knowledge of human nature instead of relying on modern technology. Despite this, the script sometimes includes anachronistic language (e.g., \\"secure the crime scene\\", \\"mojo\\"). The lead writers, Rachel Flowerday and Tahsin Guner, created the supporting characters. Other writers contributed stand-alone scripts that were not part of a story arc. Significant changes were made in some of the episodes ostensibly based on the original works, including The Hammer of God, The Wrong Shape, and The Eye of Apollo. =Filming= Church of St Peter and St Paul, Blockley Filming takes place in the Gloucestershire village of Blockley using the Church of St Peter and St Paul, Blockley (Church of England) as the St Mary Roman Catholic church of the series and the vicarage transformed into the presbytery for Father Brown's residence. Other villages used are Winchcombe, Upper Slaughter, Kemerton and Guiting Power. Filming also took place at Winchcombe railway station and Toddington railway station on the heritage Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway. Sudeley Castle was the main location for The Eye of Apollo. Princethorpe College, once a Catholic convent, now a secondary school, was used to film \\"St Agnes Convent\\" in Series One Episode 6. Filming for the second series included the Warwickshire village of Ilmington. Chastleton House and Berkeley Castle were used to portray Pryde Castle in the episode broadcast on 8 January 2014.Cotswold Homes Autumn Edition 2013. Retrieved 4 May 2017. Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire provided the location for the final resting place of the famed rosary in the episode Mysteries of the Rosary airing 10 January 2014. The gardens at Snowshill Manor featured in the same episode. The Time Machine episode, in series 3, was based around the Warwickshire estate of Alscot Park. Filming has also taken place at Ashdown WW2 Camp, Evesham, Worcestershire where the TV series the Land Girls was also filmed. Laid out as a WW2 camp, Ashdown Camp is made up of 11 Nissen huts, air raid shelters, and outbuildings. Also used were the 1930s portion of Shire Hall, Warwick, headquarters of Warwickshire County Council, Bloxham School in OxfordshireBloxham School archives (July 2013), 'BBC Filming at Bloxham' https://plus.google.com/photos/114561889497419883074/albums/5901644395753643185 and Worcester Guildhall.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Koƒçevje municipal site It no longer has any permanent residents. History Muha Vas was a Gottschee German village. It was attacked and laid waste in an Ottoman raid in 1491. In the land registry of 1574 it had two full farms divided into half farms and two tenant farmers. Due to their small farms and exposure to the danger of Ottoman raids, the farmers paid a low tax and performed corv√©e only one day per year. The settlement had 11 houses in 1770, but only seven in 1825. The peak population of the village was 60 in 1880, but by 1910 this had declined to 36. In 1936 the village had nine houses and 46 residents (10 German, 8 Slovene, and 28 ethnically mixed). At that time, the economy of the village was based on subsistence agriculture and peddling. Schooling was offered in nearby Podlesje. The German inhabitants were evicted during the Second World War, on 18 December 1941. After the war, six of the nine houses in the village were still in usable condition, and there was a population of 15. The population had declined to nine people in four houses by 1948. In 1961 only one house remained in the village, and by 1971 it was vacant and deteriorating.

NGC 4569 is also an example of an anemic galaxy. An anemic galaxy is a type of spiral galaxy characterized by a low contrast between its spiral arms and its disk.  Origin of the term  The term was coined in 1976 by the Canadian astronomer Sidney van den Bergh to classify galaxies that are an intermediate form between the gas-rich, star- forming spiral galaxies and the gas-poor, inactive lenticular galaxies  Characteristics  Anemic galaxies not only show spiral arms of low contrast but also a low content and density of neutral hydrogen (the raw material needed to form stars), redder colours than a normal spiral, fewer H II regions, and thus a low star formation activity. At first it was believed their molecular hydrogen content was similar to that of a normal spiral, but subsequent studies have shown that a number of them are deficient in molecular gas. Anemic galaxies should not be confused with galaxies with red colors due to a low star formation activity but which show a normal content of neutral gas, as is the case of the Andromeda Galaxy.  Evolution  As most galaxies of this type are present in rich galaxy clusters, it has been proposed that this may be one of the reasons that converts normal spirals into anemic ones. Studies of spiral galaxies in the nearby Virgo cluster have shown not only how, unlike in isolated spiral galaxies, in most cases their neutral gas and star formation are truncated within their optical disks, in some cases quite severely, but also how star formation activity in them is lower than on spirals outside clusters,: this means that processes that take place in galaxy clusters as interactions with the intracluster medium like ram-pressure stripping and/or interactions with other neighboring galaxies are responsible of the origin of anemic galaxies, stripping the normal spirals of their gas, increasing in some cases their star formation activity, and thus in the end quenching the latter as their gas is exhausted and not replenished. Spiral galaxies may have become anemic ones by exhausting their supply of gas via star formation activity. An anemic galaxy's most probable fate is to lose their remaining gas and star formation, becoming similar to a lenticular galaxy: it therefore is likely that most lenticular galaxies in clusters, are former spiral galaxies.  Passive spiral galaxies  Passive spiral galaxies (also known as passive spirals) are a type of spiral galaxy located in rich galaxy clusters at high redshifts that present spiral structure, but little or no star formation, in some cases hidden by dust and concentrated within its innermost regions. Often, they seem too to have few or no massive (>20 solar masses) stars. According to computer simulations, they are systems on the way to becoming a lenticular galaxy as they have lost the hydrogen that is assumed to be present in the haloes of spiral galaxies and that replenishes them with new gas to form stars. While they share at least some properties with anemic galaxies, its relationship with them is unclear: they may be a more advanced stage on the evolution of a spiral galaxy to become a lenticular than the anemic galaxies or passive spirals and anemic galaxies may be the same type of object, their difference is that the former are much farther away than the latter.  Examples  NGC 4921 in the Coma Cluster and Messier 90 in the Virgo Cluster are examples of this type of galaxy; however, most spiral galaxies of the latter are more or less deficient in gas.

History South Mall c.1871-1883 Traditionally, the street is one of the main centres of banking and financial services in the area, and also home to a number of legal offices and solicitors. Among the notable buildings on the street is the branch of AIB. This started on its current site as Provincial Bank in 1825, while the current building was constructed between 1863 and 1865.

His art studies began at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he studied under Joseph M√∂ssmer (1780-1845) and won the Grand Prize for landscape painting in 1821. He moved to Salzburg in 1840 and set up a studio there. He was also instrumental in creating the Salzburg Art Society and a small Academy that numbered Josef Mayburger and Hans Makart's father among its students. In 1851, he built his own villa (Swiss chalet style) in Aigen. It is still known as the Fischbachvilla. After the early death of his son August, who had shown great promise, he became deeply depressed and spent the last decade of his life in Munich, away from anything that might be a sad reminder of happier days. Together with Moritz von Schwind and Ludwig Richter, he is considered one of the most important representatives of the Austrian Biedermeier style. Landscapes were his speciality, but he also produced genre art, portraits, vedute and still lifes.

Legally is one of the parishes (parroquia) under the government of the council of Salvaterra de Mi√±o. It had 327 inhabitants in 2004 divided into 15 small villages (lugares). The patron saint of the parish is Saint Simon. It limits the north with the municipality of Ponteareas (Celeiros parish), the south the parishes of Soutolobre and Leirado, on the east by Vilacova and the western part the parish of Fornelos and the municipality of Ponteareas. Geography =Orography= The entire O Condado shire is a quite mountainous area. Lira has a hilly landscape, placed in the valley of Tea and Uma Rivers. The average altitude is low, about 60 m on the sea level. =Hydrography= The village has a lot of waterways due to high precipitation and the location in a valley. The largest and most important river is the Uma, with its small affluents, the Regueiro da Vila and the Rego da Lavandeira. The Uma River is a tributary of the Tea River, and this, in turn, the Minho. =Climate= The lands of Lira, with mild temperatures and rainfall usual throughout the year; are characterized by their Oceanic climate (Csf), with tendencies to have some summer drought, influence of the warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). The annual mean temperature is approximately . Environment Lira has preserved some of its Atlantic forests (fragas) where wildlife is commonly found, especially in the lower areas close to the rivers. It is relatively unpolluted, and its landscapes composed of green hills like Santo Amaro. Nevertheless, Lira is having some environmental problems in the modern age. Forest fires are a problem throughout the shire and in general in the whole Galicia. Besides some hills are spread of the eucalyptus tree, an invasive species imported from Australia, actively promoted and researched by the paper industry since the mid-twentieth century. Recently the Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, commonly known as pine wood nematode or pine wilt nematode is causing serious damages in pine populations. Furthermore, the construction conducted in recent years has transformed excessively habitats and landscape. =Biodiversity= Lira is a heavy forested area in Galicia, but the majority of Lira's plantations, usually growing eucalyptus or pine, lack any formal management, except a sound management of the forest local community. Wood figures significantly in Lira's economy. Apart from tree plantations, Lira is also notable for the surface occupied by vineyards, meadows and cornfields. A few Old-growth forests (known locally as fragas) remain, particularly in the lower parts dominated by the English oak (Quercus robur L.), mixed with other trees like: alders, birches, ashes, hazels, blackthorns, maples, willows, wild cherry trees, wild pear trees, etc. Hills are covered mainly by maritime pine trees (Pinus pinaster). As exotic species are blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), black locust or false acacia (Robinia pseudacacia) and recently the invasive heaven tree (Ailanthus altissima). It is also frequent the American northern red oak (Quercus rubra) in new forest plantations. Shrubs (holly, hawthorn, blackberry, ivy, dog rose, elder, laurel bay, Scotch broom, gum rockrose or gorse) and herbaceous are also important. Lira also has a good range of heathers, ferns and mosses species. = Agriculture = Lira is a forest village but agriculture was also important. It can still seen some pastures, corn, potato, or cabbage fields, mainly for home consumption. Every house has its own garden and orchard: apples, pears, peaches, cherries, plums,... and recently kiwis or feijoas (pineapple guava). Special mention deserves the vines. Lira has always been the area of wine. Good quality wine (called Condado) belongs to the R√≠as Baixas (DO).

McGowan, the film is about a federal agent who is sent to Mexico to prevent foreign powers from gaining control of Mexican oil refineries and fomenting revolution among the Mexican people.Magers 2007, p. 151. Plot United States government agents Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) are sent down to Mexico to foil the plans of foreign spies trying to start a revolution on the Mexican island of Palermo in order to gain control of American oil facilities and establish a submarine refueling base. When they arrive in Mexico they attend a fiesta, where Gene has his heart stolen by the beautiful Se√±orita Dolores Mendoza (Lupita Tovar). Soon after, Gene goes to the American Consulate seeking further instructions about his mission. He is informed that Dolores' brother Andreo (Duncan Renaldo) is the pawn of a gang of foreign agents operating on the island of Palmero with the objective of establishing an enemy submarine base that would put an end to Pan American neutrality. The Consul orders Gene to leave for Palermo immediately, using the excuse that he and his men are to help Don Diego Mendoza (Frank Reicher), Dolores's uncle, with his cattle roundup. On the island of Palermo, Gene and Frog learn that Don Diego's caballeros are in fear of Andreo and his band of revolutionaries. Intercepting a secret code broadcast over the radio, Gene traces the signal to the abandoned oil fields and confirms that enemy agents are plotting to gain control of American oil holdings intending to use them for establishing a submarine refueling base. Gene cleverly allows one of the agents to escape and follows him to the office of Saunders (Alan Edwards), the head of the gang of foreign spies. Before he can act, Gene is captured by Saunders, who then leads his men and a convoy of oil trucks to the submarines waiting offshore. Frog rescues Gene, and with the help of the Mexican army, they commandeer the trucks and arrest Saunders and his gang. Andreo tries to escape and is killed. The threat of revolution in Mexico is ended. Gene returns to his sweetheart Dolores, only to learn that she has become a nun to atone for her brother's sins.

Founded in 1874 as the museum of the city of Berlin and its political region, the March of Brandenburg, it occupies a building on the northern edge of K√∂llnischer Park, facing the Spree, which was designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and completed in 1908. It is now the main facility of the Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin, Landesmuseum f√ºr Kultur und Geschichte Berlins, the City of Berlin museum foundation, which also operates four other sites. Background In the second half of the 19th century, Berlin grew very rapidly. The foundation stone of a new, much larger town hall, the Rotes Rathaus, was laid in 1861. The changes provoked interest amongst the bourgeoisie in the city's past and in preserving what had not already been lost. The Verein f√ºr die Geschichte Berlins (Association for the history of Berlin) was founded. It included early photographers such as Friedrich Albert SchwartzDas Landesarchiv Berlin und seine Best√§nde volume 4 √úbersicht der Nachl√§sse (Tektonik-Gruppe E) und Sammlungen (Tektonik-Gruppe F), Schriftenreihe des Landesarchivs Berlin, 3rd ed. rev.

Beginning in the 1860s, they urged the foundation of a regional history museum. Ernst Friedel, a judge and antiquarian who had personally collected prehistoric and historic objects and paintings from Brandenburg for this purpose, persuaded the Magistrat, the executive council of Berlin, to form a new department of \\"Collections\\" and Friedel was appointed to head it together with the existing library and archive.

Early history Reliefs of Ludwig Hoffmann and Ernst Friedel, by Evelyn Hartnick In March 1875, Friedel put out a call for the donation or loan of objects of historical or scientific interest, which was so successful that the collection had to move late that year from the old town hall to the Palais Podewils, a Baroque residence in Klosterstra√üe, and in 1880 to the former town hall of C√∂lln. At that time it had over 29,500 objects.Albrecht, pp. 32-33. In addition, Berlin in the \\"Gr√ºnderzeit\\" was full of demolitions and excavations, which yielded both fragments of old buildings and prehistoric and medieval finds.Winkler, \\"Alt- Berlin\\", p. 497. The collection was crowded and in particular the large pieces taken from churches could not be properly displayed.Sven Kuhrau, Der Kunstsammler im Kaiserreich: Kunst und Repr√§sentation in der Berliner Privatsammlerkultur, Doctoral dissertation, Free University of Berlin, Kiel: Ludwig, 2005, , p. 195 However, the inventory was not without its uses: an executioner's axe from the collection was used on 16 August 1878 to behead Max H√∂del after his attempted assassination of Emperor Wilhelm I.\\"Scharfe Sache\\", Stadtlichter, Der Tagesspiegel, 15 April 2008 At the urging of Friedel, a competition was held in 1892 for a building to house the collection, but the results were disappointing. 76 entries were received, but the winning design, by Wilhelm M√∂ller, proved on examination to be both unsuitable and too expensive, and the architect had died,C. Jk., \\"Zur Erinnerung an Wilhelm M√∂ller\\", Deutsche Bauzeitung 26 (1892) p. 337 K., \\"W. Moeller ‚Ä†\\", Centralblatt der Bauverwaltung 28 (1893) p. 288 so the project was shelved.Albrecht, p. 33 Building M√§rkisches Museum seen from Wallstra√üe in 1908, the year it opened Ground floor plan Creating a new building for the museum was the first large task for Ludwig Hoffmann after his appointment in 1896 as Stadtbaurat (chief of construction) for the city of Berlin. His first sketches date to that year; the plans were accepted the following year, and construction began in 1899 and was completed in 1907. It was not ready for occupation until 1908,Albrecht, p. 34. 12 years after the start of the project. Meanwhile, in 1899, in advance of the demolition of the C√∂lln town hall, some of the collection had been placed in storage and some shown in temporary quarters on the first floor of one of the city's covered markets, until 1904. Hoffmann designed the museum as a complex of six differing buildings which echo Brandenburg brick architecture of periods from the Gothic to the Renaissance in a \\"historical collage\\", in order to reflect the contents of the museum and evoke the \\"atmosphere\\" of various times and types of building.M√§rkisches Museum, Denkmale in Berlin, Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt Ludwig Hoffmann and Fritz Stahl, Ludwig Hoffmann, Berliner Architekturwelt Sonderhefte 14, Berlin: Wasmuth, 1914, , pp. xi-xv ; images and drawings, pp. 1-23; pp. 11-12: \\"Haus und R√§ume mu√üten die Stimmung geben....Dieser energische Hinweis auf die Bauweise der m√§rkischen Heimat ...\\" - \\"The building and the spaces in it had to provide the atmosphere....This energetic evocation of the ways of building of our homeland, the Mark ...\\" Part of his reasoning was that Berlin no longer had much of an old centre.Hoffmann and Stahl, p. xii. The buildings are grouped around two courtyards and based on historic details which he had studied and sketched throughout the region; his \\"quotations\\" are accurate copies, but there is disagreement as to the originals, as in a fa√ßade which has been said to be based on the town hall at Tangerm√ºnde or on St. Catherine's Church in Brandenburg an der Havel,Lothar Heinke, \\"Trutzburg am K√∂llnischen Park feiert Geburtstag: Ein Speicher unterschiedlichster Exponate: Das M√§rkische Museum in Mitte wird hundert Jahre alt und zeigt in der Jubil√§umsausstellung 'Gef√ºhlte Geschichte' seine Sch√§tze\\", Der Tagesspiegel, 9 April 2008 and the hip-roofed tower, high, based on the bergfried (keep) of the Bishop's Castle in Wittstock or on the cathedral of Ratzeburg.M√§rkisches Museum, Stadtmuseum.de, retrieved 6 August 2012 Hoffmann also modified the layout of K√∂llnischer Park to make an attractive setting for the museum.Hoffmann and Stahl, p. xi. The interior of the museum also seeks to evoke the atmosphere of different historical settings (as was then the fashion in provincial museums in Germany). For example, the low vaulted ceilings and roughly plastered walls on the ground floor were intended to suggest great age and housed the displays on prehistory, where the display cases for funerary urns and flint axes were rough in form; the setting for the medieval altars and sculptures was a vaulted Gothic chapel echoing medieval church interiors; weapons were shown in a room with thick columns, recalling a monastery; and rococo porcelain and snuffboxes were displayed in elegant vitrines in a light and airy room on the second floor. There were a total of about 50 exhibition galleries. The visitor was led repeatedly back to the central vaulted Great Hall.\\"M√§rkisches Museum: Wandeln unter Kreuzrippen\\", Der Tagesspiegel, 24 June 2001 A week before the opening on 10 June 1908, Emperor Wilhelm II and Empress Auguste Viktoria toured the exhibits for two hours.Michael Zajonz, \\"Zeit, wo ist dein Geist?: Das M√§rkische Museum gibt es seit 100 Jahren. Doch es z√§hlt zu den Stiefkindern der kommunalen Berliner Museumslandschaft. Eine neue Ausstellung sucht Wege zur 'gef√ºhlten Geschichte'\\", Der Tagesspiegel, 11 April 2008 The museum is now judged to be amongst Hoffmann's most important works, and also one of the most outstanding German museum buildings.Michael Zajonz, \\"Wurzelsuche: Hundert Jahre wird das M√§rkische Museum in diesem Sommer.

All das soll sich nun √§ndern\\", Der Tagesspiegel, 11 July 2008 Winkler, \\"Alt- Berlin\\", pp. 492-93. History since 1908 =Before and after World War I= The museum was widely praised and popular, attracting approximately 70,000 visitors a year and supported by the Verein f√ºr das M√§rkische Museum, which included some wealthy and prominent Berliners. Especially after the creation of Greater Berlin in 1920, it focussed more on the city than on the Mark Brandenburg.Kurt Winkler, \\"Die Musealisierung der Mark Brandenburg im 19. Jahrhundert\\", in Im Dialog mit Raubrittern und Sch√∂nen Madonnen: Die Mark Brandenburg im sp√§ten Mittelalter, ed. Clemens Bergstedt et al., Studien zur brandenburgischen und vergleichenden Landesgeschichte 6, Berlin: Lukas, 2011, , pp. 36-43, p. 42 However, it was affected by the First World War and the revolution and out of control inflation which followed it. In 1925, Walter Stengel became Director of the museum, the first in that position with professional training and experience in art history and museum science. He left Hoffmann's gallery displays largely untouched, but did introduce electric lighting in 1932, over the objections of the now retired architect. He also experimented with recorded commentary in the galleries, using gramophones.Tobias Wall, Das unm√∂gliche Museum: Zum Verh√§ltnis von Kunst und Kunstmuseen der Gegenwart, Kultur- und Museumsmanagement, Bielefeld: Transcript, 2006, , p. 209, note 30 He used the museum extension, the 18th- century Ermeler House, to display the Alfred Cassirer collection of artworks, including several works of French Impressionism, as a unified whole,Sabine Beneke, \\"Ausklang einer Epoche: Die Sammlung Alfred Cassirer\\", in Die Moderne und ihre Sammler: Franz√∂sische Kunst in deutschem Privatbesitz vom Kaiserreich zur Weimarer Republik, ed. Andrea Pophanken and Felix Billeter, Passagen 3, Berlin: Akademie, 2001, , pp. 327-46, pp. 330, 334-35 and to draw visitors back to the museum, held spectacular special exhibitions, some of them offsite. The exhibition celebrating the 70th birthday of the popular illustrator Heinrich Zille in 1928, the first extensive exhibition of his work,Weltsch√§tze der Kunst, der Menschheit bewahrt: Ausstellung anl√§sslich des 40. Jahrestages des Sieges √ºber den Hitlerfaschismus und der Befreiung des deutschen Volkes: Altes Museum vom 13. M√§rz bis 23. Mai 1985, ed. Arne Effenberger, Rainer Michaelis and Hermann Simon, Exhibition catalogue, Berlin State Museums, 1985, , p. 240 was especially popular.√ñsterreichische Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichtswissenschaften 18 (2007) p. 108 =Under the Third Reich= After Hitler's seizure of power in 1933, the M√§rkisches Museum was like other cultural facilities in Germany incorporated into the Nazi system. Stengel collaborated with the Nazis, in the interest of the museum as he saw it, acquiring art objects from Jews in forced sales and securing valuable antiques in 1938 when the regime seized all gold and silver items from Jews.Raub und Restitution: Kulturgut aus j√ºdischem Besitz von 1933 bis heute, ed. Inka Bertz and Michael Dorrmann, Exhibition catalogue, Jewish Museum, Berlin, Jewish Museum, Frankfurt, G√∂ttingen/Niedersachs: Wallstein, 2008, , p. 190.Controversies and Contradictions , History of the Museum, Jewish Museum Berlin, retrieved 7 August 2012. After the war, he stated that these items were held in escrow and not simply merged into the museum's holdings. The museum remained popular until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, when it was closed and its collection placed in storage. Much was lost,Approximately 150 paintings were either destroyed or taken by the Russians; Alexandra Richie, Faust's Metropolis: A History of Berlin, New York: Carroll & Graf, 1998, , p. 611. and the building itself was severely damaged. =Under Soviet occupation and in the German Democratic Republic= When the war ended, the museum was located in the Soviet sector of Berlin which became the capital of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The first few galleries were reopened in 1946. Some items were rescued from buildings destroyed in the war, but the need for repairs to the building restricted available space and most of the natural history collection had been lost, so the decision was made to focus on cultural history. In a restoration which took place from 1953 to 1958, the interior was subdivided by partitions and lowered ceilings, increasingly destroying Hoffmann's gallery scheme, and museum staff were required to present history on a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist basis. After the Berlin Wall divided the city in 1961, the decision was eventually made to establish a separate Berlin Museum in West Berlin. Founded in 1962, this was housed in the baroque Collegienhaus of the former Kammergericht in the Lindenstra√üe in Kreuzberg, and the collection was limited to cultural history so that the two museums could be eventually reunited with as few problems as possible. =Since reunification= After German reunification, five years of discussion and planning culminated in the foundation in 1995 of the Stiftung Stadtmuseum Berlin, Landesmuseum f√ºr Kultur und Geschichte Berlins, which now unites several formerly independent museums under the City of Berlin, with the M√§rkisches Museum as primary location. The building itself was extensively renovated in 1996-2001, including building out of new space under roofs and the removal of added partitions so that visitors again experience the sequence of galleries much as Hoffmann intended, but a large part of the museum's holdings is in storage in Spandau for want of space. The Senate of Berlin plans to unify currently scattered holdings in Mitte, in and around the M√§rkisches Museum, and has thus projected an extension to the building, which is to incorporate the nearby Marinehaus, designed by Otto Liesheim and built in 1908-10.Stadtmuseum erh√§lt ein neues Zentrum, Press release, Der Regierende B√ºrgermeister, 17 October 2007 The existing museum is to house the coverage from prehistory to the start of the 20th century, and the extension, recent history.

At Anna's request, he wrote a few compositions for Anna, Josephine and Anna's students. Schubert wrote the solo part in two of his major compositions for Josephine's voice. The poet Franz Grillparzer, who also was a family friend, wrote the lyrics to the compositions. The two works are Z√∂gernd Leise D 921 (1827) and the cantata Miriam Siegesgesang D 942 (1828).

His A History of the Valley of Virginia (1st edition, 1833) provides important primary information on the earliest white settlements of the Shenandoah Valley and South Branch Potomac River and their encounters with local Indians. Biography Kercheval married Susannah Chinn on 23 September 1787. The Kerchevals were Huguenots and the name means Horse Hearted. Cheval is the French word for horse, Ker is an archaic form of Coeur or heart. As a member of the Order of the Cincinnati, Kercheval received title to properties in Maysville, Kentucky on the Ohio River. Jefferson, in his tour of the \\"French Properties\\" stopped to visit with Sam and his son Ben. Ben later moved on to Detroit. Kercheval Avenue, which extends from Detroit into Grosse Pointe and is the main shopping area there is named in their honor. The grave in Detroit's Historic Elmwood Cemetery has disappeared. They were Freemasons adhering to the teaching of the metaphors of geometry. Correspondence with Jefferson and Madison Kercheval corresponded with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. A letter from Jefferson to Kercheval contains an eloquent argument against fossilizing the constitution, arguing against treating, \\"constitutions with sanctimonious reverence, and deem them like the arc of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.\\" The inscription carved on the wall at the Jefferson Memorial behind Jefferson's right hand used the metaphor of a man still wearing the coat which fitted him when he was a boy. Jefferson wrote at least three letters to Kercheval in reply to his concerns. One was about a political pamphlet. One was to a request for a donation to the Kentucky Military Academy, in which he replied that if he met every such request he would be destitute, and that he preferred to give where he could oversee the results. The third letter details Jefferson's prejudices, how the responsibilities of civic affairs were subdivided, and the proper interpretation of the Constitution. Ward republics are discussed in the letters. A History of the Valley of Virginia His Valley of Virginia was so popular that the first edition was soon exhausted.

Personal life Andrew Kooman is from Red Deer, Alberta, and graduated from the Bachelor of Arts collaborative degree program between Red Deer College and the University of Calgary in 2003. He also studied English and creative writing at a university in Edmonton, and graduated from the Multimedia Web Developer program at the University of Calgary in 2008. As of June 2012, he was working in public relations at Red Deer College. Andrew now lives with his wife and son in London, Ontario. Andrew Kooman Activism Andrew Kooman first became aware of the issue of human trafficking while he was working for the Christian nonprofit organization Youth With A Mission (YWAM) in southeast Malaysia, where he met child victims of human trafficking, but Kooman later came to realize that human trafficking is an issue in Canada as well; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) estimate that between 600 and 800 people are trafficked into Canada every year. Kooman has spoken about the cases in which people have been trafficked into Calgary and Edmonton in order to work in the sex industry, and has posited that sex workers have likely been trafficked into his hometown of Red Deer as well since it is also located along Alberta Highway 2. Kooman continued to work in Malaysia with YWAM for two years, towards the end of which time he visited Singapore, where he attended an international conference on human trafficking, there learning details on the issue that shocked him. The conference focused on the military use of children and the prostitution of children. One of the facts that stuck with Kooman was that there are children aged five and under who are forcibly prostituted daily, and that many of these children end up spending their entire lives as human trafficking victims. Kooman is the director of Raise Their Voice, a creative, justice-driven, nonprofit organisation in Red Deer. The other four members of the organization are his family members. With the help of two brothers Matthew and Daniel , Andrew established Unveil Studios.Andrew Kooman Writing career Andrew Kooman is an author and playwright. All of Kooman's writings focus on justice and many of the issues he writes about are gender-based. Kooman's first literary reaction to human trafficking was to write some short stories. Eventually, he also started writing the play that became She Has a Name in order to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking, specifically in its connections to sexual exploitation. In 2009, the script of She Has a Name was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. By February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of She Has a Name in order to expose it to a larger audience. Some Americans expressed an interest in staging She Has a Name in the United States. After starting to write this play, Kooman read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident in a Canadian newspaper and also heard about it through a friend of his who was working at an aftercare centre in Bangkok, Thailand to restore the dignity of former sex workers. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.For Kooman's identification of the Ranong human-trafficking incident with child prostitution, see *For Kooman's appropriation of the Ranong human- trafficking incident for the play's backstory, see There was a tour of She Has a Name in 2012, and the final performances were held in Red Deer. Kooman was glad to have the tour conclude in his hometown because the people of Central Alberta were very supportive of the play. During the tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence (PACE) by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes (AACTI) and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. In conjunction with this award, a $5000 scholarship was set up in Kooman's name, which he chose to have awarded to students who evince creativity, leadership, and a commitment to those who are in need. The PACE Award ceremony is biennial, and took place on June 13 in Edmonton at the AACTI Board of Governors Conference. Before writing She Has a Name, Kooman had written other pieces of literature that had been published, such as the young adult novel Ten Silver Coins: The Drylings of Acchora, but this was his first full-length play. He had, however, been writing shorter plays since 2007, and has written other full-length plays since She Has a Name, including one about Richard Wurmbrand, a Romanian Christian who was a political prisoner of the Soviet Union in the 1950s, and another about the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands; these plays are called We Are The Body and Delft Blue respectively.

She has always felt that she didn't belong, but never did she imagine how much. When her mother sends her to Shadow Falls Camp, she learns that the place is not filled with troubled teens as she's told, but with supernatural creatures: vampires, werewolves, fairies, shape-shifters, and witches. The problem is she is one of them, but no one knows what she is, and her quest to find out begins. But problems don't stop coming from there - she is constantly followed by a certain spirit that only she can see, her heart is tormented by her parting family and two guys who have a strong affection on her; the handsome and generous Derek who shares her feelings, and the hotheaded werewolf Lucas, who shares a secret past with her. Throughout the series, she develops multiple special powers, such as \\"dreamscaping\\", superhuman speed, superhuman strength, and healing that only come when she wishes to protect others. At the end of Taken at Dusk, she finds out that her species is called \\"chameleon\\": a hybrid that acquires abilities from several species passed down through the generations. In Whispers at Moonrise, she begins to show brain patterns and abilities of witches, vampires, faes and werewolves, respectively. At the end of Whispers at Moonrise, she leaves Shadow Falls to live with her grandfather. In Chosen at Nightfall, Kylie returns to Shadow Falls and discovers an enchanted sword to aid her in an upcoming battle against Mario. She searches in her heart and finally realizes her true feelings for Lucas. At the end of the novel, she confesses those feelings and successfully defeats Mario as well as his son John on the mission to save her mother while also ensures the acknowledgement of chameleons to the open world. *Derek Lakes is one of Kylie's two love interests in the storyline. He is a half-fae with power to sense/control emotions, erase memories, dreamscape and communicate with animals. Because his father left him at an early age, he formed a deep dislike to his hereditary powers. In the beginning of Born at Midnight, he attends Shadow Falls Camp solely to learn how to give up these abilities, but when he uses them to save the camp and Kylie, he finally learns the benefits of having them and openly embraces them. He has a strong connection with Kylie, but her affection towards Lucas and his ability to sense a powered-up version of her emotions put them at a distance. Near the end of Awake at Dawn, he leaves the camp to go on missions for the FRU (Fallen Research Unit), but returns in Taken at Dusk with ex-girlfriend, Ellie Mason, whom he confesses to having slept with when they reunited. At the end of Taken at Dusk, he confesses his love to Kylie and maintains as her friend in Whispers at Moonrise. In Chosen at Nightfall, he tries to get close to Kylie again, but she turns him down, saying they both had moved on. From then on, the two become friends officially. Near the end of the novel, Derek meets and falls for another chameleon named Jenny Yates. *Lucas Parker is the other of Kylie's love interests. He is a stubborn and possessive werewolf, who shares a secret past with Kylie. They first met when they were children, but Lucas had had a relentless affection towards her since then. They never saw each other again until 11 years later, when they reunite at Shadow Falls Camp. Near the end of Born at Midnight, he leaves the camp to free his half-sister from a werewolf gang. In Awake at Dawn, he is occasionally visited by Kylie in his dreams before his return to Shadow Falls, and saves her from a rogue vampire's capture. They begin a relationship sometime after Derek left the camp, but things become complicated when his pack and family refuse to let him be with someone not of their own kind. This very problem causes a rift between the two as Lucas himself wishes for Kylie to be a werewolf. He eventually finds out that she is a chameleon, but continues his relationship with her, saying that he loves her too much to let her go. At the end of Whispers at Moonrise, Kylie finds out that he is engaged to another werewolf in hopes of getting his father's vote to join the Werewolf Council and breaks off their relationship.

She treats Kylie like a sister and often acts as her guide in her quests to help spirits and self-discovery. She is a fairy with the power to communicate with ghosts and influence emotions. She is frequently attracted to Burnett, but due to a heartbreaking past with another vampire, she often dismisses those feelings. It is revealed in Whispers at Moonrise, that this experience was caused by her identical twin, Hannah, who slept with her boyfriend, who later became her fianc√©, before the wedding. She later finds out that her twin is murdered, and the murderer is after her as well. At the end of Whispers at Moonrise, she makes amends with her sister and accepts Burnett's whirlwind proposal.

His loyalty for the FRU agency gradually shifts to Shadow Falls as he spends time caring for the students and staff. In Whispers at Moonrise, he begins to see ghosts and the spirit of Holiday's twin, Hannah. After Holiday's near-death experience, he declares his love for her and asks her to marry him, to which she accepts. In Chosen at Nightfall, Burnett finds out that Holiday is pregnant and, though insecure at first, comes to accept his little family and marries the woman. *Perry Gomez is known as one of the most powerful shape-shifters in the world; he can transform into any creature he can imagine. He develops a crush on Miranda, but doesn't dare to admit anything. At the beginning of Awake at Dawn, she gets kissed by Kevin, a fellow shape- shifter, and Perry flies into fighting rage. He then kisses Miranda and dumps her on the spot, and ignores her for most of the book. After some time, he starts a fight with Clark, a warlock, who shoves Miranda; the dining room is almost destroyed by the fight. He finally begins to follow his heart and asks Miranda out. From then on, they become a couple. Throughout Taken at Dusk, Whispers at Moonrise and Chosen at Nightfall, he is assigned by Burnett to be one of Kylie's \\"shadows\\" - a bodyguard, until Burnett ends the shadowing duties. At the beginning of Chosen at Nightfall, he flips Kylie's uncomfortable situation by showing everyone his buttocks and sway their attention to him. A brief argument occurs between Miranda and Perry when his girlfriend turns Nikki, a fellow shape-shifter, into a kangaroo out of jealousy, but they make up afterwards. *Mrs. Galen is Kylie's mother. She was initially depicted as cold-hearted, and Kylie often assumed she didn't love her, until she proved otherwise. At the end of Born at Midnight, Mrs. Galen tells Kylie about her natural father's origin when Kylie discovers the resemblance between her and a ghost named Daniel. Throughout the series, she is kept in the dark about the world of supernaturals and the fact that her daughter is one of them. On one occasion, she accidentally witnessed Jonathon drinking Helen's blood and Derek was forced to erase her memory. It is noted in Taken at Dusk that she is descended from a Native American tribe with special gifts that pass down through the generations. She meets and falls in love with a man named John Anthony in Taken at Dusk, but finds out about his evil side at the end of Chosen at Nightfall when Kylie comes to her rescue. After this, she finally tells her mother about the supernatural world. *Fredericka Lakota is a werewolf student of the camp. She is part of Lucas's group and is very deeply affectionate toward him, which is why she is incredibly resentful at Kylie for his affection. She often tries to find ways to scare her off, and is openly hostile towards her and her friends. In Whispers at Moonrise, she helps Kylie save Holiday from Collin Warren and defeats him in combat. Through this experience, they begin to come to terms with one another. She is the one who tells Kylie about Lucas's engagement party. In Chosen at Nightfall, Fredericka develops new affection toward the new history teacher, Cary Cannon, and turns to Kylie for advice, effectively ending their rivalry and her affection toward Lucas. *Sara Jetton has been Kylie's best childhood friend since before the beginning of the series.

In Awake at Dawn, she develops cancer and Kylie uses her newfound power to heal her, at the request of Sara's deceased grandmother. In Taken at Dusk, she accompanies Kylie's mother to visit Kylie, but the situation turns awkward when she meets Kylie's new friends, and their friendship never becomes the same again, though they are still friends. They lose contact for sometime, but in Chosen at Nightfall, Sara calls Kylie to confess that she has started a relationship with her friend's ex-boyfriend, Trey, and gets a haircut. *Tom Galen is Kylie's stepfather. He married Kylie's mother as soon as he found out she was pregnant with Daniel's child to save her family from shame. His only condition was to never let Kylie know that she wasn't his child. He was kicked out of the house by his wife at the beginning of the series after she found out that he was cheating on her. Kylie was closest to him before discovering his affair, which drives her further apart from him. In Whispers at Moonrise, he files divorce papers with his wife, but Kylie has come to forgive him for his mistake. *Malcolm Summers is Kylie's paternal grandfather and a chameleon. He is very distrustful of the FRU due to his heartbreaking history with the agency, and tries to persuade Kylie to live with him instead of staying at Shadow Falls, since the school is affiliated with the agency. His prejudice against Shadow Falls finally lets up some in Chosen at Nightfall. *Francyne is Kylie's great-aunt and a chameleon. She is very distrustful of the FRU due to her people's history with the agency and her sister's death. In Chosen at Nightfall, she comes to lift her prejudice against Shadow Falls. *Hayden Yates is a chameleon working with Malcolm and a teacher at Shadow Falls. He first appears at the camp pretending to be a half- fae and half-vampire science teacher. Kylie is initially incredibly suspicious of his motives, even though he always speaks the truth. In the end, she finds out about his true agenda (he is working with her grandfather to keep her safe), and leaves Shadow Falls with him. In Chosen at Nightfall, he accompanies Kylie to the FRU's base to get their genetics tested as a way of officially presenting chameleons to the supernatural world. *Steve is a shape- shifter that Della is interested in, and shares a cabin with Lucas. He supposedly has sandy-colored hair and a cute butt, and shows interest in Della, who is constantly avoiding his attention. In Whispers at Moonrise, he is assigned by Burnett to go on a mission with Della, much to her dismay. They bond during their time away from Shadow Falls; Steve comes to her rescue when her ex-boyfriend spots her at a local Chinese restaurant. He comes to her rescue again when they confront the vampire bureau that Burnett sent them to, and again when they run into a pack of werewolves. During the mission, Della gets stabbed and Steve takes time to care for her. When they return in Chosen at Nightfall, Della avoids him completely. Steve turns to Kylie for advice, and decides to fight for Della's affection, much to her dismay. *Chan Hon is Della's cousin, who faked his death in France after he became a vampire. When he ran into Della by accident, her vampiric virus activated, which turned her into a vampire. Chan took care of her, but was very unsupportive with her decision to join Shadow Falls. He visits Della on her first day at camp. In Reborn, he died due to the rebirthing process. *Kenneth Brighten is Daniel's adopted father and Kylie's adopted grandfather. He makes his first appearance in Chosen at Nightfall when he and his wife come to Shadow Falls to meet their granddaughter. At the end of the book, they meet Daniel's biological family whilst getting invited to Burnett's and Holiday's wedding. *Becky Brighten is Daniel's adopted mother and Kylie's adopted grandmother. She makes her first appearance in Chosen at Nightfall when she and her husband come to Shadow Falls to meet their granddaughter. At the end of the book, they meet Daniel's biological family whilst getting invited to Burnett's and Holiday's wedding. =Other characters= *Helen Jones is a half-fae with the power to heal internal diseases and detect brain tumors. She uses this power to scan Kylie's brain and confirms that she is tumor-free in Born at Midnight. After this, she becomes one of Kylie's closest of friends, and starts a relationship with Jonathon, a newly turned vampire, with advice from Kylie. In Chosen at Nightfall, Helen is attacked outside of campus. Though the identity of her attacker is a mystery, many believe it was Mario Esparza, the evil chameleon who commits evildoings in the vampire community. She returns to school one week later, but hardly encounters Kylie. *Jonathon is a newly turned vampire. He begins a relationship with Helen in the middle of Born at Midnight. In Taken at Dusk, he assigns himself as Kylie's \\"shadow\\" (meaning: bodyguard). Though he rarely hangs out with Kylie's group of friends, he is one of them, including Helen. In Chosen at Nightfall, Jonathon is distraught by Helen's attack and accidentally knocks down Kylie's stepfather when he enters campus ground uninvited. *Ellie Mason is Derek's ex-girlfriend and a vampire. Derek brought her to Shadow Falls Camp after crossing paths with her in Pennsylvania. Though she likes Kylie, Derek's love interest, Kylie shows opposite affection, especially after finding out that she had slept with Derek. They eventually move past their issues and become friends of sorts. At the end of Taken at Dusk she dies trying to protect Derek from Mario Esparza, and her spirit guides Kylie to his whereabouts before moving on to heaven. *Kevin is a shape-shifter and Perry Gomez's friend before he kissed Miranda and turned their friendship into rivalry. *Mandy is a fae who likes to kiss anyone on the lips. In Born at Midnight, Derek used her to make Kylie jealous. *Trey Cannon is Kylie's ex-boyfriend. He broke up with her shortly before the beginning of the series. He tries to reconcile with Kylie in Born at Midnight, but she brushes him off. Initially, she finds Derek's looks quite similar to Trey, but later comes to like Derek himself. It is later revealed in Awake at Dawn that he hooked up with Sara after Kylie's rejection. *Selynn is a werewolf agent of the FRU and Burnett's ex-girlfriend. She joined with Burnett to protect Shadow Falls, but her insensitive ways of handling situations made her unaccepted by the inhabitants and she was eventually reassigned. *Sky Peacemaker is a former camp leader of Shadow Falls Camp. She was a werewolf, who was threatened by the Blood Brothers Gang with her sister's life to help shut down the camp. At the end of Born at Midnight, Sky redeems herself by coming to Kylie and Derek's rescue during their struggle against the Blood Brothers Gang and confessing her crime. *Clara Parker is Lucas's half-sister who attends Shadow Falls in Whispers at Moonrise. She gets chased by a massive 'fog', and ends up getting rescued by Kylie. Clara accuses her of being behind the whole plot due to her being a witch at the time. In Chosen at Nightfall, she resents Kylie for putting Lucas's life in jeopardy as well as the destruction of his life purpose. *Ava Kane is a sexy-looking English teacher at Shadow Falls. She is half-witch and half-shape-shifter, though her shape- shifter side is more dominant. *Monique is Lucas Parker's former-fianc√© through an arrange-marriage. She first appears at the end of Whispers at Moonrise during her engagement party. In \\"Chosen At Nightfall\\" she encounters Kylie and indicates she was as unhappy about marriage as Lucas or Kylie. She also implies to have had no interest in Lucas until after he broke off the arrangement. *Chris Whitmore is a student at Shadow Falls. He is the representative of the vampire group at the school and is mostly in charge of pairing up campers/students for their daily activity, Meet Your Campmate Hour. Though he appears playful and funny, he can be serious at times. Like several others, he is assigned as one of Kylie's shadows. *Blake is Holiday's vampire ex-fianc√©. He and Holiday were in love and on their way to marriage before he slept with her sister, Hannah, and then dumped Holiday on their wedding day. He makes his debut appearance in Whispers at Moonrise, and is suspected by Burnett to be Hannah's murderer. *Jenny Yates is Hayden's younger sister and Kylie's newfound friend. After learning to harness the power of invisibility, she escapes from her fellow chameleons in hopes of finding freedom. With help from Kylie, Hayden and Derek, she becomes the first chameleon to enroll Shadow Falls after Kylie, and shows affection toward Derek Lakes, who genuinely returns her feelings. *Cary Cannon is the history teacher who replaces Collin Warren in Chosen at Nightfall. He is a young but smart werewolf and Fredericka's new love interest, but due to their statuses as teacher and student, Kylie suggests they stay friends for the time being until Fredericka graduates. *Lee is Della's ex-boyfriend. Because of his strict upbringing, he was meant to marry a pure Chinese girl, but went against his mother's wishes to date Della, a part-Chinese. After Della became a vampire, he pushed her away because of her perpetually cold body temperature, and Della ended their relationship. He had since found a new Chinese girlfriend. They are currently engaged. *Will is a werewolf student attending Shadow Falls. He is Lucas's closest friend. Whenever Lucas asks him for a favor, he would agree to it. He doesn't believe in the old beliefs of werewolves. *Mrs. Parker is Lucas's grandmother. She took him in when Lucas's parents didn't want him, and took care of him in ways his parents never did. She was a purist regarding the beliefs and traditions of werewolves, and wasn't very thrilled when Kylie, a non-werewolf, won Lucas's affection. She helped Lucas contact an elder of the werewolf council in hopes of getting her grandson a chance to join it. Soon after that, she died; however, she still worried for Lucas and asked Kylie to help him through his grief.

CSK ZSU is subordinated to the Sport Administration of Ministry of Defense (created on April 29, 1992). The club is a member of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine and prepares Ukrainian Olympic reserve (Olympians) for Olympic Games. The club also used administer couple of professional teams, particularly in football such as FC CSKA Kyiv and cooperated with CSKA-Borysfen (since 2001 known as FC Arsenal Kyiv). Brief overview =Sports Club of the Army (Soviet Union)= The predecessor of CSK ZSU was the Sports Club of the Kyiv Military District (SK KVO) which was established on April 1, 1957 by the district's administration of military training as a regional department of the Sports Society of Armed Forces of the USSR. The club was based on the Sports Club of the Kyiv Military District Officers' Club (SKDO Kyiv). The newly established club included following sports establishments: * Palace of sports (vulytsia Leitynantska, #1/3) * Stadium (Povitroflotske shose, #32) * Covered swimming pool (Povitroflotske shose, #32) * Equestrian sports facilities (vulytsia Leitynantska, #1/3) * Shooting sports facilities (shooting range at Koncha-Zaspa) The Palace of sports, stadium and the shooting range were all inherited from the Officers' Club. The swimming pool, initially uncovered, was part of the Officers' Club since 1951. However after its reconstruction in 1956, it was handed to the administration of military training and was transferred to the sports club only on April 1, 1958, a year later. The equestrian sports facilities were created on the base of a liquidated stables of the 114th Separate Rifle Company and were transferred to the sports club as well. In 1957 the football squad of military servicemen from the Soviet Class B (third tier) were added to the club. The football squad was completely sponsored by the Kyiv Military District headquarters. In 1959 the team however was dissolved. On May 10, 1960, a day after the Victory Day, the club was renamed into the Sports Club of Army (SKA Kyiv). On July 4, 1962 the shooting sports facilities were transferred to the military unit #01626. Since May 20, 1971 the club was transferred to the staff of #48/105-A and on December 15 it adopted the number 14 becoming the 14th Sports Club of Army. On February 12, 1980 the club created two children and youth sports schools. One school was for fighting sports and team sports, while another - for other Olympic sports. =Central Sports Club of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Ukraine)= With fall of the Soviet Union all Soviet organization that were funded through the central government ceased to exist. In 1992 the Kyiv Military District was dissolved, some of its components were moved to Russia, while others were transferred to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The former SKA Kyiv was discontinued and all its assets were transferred into the newly formed the Central Sports Club which absorbed all the Soviet Army centers based in Ukraine such as Odessa, Lviv, and Sevastopol (every one corresponds to the administrative center of a Soviet military district).

For the rest of the 2017 Super Rugby campaign Luatua was excellent, providing a game-winning offload to Sonny Bill Williams who subsequently offloaded to Ihaia West so that West could score against the British and Irish Lions. The Blues won 22-16. The following day however, Luatua was not selected for the All Blacks, meaning the Blues' 22-16 win against the Lions would be his last match at Eden Park. Steven Luatua wins a lineout as the Blues defeat the British and Irish Lions in 2017  Outside rugby  Luatua is an avid New England Patriots fan. He covered the NFL playoffs in 2017 for Duke TV.

Location and description Caldron Linn is about a mile below Rumbling Bridge, and can be accessed through fields by Powmill, with a 150 ft slippery descent to reach it. The height of its fall was lessened in 1886 by rock fall. Here are two cataracts, distant from each other 28 yards. The upper fall, thirty-four feet in height, declines a little from the perpendicular; the rocks rise out of the channel, and there is one like a pillar, horizontal at the top, by which many persons have passed from one side to the other. Between these falls, the river has formed three round cavities, having the appearance of large caldrons or boilers. In the first, the water is perpetually agitated as if it were boiling; in the second, it is covered with a constant foam ; in the third, which is the largest, being 22 feet in diameter, it appears as if spread out in a large cooler. These cavities are separated from each other by ledges of rock; they communicate, not by the water running over their brim, but by apertures about middle depth in their ledges, wrought out in the course of ages by the action of the water. The lower caldron discharges the water into the last fall through a similar aperture, having the appearance of a door or large window hewn out of the rock. Through this opening, the river rushes in one vast and rapid torrent over a stupendous pile of perpendicular rocks, into a deep and romantic glen. The noise of its fall is tremendous, and the rocks seem to tremble to their centre, while the mind of the spectator is deeply affected by emotions of wonder and admiration. The height of the rock is 88 feet, and the fall 44. The most complete view of this magnificent scene, and of the deep and finely-wooded dell, is from the bottom of the great fall, where it has the appearance of a prodigious fountain gushing from the solid rock. It is beheld to most advantage between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, when the sun shines directly in front of it. A vapour constantly ascends from the pool; in sunshine this vapour exhibits all the colours of the rainbow, which, by the constant agitation of the air, disperse, and again appear in the most beautiful combinations. The Caldron Linn, in short, is perhaps the greatest natural curiosity, and certainly one of the most sublime objects in Scotland. More than twenty years ago [c.1818] the following extraordinary occurrence happened at this place: a fox, which was hard pursued by a pack of hounds, led them along the banks of the river, till he reached the boiling caldron, which he crossed; the dogs attempted to follow, but being unacquainted with the path, they fell, one after another, into the caldron, and were drowned. Several years ago, a gentleman fell into the same caldron, and was extricated with the greatest difficulty.\\" See also *Waterfalls of Scotland Notes External links *photo Category:Waterfalls of Perth and Kinross Category:Waterfalls of Clackmannanshire ","title":"Cauldron Linn (River Devon)"},{"id":"36624066","text":"Sami Al Lenqawi is a kuwait football Defender who played for Kuwait in the 1996 Asian Cup.

She is an investor of various social enterprise businesses including VPL, a woman's wear company dedicated to women's education, and founded Fashion Girls for Humanity in New York, a non-profit humanitarian organization. Early life and education Hanazawa is the daughter of Ikue Hanazawa and Kiyoshi Yokoyama of Japan. Her father was a business entrepreneur-turned Tendai Buddhist monk, and her mother Ikue Hanazawa owned an haute couture fashion business. Her aunt was Tomiyo Hanazawa who designed modern kimono for Chiyo Uno and staged the first kimono fashion show in the US in 1957. Both Tomiyo and Ikue started their careers in fashion working for Uno Chiyo, a well known feminist author in Japan, who founded Sutairu (\\"Style\\"), Japan's first fashion magazine in 1936, along with the boutique in Ginza. During the Second World War, however, it was suppressed by government censors, who found the articles they wrote on themes like \\"Proper Underwear - a Must for Western Dresses\\" not in keeping with the seriousness of the times. But the unsinkable they resurrected it during the Occupation. Following Chiyo Uno's advice to be an independent woman, neither Tomiyo nor Ikue Hanazawa were ever married and became very involved in fashion business with Chiyo Uno for much of their lives. While Hanazawa grew up surrounded by these professional working women, she had no interest in fashion as a career and came to New York in 1989 to attend Columbia University with no financial support. In order to fund her own education, she held various positions at Itochu and J. Crew. In 2000 she finally graduated magna cum laude in art history / architecture theory. She also graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA in 2002. Career Hanazawa's first job was selling American vintage clothes in Shibuya. Prior to starting non profit and social ventures, she took various jobs and internships, including Itochu, J. Crew, Accenture, TPG and Theory. In 2006, Hanazawa invested in VPL (brand) and became president of the company. VPL is sold globally including Barneys New York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Ikram, Fred Segal, and Harvey Nichols, and it has been worn by celebrities like Gwen Stefani and Victoria Beckham. VPL received numerous industry recognition, including Ecco Domani, CFDA/Vogue fashion fund finalist, and CFDA Lexus Sustainability award. In 2010 with Miki Higasa, Tomoko Ogura, and Julie Gilhart, Hanazawa founded Fashion Girls for Japan. They together organized a successful designer sale in NY, Japan and London to benefit Japanese earthquake victims. Fashion Girls for Japan was renamed to Fashion Girls for Humanity in response to Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and the fund helped the restoration of more than 5 fire stations and various individual homes in NJ and Long Island. The online auction in December 2013 to help survivors of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines raised the fund to purchase water filters distributed by Waves for Water. In 2014 Hanazawa was selected as one of Forbes Asia 48 Heroes of Philanthropists. Fashion Girls for Humanity became a recipient for Asia Society's Game Changer Award in 2014. In 2015 Fashion Girls raised the fund for Shikshya Foundation and Waves for Water to benefit earthquake victims in Nepal. Hanazawa served on the finance committee for CFDA as well as a panel for CFDA Fashion Incubator program.

Various areas have developed these systems as part of incident management. The purpose of these routes is to provide a detour in the event that the parent route is impassable, due to either a traffic jams, traffic collision, or road closure (for a variety of reasons). Sometimes these routes are signed as a prefixed or suffixed numbered road, making them a type of special route. A permanently signed detour route should not be confused with a \\"permanent detour\\". The latter would be used if a particular roadway section, such as a bridge, were closed permanently. Canada =Ontario= An emergency detour route (EDR) sign on Ontario Highway 401 The province of Ontario in Canada is one jurisdiction outside the United States with a very prevalent system of these roads. The Emergency Detour Routes, originally Emergency Diversion Routes (EDR), are a system of temporary detour routes paralleling many major highways in Ontario. Most of these follow county or municipal roads within the province that are not (currently) provincially controlled (though many were former provincial highways). These routes are designed to be used in the event of a closure on a major road or 400-series highway, such as construction or serious collisions. Though most EDRs are set up along 400-series highways, a select few have been established along two lane King's Highways, notably Highway 21 due to the lake effect of Lake Huron, which can result in sudden snowsquall conditions during the winter. ;History Halton was the first jurisdiction in Ontario to create EDRs, although it initially referred to them as Emergency Diversion Routes. In August 1999, the regional council approved the preparation of the Road Closure Action Plan (RCAP), which was developed with input from the Halton Regional Police Services and the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The RCAP utilized folding signs that police could open to \\"activate\\" the route. Similar in appearance to the EDR signs of today, the RCAP signs featured a trapezoid shaped orange EDR sign, as opposed to an orange square with a black circle containing the letters EDR. These signs were first deployed along a limited stretch of the Queen Elizabeth Way in March 2001, between Dorval Drive and Trafalgar Road in Oakville and between Bronte Road and Burloak Drive in Burlington, both the location of major ravines with limited alternative crossings. By the spring of 2003, when the deployment of the system was complete, the entire Queen Elizabeth Way, Highway 401 and Highway 403 had diversion routes within Halton Region. Following Halton's tests, the MTO and the Ontario Good Roads Association formed a joint task force, and using the RCAP as a model, developed the Emergency Detour Route program. In 2010 and 2011, an aggressive program was instituted to place EDRs alongside major routes throughout the province.City of Ottawa. Ottawa Gets Emergency Detour Routes .

Accessed on September 15, 2011. =Alberta= Highway 2 uses Highway 2A as an Emergency Detour Route. On Highway 2, there are signs with flashing lights indicating when to take the next exit to use the detour route.  Sweden  Sweden use signs with white background and blue text for their permanent detour routes (Swedish: permanent omledningsv√§g) on numbered roads. According to the Swedish Transport Administration's guidelines a permanent detour route should be able to handle all the traffic when it comes to capacity, weight, height, etc. as sorting traffic is almost impossible. In cases that for some reason need traffic sorting the police will regulate the traffic. However, there may be different routes for different travel directions as to not create accessibility problems or queues due to limited capacity; in these cases a letter for the cardinal direction is added at the end. The guidelines also emphasize that the segments of the permanent detour route should be as short as possible with access to the main route whenever it is possible. United Kingdom and Ireland The United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland use yellow signs with a series of symbols for their emergency diversion routes. Symbols come in a shapes, with a solid and hollow version, including circle, triangle, square and diamond. When a roadway is closed, a trigger sign is opened at the last junction prior to the closure, displaying a symbol, which motorists can follow to rejoin the route at a point beyond the closure. United States The national MUTCD has not yet adopted standard signage for these routes. Some states have adopted their own systems. =Michigan= Emergency plate Emergency I-94 shields in Coloma, Michigan Michigan has a system of special routes called \\"Emergency\\" routes which parallel major highways, primarily in Southwestern Michigan. These routes provide relief in the event of emergency closures to a freeway due to accidents, weather, or other civil emergencies. Emergency routes have been gradually put in place as part of a broader plan by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to upgrade its ITS network across the state. These detours may or may not follow MDOT-maintained State Highways, however, and some portions of the routes pass through urban or suburban areas. Emergency routes exist on and parallel to Interstate 69 (I-69) and I-94 and US Highway 31 (US 31). These routes are signed with an auxiliary \\"Emergency\\" plate that is colored orange, indicating a temporary traffic control sign. Emergency US 31, which offers an alternative crossing of the Grand River in the event that the bascule bridge in Grand Haven, Michigan is unavailable for motorists, is one such route. According to MDOT, \\"this route would only be used in emergency situations and worst-case scenarios impacting the entire bridge structure.\\" =Missouri= Missouri uses \\"Incident By-Pass Routes\\" along its highways. =Nebraska= Nebraska has created an alternate route for Interstate 80. Signs M4-1E and M4-1W. =New York= The New York State Thruway uses emergency detour signs to divert traffic from the Thruway in the event of weather conditions or other emergencies. =Ohio= I-76, I-76/US 224 Alt, and I-77 alt at Ohio State Route 21 in Norton Ohio has established a permanent detour scenario of Interstate 70 east of Columbus, due to frequent flooding. Alternate Interstate routes also exist for I-70 near Dayton as well as for Interstate 76 and Interstate 77 in Summit County. =Pennsylvania= Green and orange detour signs in Pennsylvania Pennsylvania has a system of \\"color detour signs\\" in which any detour follows signs with a specific color. The detours are meant to be used if a limited-access highway has to be closed for an emergency situation such as a flood or car accident, directing motorists along local roads near the limited-access highway to the next exit. According to a document produced by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission containing information from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, they are generally color-coded according to direction, with blue meaning north, red meaning south, green meaning east, and orange meaning west, with other colors sometimes being used when detour routes overlap with one another. However, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's own sign manual recommends that only black, blue, or orange be used.
