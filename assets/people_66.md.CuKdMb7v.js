The unit was initially known as \\"Cobb's Light Artillery\\" for its first commander, Major Moses Cobb. An experienced officer of the Massachusetts militia, Cobb was selected to organize and command the battery on April 20, 1861, however he did not go with the unit when it departed for the field. The unit was later known as \\"Nim's Battery\\" after its subsequent commanding officer, Capt. Ormand F. Nims. It was one of the Massachusetts regiments organized in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call on May 2, 1861, for volunteer troops to serve a term of three-years. The 2nd Massachusetts Battery was the first unit of artillery to be recruited in Massachusetts for three- years service. The battery trained at Camp Adams in Quincy, Massachusetts, and was mustered into federal service on July 31, 1861. Departing the Boston area on August 8, the battery first served garrison duty near Baltimore and in operations in eastern Maryland. In February 1862, it was assigned to the Department of the Gulf under Major General Benjamin F. Butler and shipped for Louisiana on April 19. The regiment saw combat during the early stages of the Siege of Vicksburg, and suffered badly from disease and general debility during the operations. After Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks took command of the Department of the Gulf, the battery participated in the Siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana. They also saw action during the Second Bayou Teche Campaign in western Louisiana and the Red River Campaign, during which their guns were captured at the Battle of Sabine Crossroads. They were resupplied with new guns in May 1864. The original volunteers were mustered out on August 16, 1864, having served their three-year term. Some of these chose to reenlist and, receiving new recruits, the unit went on to serve an additional year, seeing action during operations against Fort Blakeley, Alabama. The unit was mustered out on August 11, 1865.

C. Eyckens, Vanech, Gio: Vanech, J. v. Eyckens, Jan Carel van Eijck (1649 in Antwerp ‚Äì 1686/1706), was a Flemish painter active in Antwerp and Italy in the second half of the 17th century. He is known for his landscapes with villages and city scapes with genre scenes. He is also mentioned as a painter of portraits and biblical scenes.Jan Carel van Eyck at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Flemish townscape with an animated frozen river Jan Carel van Eyck was born in Antwerp as the son of the painter Jan Carel van Eyck and Dymphna Heyman. He was baptized on 12 May 1649. He had another brother called Nicolaas who became a painter but of whom no known works are known. His uncle Gaspar was a marine painter. Jan Carel's family was well-off and lived at a prestigious address on the Meir in Antwerp. His father became a captain of a local schutterij in 1658.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1013-1014 He was registered at Antwerp's Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of the history painter Jan Erasmus Quellinus under whom he started to study in 1669.Ph.

Van Lerius, Advokaet, onder de bescherming van den raed van bestuer der koninklyke Akademie van beeldende Kunsten, van gezegde Stad, Volume 2, Antwerp, 1872, pp. p. 386, 389, 280 There is no record that he became a master of the Guild. He travelled to Italy and his presence in Rome in 1677 is recorded. On a winter landscape noted in 1907 the signature reads 'Roma', which is further evidence that he resided in Rome. His trace was lost in Italy and he is believed never to have returned to Antwerp. It is not clear when or where he died. It must have been after 1686 (painting from that year known) or 1692 (painting from that year mentioned, but there is no clear record for this). His death dues were never paid at the Antwerp Guild. Work Jan Carel van Eyck is known for his landscapes with villages and cityscapes with genre scenes. He is also mentioned as a painter of portraits and biblical scenes. Crowded village scene with a messenger reading a proclamation In the second half of the 17th century city views had become popular. Antwerp painters such as Erasmus de Bie specialised in the genre of city views showing genre scenes with many figures on the frozen Scheldt as in the Figures in front of the frozen Scheldt in Antwerp or public events such as The Ommegang in Antwerp. These animated scenes, particularly those of city squares populated with many characters, on foot or on horseback, were likely an inspiration for van Eyck. An example of an animated city view by van Eyck is the Townscape in winter with carriages (At Dorotheum on 30 April 2019 lot 321). It shows a large city view in winter with many figures, horses and carriages bustling about on a frozen river lined by town houses and a church. Some ships have been frozen in by the river. In the foreground is a carriage drawn by six horses which startles a horse ridden by a man. There are many figures engaged in conversations, fishing, sleighing or observing other passers-by. While the town architecture is clearly that of a 17th-century Flemish town, the persons in the scene appear to be wearing southern European and some even Oriental clothes, and some women appear to be wearing masks. In spite of the intensive activity, van Eyck achieves a balance by covering the busy street with snow, thereby adding a touch of calmness and an almost wistful atmosphere to the bustling scene.Jan Carel van Eyck, Townscape in winter with carriages at Dorotheum The Prado attributes a work in its collection depicting the Fall of Phaeton to van Eyck. This is a painting from the series of paintings inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses made by various Antwerp artists after designs by Peter Paul Rubens for the King of Spain's hunting lodge.Jan Carel van Eyck, Fall of Phaeton at the Prado It is clear that this work cannot have been painted by Jan Carel van Eyck since he was not even born when this series of paintings was executed in the mid 1630s.

The Exeter & South Devon Volunteers was the premier unit of Britain's Volunteer Force. Formed in 1852 it went on to become a battalion of the Devonshire Regiment. Both its active service battalions went to garrison India on the outbreak of the First World War, and then saw action in Mesopotamia and Palestine. In the Second World War, the battalion served in the garrison of Gibraltar. It continued in the postwar Territorial Army until it was merged with other West Country units. Its successors today serve in a reserve battalion of The Rifles. Volunteer Force Part-time volunteer units had often been organised in Britain in time of war to serve in local defence and supplement the Regular Army and Militia, but these were always stood down when the threat of invasion had passed. Concerns about national defence re-emerged after Louis Napoleon seized power in France in 1851. The Militia was reorganised in 1852, but there was agitation to allow the formation of volunteer units as well. The government was unenthusiastic, but on 26 March 1852 the Home Secretary in Lord Derby's short-lived Who? Who? ministry, Spencer Horatio Walpole, did accept an offer of service arising from a meeting held in January at the Exeter Athenaeum to discuss the dangers to the Devonshire coastline. The prime movers were Dr (later Sir) John Charles Bucknill, superintendent of the Devon County Asylum at Exminster, and William Denis Moore, town clerk of Exeter, whose proposal was forwarded by the Lord Lieutenant of Devon, Earl Fortescue (who was Colonel of the 1st Devon Militia). The Exeter & South Devon Volunteer Rifle Battalion of two companies was accepted under the Volunteer Act of 1804, which was still in force. The first officers' commissions were signed by Queen Victoria on 4 January 1853, with Sir Edmund Prideaux, 9th Baronet, as Major- Commandant and Denis Moore as adjutant. The volunteers had been drilling since the summer of 1852 in the Castle Yard at Exeter, initially in civilian clothes until a uniform was decided upon.Beckett, pp. 7‚Äì16.Beckett, Appendix VII.Exeter & South Devon Rifle Corps at Devon Heritage.Frederick, pp. 86‚Äì8.4th Devons at Regiments.org.Spiers, p. 163.Westlake, pp. 62‚Äì7.London Gazette, 18 January 1853. The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following a renewed invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many new Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) across the country, and the government began to supply them with the new Enfield Rifle.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 164‚Äì8. Captain Moore of the Exeter & South Devon Rifles helped to draw up the rules governing the new corps and his unit was adopted on 23 September 1859 as the 1st (Exeter & South Devon) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps. Because of its premier position in the Volunteer Force, the unit was unofficially known as the 1st Rifle Volunteers; this became an official subtitle in 1958.Beckett, p. 24. The popularity of the Volunteers led to an increase in the number of companies in the 1st Devonshire RVC, with detachments at Exmouth, Crediton, Dawlish and Teignmouth and in 1860 it absorbed the 24th (Budleigh Salterton) Devonshire RVC. By the early 1860s the corps had 11 companies, and the 1st Devonshire Engineer Volunteer Corps at Torquay was attached to it for drill and administration from 1863 to 1869. Sir Edmund Prideaux retired from the command and was appointed Honorary Colonel on 8 February 1862, when Maj Arthur Charles Chichester was promoted to succeed him as lieutenant-colonel, and Capt Moore was promoted to major. Lord Poltimore became CO on 27 September 1865, followed by Sir William Walrond, 2nd Baronet (formerly captain in the Grenadier Guards) on 9 June 1877. A retired Regular Army major, Sir Dudley Duckworth-King, 5th Baronet, became CO on 12 December 1894.Army List, various dates.London Gazette, 14 March 1862.London Gazette, 8 June 1877. =1st Volunteer Battalion= Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' scheme introduced by the Cardwell Reforms of 1872, Volunteers were grouped into county brigades with their local Regular and Militia battalions. For the Exeter & South Devon battalion this was Brigade No 34 (County of Devon) in Western District alongside the 11th Foot, the 1st Devon Militia and the 2nd Devon Militia.Spiers, pp. 195‚Äì6. The Childers Reforms of 1881 took Cardwell's reforms further, and the Volunteers were formally affiliated to their local Regular regiment, with the 11th Foot becoming the Devonshire Regiment and the 1st Devonshire RVC becoming one of its Volunteer Battalions on 1 July 1881. The RVC changed its title on 1 November 1885 to 1st (Exeter & South Devon) Volunteer Battalion. By 1889 the battalion was distributed as follows: * Battalion headquarters (HQ) at 16 Castle Street, Exeter,Exeter at Drill Hall Project. * A‚ÄìE Companies at Exeter * F Company at Manchester House, Exmouth (Ferry Road by 1893)Exmouth at Drill Hall Project. * G Company at High Street, CreditonCrediton at Drill Hall Project. * H & I Companies at Somerset House, TeignmouthTeignmouth at Drill Hall Project. Exeter School formed a Cadet Corps affiliated to the battalion in 1897. =3rd Volunteer Battalion= While the Volunteers in Exeter formed a single large battalion, a number of smaller RVCs were being raised in the small rural towns of East Devon. In August 1860 these were formed into the 1st Administrative Battalion, Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps with its HQ also at Exeter, under the command of Lt-Col Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 11th Baronet:3rd VB at Regiments.org. * 5th (Upper Cullompton) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed 22 March 1860 at Upper Culm Vale, moved to Cullompton in 1862 * 8th (Buckerell) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed 8 February 1860 * 11th (Bampton) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed 28 February 1860, * 13th (East Devon and Honiton) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed 20 February 1860 * 14th (Tiverton) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed 1 March 1860 * 20th (Broadhembury) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed 3 March 1860; disbanded 1875 * 25th (Ottery St Mary) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed 4 April 1860 * 27th (Colyton) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed 12 December 1860 Dyke Acland was an enthusiast for the concept of Mounted Rifle Volunteers and several such units were raised in Devonshire, five by Acland himself, of which the following were attached to the 1st Admin Battalion:Beckett, pp. 70‚Äì3; Appendix X. * 1st (Clyst) Devonshire Mounted Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed at Broadclyst on 23 February 1860 by Sir Thomas Dyke Acland; commanded by his son Charles Thomas Dyke Acland from 1862; disbanded 1877Beckett, p. 275. * 2nd (Exminster) Devonshire Mounted Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed on 5 March 1860; disbanded December 1861 * 3rd (Upottery) Devonshire Mounted Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed on 10 April 1860; absorbed by 1st MRV 1872 Apart from the mounted riflemen who were generally farmers and members of hunts, the battalion recruited mainly from agricultural labourers, and in 1864 had to arrange its annual camp in July between the hay harvest and the corn harvest.Beckett, pp. 71, 75. When the RVCs were consolidated in 1880, the battalion was redesignated the 3rd Devonshire RVC and its seven component corps became A‚ÄìG Companies. It became a VB of the Devons in 1881 and was numbered as the 3rd Volunteer Battalion in 1885, when a new H Company was added at Sidmouth. In 1900 I Company was formed at Axminster and affiliated cadet corps were formed at Allhallows School, Honiton, and Blundell's School, Tiverton. Charles Williams-Troyte of Huntsham, formerly of the Royal 1st Devon Yeomanry, took command of the battalion in 1881 when Sir Thomas Dyke Acland (his uncle) became honorary colonel. Sir John Kennaway, 3rd Baronet, VD, who had raised the 25th Devonshire RVC in 1860, became CO of the 3rd VB on 12 July 1894. He later became Hon Colonel, a role he still fulfilled on the outbreak of the First World War. The 3rd VB was distributed as follows: * HQ at 7 Well Street, Exeter; moved to 4 Leighton Terrace, Exeter, by the early 1900s * A Company at Cullompton * B Company at Buckerell * C Company drill hall at Brook Street, BamptonBampton at Drill Hall Project. * D Company drill hall at Dowell Street and armoury at High Street, HonitonHoniton at Drill Hall Project. * E Company built its drill hall and armoury with associated house for the Sergeant Instructor at Newport Street, Tiverton in 1884Tiverton at Drill Hall Project. * F Company at Ottery St Mary Town HallOttery St Mary at Drill Hall Project. * G Company at Queen Street, ColytonColyton at Drill Hall Project. * H Company at Castle Hill, AxminsterAxminster at Drill Hall Project. =Mobilisation schemes= When a comprehensive mobilisation scheme for the Volunteers was established after the Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888, the 1st and 3rd VBs of the Devons were assigned to the Plymouth Brigade, charged with defending the Royal Navy's base at Plymouth. This brigade, which soon included all the VBs of the Devonshires and the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry (DCLI), was renamed the Devon Brigade in 1901 and the DCLI later moved to a different formation.Dunlop, Appendix A.Spiers, pp. 228‚Äì9. =Second Boer War= Service companies from both volunteer battalions served with the Regulars in the Second Boer War, gaining the battalions their first Battle honours: South Africa 1900‚Äì01 for the 1st VB, South Africa 1901 for the 3rd VB. After the war Lt-Col Charles Marwood Tucker (who had served in South Africa as a lieutenant in the Imperial Yeomanry), became CO of the 3rd VB. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st (Exeter & South Devon) VB amalgamated with the 3rd VB to form the 4th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment. The school cadet corps associated with the former battalions all transferred to the junior division of the Officers' Training Corps.London Gazette 20 March 1908. The new battalion was organised as follows by 1914:Conrad, British Army 1914. * Battalion HQ at Bedford Circus, Exeter * A Company: Exeter, with a detachment at BroadclystDevon Drill Stations at Drill Hall Project. * B & C Companies: Exeter * D Company: Drill Hall, St Andrews Road, Exmouth with detachments at Budleigh Salterton and Lympstone * E Company: Drill Hall being built at King Street, West Exe, Tiverton, to replace the 1884 building in Newport Street; detachment at Dulverton, SomersetDulverton at Drill Hall Project. ** Half Company: Drill Hall, Brook Street, Bampton * F Company: Sidmouth ** Left Half Company: Drill Hall, High Street, Honiton * G Company: Drill Hall, The Green Cullompton (shared with D Company, 7th (Cyclist) Bn, and part of A Squadron, Royal 1st Devon Yeomanry);Cullompton at Drill Hall Project. detachments at Burlescombe and Uffculme * H Company: Drill Hall, Silver Street, Axminster; detachments at Chardstock and at Drill Hall, Church Street, Lyme Regis, DorsetLyme Regis at Drill Hall Project. ** Left Half Company: South Street, Colyton The Exeter Cathedral School Cadet Company was also affiliated to the battalion. The battalion formed part of the Devon and Cornwall Brigade in the TF's Wessex Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 43‚Äì8.Devons at Long, Long Trail. The CO from 5 March 1913 was Lt-Col Hugh Acland Troyte of Huntsham Court, second son of the former CO of the 3rd VB. He had served as a Regular officer in the 20th Hussars from 1894 to 1898. After retiring from the army he joined his father's former battalion, taking command of the Bampton company and being instrumental in the construction of the new drill hall at Tiverton.Obituary, Western Morning News, 25 April 1918, quoted at Opusculum. First World WarMobilisation= On 26 July 1914, the Wessex Division was on Salisbury Plain, beginning its annual training. Three days later, with the international situation deteriorating, the division was warned to take 'precautionary measures'. The divisional HQ returned to Exeter and the units took up their precautionary posts, with the infantry brigades at defended ports in South West England. 4th Devons arrived at Plymouth on 4 August, on which date the division was ordered to mobilise for war. On 9 August the battalion returned to Salisbury Plain, this time under war conditions.43rd (Wessex) Division at Long, Long Trail.James, pp. 54‚Äì5. After the outbreak of war, units of the TF were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas, and absorbing the large numbers of volunteers coming forward. Later the 2nd Line TF battalions were raised to full strength ready to go overseas, and began to form Reserve (3rd Line) units to supply reinforcement drafts.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 6, 65.1/4th and 2/4th Devons in WWI at The Keep Military Museum. =1/4th Battalion=India On 24 September, the 1st Wessex Division accepted liability for service in British India to relieve Regular units for the Western Front. The division's infantry battalions and field artillery embarked at Southampton on 9 October and sailed via Gibraltar, Malta, and the Suez Canal. The Devon battalions went to Karachi, where they disembarked on 11 November. Although the 1st Wessex was officially numbered the 43rd (Wessex) Division in early 1915, it never served as a complete formation during the war: on arrival in India all its units were distributed to various garrisons. 1/4th Devons went to Ferozepore and came under the orders of 3rd Lahore Divisional Area (3rd (Lahore) Division having already sailed for the Western Front). In February 1915 it joined the independent 44th (Ferozepore) Brigade.Perry, pp. 55‚Äì7. No reinforcements reached the Wessex units during 1915, and their strength began to dwindle, made worse by the requirement to provide drafts for other theatres of war, while many of the best Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) were taken away for officer training. Modern short Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles were received during 1915, and some units went to the Mesopotamian Front. By 1916 it was clear that the complete 43rd (Wessex) Division could not be returned to the Western Front as intended, so instead training was pushed forwards in India, some drafts were received from home, and the remaining units prepared for service in Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia The 1/4th Devons arrived at Basra with 41st Indian Brigade on 2 March 1916. The brigade did duty on the Lines of Communication, moving up the Tigris during the last failed attempt to relieve the Siege of Kut. The battalion then joined 42nd Indian Brigade in April, moving in June to 37th Indian Brigade at Shaikh Said in the newly-formed 14th Indian Division. It served as the British component in the brigade composed of 1/2nd Gurkha Rifles, 36th Sikhs and 45th Rattray's Sikhs. After the fall of Kut, the British forces in Mesopotamia maintained their positions for several months. Although occasionally shelled by the Turks, the battalion's biggest enemy was disease, and during the summer of 1916 some 400 men were admitted to hospital.Moberly, Vol II, pp. 372, 406.Moberly, Vol III, pp, 7‚Äì9, 16; Appendix XXXI.Perry, pp. 134‚Äì5.Perry, 127‚Äì30. A new British offensive began on 14 December 1916 with an advance across the Hai river, then closing in on Kut. On 1 February 1917 37th Brigade attacked the Hai Salient with 35th and 45th Sikhs, but they were driven back to their starting positions. A fresh attack by the 1/4th Devons and 1/2nd Gurkhas was cancelled because of the Sikh wounded congesting the trenches. 14th Division intended to renew its attack next day, but mist prevented artillery observation, so it was postponed to 3 February. A 10.40, after 10 minutes' intense artillery preparation, the two fresh battalions attacked, 1/4th Devons on the left in eight waves on a frontage of . They advanced 'with great dash' and within 10 minute had captured the two Turkish trench lines that comprised their objective. Several Turkish counter-attacks were broken up by artillery and rifle fire, the Devons and Gurkhas being reinforced by the 62nd Punjabis. The victory came at a price: out of 15 officers and 403 other ranks of the Devons who attacked, only five officers and 186 men came out unscathed; the battalion's total casualties in the battle amounted to 283.Moberly, Vol III, pp. 76, 118‚Äì23. It was the battalion's only major action: later in the month the reduced battalion was transferred to Corps Troops at Amarah for the Tigris defences and to work on the Lines of Communication. The survivors spent the rest of the war building roads, guarding prisoners and administering refugee camps. Moberly, Vol III, p. 155; Appendix XXXIX. Lieutenant-Colonel Acland Troyte left for the UK on sick leave, and after recovering was sent to command a 'sub-area' behind the lines on the Western Front. He later served on the staff of IX Corps which went with the British Force sent to the Italian Front. The Corps HQ was back in France at the time of the German Spring Offensive; Lt-Col Acland Troyte was killed on 17 April 1918, and buried at Berguette Churchyard.CWGC record. When the Mesopotamian campaign ended with the Armistice of Mudros on 31 October 1918, 1/4th Devons was at Baqubah, north-east of Baghdad. It was demobilised on 28 August 1919. Commanding officers The following officers commanded 1/4th Bn during the war:Devons at Infantry Battalion COs. * Lt-Col Hugh Leonard Acland-Troyte, from mobilisation until invalided 15 July 1917 * Lt-Col Colin Percy Tremlett, from 15 July 1917 to end of war =2/4th Battalion=India The 2/4th Battalion Devonshire Regiment was formed at Exeter on 16 September 1914 as the 1/4th Bn was preparing to go overseas, and became part of the 2nd Devon & Cornwall Brigade in 2nd Wessex Division. It was quickly decided to send this division to India as well, where it could replace further Regular units and continue its training. It embarked at Southampton on 12 December, arriving early in January 1915. Like the 43rd, the 45th (2nd Wessex) Division (as it was later numbered), never served together, and its units were immediately distributed to peacetime stations across India. The 2/4th Devons joined Southern Brigade, 9th (Secunderabad) Division, which was carrying out internal security duties in southern India.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 55‚Äì60.45th (2nd Wessex) Division at Long, Long Trail.Perry, pp 105‚Äì10. 2/4th Devons remained in Madras, training and despatching drafts to the 1/4th Bn in Mesopotamia and for miscellaneous duties all over India. As with the 43rd, it became clear in 1916 that the 45th (2nd Wessex) Division could not be reformed as intended, and its units were progressively detached to active fronts. On 15 October 1917 the 2/4th Devons sailed from Bombay for Egypt, arriving at Suez on 25 October. Palestine At first the battalion was employed on Line of Communication duties at Qantara, but on 13 December 1917 at Ramla in Palestine it joined 234th Brigade in 75th Division. This formation had been created mainly from British TF units arriving from India with a few Indian battalions. The division had already seen a good deal of action at the Third Battle of Gaza and the operations that led to the Capture of Jerusalem.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 123‚Äì30.Falls, Vol II, Pt I, p. 355. 2/4th Devons took over and extended the line at Deir Ballut on 14 March 1918, holding the position until the end of the month. It suffered more casualties from disease than from Turkish fire. 75th Division attacked on 9 April during the Action of Berukin, with 234th Brigade aiming capturing 'Three Bushes Hill' after a stiff fight. But the division could not press on, and Three Bushes Hill was evacuated on 21 April.Falls, Vol II, Pt I, pp. 353‚Äì7. 75th Division was reorganised on the lines of an Indian division in the summer of 1918, releasing surplus British troops to bring other units up to strength and later for service on the Western Front. 2/4th Devons left for Egypt in July and the battalion was disbanded on 17 August 1918 at Wadi Ballut in Egypt, with the men being drafted elsewhere. Commanding officers The following officers commanded 2/4th Bn: * Lt-Col Charles Marwood-Tucker, from 23 September 1914 to 19 March 1918 * Lt-Col Cecil Edward Rice, 19 March until invalided 5 April 1918 * Maj Douglas Henry Avory, acting 5 to 30 April 1918 * Lt-Col John Nicolson Macrae, 1 May to 12 July 1918 * Lt-Col John Robert Birchall, from 12 July 1917 to end of war =3/4th Battalion= The 3/4th Battalion Devonshire Regiment was formed at Exeter on 23 March 1915 and in the autumn it went with the other 3rd Line battalions of the Devons to Bournemouth. It was renamed the 4th (Reserve) Battalion on 8 April 1916, and when the Training Reserve (TR) was formed on 1 September it absorbed the 5th (Reserve) (Prince of Wales's) and 6th (Reserve) battalions of the regiment at Hursley Park, Winchester. The battalion, with an establishment of 2085 men under training, now formed part of the Wessex Reserve Brigade in Southern Command.Army Council Instruction 1528 of August 1916 (Appendix 135). By March 1917 the battalion was training on Salisbury Plain, first at Sutton Veny, then in early 1918 at Larkhill. In April 1918 it left the Wessex Reserve Brigade and was sent to Ireland, where it was stationed at various times at Belfast, Derry and Clonmany, County Donegal. The battalion was disbanded on 27 August 1919 at Randalstown. Commanding officers The following officers commanded 3/4th Bn: *Capt Eric George Cardew from 25 March to 20 October 1915 * Lt-Col Arthur Graves Spratt from 1 November 1915 to 4 July 1916 * Lt-Col Nathaniel Robert Radcliffe from 4 July 1916 to end of war =15th Battalion= In February 1915 the remaining Home Service and unfit men were separated from the Second and Third Line Battalions to form brigades of Coast Defence Battalions (termed Provisional Battalions from June 1915). The men from the five TF battalions of the Devons and DCLI were formed into the Devon and Cornwall Brigade Provisional Battalion, later designated 86th Provisional Battalion, as part of 10th Provisional Brigade.15th Devons at The Keep Military Museum.David Porter's work on Provisional Brigades at Great War Forum. By July 1916 the brigade was at Herne Bay in Kent under the command of Southern Army of Central Force.Distribution of Northern and Southern Armies (Home Defence), The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 33/765.Army Council Instruction 221 of January 1916 (Appendix 18). The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The Provisional Brigades thus became anomalous, and on 1 January 1917 the remaining battalions became numbered battalions of their parent units: 86th Provisional Bn became 15th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment, and 10th Provisional Brigade became the 227th Mixed Brigade. Part of these units' role alongside the TR units was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. The brigade never served overseas: it moved to Aldeburgh in 1918 and was attached to 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division. The battalion was commanded by Lt-Col Albert Edward Kirk from 1 January 1917 to the end of the war. It was disbanded on 12 June 1919 at Aldingham Camp, Lancashire. Interwar The TF was reformed on 7 February 1920 and reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) the following year. As before, the 4th Devons were in 130th (Devon and Cornwall) Brigade in 43rd (Wessex) Division. In the 1920s the Exeter Cadet Battalion and The King's School, Ottery St Mary, cadet company were affiliated to the battalion.Titles & Designations 1927. After the Munich Crisis in late 1938 the TA was doubled in size, and once again its units formed duplicates. The 4th Battalion's duplicate was the 8th Battalion (taking the number of the regiment's first 'Kitchener's Army' battalion in World War I), which was formed on 25 May 1939 at Yelverton. Second World WarMobilisation= The TA's infantry units mobilised on 1 September 1939, two days before war was declared. At the time of mobilisation the duplicate 45th Division was still being organised, so both 1st and 2nd Line units were administered by 43rd (Wessex) Division HQ. 4th and 8th Devons were therefore both serving in 134th Brigade, together with the 6th Battalion. 45th Division HQ assumed control of the brigade on 7 September, and it spent the Phoney War period training in its West Country home area under Southern Command.Joslen, p. 320.Joslen, pp. 73‚Äì4.Collier, Map 5. =4th Battalion=Gibraltar On 17 May 1940, just as the Battle of France was under way, 4th Devons left 45th Division and sailed to Gibraltar, landing on 30 May to reinforce the garrison of this vital base in view of tensions with Italy (which entered the war on 11 June). Gibraltar suffered bombing raids from both the Italian and Vichy French air forces, and Human torpedo attacks against shipping, but no land attacks, despite the Germans planning Operation Felix to take the Rock with Spanish support.Joslen, p. 553.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 83, 142‚Äì3, 215, 240, 253.Playfair, Vol II, p. 272. Rankin, pp. 220, 265‚Äì78, 295‚Äì9, 336‚Äì46, 503‚Äì19. On 24 April 1941 4th Devons came under the command of 2nd Gibraltar Brigade.Joslen, p. 448. Home Defence Having spent almost three years in the fortress, the battalion left 2nd Gibraltar Bde on 24 April 1943 and by the end of the year was back with 134th Bde in Home Forces in the UK. By now 45th Division had been placed on a lower establishment and was not expected to go overseas. On 3 April 1944 4th Devons transferred within the division to 135th Bde, but this was disbanded on 20 July as men were drained away to reinforce units fighting in Normandy. 4th Devons transferred back to 134th Bde, but this was also due to be disbanded with the rest of 45th Division, so on 1 August it moved to 164th Bde in 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. This was a 1st Line division that had been brought back from Northern Ireland and placed on a higher establishment. But it too was destined not to see any service before the war ended. Both the division and the brigade were demobilised after VE Day, leaving 4th Devons to transfer to 183rd Bde in 61st Division, which was reorganising as a light division.Joslen, p. 321.Joslen, pp. 90‚Äì1, 95‚Äì6, 352, 358. =8th Battalion= 8th Devonshires had remained with 45th Division when the 4th Battalion went to Gibraltar. It had been stationed in the prime invasion area of the Sussex Coast while the Battle of Britain raged overhead.Collier, Maps 6 and 17. By the Spring of 1941 it was in GHQ Reserve in the Midlands, but at the end of the year the division's role was reduced as it was placed on a lower establishment.Collier, Map 20 8th Devons left 134th Bde on 3 January 1943, transferring to 203rd Bde in 77th (Reserve) Division. 77th Division was later downgraded further to a 'Holding' division and on 2 November 1943 the battalion transferred to 211th Bde in 80th (Reserve) Division , a reinforcement training formation, until July 1944.Joslen, pp. 100, 103, 366, 374. The battalion was placed in suspended animation on 10 December 1944. Postwar When the TA began reforming on 1 January 1947 the 4th Battalion was still on active service. It was placed in suspended animation on 28 February 1947 and reformed the next day (1 March), re-absorbing the 8th Bn. Battalion HQ and A & B Companies were at Exeter once more, C Company at Tiverton and D Company at Honiton. It now formed part of 130 (West Country) Infantry Bde in 43rd (Wessex) Division.Devon & Dorsets at British Army 1945 onwards.Watson, TA 1947. On 15 May 1950 all three of the Devonshire Regiment's TA battalions ‚Äì 4th, 5th (Prince of Wales's), and 628 Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (formerly 6th Bn) ‚Äì merged into a single 4th Battalion (though many of the AA gunners went to 296th (Royal Devon Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery). 5th Battalion was represented by a company at Plymouth and 6th Bn by a company at Barnstaple.Frederick, pp. 1003, 1026. When the Devonshire Regiment and the Dorset Regiment merged in 1958 to create the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, the TA battalion was redesignated the Devonshire Regiment (1st Rifle Volunteers), making official the 1st Rifle Volunteers title that it had unofficially used for many years. In 1967 the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) and the battalion was reconstituted as two units at Exeter: * HQ Company (Devon), Wessex Volunteers, in TAVR II * C Squadron, The Devonshire Territorials (Royal Devon Yeomanry/1st Rifle Volunteers) in TAVR III The TAVR was further reorganised in 1969, when the TAVR III element was reduced to a cadre and then reconstituted as D (Royal Devon Yeomanry/1st Rifle Volunteers) Squadron, Royal Wessex Yeomanry, at Barnstaple. In 1974 the '1st Rifle Volunteers' subtitle s dropped and that lineage ended. Meanwhile, the TAVR II element reorganised 1970‚Äì71 as E Company (Devon), 1st Battalion, Wessex Volunteers, at Exeter with platoons at Plymouth and Barnstaple. The Wessex Volunteers became the 1st Battalion, Wessex Regiment (Rifle Volunteers) in 1972. However, in 1987, E Company was separated and expanded to form 4th (Volunteer) Battalion, The Devonshire and Dorset Regiment (1st Rifle Volunteers), with the following organisation:. * HQ at Wyvern Barracks, Exeter * A Company at Plymouth * B Company raised at Paignton in 1988, reduced to Paignton platoon in HQ Company in 1992 * C Company at Dorchester and Poole, Dorset, transferred from 2nd Bn Wessex Regiment (Volunteers) in 1990 * D Company at Poole, transferred from 2nd Bn Wessex Regiment (Volunteers) in 1992 In the further reductions to the TA in 1999, 4th (V) Bn amalgamated with 6th (V) Bn, The Light Infantry and part of 2nd (V) Bn, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment to form The Rifle Volunteers, to which it contributed E (Devonshire and Dorset Regiment) Company by amalgamation of HQ and A Companies. In 2005 the company's subtitle was altered to 'Devonshire and Dorset Light Infantry', and in 2007 The Rifle Volunteers became 6th Battalion, The Rifles. Uniforms The uniform of the Exeter & South Devon Volunteers was Rifle green with black facings. The 1st Admin Battalion wore Volunteer grey with green facings. The 1st and 3rd VBs kept these colours. Indeed, a War Office Colour Committee in 1883 recommended the grey uniform of the 3rd as the pattern for the new service dress for the whole army to replace the traditional scarlet; in the event the army chose Indian Khaki.Beckett, p. 202. After the Second Boer War the 3rd VB adopted 'Drab' (light khaki) for its uniform, as popularised by the Imperial Yeomanry (in which their CO had served). The 4th Battalion retained its Rifle green full dress until 1914 even when the other TF battalions adopted the scarlet uniform with Lincoln green facings of the Devonshires. However, by the time it was reformed in the 1920s scarlet and Lincoln green were listed for the increasingly rare full dress uniform. Honorary Colonels Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, Bt, CO and later Hon Colonel, 3rd Volunteer Battalion. The following served as Honorary Colonel of the battalions: 1st (Exeter & South Devon) Battalion * Sir Edmund Prideaux, 9th Baronet, former CO, appointed 8 February 1862 * William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon, appointed 2 June 1877 * Gen Sir Redvers Buller, VC, GCB, KCMG, appointed 4 May 1892 3rd Volunteer Battalion * Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 11th Baronet, former CO, appointed 17 August 1881, died 1898 * Sir John Kennaway, 3rd Baronet, VD, former CO, appointed 31 December 1902, continued with 4th Battalion (TF) 4th Battalion * Charles Marwood Tucker, former CO, appointed 29 July 1920 * Colin Percy Tremlett, CBE, TD, former CO, appointed 29 July 1925, still in post in 1939 * Godfrey Charles Wycisk, OBE, TD, from 5th (PoW) Battalion, 1950 * Dennis Argent Bulllock, OBE, from 628 Heavy AA Regiment, appointed 5 August 1951 Devonshire Regiment (1st Rifle Volunteers) * John Nevill Oliver, CBE, TD, appointed 28 September 1958 * Alfred William Anstey, TD, appointed 28 September 1963, to 1967 Memorials In 1895 the 1st Devonshire VB erected a memorial in Northernhay Gardens, Exeter, to commemorate the formation of the Exeter & South Devon Volunteers. The memorial comprises a small Renaissance pillar by local sculptor Harry Hems, with plaque recording the names of the first officers commissioned, the committee responsible for its formation, and the list of places from which the first recruits were drawn: Exeter, Cullompton, Tiverton, Bovey Tracey, Exmouth, Honiton, Brixham, Torquay and Totnes. There is a stone plaque in the Devonshire Regiment Chapel in Exeter Cathedral commemorating the men of 1/4th, 2/4th and 3/4th Devons who died in India, Mesopotamia, Palestine and elsewhere during the First World War.IWM WMR ref 25227.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to stop the Chronicoms from unraveling history in the 1970s. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by Iden Bagdadchi and directed by Stan Brooks. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward. The episode moves to the mid-1970s, bringing with it guest star Enver Gjokaj who reprised his role of Daniel Sousa from the MCU series Agent Carter in the previous two episodes. Neal Bledsoe also returns as Wilfred Malick, while Patrick Warburton reprises his role as Rick Stoner from season five. Following changes made to the timeline, the episode depicts events from the MCU film Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) taking place in the 1970s. \\"A Trout in the Milk\\" originally aired on ABC on June 24, 2020, and was watched by 1.37 million viewers. It received positive reviews for its use of events from The Winter Soldier and other Marvel references. Plot Landing in 1973, the agents return to the speakeasy to figure out the Chronicoms' latest plan while Daniel Sousa adjusts to the new time period, only to discover from General Rick Stoner that Wilfred Malick, who should have died in 1970, is leading S.H.I.E.L.D. in preparing Project Insight, which should not have been developed for several more decades. Wilfred and the Chronicoms attempt to capture the agents, but Daisy Johnson takes the former's son, Nathaniel, hostage to facilitate their escape. Unbeknownst to her, Nathaniel sees her using her powers. The agents reunite with Enoch and return to their mobile headquarters, Zephyr One, to stop Project Insight, believing they have time to do so. Without warning however, the Chronicoms jump forward to 1976, when Project Insight is set to launch, causing Zephyr One to follow them. The aliens also confront Wilfred regarding his saving Nathaniel over destroying S.H.I.E.L.D., though they become inspired to use their enemies' emotions against them. With no other options left, Johnson and Sousa hack the Lighthouse's security system while Phil Coulson and Melinda May infiltrate the S.H.I.E.L.D. base to plant explosives. Concurrently, Deke Shaw and Elena \\"Yo- Yo\\" Rodriguez confront Wilfred, who reveals the Chronicoms knew they were going to try and destroy the Lighthouse before Deke kills him. Despite this, he and Yo-Yo discover too late that the Chronicoms have captured Director Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie's parents and imprisoned them in the Lighthouse. In response, Mack aborts the detonation, allowing Insight to launch. The team uses Zephyr One to destroy Insight, giving away their location as Chronicom leader Sibyl predicted while Coulson and May are arrested. Meanwhile, after capturing Johnson and Sousa, Nathaniel attempts to acquire Hydra scientist Daniel Whitehall's research on transplanting superhuman powers to others. ProductionDevelopment= After the sixth season finale of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. aired in August 2019, showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell revealed that the seventh season would feature the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later that month, one of the season's episodes was revealed to be titled \\"A Trout in the Milk\\" and written by Iden Bagdadchi. It was confirmed to be the fifth episode of the season in June 2020, when Stan Brooks was revealed to have directed it. While creating the episode, the writers researched the opening credit sequences of 1970s crime series, ultimately finding the opening of The Streets of San Francisco. The episode they found was named \\"A Trout in the Milk\\", which led to this episode being named similarly. To prepare for the episode, Brooks watched the film Saturday Night Fever (1977) and \\"a lot of 70s TV\\" including Mannix, The Streets of San Francisco, Columbo, and Cannon. =Writing= Enver Gjokaj said it was fun to portray Daniel Sousa in the 1970s and reacting to the new time period. He added that having Sousa be out of his time would give \\"some clarity\\" to his Marvel Cinematic Universe history and the status of his relationship with Peggy Carter. The episode also shows Sousa \\"struggling to be a part of the team, or S.H.I.E.L.D., and go from being at the top of the S.H.I.E.L.D. organization in his time to not really having a clue what‚Äôs going on in this time.\\" Some of the decisions Sousa makes are in service of his original mission to take down Hydra, and \\"feeling allegiance\\" to his own time. =Casting= Patrick Warburton returns to guest star as Rick Stoner in the episode With the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. Series star Clark Gregg also returns as his character Phil Coulson, portraying a Life Model Decoy version of the character in the seventh season. In August 2019, Patrick Warburton was revealed to be returning for the final season after appearing as Rick Stoner earlier in the series, guest starring in \\"A Trout in the Milk\\". Also guest starring are Joel Stoffer as Enoch, Tobias Jelinek as Luke, Neal Bledsoe as Wilfred Malick, and Gjokaj reprising his Agent Carter role as agent Daniel Sousa, all returning from earlier episodes of the season. Cameron Palatas reprises his role as a young Gideon Malick from the third season, while Thomas E. Sullivan takes on the role of Nathaniel Malick who was portrayed by Joel Dabney Courtney in the third season. They are joined by Dawan Owens as agent Ford, Sedale Threatt Jr. as John Mackenzie, and Paulina Bugembe as Lila Mackenzie. =Design=Costumes Jessica Torok joined the series as costume designer alongside Whitney Galitz beginning with this episode, ahead of Galitz leaving the series to give birth to her daughter. The 1970s blue S.H.I.E.L.D. jumpsuits are a reference to the uniforms worn by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in Marvel Comics from the 1960s and 1970s. Though the comics versions had \\"a darker shade of blue\\" and were \\"more skintight\\", the episode versions had a S.H.I.E.L.D. logo patch on the left shoulder, white bands on the right arm, and a white belt and gun holster, similarly to the comics counterpart. Torok's designs for the jumpsights also took inspiration from real life 1970s jumpsuits. Brooks specifically requested the red Adidas tracksuit for Deke \\"because there's nothing more iconic to 70s\\". Title sequence \\"A Trout in the Milk\\" features a 1970s-themed opening, continuing the decade-themed opening for each episode in the season. This opening was the first in the series' history to include \\"actual opening credits\\". These feature voiceover introductions for the actors, over clips from past seasons, including: Coulson with his car Lola (which has not been \\"seen on the show in years\\") from \\"The Asset\\"; May from \\"Face My Enemy\\" during her fight against Agent 33; Daisy Johnson's \\"fierce entrance\\" from \\"Laws of Nature\\"; Mack with his shotgun-axe from \\"Ascension\\"; and Yo-Yo's first appearance in \\"Bouncing Back\\". Clips of Jemma Simmons and Deke smiling are also included. Brooks was shown a few options the producers were thinking of for the opening before he started shooting, and once they settled on the version they would go with, Brooks storyboarded the sequence. It was originally planned to have all stock footage from past seasons in the opening, but there was an issue with the Screen Actors Guild, necessitating some clips to be shot for it, such as Henstridge's. The sequence was designed and created by the series' post production supervisor, Daniel Spilatro. Jamie Jirak of ComicBook.com called this opening \\"next level\\", while Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club described it as \\"delightful\\". Bam! Smack! Pow!s Wesley Cobrun felt the opening was \\"outstanding\\" and likened it to the opening sequence of the 1970s television series Wonder Woman, but with the font from the series M*A*S*H. =Filming= The episode was shot in mid-April 2019, with the scenes on the New York City streets filming on the Warner Bros. backlot. The opening shot of the episode was a homage to Saturday Night Fever. Director Stan Brooks utilized many filming techniques from the 1970s, such as snap zooms and whip pans, to make the episode feel like a 1970s television series. =Visual effects= The standout visual effects sequence from the episode for visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack and many fans of the series depicted a hatch opening underwater to reveal a rocket silo for launching \\"Project Insight\\", all created through computer-generated imagery. Kolpack first created storyboards of the sequence, before designing the rocket with his team; the design was based on actual rockets from the \\"1970s era\\", including Apollo 11. Extensive research was done on actual rockets to depict the launch accurately, down to \\"the deflected flames that then transitioned to the huge plume of smoke\\". Long simulations were run to create the water pouring into the silo from outside the hatch, while the shot where the hatch first opens under the water was even more difficult. Creating the correct amount of mist coming off the water was also a challenge. =Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins= \\"Project Insight\\", a major plot point in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), is featured heavily, due to the Chronicoms altering the timeline so its deployment is 40 years sooner than established in the films. Like in The Winter Soldier, \\"Project Insight\\" is targeting high-level assets, such as Bruce Banner, Peggy Carter, Victoria Hand, Nick Fury, Robert Gonzales, Jim Morita, and Isabelle Hartley. Other names were also included in the episode as Easter eggs, including other characters who have appeared in the series or comics. Roger Dooley, the SSR New York chief from Agent Carter, is also referenced in the episode. Release \\"A Trout in the Milk\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on June 24, 2020. ReceptionRatings= In the United States the episode received a 0.2 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.2 percent of all households in that demographic. It was watched by 1.37 million viewers. The 0.2 percent share was the lowest for the series. Within a week of release, \\"A Trout in the Milk\\" was watched by 2.42 million viewers. =Critical response= Christian Houlb of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a \\"B-\\". Speaking to the use of \\"Project Insight\\" in the episode, Houlb said while the MCU connections in the series \\"have faded a bit in recent years\\", he enjoyed \\"this direct callback. Plus, critics have often compared The Winter Soldier to '70s conspiracy thrillers like The Parallax View (1974), so it is fun to imagine its plot happening in the actual '70s.\\" Cinema Blends Laura Hurley felt it was \\"pretty funny\\" that the series \\"just destroyed the premise of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, when The Winter Soldier totally blew up the premise of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. halfway through S.H.I.E.L.D.s first season\\". Trent Moore at Syfy Wire called the inclusion of \\"Project Insight\\" a \\"great callback to the film universe, and a truly organic one.\\" He continued saying that \\"If the Chronicoms really want to help Hydra stamp out S.H.I.E.L.D., what better way than accelerating their eventual plan as laid out in the films?\\" In his review of the episode, Alex McLevy from The A.V. Club said \\"The return of Project Insight was such an inventive way to combine S.H.I.E.L.D.s latest enemies and its oldest ones, it's a shame it ended up just being a one-off premise, albeit one that created a real cliffhanger for the episode.\\" He added that the wrinkles introduced by the Chronicoms, such as keeping Wilfred and Nathaniel Malick alive, \\"helps the show keep fresh a formula that might otherwise begin feeling a little too pat.\\" However, McLevy felt the series was \\"still dragging its heels\\" regarding Leo Fitz and Simmons, despite Simmons having \\"some moments of real significance\\" in the episode. Overall, he gave the episode a \\"B-\\". Giving the episode 4.5 stars out of 5, Michael Ahr at Den of Geek exclaimed the \\"sheer depth of the Marvel references\\" in the episode \\"distinguishes it from all others before it\\", calling \\"A Trout in the Milk\\" an \\"excellent\\" episode. Wesley Coburn at Bam! Smack! Pow! called the episode \\"the first real filler episode of the season\\" adding there were \\"too much uncomfortable possibly-romantic pairing of characters\\", and gave it a \\"B-\\".

Lieutenant Colonel Satchit Samser Rana was in charge of the mission from the Nepal Army in this operation. Historic Background While Dalai Lama was in Tibet, he was strengthening his military by training and equipping his soldiers, these soldiers were called Khampa in the Tibetan language. When Dalai Lama fled to India, some Khampas led by Gey Wangdi started to migrate down in the adjoining Nepal-Tibet border and started anti-China activities. Khampas were supported by the Indian government as well. Around that time, Indian troops were also deployed in Nepal-China border areas. They provided military intelligence and other guidance to the Khampas. Meanwhile, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)was also supporting the guerrilla movement in Tibet. This activity was against the foreign policy of Nepal. Due to security risks, the government of China made an agreement with the Nepal government to control Khampa activities. After the agreement, Nepal decided to conduct a disarming operation against Khampas. The ‚ÄòReconnaissance Team‚Äô of Nepal Army found that nearly 9000 Khampas armed with adequate weapons, bullets and explosives had set up camp in Kesang located near Nilgiri Himalayan Mountains. The disarming mission In 1974, King Birendra issued an order to peacefully disarm the Khampas settled in Mustang, bring them near Pokhara and prohibit them from proceeding toward China. Accordingly, Nepali troops moved toward Pokhara on July 15, 1974 for the initial preparation. Shreenath Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Satchit Samser Rana was in charge for the mission. Brigade headquarters was set up in Jomson and the mission was started. Nepal Army made contact with Gey Wangdi, the leader of Khampas, to surrender and hand over the weapons. They were also promised to be given Nepali Citizenship, land and money. Initially, the rebels agreed and the date of handover was fixed for July 20, 1974 but the date was extended to July 26 upon request from Khampas. Khampas demanded additional time yet again and agreed to hand over the entire weaponry at midnight of July 31. But they did not surrender. Once the deadline was over, Nepal Army conducted an intensive search at Kesang camp from August 1, 1974. Various kinds of weapons and ammunition were found buried under the ground and they were seized. Similarly, search operations was done in Chhusang, Samar, Ghiling and Dhami. Gey Wangdi was not captured. He was en route to India. After a few days, the Army received the message from the local administration that the team of Gey Wangdi was crossing the border from Nepalgunj. Gey Wangdi fell in ambush at Tinkarlipu, Doti on September 15, 1974 while trying to attach Nepal Police Post.

It deals mostly with Alamkara-Shastra (rhetoric) and Rasa, and is claimed to have been authored by Raja Bhoja, the king of Paramara dynasty in the early 11th century A.D. A large extent of this magnum opus is dedicated to Sringara Rasa, which according to Bhoja's theory: \\"is the only one Rasa admissible.\\" Overview A specialist on the subject, Sivaprasad Bhattacharya, considered Sringara Prakasa as the most \\"detailed and provocative\\" discourse on Rasa. Some have argued, however, that no Sanskrit literature was developed after Abhinavagupta's Rasa literature - Abhinavabharati. But scholars such as V Raghavan and Sheldon Pollock disagree with this view and assert that Bhojadevs's Sringara Prakasa can be considered as an equally profound Sanskrit literature as Abhinavaguptas' Abhinavabharati. Carl Olson translated the title as \\"Revelation of Love\\" and described it as an expression of self-love, which according to Bhoja, was a much higher and most often expressed form of emotion in the world. He further interprets the poetry as an emotion of love which refines the human ego Ahamkara and develops self-consciousness Abhimana in a person. According to P.V.Kane, Sringara Prakasa can be considered as an encyclopaedia of various branches in Sanskrit literature such as Darsanas, poetry, and dramaturgy, written extensively by quoting numerous works which existed in that period. Translations Though many scholars have attempted to translate this magnum opus of Raja Bhojadeva, Sheldon Pollock's and Dr. V Raghavan's works are considered as dominant interpretations. Pollock notes that in spite of the fact that the Sringara Prakasa is so relevant in the current time because of its content and its similarity with existing Sanskrit literature including its organization and style, it had not attracted much attention except in South India and Bengal. During the mid-20th century, there were claims of only four incomplete manuscripts available, out of which two were transcripts of a third one. But, V. Raghavan's translated commentary based on the fourth manuscript is considered valuable among scholars even today. The Cantos This work of Bhoja is different from his other, smaller works such as Sarasvatƒ´-ka·πá·π≠habhara·πáa. The name Sringara Prakasa bears significance as it attempts to deal with Sringara Rasa of Ahamkara and Abhimana. In chapter I, Bhoja talks about Rasa as the \\"greatest element by virtue\\", and thus, men are called Rasikas accordingly. This is invoked through Kavya drama and poetry. There, Bhoja refers to Bhamaha and attempts to unite the two by calling them \\"‡§∂‡§¨‡•ç‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡•ã ‡§∏‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡•å ‡§ï‡§æ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ\\": Poetry is word (Sabda) and sense (Artha) united. Most of the content in chapter I-VI deals with grammar, word, sense, and Sahitya. Chapters VII-VIII deal with the relationship between Sabda and Artha, and defining Sahitya by dividing it into Sabda and Artha. Chapter IX deals with poetical relations with Sahitya, whereas chapter X is primarily about different kinds of Alamkaras. In chapter XI, Bhoja calls his work as \\"Sahitya-Prakasa\\" and gives more importance to Rasa by saying: \\"A poetry may be as much flawless by adopting Alamkara, but every poet should pay apt attention to the Rasa, as it is the greatest factor of beauty and in the absence of it, all other beauties are in vain.\\" In chapter XII, Rasa, as well as the structure of drama are discussed. Chapter XIII classifies Ahamkara- Sringar into four: Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksa and briefly describes the activities to be fulfilled to achieve the four purusharthas. The rest of this voluminous works deals with Rasas, the greatest Sahitya of Sabda and Artha in Kavya.

The company is named after its co- founder Mr Charles JG Church who established the business in 1965. After a series of complex restructurings and takeovers, the company has been a subsidiary of Persimmon plc since 2001. HistoryFoundation= A 1980s Charles Church housing estate at Martins Heron in Bracknell Charles Church was founded by Mr Charles JG Church and his wife Mrs Susanna B Church in 1965 as a luxurious residential developer in south-east England. It built one house in Camberley, Surrey and then used the proceeds to build four more houses before expanding further. It built its reputation on building top quality new homes to the highest standards, successfully growing during the late 1960s and 1970s. Land Development Studies Education Trust (Great Britain): Journal of Property Research, Volume 9 (1992) The company's rate of expansion grew during the 1980s. It had operations in residential developments, general construction, commercial properties as well as having operations in America. By 1985, the housebuilding arm consisted of three divisions, South East, Southern and Chiltern.Charles Church Developments Ltd Annual Report 1985 It built on sites ranging from just one plot to up to 400 plots. It expanded into the London market in January 1987.Charles Church Developments plc Annual Report 1987 In April 1987 the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange, as Charles Church Developments plc, to further its expansion. At the time, the Church family retained over 80% of the firm's shares. Mr Church was Chairman and Mrs Church was Quality Control Director.Charles Church Developments plc Annual Report 1987 Land Development Studies Education Trust (Great Britain): Journal of Property Research, Volume 9 (1992) The company acquired County Homes in August 1987 to expand into Essex. Charles Church Developments plc Annual Report 1987 It started building retirement homes in 1988.Charles Church Developments plc Annual Report 1988 On 25 May 1989, just over two years after the company's public floatation, Charles Church Developments plc was taken private and de-listed from the London Stock Exchange by Charles Church Holdings plc, a company controlled by the Church family.Charles Church Developments plc Scheme of Arrangement 1989 Land Development Studies Education Trust (Great Britain): Journal of Property Research, Volume 9 (1992) On 1 July 1989, the company's co-founder and Chairman, Mr Charles JG Church, was killed in a plane crash at the age of 44. The Supermarine Spitfire aircraft which he was flying crashed on trying to land at Blackbushe Airport. He was one of the 200 richest people in the United Kingdom with a fortune of ¬£140 million. He was survived by his wife Mrs Susanna B Church, two daughters and one son. =Restructuring= Following the death of Mr Church, Mrs Church assumed the role of Chairman. In the subsequent recession, the company suffered under the debts taken on when it was taken private by the Church family. The debts were restructured on 30 August 1991 and the company came under the control of its creditors, whereby if Charles Church met certain financial targets, control would pass back to the company's directors, i.e. the Chairman Mrs Church and her family.Charles Church Developments plc Annual Report 1991 However, the company went through another financial restructuring during 1994, with the holding company becoming The Charles Church Group Limited. Mrs Church retired from the company on 29 June 1994 as a result of this reorganisation.Charles Church Developments plc Annual Report 1994 Charles Church's lead creditor, Royal Bank of Scotland, bought out the other syndicate of banks for ¬£22.6 million and became the sole owner of the company on 14 March 1996.Charles Church Holdings plc Annual Report 1996 =Subsequent takeovers= On 13 May 1996 Beazer Group plc, then the UK's third largest housebuilder, paid ¬£35.7 million for Charles Church, including ¬£3 million goodwill for the \\"Charles Church\\" brand name. Under Beazer's ownership, Charles Church grew from being a regional housebuilder in the south east of England to a nationwide residential developer throughout the United Kingdom. In 2001 Beazer was taken over by Persimmon plc who retained the ¬£37 million \\"Charles Church\\" brand name for its most upmarket homes. Operations The company currently operates throughout the United Kingdom. It builds a full range of homes from one bedroom apartments to six bedroom luxury detached houses. The company's original headquarters Charles Church House in Knoll Road, Camberley, Surrey is still used by Persimmon today as the company's office for the Thames Valley division of both Persimmon and Charles Church, and the building has since been re-named Persimmon House. Criticism Since the takeover by Persimmon, Charles Church's practices and processes have been integrated with those of Persimmon, thus reducing its quality control as a consequence. Some Charles Church homes are now re-branded Persimmon house types with higher specification fittings. In 2014, Mr Church's son Mr Charles N Church criticised Persimmon for reducing the quality of Charles Church branded homes, saying that his father would be very upset by the homes built under his name today. In popular culture Harry Potter film series One of the most well known Charles Church housing estates is located in Martins Heron in Bracknell, Berkshire. The area lies within the former parkland and grounds of a mansion, Martins Herne (or Heron), built around 1750 but demolished in the early 1980s, which was associated with minor nobility for much of its life, including the 18th-century British general, William Gordon. The house made way for a small estate of mainly large detached houses.Charles Church Developments plc Annual Report 1985 It is the site of Harry Potter's uncle and aunt's house. The filmed version of the first of JK Rowling's famous stories, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was filmed partly on location. The external scenes with the actor Daniel Radcliffe playing Harry Potter at his house were shot on location at a house in Picket Post Close, Martins Heron. However, according to the documentary Creating the World of Harry Potter, logistics made this location impractical as a long-term filming location, so a portion of the street was recreated on the backlot of Leavesden Film Studios.

It was dedicated to Emperor Frederick III and printed in Rome by Hermann Scheuss. It developed the ideas set out in his earlier Ars Magnesia and argued that the universe is governed by universal physical forces of attraction and repulsion. These were, as described in the motto in the book's first illustration, 'hidden nodes' of connection. The force that drew things together in the physical world was, he argued, the same force that drew people's souls towards God. The work is divided into three books: 1.De natura et facultatibus magnetis (Of the nature and properties of magnets), 2.Magnes applicatus (Applications of magnets), 3.Mundus sive catena magnetica (The world or the magnetic chain). It is noted for the first use of the term 'electromagnetism'. The Earth‚Äôs magnetic field The question of the earth's magnetic field and, in particular, magnetic declination was addressed in Book 2 of Magnes. It was one of great interest in Kircher's time, because it was thought that an understanding of it would help resolve the problem of longitude. The Jesuit order had scholars working in many different parts of the world and was thus able to collect observations on declination. Kircher collected forty-three of these and combined them with observations from a network of other scholars including Mersenne to produce three tables and two lists with a total of 518 values. He proposed that a magnetic map of the earth could be made with this data, although he did not attempt to do this himself. Magnetism and Copernican theory Diagram of the earth‚Äôs magnetic declination from ‚Äú Magnes sive de arte magnetica‚Äù Magnes contained the first response by a Jesuit to the arguments of some heliocentrists who held that magnetism proved the Copernican model of the universe. Kircher was aware that he was the first scholar to mount a critical assault on the heliocentric theory that the Church had condemned as heretical. He did not agree with Galileo and some other scientists of the time that the earth rotated, so William Gilbert's view that the earth's magnetic poles had something to do with that rotation was one he did not support. In Kircher‚Äôs view, the earth's poles were not the axis of planetary rotation, but the axis around which the stars rotated in the heavenly spheres. Indeed, he argued in Magnes that the earth stands still because its two magnetic poles are attracted by two celestial reverse poles. Kircher also rejected Kepler's view that the Sun created a magnetic force that caused the planets to rotate around it. He argued that the experimental proofs of magnetism were not sufficient to resolve the question of whether the earth or the sun was at the centre of the universe, and did not believe that the behaviour of magnets at a small scale on earth was a useful guide to how the cosmos worked. To disprove the idea put forward by Gilbert that the entire earth was a magnet, Kircher attempted to calculate the force it would exert and the weight it could move if it were so. He concluded that if the earth were a magnet and the moon ferrous, the earth's magnetic force would cause the moon to crash into it. He likewise argued that if the earth were a magnet then all the iron on its surface, even in mountains, would be pulled into itself and could not remain where anyone could find it. Kepler had argued that the Sun was like a magnet, holding the planets in their orbits around it. Kircher found this unsatisfactory: how could a single, consistent magnetic force emanating from the Sun explain the different motions of the planets, with their varying speeds and trajectories? How could a force powerful enough to move the planets leave the fixed stars beyond them unmoved? In any case, he argued, it was contrary to the observable behaviour of magnets to suggest that a motionless magnet could draw magnetised bodies around it in orbit. Magnetic communication Illustration of a magnetic cryptography machine from ‚Äú Magnes sive de arte magnetica‚Äù Kircher noted that once objects had been magnetised, they continued to have a relationship with each other even when they were at a distance. He therefore proposed a ‚Äúmachina cryptologica‚Äù; this consisted of a number of bottles at some distance from each other, with the letters of the alphabet inscribed around the middle of each bottle. Each also had a lubricated and magnetised stopper bearing a pointer. When the stopper on one bottle is rotated so that the pointer indicates a particular letter of the alphabet, the stopper on the other bottles rotates in the same way. Thus by turning the stopper in one place, someone could send a message to a person observing the bottle at the other end of the machine. Magnetism and health Illustration from Magnes about tarantism While Magnes is noted today primarily for its arguments against Copernicanism, the work addressed a wide variety of different phenomena, including some that have no relationship to the modern scientific understanding of magnetism. There was a scholarly debate in Kircher's time as to whether 'magnetic' powers (i.e. powers of attraction) could be used to heal wounds. Robert Fludd held that if the weapon used to cause a wound was placed against it, the wound would disappear. Kircher argued that there was no magnetic cure - indeed such a cure would be the work of the devil. While he dismissed the notion of a magnetic cure for wounds, he devoted a chapter of Magnes to tarantism as a cure for a spider bite - an example, he believed, of magnetic forces of attraction inherent in music. Illustrations Final illustration in ‚Äú Magnes sive de arte magnetica‚Äù Kircher's first work on magnetism, Ars Magnesia, had contained only modest woodcut illustrations. In contrast Magnes was illustrated not only with more than 150 woodcuts but with 32 full-page engraved plates. It was the first of Kircher's works to combine woodcuts with copperplate engravings. These illustrations were both technically challenging to create and expensive to produce. Two of the illustrations were of machines with moving parts, and readers could cut the parts out and use to create working models of the machinery themselves. On reading the first edition soon after it was published, Evangelista Torricelli wrote to his teacher Galileo that it was a pleasure to read and \\"enriched with a wealth of beautiful engravings.\\" The frontispiece of the first edition is by Claudio Dagli. It depicts the double-headed imperial eagle of the Hapsburg dynasty. It hangs by a magnetised chain from the imperial crown that supports an orb and a cross. Both the crown and the cross are struck through with magnetised arrows pointing towards a heavenly source, but not directly at the all-seeing eye of god directly above - perhaps a reference to magnetic declination. In one of its claws the eagle holds the crowns of Austria, Hungry and Bohemia, held together by magnetism, while in the other it holds the sceptres of the three realms, similarly linked by magnetic force. Arrows from the bird's outstretched wings project imperial power to the lands below. A lodestone on the eagle's breast carries the dedication to Emperor Ferdinand III and a banner above the eagle's head carries the Latin motto Regna Quis Adiunxit Regnis Nova Sceptra Coronis (\\"He has added kingdoms to kingdoms and new sceptres to crowns\\"). A second banner curling around its feet carries the Latin pun Et Boreae Et Austri-Acus (\\"\\"Needle of the north and south - 'austriacus' also meaning 'Austrian'). In the third edition the dedication to Ferdinand III is replaced on the breast of the eagle by his portrait. In the first edition there is also a second frontispiece to Book III, designed by Giovanni Battista Rinalducci and executed by Giovanni Battista Ficavazza. This is intended as a graphic illustration of the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines. Fourteen of these are depicted, with theology at the top, accompanied by philosophy, physics, poetry, rhetoric, cosmography, mechanics, perspective, music, natural magic, medicine, astronomy, arithmetic and geography, linked by a golden chain. At the centre of the ring they create sits an emblem of the Mundus Archetypus ('world of archetypes'), containing the all-seeing eye of God, and immediately around it stand representations of Mundus Sidereus ('the world of stars'), Mundus Sublunaris ('the sublunar world') and Microcosmus {'the microcosm'). Weaving between these emblems was a banner bearing the motto 'omnia nodis arcanis connexa quiescunt' ('all things are at rest, connected by secret knots'). This plate was omitted in the second edition but was remade in folio size for the third edition. The final illustration in the book is of the egg of Columbus standing on its point on a slate and bearing the motto Et nos haec poteramus (\\"and we have been able to do likewise\\") - in other words, in producing this work, Kircher had, like Columbus, been able to do something thought to be impossible. Later editions The second edition was published in 1643, only two years after the first, showing the work's success. It was completely reset, reducing it from around 900 to 800 pages, with every illustration redrawn. Including a number of corrections, it was published in Cologne by Kalckhoven. Kaspar Schott edited the revised third edition of the book (1654), finding and correcting a great many errors in Kircher's original text. It was the first edition in folio format, published in Rome by Blasius Deuersin and Zanobius Masottus. Magnetism in other works Kircher was not the first scholar to write about magnetism. In 1600, William Gilbert published De Magnete ('On the Magnet'), the first modern treatise on magnetism and in 1635, Henry Gellibrand first discovered that magnetic declination changes with time. Among Jesuit scholars, Leonardo Garzoni wrote Trattati della Calamita ('Treatise on the Lodestone') (around 1580) which described the double polarity of magnets. Niccol√≤ Cabeo used Garzoni‚Äôs manuscript as the basis for his own Philosophia Magnetica. Kircher cited Gilbert, Garzoni and Cabeo in Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica. Magnetism was an important theme in Kircher's 1664 work Mundus Subterraneus as well as his 1667 book Magneticum Naturae Regnum. Many of the magnetic machines lavishly illustrated in the work were later built and displayed in Kircher's museum in Rome.

Her work considers reproductive justice and medical care for marginalised communities, with an overarching aim to eliminate healthcare inequalities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, McLemore studied the impact of coronavirus disease during pregnancy.  Early life and education  McLemore was born as a preemie (pre-term birth). She had no medical members of her family, but decided to become a nurse when she was eight years old. She studied nursing at The College of New Jersey. She earned a Master of Public Health at San Francisco State University. McLemore moved to the University of California, San Francisco for her graduate studies, where she studied CA-125; an antigen that is associated with tumours.  Research and career  McLemore studies the relationship between physical and mental health in low-income communities of colour. Her research makes use of reproductive justice theory; which argues that people who become pregnant have the right to decide how they want the birth to be. Rooted in reproductive justice theory, McLemore launched the Saving Our Ladies from early births And Reducing Stress (SOLARS) study, which looks to understand the impact of stress, anxiety and racism on gestational duration in Black and Latina communities. McLemore was part of the preterm birth initiative (PTBi-California), which looks to understand why preterm births mainly occur in low-income women of colour. PTBi-California looks to mitigate for the disproportionate impact that preterm births have on already marginalised communities; and to work with physicians and educators to deserve programmes that better support these communities. In 2020 McLemore retired from her clinical nursing career to focus entirely on research with a focus on Black maternal health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, McLemore studied the impact of coronavirus disease during pregnancy, and why Black Americans were hardest hit by the disease. In an article for Scientific American, she argued that the coronavirus disease was not an excuse to abandon pregnant women.

(in Spanish) However, many newspapers and magazines of the time reported that he was responsible for more. His modus operandi consisted of ambushes on sidewalks, estates and highways, where he kidnapped and murdered law enforcement officials (such as soldiers and policemen), civilians, peasants and even minors.Colombian National Police Magazine. Volume 51, No. 104, March - April 1964, Bogot√°, DE (in Spanish) He also sexually assaulted female victims and committed thefts whenever he could. At the time, he was known by the alias Desquite, because he exacted revenge for the murders of his father and brother, as well as suffering from the dispossession of his property. In the words of famous journalist Gonzalo Arango, Aranguren was \\"an assassin who killed simply to kill.\\"Jairo Andr√©s Vargas The last voices of a massacre Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano. Accessed June 5, 2020. (in Spanish)  Crime spree  Aranguren's first recorded criminal activity was in 1956, when he ambushed a truck from a tobacco company called 'Compa√±√≠a Colombiana de Tabaco'. During the robbery, four crew members were killed, with Jos√© stealing their money. As a result from this act, he was sentenced to 23 years imprisonment and was incarcerated in the Picota Central Penitentiary, where he managed to escape from within a year. Once he escaped, Aranguren organized a gang in 1960. By mid-1961, he carried out an assault in Venadillo, where he murdered two peasants on a farm. In April, he launched another assault on a new hacienda called 'La Argentina', where he murdered 20 peasants. The news generated great consternation at the time, so much that this event was considered a massacre against the peasant populus. Not long after, Aranguren repeated the act on another hacienda very close to Pul√≠, where he murdered another seven peasants. The last attack of that year occurred on December 4th, where four more peasant perished. News of Aranguren's brutality spread, and in April 1962, he murdered several members of the security forces: in this case, a non-commissioned officer and four soldiers, aided by members of other gangs. By the middle of that year, he again murdered a farmer in L√≠bano, whom he beheaded. In December, after confronting and surrounding a police checkpoint in Mariquita, Aranguren murdered the four policemen assigned to the area. As time passed and his crimes increased, Aranguren's modus operandi also evolved. On January 22, 1963, he once broke into a hacienda called Calmonte, from where he kidnapped two minors. He demanded a ransom from the relatives amounting to 5,000 pesos, but cancelled it and eventually beheaded his hostages. On February 13th, he ambushed a bus where several people were being transported. From this accident, he killed one person, raped a woman, wounded five people and kidnapped three others, whose further fate is unclear. Only five days later, he attacked again in Honda, assaulting and beheading four farmers. On August 5th, he and his posse ambushed a bus, truck and two dump trucks travelling along the Victor√≠a-Marquetalia route, during which 39 people were killed and beheaded, as well as 250,000 pesos stolen. On September 2nd, he murdered another nine peasants in Las Damas. Finally, in December, Aranguren murdered eight more people: three adults and five minors. In early 1964, Aranguren faced a Colombian army patrol, ending the life of a soldier. The last official known information of a crime he had committed occurred on March 12, 1964, in a farm known as El Volc√°n. According to the information, Aranguren kidnapped a child, killing him in a particularly cruel manner by piercing his heart with a knife and later dismembering the corpse in eight pieces, which he then buried in a mass grave.  Death  Aranguren was located on a farm located in the village of Rosacruz, Venadillo on March 17, 1964. Colombian army commandos and police were alerted from an anonymous tipster, and quickly prepared to enter the premises after verifying that it was indeed the bloodthirsty fugitive. Led by soldiers, the assault team warned Aranguren that his reign of murders and crime was effectively over, and that they would not let him escape. He was finally killed \\"like a dangerous animal being exterminated\\", without contemplation or remorse. After this, the entire Colombian army repeatedly threw grenades at the farm, in order to prevent any other associate of Aranguren from escaping alive. The operators were later rescued by helicopter, after transporting the now-deceased criminal's remains. According to investigations from the time, Aranguren was not alone in the farm at the time of his death. He was accompanied by three accomplices: Alfonso \\"Pata de Chivo\\" Parra, Gustavo \\"Veneno\\" √Åvila and Alberto \\"Peligro\\" L√≥pez, all of whom were armed. Investigators determined that Aranguren carried with him a 7mm rifle with 96 cartridges and a long .38 caliber revolver with 7 cartridges; √Åvila also had a rifle with 50 cartridges; Parra carried a Crist√≥bal Kiraly M2 Carbine with 423 bullets, and L√≥pez with 1940-model rifle with 110 cartridges and a frag grenade imported from America.

History Church interior The monastery was presumably founded in the 17th century by some monks fleeing from their original monastery located on the seashore near Sisses, which had been destroyed by pirates; nowadays the only remaining building is a chapel. Actually the small size and the relative remoteness of the town of Fodele were responsible for the preservation of the new monastery from the devastations occurring in other parts of Crete. The monastery was, however, subject to several damaging events and transformations over the centuries. Throughout the Ottoman occupation of the island it played an important role in supporting Cretan rebels, and during the 19th century was used as a field hospital. The few monks still living there celebrate the feast of Saint Pantaleon, the patron of bakers, every year, on July the 27th. Description Church facade An old foutntain in the monastery compound Agios Panteleimon is located west of Heraklion, some 5 km from the center of Fodele, in the Malevizi municipality, outside of the main touristic routes. A tiny, asphalted road links it to Fodele along a shady valley with rich vegetation. The complex, along with several other Cretan monasteries, reflects a Venetian fortress plan, although very few of its buildings are in a good state nowadays. The church has two naves, one of which is dedicated to Saint Antony, the other to Saint Pantaleon. It possesses some noteworthy icons, although many of the other valuable icons that once belonged to the monastery are now exhibited in the Religious Art Museum of Heraklion.

He started his way in the world of art and design as a paper origami artist, and today also designs furniture, jewelry and works of art out of a variety of materials, such as metals, wood, and glass. He masters an origami genre called Tessellation. During 2012 he co-established Origamisrael, the Israeli origami artists' organization, and he is its chairman ever since. He is an author of several books in the fields of origami and puzzles. In September 2019, Garibi presented a TEDx talk as part of TEDxPaloAltoSalon. Personal life Garibi was born and raised in Hadera, the second of five children to Shula and Salman Garibi. He is married to Sigal and father to three. In 1983 he joined the IDF and served as an intelligence officer until he retired in 2009 as a lieutenant colonel. Origami Garibi is folding origami from a young age. During his sixth grade, he learned to fold from the book ‚ÄúOrigami 1‚Äù by Robert Harbin, and later on from the other three books in the series. During 2006 he joined the Israeli Origami Center, where he managed the folders' club between 2009-2011. In 2008 he started to create original origami designs, which he published in Flickr and various international origami groups. In 2009, after retiring from the military, he started to teach Creative and Scientific Thinking Through Origami to gifted students in the 'Techno Da' school in Hadera. Since 2011 Garibi is an editor for The Fold, the online magazine of OrigamiUSA. He conducted and published a series of Paper Review articles, in which he analyzes different types of paper to find how suitable they are for origami. He also writes the Origami Designer Secrets column, in which he interviews young origami artists from all over the world about their creative process.Garibi \\"interviews\\" himself for his column, Diagrams to dozens of Garibi's origami models have been published in many international origami magazines, such as the British Origami Society magazine, the Spanish group origami magazine Pajarita, the American magazine The Paper, The Dutch magazine Orison, and others.

The first project for the gallery was to design origami lamps for Aqua Creations design studio. The series was developed with the studio's employee Ofir Zucker, and was called Molecules. It was presented during Milan Design Week 2011, and still being sold (2020). Later on, in 2012, Garibi collaborated with Zucker again to make a series of concrete vases using folded paper as the mold.

Ilan Garibi - Tavolini trio.jpgWood Oriental Table Ilan Garibi - Palmas.jpg\\"Palms\\" vase series, concrete cast in paper models, with Ofir Zucker - 2012 In 2012 Garibi learned how to fold metal sheets, using laser cutting. The technique is based on several steps: the cutting pattern is planned and diagramed according to the fold lines of the paper design; the file is sent to a laser machine to cut a metal sheet; after cutting the metal sheet is moved to a clean environment and then hand folded according to the original design. Garibi started to work with plain stainless steel and later on moved to mirror finishing stainless steel. The folded mirror creates a multi-facet reflection that gives the art pieces a unique look. Garibi designed several collections with this technique, that were presented in various exhibitions during the years 2013-2019. The collections include works of art and works of design, such as tables, lamps, wall tiles and more.

The Marblehead people were at afternoon service. The regiment, with loaded muskets and bayonets fixed, marched to Salem under orders to seize military stores concealed there. Salem As soon as its destination was known, Major John Pedrick of Marblehead rode \\"across lots\\" to Salem, and gave the alarm. Arrived at Salem, where the movement was delayed at New Mills by the tearing up of the bridge over South River, the troops were guided by a Loyalist towards \\"North Fields,\\" a section reached by a drawbridge over North River. Here they found the draw raised to arrest their progress. Some flatboats lying in the stream were promptly scuttled by their owners in the face of the troops. Across the river a large number of people were gathering, armed as opportunity offered. Colonel Timothy Pickering, then a young militia officer (afterwards Secretary of War under Washington) was among them. Parson Thomas Barnard hastening from his pulpit in the North Church close by, had reached the spot, and was trying to mediate. Captain John Felt was at Colonel Leslie's side with purpose, afterward declared, of throwing him into the river in case the regulars had fired. The Honorable Richard Derby, whose ships' guns, loaned to the Province, were the objects of the search, and Colonel David Mason, the Provincial agent for mounting them for the field, were present, insisting, as did Captain James Barr, Major Joseph Sprague, and others who had disabled the flatboats, that Colonel Leslie was marching not on the King's highway, but in a private lane, that the bridge was the property of individual proprietors, that the draw would not be let down on his order, and that, as neither war nor martial law had been declared, he would advance at his peril. \\"Find the guns, if you can,\\" said Derby. \\"Take them, if you can. They will not be surrendered.\\" Leslie said his orders were to cross the river, and he would do so. Meanwhile the guns had been removed to a safer place, and a mounted messenger, Benjamin Daland, had posted to Danvers, spreading the alarm. The concourse of citizens was fast increasing, and help was arriving from Beverly and Danvers. Negotiation Night was approaching, and at dusk Colonel Leslie agreed that, if the draw should be lowered, he would march but a few rods beyond, abandon the search, and withdraw his regiment. The terms were accepted and observed. The regiment returned to Marblehead through streets lined with armed men, and re-embarked for Boston. Their march had been arrested and their purpose defeated. Edmund Burke summed up the situation in these memorable words : \\" Thus ended their first expedition, without effect, and happily without mischief. Enough appeared to show on what a slender thread the peace of the Empire hung, and that the least exertion of the military power would certainly bring things to extremities.\\" Hon. Robert S. Rantoul, having made researches in the matter of the history of Leslie's retreat,Essex Institute Historical Collections, Volumes 32-33, Some Claims of Salem on the notice of the Country, by [Robert S. Rantoul has expressed himself as surprised that the historian Dr. Bentley, in his voluminous notes, had made no mention of it; yet it was of sufficient importance for Burke to set it down in his magazine published in England at that time as \\"the first military enterprise of the colonies.\\" It seems that Leslie was held and delayed at the bridge by a quibble raised as to whether the bridge was a portion of the King's highway or private property. During this delay the cannon in North Fields were removed, and thus saved to the patriots. He stated that this bridge was originally built by the town ; but, as it proved of slight advantage except to land-owners on the other side the town apportioned it off in small sections to the proprietors of the land, for them to care for, reserving, however, some eighteen feet and the draw as town property. This would indicate that most of the bridge was private property at the time of Colonel Leslie's visit, but that the draw was town property. Legacy The town of Salem erected a monument to the eventLeslie's Retreat MonumentMonuments, Salem, North Street, tablet in commemoration of Leslie's retreat, which states: \\"In the Revolution, the first armed resistance to the Royal Authority was made at this bridge, 26 Feb. 1775 by the people of Salem.

The building, located centrally on the university campus next to the Campus Pond, Old Chapel (Amherst, Massachusetts), and W. E. B. Du Bois Library currently serves as the home to the University of Massachusetts Amherst Alumni Association and members of the Campus Development office. A 2009 report recommended addition of Memorial Hall to the state's list of historical places.  History  The building was planned beginning in 1918, and construction finished in 1921. The foyer was initially used for formal services and display of the honored dead. A motto engraved into the inside reads \\"we will keep faith with you who lie asleep\\", a reference to the desire to keep student life active in the facility. One prominent visitor was former general and then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who toured it in the mid-1950s. The Hall was a staging ground for anti-war protests against the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s. In 1998, ownership of the Hall transferred from the Alumni Association to the university. Since this time, the building has been a site for weddings, concerts by the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band, Reserve Officers' Training Corps training exercises and Memorial Day services, art exhibits, and funerals. For a time in the mid-1970s, the Hall hosted the editorial offices for the Massachusetts Review. thumb = Architectural Details = Architect James Ritchie wished to construct \\"...a monumental design which will differentiate [Memorial Hall] from the buildings dedicated to instruction.\\" The building is two stories high, with high vaulted arched windows over a central French door, evoking the style of a crypt or museum. Various architectural elements, such as its sandstone trim and matching ballustrades at each level, were inspired by the Italian Renaissance. It has two low-slung wings, which serve as Boardrooms and conference spaces. = Centennial Celebration = An engraving of the completed Memorial Hall, After transformation across the years, from use as a ballroom, a billiards hall, a bowling alley, and a home for the University's student alumni association's dialing center, Memorial Hall fell into disrepair and was shuttered in mid-2019. However, as the 100th anniversary in 2020 drew closer, efforts to rehabilitate and reclaim the building as a showpiece for center campus resumed among multiple campus stakeholders.

MRIB also compiled other genre charts for the United Kingdom. HistoryFoundation= MRIB was founded in 1981, by Luke Crampton, and Dafydd Rees. =The Network Chart= MRIB's Network Chart was a rival competitor to the \\"official\\" UK chart that was compiled by Gallup and that is now published by the Official Charts Company (OCC). It was reported in March, 1991 that the Network Chart compiled by MRIB had a radio audience size that was gaining on the BBC Radio 1 chart show which broadcast the chart that was compiled by Gallup for the OCC (then CIN). Later that month Music & Media magazine reported that they were switching to publishing the MRIB charts for the UK which they would also use to compile the European Hot 100 Singles and European Top 100 Albums charts. There were sometimes public disputes over accuracy between Gallup and MRIB such as when the former placed Whitney Houston's single \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\" at number 10 while the latter placed it at number 2 in the same week. MRIB's Network Chart was published in music publications NME and Melody Maker as well as on ITV's Teletext service. =Other charts= MRIB also compiled the UK Independent Singles and Albums Charts that were published in many newspapers and magazines such as Melody Maker. In the 1980s MRIB compiled the disco charts for the UK that were published in Record Business (which was later absorbed into Music Week).

Although MRIB's Network Chart was a direct rival to the chart that was compiled by Gallup for CIN/OCC and broadcast by BBC Radio 1, the same radio station announced in 1995 that it was launching the 1FM Artist Chart that combined album and singles sales and would be compiled by MRIB. This had apparently disappointed CIN. From 1998 to 2001, MRIB also compiled the World Beat album chart show for CNN International.

The group started as Lesbians and Gays Against Oppression (LAGO) and in 1987 reorganized as OLGA. Both organisations fought for LGBT rights and were anti-apartheid. OLGA was affiliated with the United Democratic Front (UDF) and sent suggestions for a more inclusive constitution for South Africa to the African National Congress (ANC).  History  The Gay Association of South Africa (GASA), an LGBT rights organization in South Africa, would not take a stance on anti-racism activism. By 1986, the group fell apart and black lesbian and gay South Africans left to form the Rand Gay Organisation, while white activists came together to form Lesbians and Gays Against Oppression (LAGO). LAGO was created in Cape Town in 1986 and took a definite anti-apartheid stance. In addition, the group had links to other anti-apartheid groups. The later iteration of LAGO, OLGA, was affiliated with the United Democratic Front (UDF). Some of the founders of LAGO were prominent anti-apartheid activists, including Derrick Fine, Sheila Lapinsky, Julia Nicol and Ivan Toms. There were initially six members. The LAGO constitution required that all decisions needed to be made by full consensus. In October of 1987, LAGO was dissolved because of this deadlock. It was immediately reorganized as the Organisation of Lesbian and Gay Activists (OLGA) with the same goals as LAGO, but with a modified constitution. While OLGA was initially founded by mostly white gays and lesbians, it had an interracial membership. By 1991, there were 35 members with 200 people interested in their work. OLGA was dissolved in 1994.  Activities  OLGA raised awareness of gay and lesbian rights by wearing t-shirts and buttons with pro-LGBT slogans. The group was also involved in the fight around HIV. OLGA also explicitly fought against apartheid. They were involved in public events, such as meetings, workshops and demonstrations. OLGA submitted proposals to the African National Congress (ANC) Constitutional Committee that would include language providing rights to LGBT individuals. This was called the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Rights Charter, and it was decided that ANC should also fight for LGBT rights.

It produces a digital platform that uses data to verify a product's sustainable production claims and tracks that product throughout its individual supply chain. Consumers can then view the product's history by scanning a QR code with their mobile device.  History  In 2017, WWF Australia ran a small-scale pilot program tracing tuna from fisheries in the Pacific Ocean as part of the WWF's Panda Labs program. Using data and experience from that project, WWF Australia collaborated with BCG Digital Ventures on the blockchain tracking platform, OpenSC. That platform designed to verify sustainable production claims and track food through its supply chain was officially launched on 17 January 2019. OpenSC-tracked food was served at the company's launch event in Sydney and later at a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. At its outset, the platform tracked items such as seafood products like fish, but the company planned to add other commodities to its platform in the future. Markus Mutz has been OpenSC's CEO since its outset. Austral Fisheries, which is a part of the global Japanese seafood company Maruha Nichiro, was one of the initial companies to adopt the OpenSC platform to track their fish and prawns. In July 2019, it was announced that Nestl√© would start a pilot program to track food using the OpenSC platform. As part of the program, Nestl√© will trace its milk from producers in New Zealand to its own Middle East-based factories and warehouses. It also plans to use OpenSC to trace its palm oil supply chains in the Americas at a future date. In September 2019, it was announced that OpenSC had raised $4 million (USD) in funding to assist with the further development of its platform. Investors included Working Capital and Swiss angel investor, Christian Wenger.  Platform  The OpenSC platform uses technology and real- time data to verify a product was produced in an ethically or sustainable way, and it then tracks the food and other products throughout their entire supply chain. Although the company started out tracking fish and beef, it has expanded traceability to items like palm oil and dairy. OpenSC typically focuses on improving transparency of commodities with known \\"environmental or human rights risks within their supply chains,\\" and its tracking data is designed to help companies and consumers ensure that products are ethically and sustainably sourced. Consumers can scan a QR code (typically on restaurant menus or on the product itself) to get access to the data about the product's history, which is stored on an open blockchain.

Career In the 1920s, he worked as a fashion illustrator and he produced erotic illustrations, which he signed I. de Chanteau. In the 1926 Handbuch des Kunstmalers (Directory of Berlin artists) he is shown at W15 Fasanenstrasse 33. He worked for the Agentur Schostal in Berlin from 1929 onwards. In the years between the wars, the Agentur Schostal had its head office in Vienna, with branches in Paris, Milan, Berlin and Stockholm. It was particularly successful in the 1930s up until the declaration of the Second World War. The main customers were print media, including magazines such as Die Dame, Die Woche and Uhu in Germany and Moderne Welt, , and Wiener Magazin in Austria, to which Schostal supplied images relating to culture, fashion and glamor. Its images also appeared in U.S. publications. His studio was at 10 Tiergartenstrasse in Berlin (a Gabrielle von Santho is shown in the J√ºdisches Adressbuch f√ºr Gross-Berlin (Jewish Address Book) for 1931 at that address) and from 1932 to 1933 he worked from his studio at 44 Kaiserdamm. He frequently worked with the German \\"supermodel\\" of the day, Karen Stilke. After Hitler came to power, he supposedly left Germany and moved to Vienna. However, it has been noted that he was a friend of Magda Goebbels and some of his Berlin fashion photography carries dates in the late 1930s and 1940s. In 1933 the Deutsches Modeamt (German Fashion Office) was established by the Ministry of Propaganda, under the leadership of Madga Goebbels, from which her husband dismissed her very early on. Imre von Santho is shown in the Berlin telephone directories for 1940 and 1941 having a studio at W15 Kurfurstendamm 201 (and at 102). Whilst all luxury magazines had suspended publication in 1939, von Santho remained as the main fashion photographer for the journal Der Silberspiegel (The Silver Mirror) until March 1943 when it too suspended publication. After 1945 his name was mentioned as a teacher at the photo academy of Angelo (P√°l Funk). Imre von Santho is believed to have committed suicide in either 1945 or 1946. Exhibitions His work was shown in 2013 at the exhibition, Vanity Fashion Photography from the F.C. Gundlach Collection at the National Museum in Krak√≥w, Poland. Previously, in 2005, the show Berliner Modefotografie - Die Drei√üiger Jahre, at the Kunstbibliothek, Berlin, had included his works.

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, with its headquarters in downtown Minneapolis, is one of the \\"largest law enforcement agencies in Minnesota\\" with division and unit facilities throughout Hennepin County. Twin cities, Saint Paul and Minneapolis, have their own police departments, the Minneapolis Police Department, which was established in 1867 and the Saint Paul Police Department. A union for rank and file officers in Minneapolis‚Äîthe Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis (the Federation)‚Äîwas established in 1917. Since its establishment in 1967, the Minneapolis Police Department has had 52 Chiefs of Police. The current Chief of Police, who began his term in 2017, is Medaria Arradondo, who is a fifth-generation Minnesota resident and is the first African American to serve as chief of the Minneapolis Police Department. * March 9, 1867: In response to a request from the Mayor of Minneapolis for a police force, on March 9, 1867 four officers were appointed to the Minneapolis Police Department. online version The MPD was established shortly after the end of the American Civil War (1861 ‚Äì 1865), an internal war pitting the northern United States against the southern United States ‚Äîthe Confederacy‚Äîprimarily fought over the enslavement of black people. The Dakota War which was part of the Sioux Wars and the American Civil War, had ended in 1862. At that time, the population of Minneapolis was about 5,000. *1867‚Äì1917: In the early years newly elected mayors would fire MPD officers and replace them with \\"friends, family, and their supporters,\\" according to Fossum's 1996 History of the Minneapolis Police Department. Cited by MPD 150 2017 *1890: Augustine E. Costello published his History of the Fire and Police Departments of Minneapolis: Their Origin, Progress, and Development. *1892: The first Minnesota African-American police officer was James H. Burrell, who joined the St. Paul Police Department in 1892. *January 7, 1901: A. A. Ames (1842 ‚Äì 1911) began his final term as mayor of Minneapolis. He appointed his brother, Colonel Fred W. Ames as chief of police and a former gambler, Norman W. King as detective. The Minneapolis Police force was transformed into Ames' army. The police would put pressure on criminal organizations and Ames' people would take money from various criminal activities in the city all with the knowledge of local citizens. By 1902, Ames was drinking heavily and people working under him were fighting among themselves. Extortion schemes increased. Attempts by the Hennepin County sheriff to crack down on the widespread criminal activities were quashed, but even average citizens were aware of the city's descent into corruption. *April 1902: A grand jury was drawn composed of \\"unselected citizens\\" with Hovey C. Clarke, local businessman, as foreman. They \\"received no special instructions from the bench\\" and the county prosecutor put only routine work before the grand jury. Clarke dismissed the county prosecutor when he refused to investigate A. A. Ames and his brother, Fred.
