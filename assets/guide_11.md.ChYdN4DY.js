It was used by the Special Warfare Department and others associated with the Counter-Guerrilla. Those detained were mostly associated with the left; the 12 March 1971 coup was alleged to be a counter-coup against a planned 9 March communist coup. The mastermind behind Ziverbey interrogations was brigadier general Memduh Ünlütürk, working under lieutenant General Turgut Sunalp, who was reporting to the Commander of First Army, General Faik Türün. The latter two generals were Korean War veterans who had served in the Operations Department (). The interrogation techniques they used in Ziverbey were inspired by what they had seen done to Korean and Chinese POWs during the Korean War. Prisoners were bound and blinded. Intellectuals such as İlhan Selçuk (allegedly linked with the 9 March coup plans) and Uğur Mumcu were tortured there. Several Ziverbey victims confirmed that the interrogators introduced themselves as \\"Counter-Guerrillas\\", above the law, and entitled to kill.Lucy Komisar, Turkey's terrorists: a CIA legacy lives on, The Progressive, April 1997.İlhan Selçuk, Ziverbey Köşkü (quoted in Mercan, 2006). His interrogators reputedly said: \\"İlhan Selçuk, Genelkurmay Başkanlığına bağlı kontrgerilla örgütünün karşısında bulunuyorsun. Sen bizim tutsağımızsın. Burada anayasa babayasa yoktur. Örgüt seni ölüme mahkum etmiştir. Sana istediğimizi yapmaya yetkiliyiz. Buraya getirilmen örgüt kararıyladır. Seni Marksist, Leninist, Komünist biliyoruz. Eğer konuşur ve böyle olduğunu itiraf edersen hakkında hayırlı olur.\\" Under duress to write an apologetic statement, Selçuk famously revealed his plight using a modified acrostic which decrypted to \\"I am under torture\\". The key letter was the first of the penultimate word of each sentence in his statement. Another prisoner, outspoken liberal Murat Belge, says that he was tortured there by Veli Küçük, who later founded JITEM and Hezbollah (Turkey) to counter the Kurdistan Workers' Party. Küçük says he could not be responsible since he was stationed in Şırnak and has been charged with colluding with another Ziverbey victim, İlhan Selçuk (see Ergenekon). The activist film director Yılmaz Güney was also present. A friend of his in the MİT had tried to prevent him from being captured by telling his superiors that Güney was also a spy, but the ruse failed. A MİT officer who was present, Mehmet Eymür, said Güney was treated well in return for his co-operation. General Yamak denied that the Special Warfare Department (ÖHD) was involved, and dismissed any notion of a \\"counter- guerrilla\\".

Gerard eventually became the Incumbent of St John's, Aberdeen (1733–1767); a position which he kept until his death. He married sometime before December 1731 to Mrs Burnett, widow of Robert Burnett (son of the Reverend John Burnett, Incumbent of Monymusk). Following the resignation of William Dunbar in 1745, he was elected Bishop of Aberdeen and was consecrated at Cupar on 17 July 1746 by bishops Robert White, John Alexander, William Falconer and James Rait. Bishop Gerard died in office in Aberdeen on 7 October 1767, and was buried on 9 October 1767.

It permits an opt-out system of organ donation, known as presumed consent, or deemed concent. The act allows hospitals to presume that people aged 18 or over, who have been resident in Wales for over 12 months, want to donate their organs at their death, unless they have objected specifically. The act varies the Law of England and Wales in Wales (still applicable in England), which relied on an opt-in system; whereby only those who have signed the NHS organ donation register, or whose families agreed, were considered to have consented to be organ donors. The law came into effect in 2015, which allowed time for a Welsh Government public information campaign to take effect. The act is considered by the Welsh Government to be the \\"most significant piece of legislation\\" passed in Wales since additional lawmaking powers were acquired by the Assembly in 2011, under the Government of Wales Act 2006. Background The Human Tissue Act 2004 (c 30) consolidated previous legislation in the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland, where the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 was enacted) and created the Human Tissue Authority to \\"regulate the removal, storage, use and disposal of human bodies, organs and tissue\\". Under the act, for organs (hearts, lungs, livers, pancreas and kidneys and corneas) to be available for transplant, a person must consent to their use on an 'opt-in' basis. That is, it is presumed that a person does not want to donate their organs, unless they indicate otherwise by: carrying an organ donation card; joining the NHS organ donation register; writing it down; or telling their relatives. A 2003 survey by UK Transplant (now part of NHS Blood and Transplant) showed 90 per cent UK public support for organ donation in principle. In practice, however, organ donation was significantly lower, due mainly to the refusal by 40 per cent of relatives to give their consent for donation. In 2008, the UK had one of the lowest organ donation rates in Europe, at 13 donors per million of population (pmp). Spain had the world's highest donor rate, at 35 pmp. Spain's organ donation programme uses the 'opt- out' system, which has led many people, including the Chief Medical Officer for England, Liam Donaldson and the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, to believe changing to a system of presumed consent would increase the incidence of organ donation in the UK. The Organ Donation Taskforce, set up by the UK Government in 2006, considered Spain's relative success. According to Taskforce member, Dr Paul Murphy, \\"There is an association between countries with presumed consent and higher donation rates, but we could not see that link was a causal one.\\" However, in an article entitled Time to move to presumed consent for organ donation, the British Medical Association argued that \\"the taskforce did not consider all the relevant evidence, particularly on relatives' refusal rates, and that the current policy, however reinforced, will not substantially increase the number of organs available. By modelling different scenarios, we show that only a policy of presumed consent will substantially increase the number of organs available for transplantation\\". A report by the British Medical Association, published in the British Medical Journal in January 2009, found that of the countries studied (Spain, Austria, and Belgium), \\"all reported an increase in donation rates after the introduction of presumed consent\\". Nevertheless, the report concluded \\"Presumed consent alone is unlikely to explain the variation in organ donation rates between countries. Legislation, availability of donors, organisation and infrastructure of the transplantation service, wealth and investment in health care, and public attitudes to and awareness of organ donation may all play a part, but their relative importance is unclear\\". In 2008, the charity Kidney Wales Foundation established Opt for Life Cymru, with People Like us Cymru, the Welsh Kidney Patients Association, the British Heart Foundation, the British Lung Foundation, Diabetes Cymru, Cystic Fibrosis and the British Medical Association, to campaign to change the law in Wales to a 'soft opt- out' system of organ donation. Donation rates improved following the implementation of recommendations made in 2008 by the Organ Donation Taskforce. By 2012, the donation rate in the UK was 17.4 pmp. Donation rates in Wales continued to be higher than in the other countries of the UK. In 2012, the rate in Wales was 24.9 pmp. Detailed cost-benefit analyses were published by the Welsh Government in 2012 as part of their Regulatory Impact Assessment. Net savings forecast, over a ten-year period, were: £3.392m per additional kidney transplant; £5.624m per additional liver transplant; £2.434m per additional heart transplant; £0.65m per additional lung transplant. The figures were calculated using transplant related costs against savings of medical management, to which quality-adjusted life year benefits (calculated by the UK Department of Health in 2006) were added. More people are on the waiting list for organ donation than organs are available. In Wales, 33 people died in 2012/13 while waiting for an organ. In September 2012, 237 people in Wales were on the waiting list for an organ. In 2011/12, 67 people became organ donors in Welsh hospitals. Potentially, each donor could provide up to nine organs for transplant. The Welsh Government hope organ donation rates will increase by 25 per cent following the introduction of a soft opt-out system. According to those in favour of presumed-consent, an opt-out system increases the number of organs available for transplant. However, according to those in favour of an opt-in system, no evidence exists to show an increase following such a change to the organ donation system. Organ Donation Taskforce In 2006, The UK Government set up the Organ Donation Taskforce (ODTF), to \\"consider the barriers to organ donation and make recommendations on how they could be overcome\\". The ODTF was asked: to take stock of progress within the context of the UK's ten year transplant framework (published in 2003); to identify barriers to organ donation; and to recommend what action needed to be taken to increase organ donation and procurement. The ODTF's first report, ‘Organs for Transplants’, published in January 2008, made 14 recommendations for improvements to donation infrastructure, including better identification and improved referral and care of donors, by which they anticipated a 50 per cent increase in organ donation in the UK within five years. No recommendations were made on the system of consent. Following their report, the UK Health Minister asked the ODTF to extend their work, to consider whether presumed consent should be introduced throughout the UK. The ODTF's second report, published in November 2008, unanimously opposed a change in the law to a system of presumed consent. Considering legislation Kidney Wales Foundation petitioned the National Assembly for Wales, in 2007, to increase the number of organ donors in Wales. The Assembly's Petitions Committee invited Kidney Wales Foundation to present oral evidence and, subsequently referred the matter to the Assembly's Health, Wellbeing and Local Government Committee, requesting that they consider the issue of presumed consent. The Committee presented its report, Inquiry into Presumed Consent for Organ Donation, in July 2008. The report was critical of UK Transplant (UKT). Noting that substantial sums were provided to UKT by the Welsh Government, the committee put forward three recommendations to ensure the needs of Wales were met. These included requiring UKT to comply with the Welsh Language Act 1993; the report noted that UKT had made no provision for Welsh speakers and the only Welsh language literature produced by UKT was the organ donor card. No suggestion was made, however, \\"that organs harvested in Wales should not continue to be made available across the UK\\". A number of recommendations were made in the report, including implementing the UK \\"ODTF recommendations in full in Wales as a matter of urgency\\". Although most of the Committee agreed with presumed consent in principle, their report did not recommend that the Assembly should seek to introduce of a system of presumed consent \\"at this stage\\". Of the nine committee members, six voted against proposing a presumed consent system: Jonathan Morgan (Chair) (Conservative (Con)); Lorraine Barrett (Labour (Lab)); Irene James (Lab); Ann Jones (Lab); Val Lloyd (Lab); and Nick Ramsay (Con). Three voted in its favour; Helen Mary Jones (Plaid Cymru (PC)); Dr Dai Lloyd (PC); and Jenny Randerson (Liberal Democrat). In September 2008, Edwina Hart, Minister for Health and Social Care, rejected the committee's main recommendation, saying it did not reflect the weight of public opinion in favour of presumed consent. Hart confirmed the Welsh Government's intention to keep a change to the law under \\"active consideration\\". Nationwide public debates, held between October 2008 and January 2009, sought to gauge public opinion on whether Wales should become the first UK country to introduce an opt-out system. The Welsh Government's public consultation paper, Options for Changes to the Organ Donation System in Wales published in May 2009, concluded that public opinion favoured change to a soft opt-out system. Further public consultation in 2009 showed \\"strong public support\\" for legislative change, encouraging Hart to propose introducing a presumed consent organ donation system in Wales. Legislative progress The Welsh Government announced their intention, in December 2009, to submit a Legislative Competence Order (LCO) introducing a soft opt-out system of presumed consent organ donation in Wales. This was confirmed by Carwyn Jones, First Minister of Wales, when he set out the Government's 2010/11 legislative programme. An LCO proposing to transfer legislative powers for organ donation from the UK Parliament in Westminster to the National Assembly was introduced by the Welsh Government on 10 January 2011, as The National Assembly for Wales (Legislative Competence) (Health and Health Services) Order 2011). In a referendum on 3 March 2011, Wales voted in favour of extending the law-making powers of its National Assembly. This allowed primary law to be made in the Senedd, freeing the Assembly from the requirement to seek permission from Westminster for an LCO before it could enact legislation on devolved matters. Consequently, on 9 March 2013, Edwina Hart, Minister for Health and Social Services, withdrew the LCO from consideration by the Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Affairs Committee in London. An impending Assembly election required that the Assembly be dissolved before the 5 May 2011 polling day. Believing insufficient time remained to write and consider a new bill before the Assembly's dissolution, Hart urged the next government to pursue new primary legislation permitting the system of presumed consent organ donation that she favoured. Three of the four main parties (Plaid Cymru, Welsh Labour and Welsh Liberal Democrats) included a commitment to introduce an opt-out system for organ donation in their 2011 election manifestos. Following the election, which returned Labour as the largest party, Carwyn Jones included an \\"Organ Donation Bill to create an opt-out system of organ donation\\" among the legislative priorities set out by the new Welsh Government in July 2011. In the First Minister's Legislative Programme statement, Jones told the Assembly the government would introduce a bill by the end of 2011, \\"with a view to a new soft opt-out system being implemented in 2015\\". =White paper= A white paper proposing introducing a soft opt-out system of organ donation in Wales was published by the Welsh Government in November 2011. Its aim was to increase the number of organs available for donation, explaining that under the prevailing opt-in system, suitable organs were often not used because the deceased had not signed the NHS organ donor register (ODR). It said only 31 per cent of people in Wales were included on the ODR. It cited 25 to 30 per cent higher organ donation rates in countries using a soft opt-out system. The white paper proposed permitting the removal of organs and tissue for transplant of adults who had lived and died in Wales, unless they had objected during their lifetime. Under the proposals, the deceased's relatives would be involved in any decision to remove organs. The white paper invited responses to its proposals. Over the 12 week consultation period, 1,234 responses were received, which the Welsh Government published in March and April 2012. The public consultation included 13 meetings held across Wales. Of the responses stating a view, 52 per cent were in favour of the proposals, and 39 per cent against. A BBC Cymru Wales/ICM poll (of 1,000 people) held in March 2012 showed 63 per cent were in favour of the proposals, and 31 per cent against. =Draft Bill= Further consultation was sought on the Welsh Government's Draft Human Transplantation (Wales) Bill and Explanatory Memorandum, published in June 2012. The 12 week consultation elicited 2,977 responses, a summary of which was published in October 2012 (updated December 2012). Of the 2,977 responses, 2,688 were identical or similar letters from (whom Dr Chris Jones NHS Wales medical director described as) \\"lobbying organisations\\" concerning the definition of brain-stem death, which would not change under the proposals. =Stage one= The Human Transplantation (Wales) Bill was laid before the National Assembly for Wales on 4 December 2012, by Lesley Griffiths, Minister for Health and Social Services. The bill's purpose was to establish a soft opt-out system, applying to people aged 18 and over who had lived in Wales for more than six months. Griffiths emphasised medical staff would not add to the families' distress by insisting on taking organs from their deceased relatives, despite families having no legal right of veto. The Welsh Government also published further research giving evidence of \\"an association\\" between opt-out laws and increased rates of organ donation, of 13–18 per cent. Noting that research showed that knowing the deceased's wishes were the main determining factor of their family's decision to agree to organ donation, Griffiths announced the Heart to heart campaign, aiming to encourage families to ensure their wishes for organ donation were known to each other. Mark Drakeford, Minister for Health and Social Services since March 2013, moved the motion to agree the General Principles of the Human Transplantation (Wales) Bill in the Assembly on 16 April 2013. Addressing the \\"serious concerns\\" raised by the Health and Social Care Committee about the role of the deceased's family in the decision to donate organs, Drakeford said the Bill would be amended to provide a \\"clear right of objection for family members, where they can confirm that a potential donor would not have wished donation to take place\\". The Motion was agreed: For 41; Against 9; Abstain 5. =Stage two= The Health and Social Care Committee considered amendments to the bill on 22 May 2013. Of the 42 amendments considered, 22 were agreed, including extending the period of residency in Wales for deemed consent to apply, from six to twelve months. The living donation criteria for those \\"lacking the capacity to consent to donation” was confirmed to apply only if donation were in the best interests of the potential donor. =Stage three= Amendments to the bill, as agreed in committee, were debated and disposed of in the Senedd, on 2 July 2013. =Stage four= The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 2 July 2013, following discussion in the Senedd of four and three quarter hours. =Royal assent= The bill was given royal assent on 10 September 2013, becoming the Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013. Exemptions Over 70 amendments to the bill were discussed before the bill was passed, several of which were agreed. Other transplants, including of limbs and face, would be exempt from the final regulations, which at the time of the bill, had yet to be completed.

Life  Johann Adolf was the youngest son of Frederick II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha- Altenburg and Magdalene Augusta of Anhalt-Zerbst. Since 1735 the prince was educated in Geneva and joined the Danish military service in 1739. On his Grand Tour he visited his sister Augusta in the United Kingdom where he also obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Oxford. In 1743 he moved to the Saxon army to become holder of a regiment the following year and fought at the Battle of Hohenfriedberg. He became major general in 1746 and established his headquarter in Naumburg. In 1748 he obtained the Polish Order of the White Eagle and became Saxon lieutenant general in 1753. During The Seven Years' War he was captured be the Prussian Army and had to swear not to fight the Prussians further before being released. Later, the Prussian Army tried to absorb his regiment. Johann Adolf retired to Eisenberg where he had the house Markt 25 built in 1750. In 1756 he had built Schloss Friedrichstanneck nearby. After Prince Joseph of Saxe-Hildburghausen died in 1787 he became Elder of the Ernestine line of the House of Wettin, a position already hold by his older brother Frederick III until his death in 1772. Because of this position he obtained Oldisleben territory. After Johann Adolf died in 1799 Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld became Elder of Ernestine Wettin and received the Oldisleben territory. Johann Adolf is buried at the chapel of Christiansburg Castle in Eisenberg. Schloss Friedrichstanneck Markt 25, Eisenberg  Marriage and Issue  The Ernestine duchies of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg and Saxe-Weimar considered a marriage between Johann Adolf and Princess Ernestine Albertine of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, daughter of Ernest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach.

Biography  Born on the Via Mazzini in Milan, Barbieri's family were fabric wholesalers, and his father owned a department store. He performed in amateur dramatics in the mid-1950s, forming \\"The Trio\\", a performance troupe with his friends. Barbieri also had a non-speaking role in Luchino Visconti's film Medea. He was influenced by cinema at an early age and photographed models in 1960s Rome, part of the social scene that was portrayed in Federico Fellini's 1960 film La Dolce Vita. A self-taught photographer, his first professional work was an apprenticeship to the Harper's Bazaar photographer Tom Kublin, who died twenty days later. In 1963 Barbieri had some images published in the Italian fashion magazine Novità, which became Vogue Italia in 1965. Barbieri also shot for the American and French editions of Vogue. The role of fashion editor had not been fully created in the 1960s, and Barbieri had to find the best setting for his photographs and create the hairstyles, makeup, and jewellery. This could led to the use of unusual materials, a notable example being earrings made with table tennis balls painted in a mother-of-pearl colour. Barbieri opened his own studio in Milan in 1964, and began to work closely with ready-to-wear fashion designers a few years later. His creative relationship with Walter Albini led to an appreciation of the role of the stylist, and Barbieri and the fashion designer Valentino were responsible for innovations in modern fashion advertising campaigns. Notable models that Barbieri has photographed include Mirella Petteni, Jerry Hall, Veruschka, Monica Bellucci and Audrey Hepburn. Barbieri has worked for fashion designers Armani, Versace and Ferré, and Dolce & Gabbana, Pomellato, and Giuseppe Zanotti. In the 1990s Barbieri became a travel photographer. An exhibition of Barbieri's work was curated by the English fashion photographer David Bailey, shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Kunstforum in Vienna. Barbieri photographs in analog and does not retouch his pictures. One of his early cameras was a Reflex Voigtländer 35mm. In 1968 he was awarded the Biancamano Prize as Best Italian Photographer and was named one of the 14 best international fashion photographers by the German magazine Stern in 1978.

Background McMichael grew up in Adelaide, and graduated in medicine from the University of Adelaide (1961-1967). As a student he spent a summer volunteering at a leprosy colony in New Delhi, India where he saw how patients were treated as social outcasts suffering from the stigma of a disfiguring disease although they were no longer contagious. The following year, whilst on a similar service trip to Papua New Guinea he met social sciences student Judith Healy, whom he married shortly after graduation. They had 2 children. He was elected president of the National Union of Students, based in Melbourne, in 1968. After 18 months in general practice, he was invited to become the PhD student of Professor Basil Hetzel at the new department of social and preventive medicine, Monash University in Victoria, graduating in 1972. Studying factors that influenced the mental health of undergraduate students, he gained skills in epidemiological research. He also showed early evidence of independent inquiry informed by reading the works of thinkers such as Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich who questioned the capacity of the Earth to support a growing world population with increasing consumption of resources. He then worked at the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, studying the health of workers in the tyre industry. Returning to Australia he worked for CSIRO and then became the Foundation Chair in Occupational and Environmental Health at the University of Adelaide from 1986 until 1994. In 1994-2001 he was Professor of Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, before returning to Australia to follow Prof Bob Douglas as the director of the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population HealthNational Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, nceph.anu.edu.au at the Australian National University in Canberra. Most recently he held an NHMRC Australia Fellowship at the ANU, where he also ran the Environment, Climate, and Health research program. McMichael was chair of think tank The Australia Institute. Scholarly contributions McMichael coined the term the 'Healthy Worker Effect' (later extended by others to similar phenomena such as the 'Healthy Migrant effect'), a statistical fiction that tended to overestimate the good health of populations working in noxious industries. His study established a link between benzene exposure and leukemia among tyre builders.http://www.pnas.org/content/109/18/6787.fullMcMichael AJ (1976) \\"Standardized mortality ratios and the 'healthy worker effect': Scratching beneath the surface\\".

(1988) \\"Port Pirie Cohort Study: Environmental exposure to lead and children's abilities at the age of four years\\". N Engl J Med 319:468–475 His work, and two other studies, were instrumental in the phasing out of lead in more than 100 countries. Increasingly interested in underlying causes of illness, he exposed the effects of passive smoking, and also the effects of UV radiation in creating lower rates of multiple sclerosis, which has a higher incidence in populations towards the poles. UV exposure lessens immune system activity, including misdirected \\"autoimmune\\" attacks on the body tissues.McMichael AJ, Hall AJ (1997) \\"Does immunosuppressive ultraviolet radiation explain the latitude gradient for multiple sclerosis?\\" Epidemiology 8:642–645. In later years, and particularly after returning to Australia in 2001, he worked on the health effects of climate change.Anthony J. McMichael and Keith B. G. Dear (2010) \\"Climate change: Heat, health, and longer horizons\\" PNAS 107 (21): 9483-9484 He had always been influenced by ideas of anthropogenic crises, first population growth and latterly of general planetary overload. He argued that a warming world would have significant negative effects on human health. He said \\"Climate change is not just about disruptions to the local economy or loss of jobs or loss of iconic species. It's actually about weakening the foundations the life support systems that we depend on as a human species.\\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/18/6787.full His team showed that tens of thousands of people were dying each year from climate-induced flooding, malnutrition, and infectious diseases.McMichael AJ, et al.

At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Kukës. Novosej is inhabited by Albanians, whereas many of the surrounding villages are populated by Slavic-speaking Muslims of the Gorani people. The region was isolated until 1978, when a road was built from Kukës to Shishtavec, which provided a link to the city of Kukës and the national highway. With no subsequent investment in the road, its condition deteriorated, but an initiative in 2012 resulted in it being upgraded, and a extension being built. There were proposals for an additional , to open up the area, and this was funded by German development grants. In addition to the road, the initiative, which was administered by the Albanian Development Fund, provided a water supply for Novosej and the nearby villages of Borje, Shtrezë and Oreshkë. The village is located in the Shishtaveci Alps, an area with hiking trails, forests, and waterfalls, and as well as providing access to Kukës, the road has enabled tourism to develop, while the water supply has assisted the development of agriculture and livestock farming. The establishment of small hotels and other types of accommodation for tourists has become a source of extra income for local people. The village holds a traditional celebration of \\"Saint George\\" each May. This has been encouraged by the Rural Association Support Programme, a not-for-profit organisation established in 1997 to promote sustainable development and tourism in Albania. Several sporting events are held on the first day of the festival, including horse riding, wrestling and football. In the afternoon, \\"potka\\" are collected, accompanied by music and dancing. \\"Potka\\" consists of fresh leaves from the white birch tree, and these are placed in water, together with eggs, and the water is then used to wash children. After this, the potka are placed in items of importance, such as houses, gardens and cars, and the following morning are taken to agricultural holdings. The 2009 festival was supported by many from other villages in the region, together with visitors from other parts of Albania and abroad. To the west of the village is the Novosej oak-forest, some of oak woods, situated at an altitude of over above sea level. The trees, of type Quercus Pubescence, have grown there naturally, but at an altitude much higher than is normal for the species. To the south of the village, near to the Lake of Novosej reservoir, is another forest at a similar altitude, this one covering and consisting of birch trees. The extent of the forest is unusual, and such large areas of natural birch forest are only found in the Kukës region, and are on Albania's red list, because the habitat is so rare. Novosej is very close to the border with Kosovo, and during the Kosovo War of 1998 and 1999, it is estimated that some 3,350 missiles fired in Kosovo crossed the border and landed in the Kukës prefecture. During a prolonged bombardment lasting for 79 days, Novosej was one of 11 villages in Kukës which suffered damage from the stray missiles, as well as 14 in the Has district and 14 in the Tropojë district.

He was born in Loughborough, Leicestershire and died at Branksome, Poole, Dorset. Armstrong was a right-handed middle-order batsman and an irregular right-arm medium-pace bowler. He came rather late to first-class cricket, playing just a single match in the 1919 season and then not re-appearing until 1926, when he was 33. He then played for the first team regularly right up to the start of the Second World War, when he was 46, and even re-appeared in non-first-class matches played at the end of the war in 1945, when he was 52. Every single one of his 386 first-class games was played for Leicestershire; his period of greatest success came after he was 40 and he was never selected for a representative game of any kind. Cricket career After Armstrong's single unsuccessful appearance as an amateur in 1919, he disappeared into club cricket in Loughborough, but in 1924 he re-emerged in a single match as an all-rounder as Leicestershire entered its second team in the Minor Counties competition, though he was injured in the game. The establishment of a second team in the Minor Counties was part of a series of moves intended to produce a stronger team for what had traditionally been one of the weaker English counties; the moves included the appointment of the club's first full-time coach, the former Surrey and England player Ernie Hayes, and the recruitment of new professionals. Armstrong was cited then and later as a player who had benefited from this coaching and the more professional set-up. In 1926, he was taken on to the county staff and though he made only one score of more than 50, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that \\"he did sufficient to suggest that for him the future has considerable possibilities\\". A year later, Wisden was able to report that \\"Armstrong so fully realised the promise given during his first season with the county that he added 500 runs to his aggregate, and ten to his average, besides getting his first 100 and exceeding the 1,000 in all matches\\". The century was 113 not out against Northamptonshire made in 225 minutes. It was the first of 36 career centuries, all of them made for Leicestershire and the 1013 runs he made in 1927 were followed by 12 further seasons in which he exceeded 1000 runs. Armstrong moved up to bat at No 3 in 1928 and retained that place in the batting order for the next 12 seasons. Against Yorkshire he took 400 minutes to score 186 as Wilfred Rhodes bowled 69.3 overs to take six wickets for 169 runs; but Leicestershire made Yorkshire follow on and that in games between those two teams was seen as a triumph for Leicestershire. He topped the Leicestershire batting averages in that season and did so again in four other years: 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1939. In 1933, at the age of 40, Armstrong became the first Leicestershire player to score more than 2,000 runs in a season when he made 2112 runs at an average of 43.10. It was a very poor season for Leicestershire and they finished bottom of the County Championship for the first time (they had been jointly at the bottom twice before). Leicestershire's improvement and a slightly wetter season accounted for a fall in his aggregate in 1934 – he played 10 fewer innings in the season than he had in 1933 – but he maintained his average at 42.52. He averaged more than 40 again in 1937, though Les Berry was higher in the averages, and in 1939 he was top of the Leicestershire table again, though once more it was in a season when the county finished at the bottom of the Championship. Armstrong played fairly regularly in and around Leicester during the Second World War and appeared in some non-first-class county matches in 1945 when the war was over. But when first-class cricket resumed in 1946 he was 53 and he did not play again. At the time of his death in 1990, he was recorded as the second-oldest surviving first-class cricketer. Cricket style Armstrong's first century in 1927 took 225 minutes and his highest career score of 186 a year later stretched over more than six-and-a-half hours, but at that stage in his career he was not thought of as a dour batsman: \\"Attractive in style, his offside play was enterprising without being unduly risky,\\" Wisden noted in 1928. Six years later, after Armstrong had enjoyed his most successful season with the bat and become the first Leicestershire player to score 2000 runs in a season, the praise was less wholehearted: \\"While Armstrong could not in any sense be termed a stylish batsman,\\" Wisden wrote, \\"his extremely sound defence proved very valuable among so many unreliable run-getters.\\" There are similar comments in several other issues of Wisden across the 1930s. The only note of dissent from this came in the report of Leicestershire's cricket in what proved to be Armstrong's last season, 1939, when he was 46. \\"The batting never rose to great heights but the complete change of style shown by Armstrong came as a revelation,\\" Wisden reported. \\"Previously a useful, rigid, defensive batsman, Armstrong last year began bringing off strokes which previously he scarcely ever produced. He played a number of really attractive innings and became the most consistent man on the side.\\" A later comment in his Wisden obituary reflects in part Armstrong's later role at Leicestershire, when runs were scarce and the money to buy new batsmen was not available. Observing that Armstrong had benefited from Hayes' coaching, it wrote: \\"His defence, later to become rock-like, was tightened up, but wisely no attempt was made to interfere with his highly idiosyncratic array of scoring strokes on the leg side, of which the most telling was a species of short-arm hook in front of square. For the rest of his runs he relied on a variety of pushes, nudges and prods, executed at the last minute just as the frustrated bowler thought he had broken through.\\" His obituary in Wisden concluded: \\"Owing to his inflexible determination at the crease, and the frequency with which he rescued a lost cause in a weak batting side, he came to be known as 'the Valiant Armstrong'.\\" References Category:1892 births Category:1990 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Leicestershire cricketers ","title":"Norman Armstrong"},{"id":"39859203","text":"Calumia is a genus of fishes in the family Eleotridae native to the marine waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean.

His religious writings, social critiques, and homilies on post-war society were acclaimed in the United States, England, and in Canada, receiving praise from intellectuals such as Albert Jay Nock, T. S. Eliot, Richard M. Weaver, and Russell Kirk. Featured on the cover of Time magazine as America's \\"brilliant maverick,\\" he authored over 20 books and numerous articles appearing in The New York Times, The Atlantic, The Criterion, Scribner's, and Commonweal. For the majority of his career, he toured and lectured at universities such as Harvard, Oxford, Yale, Columbia, Chicago, and Princeton as well as \\"almost every cathedral in England.\\"  Life  = Early Years and Education = Bernard Iddings Bell was born in Dayton, Ohio, the second of four children to Charles Wright Bell, a paper manufacturer, and Valentia Bell, née Iddings. His siblings were Florence, Myrta, and Alfred. They were of Portuguese descent. Several early experiences helped to shape Bell's \\"maverick\\" ideas and character. Russell Kirk, author of The Conservative Mind and friend of Bell, related the following anecdote in memoria: > In educating his only son (who died at the threshold of manhood), in > extensive travel, and in devotion to his ordained duties as a priest, he > spent his money as it came: and that on principle. For when Bell was a > little boy, he learned something from his grandmother. His grandparents, > straitened in their means, had been frugal, saving all their lives to build > and furnish a house to their liking. In old age they achieved their end, and > their house was built and well furnished; and just then Bell's grandmother > discovered that she was suffering from an incurable malignant cancer. Put to > bed, she had her grandson called in, and said this to him: \\"Bernard, your > grandfather tells me that they are going to put me under drugs soon, and > then I will not be able to talk to you. So I want to tell you now what I > have learnt from life. I have had a long life and a rather hard one, and I > have learnt this: Never save any money.\\" Charles and Valentia raised their children in the Episcopal Church, which at the time was considered evangelical but by the 1930s \\"would probably be given the name Fundamentalist.\\" Bell recalled that as a child, his mother once told him that God was in Heaven and that Heaven was \\"up there,\\" so he imagined God to be a silvering gentleman who lived on the roof and looked like \\"a somewhat glorified copy of my paternal grandfather.\\" However, this mental picture gradually lost its vividness and dissolved into \\"a vague aura, a spiritual influence, a permeating benevolence.\\" The midnight of December 31, 1899, Charles Bell gathered his children together to give thanks for the coming century, whose blessings of technology and modernism, he believed, would bring about a more enlightened, peaceful world. In A Man Can Live Bell recalled, \\"[My father] was quite sure that the modern world was wise, sound in structure, giver of all good. We children too were sure of it. Our friends were sure of it. What we heard and read made us more sure of it. Our teachers were sure of it. Even our priests, preachers, rabbis were sure of it.\\" Struck by this vision of human salvation, he became profoundly disillusioned with the church and ceased praying, except intermittently and perfunctorily. When he had completed his freshman year of college, the religion of his childhood \\"had been demolished.\\" He spent much of the time experimenting \\"in the philosophical realm, looking for a sane theory of life\\" and at one point briefly adopted scientific mechanism or materialism; however, it too fell short of being an adequate motivation for living. Failing to find guidance from either his professors, the religious leaders on campus, or the writings of modern philosophers, he declared them all \\"blind leaders of the blind\\" and \\"hair-splitting pedants.\\" It was soon thereafter that Bell made the acquaintance of an Anglo-Catholic priest who oversaw a nearby parish. Though he was initially uncomfortable with the high church vestments and traditions, the priest > had a winsomeness that came from inner peace. He did not bother much to > argue with me. He quite understood that my literalistic and legalistic > Protestantism had to go. He also understood why I, at least, could not > become a Roman Catholic...

At the age of 21, Bell graduated with a bachelor's degree in social history from the University of Chicago. For a brief period he worked as \\"a paddy- wagon-chasing newspaper reporter.\\" When he finally decided to pursue his calling to the priesthood, his father, who was then a vestryman, lamented: \\"I am very sorry that a son of mine should become a parasite.\\" The following year, he entered Western Theological Seminary to study sacred theology, but found himself \\"more than a little oppressed by the stifling smell of controversies long dead.\\" It was then that he stumbled upon G.K Chesterton's Orthodoxy. He identified with Chesterton, having also formulated his own theology, only to find it \\"a dull copy of a more brilliant orthodoxy.\\" He particularly praised the way it portrayed the Christian religion as rising above pure rationality, confirming both the empirical nature of science and the invisible, unquantifiable mysteries of human life. He was ordained to the priesthood on the Feast of St. Thomas the Doubter in 1910, and graduated with his second bachelor's in 1912. He was the first vicar and builder of St. Christopher's Church in Oak Park, Illinois from 1910 to 1913. = St. Paul's Cathedral = In the summer of 1912, the venerated Bishop Charles Chapman Grafton died, leaving behind a legacy as well as high expectations for his replacement at St. Paul's Cathedral, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Bell was instituted as vicar and first-ever dean of St. Paul's in 1913 and remained there until 1918. He married Elizabeth Woods Lee, and they gave birth to their only child Bernard Lee Bell in 1913. The next year, he wrote an article titled \\"The Dynamite of the Sacraments\\" describing some of the practical theology which formed the basis of his decision to join the U.S. Navy during World War I.  First World War  Bell served as a chaplain in the United States Navy for twenty months from February 1917 to November 1918 in the Great Lakes Naval Training Station located near North Chicago in Lake County, Illinois. At first, he was denied enlistment due to a medical issue; however, as new conscripts flooded in at an increasing rate, \\"tent cities sprouted up\\" on the 165-acre compound (by the end of the War 45,000 recruits were living in a space designed for 1,500). This created a shortage of commissioned land chaplains, prompting Rear Admiral William A. Moffat to make an exception. During his time there, Bell oversaw roughly 87,000 of the total 125,000 recruits, preaching on Sundays to congregations ranging from 3,000-7,000, teaching a total of 267 courses on morals and religion, and holding daily office hours \\"to which men came with problems ranging from how to believe in God to how to get a dance invitation.\\" In March 1918, the first case of Spanish influenza cropped up in Fort Riley, Kansas, and soon the pandemic was sweeping America, ultimately claiming the lives of 700,000 Americans and 50 million worldwide. In this state of emergency, Bell found himself frequently providing Communion in barracks and visiting hospitals to perform last rites. Meanwhile, his first book Right and Wrong After the War was published prior to the war's end, thus establishing the \\"prophetic\\" voice and style for which he is known.  Challenge to Christianity's Decline  Throughout his time in the Navy, Bell enjoyed informal meetings with both individuals and \\"small groups who were willing to sit around and talk about religion.\\" And it was here that he was first confronted by the young men's overall passivity toward religion. He confessed that, like many clergy in the church, he had believed that \\"the great mass of the people...was to be regarded as without any religion at all.\\" However, this proved not to be the case: > The discovery I made, which came to me at once as a challenge and as an > encouragement, was that most of the non-interest was due, not to deliberate > disbelief or even to indifference, but rather to plain ignorance. They had, > for the most part, scarcely any idea what the Christian religion was all > about...It does not seem quite reasonable that four out of five of our young > people should never have learned what Christianity, in its essence, really > is. We seem to have been astonishingly inefficient in passing on the Faith. According to Bell, the essential truths of Christianity had been lost in a \\"mass of non-essential facts, alleged facts, and discarded 'facts' of a more or less religious flavor.\\" Rather than possessing a useful religion which helped in hardship, theirs was a weak collection of Bible stories, moral lessons, unanswered doubts, and negative-to-neutral impressions of churchgoing. Understandably, these men had come to view religion as well intended, but otherwise useless to their faith. Bell worked out an explanation of the Christian religion to address directly their questions and anxieties. He sought to use as little theological terminology as possible, reasoning that people did not despise religion for religion's sake, but that they disliked hearing a jargon-rich language which they could not understand. Encouraged by the men's predominantly positive response, he later delivered it as a series of lectures in New England before being prompted again to set it down in book form under the title The Good News. It became the bedrock of Bell's ministry, and he dedicated the remainder of his life to training men and women in the basics of the Christian religion. = Bard College = At the age of 34, Bell became the youngest president of St. Stephen's College (now Bard College) in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where he would remain from 1919 to 1933. While there, he was made head of the philosophy department at Columbia University and honored with a Doctor of Letters. He published Beyond Agnosticism in 1929, which addressed common college-age doubts, with a dedication to his son, Bernard Lee, who was preparing for higher education.  Initial Fame and Progress  When Bell arrived to St. Stephen's College, the school was racked with massive debt, 29 students were enrolled, the buildings were in disrepair, and there were nine faculty members running all its programs. His wife Betty, after witnessing the overgrown campus and derelict presidential house, confessed to wondering if her husband was insane to take on the job. Bell himself admitted to accepting the position, among other reasons, in order to put an educational theory of his \\"on the ground\\". The administration hoped that Bell's recent fame and youthful energy would revive St. Stephen's, especially since Right and Wrong After the War (1918) and Work of the Church for Men at War (1919) were then some of the most discussed books in America. According to former Bard College president Reamer Kline, \\"Word of the St. Stephen's educational program and its theological base was carried to outside world in one of the most phenomenal, one-man PR campaigns in the history of American religion and higher education.\\" Before commencing the school year, Bell solicited acquaintances from the Navy, returning veterans, and brought the enrollment up to 49. He fired six faculty and personally hired a colorful assortment of professors based primarily on their \\"note and standing\\" in addition to being excellent teachers and learned men. With the help of the Board of Trustees, he doubled the size of the campus, quadrupled the budget, and built drama and athletics programs as well as one of the first sociology programs in America. All this he fueled through constant speaking engagements: appearing on college campuses, cathedrals, suburban and urban parishes, large seminars, and most effectively, national radio. It was not long before \\"his name became a household word to thousands of people who had never themselves set eyes on him. He was certainly the most widely known, most listened-to, and most influential American clergyman of his generation and very possibly of [the twentieth century].\\"  Prophet of Postmodernism  Since the 1880s, the word 'postmodern' had been used infrequently to describe movements in architecture and the visual arts. When Bell published Postmodernism and Other Essays in 1926, he reimagined and popularized the term to denote the historical era following modernity. However, the subject did not enter the academic sphere until Arnold J. Toynbee's 1939 article, \\"Our own Post-Modern Age has been inaugurated by the general war of 1914–1918.\\" The central argument of Postmodernism and Other Essays is that all aspects of Modernity––politics, religion, science, philosophy, technology, history, education––had failed and would give rise to widespread resentment and agnosticism, not only concerning God but every human authority. This would serve as the catalyst for change. The successful postmodernist would subject everything Modernity had accepted as \\"truth\\" or \\"reality\\" to rigorous questioning and thereby return to the path of Truth. The unsuccessful would remain spiritually malnourished, and vainly pursue various ends in the hopes of fulfillment. Should the latter prevail, truth would once again become subjective, and people would become historically ignorant, rudderless: > Who will pioneer if there can be found no sure approach to Truth? Who cares > to blaze new trails if all trails lead alike to nowhere? If we can never > know what we are or why we are, how is leadership possible? Who dares lead > anybody anywhere if no one may first be sure? One outgrowth of widespread subjective truth is the necessity of tolerance. Without it, peace is impossible among so many personal convictions. Bell believed that tolerance marked \\"the decay of old standards rather than formation of new ones\\" in civilization; the succeeding intolerance was a constructive force, though often accompanied by intellectual strife and violence. He points to the tolerance which led to \\"violent contentions\\" in ancient Rome and 18th century France as examples. Under these conditions, a person's truths might conform to the pressure of crowd sentiments––the danger being that \\"tolerance might destroy within us the capacity for constructive thought and determined action\\" and cause us to act on personal feelings and crowd-think alone. Such a society in America would likely be cynical, over- organized, bored with easily accessible pleasures, and devote itself as heartily and unthinkingly to commercialism as ancient Rome did to imperialism.  1926 Student Strike  In March 1926, three-quarters of the student body ceased attending classes or Chapel, stating that they would do so until president Bell resigned. The strike lasted ten tensely uncomfortable days until spring recess began. For some time, student resentment had been building towards the president's high standards, his over-involvement in campus minutia, and his perceived arrogance about his achievements. In the dining commons, Bell publicly chastised several students for their conduct in Chapel. Kline speculates that he may have been more irritable and dealt more harshly that day, having recently returned from a serious operation on his thyroid. However it may be, certain students gathered signatures and submitted a petition that administration release disciplinary power to a joint committee of students and faculty. Bell ignored the petition and left for his Sunday speaking engagement at Union College, only to return to the strike. Over the next ten days, there were faculty meetings and student gatherings, formal and informal, as well as \\"gossip, publicity, and newspaper articles.\\" Bell rejected the petition outright and tried unsuccessfully to expel the students who had led the strike. His inflexibility on the matter imparted a general attitude among the students, being that Bell had made himself an obstacle and that only his resignation could end the strike. This, however, was not to be the case. During spring recess, some of the remaining students and faculty met with the Trustees, who ultimately decided that disciplinary authority would be delegated to the pertinent party: faculty in academic matters, the bursar in financial, and the chaplain in Chapel. This arrangement seemed to resolve the issue, although enrollment fell by 27 students the next fall. Beneath the surface, the real trouble centered around Fr. Jack Bray, the athletic director, who had been falsely endorsing tuition notes for a small group of athletes from the S A E Fraternity. Bray, along with another liable staff member, had covertly influenced certain students to submit the petition. Looking back on the incident 25 years later, Bell wrote in a letter: > The famous 'strike' was an interesting phenomenon. It was hard to deal with, > because as with most such student performances, the undergraduates were > manipulated by a few unscrupulous members of the faculty. The poor boys > thought that they were fighting for democracy, whereas in reality they were > fighting to get rid of the president who had become dangerous to some > members of the staff, and who was about to recommend the dismissal, for > cause, of two of them...The Board of Trustees let it ride, and finally was > able to dissolve it and show the students responsible for leading it, that > they had been 'used' by the two professors. Both these men were dismissed.  Bernard Lee Bell  Bernard Lee was six years old when his father was hired to St. Stephens and the family moved from Wisconsin to New York. According to Kline, people's impressions of him ranged from \\"the most brilliant boy I have ever known\\" to \\"very dumb.\\" He was unhappy in school, vacillating between in-home tutoring and attending a series private and public institutions: Red Hook Central schools, an academy in Cornwall, Connecticut, and Choate. Nevertheless, Bell was immensely proud of him and foresaw nearly limitless potential. For instance, upon receiving a poor report card from Bernard Lee's high school, Bell wrote: > Your marks, except in Geography, are not very good but I am inclined to > think that they are reasonably satisfactory with the exception of > Arithmetic. In your examination you showed a good knowledge of the rules and > principles of Arithmetic, according to Mr. Shrives, but ruined your paper by > sheer carelessness in multiplication and division... You are like me in > this, you see large principles easily but are impatient in application to > details. I have always been so. When I was a boy, I was more so than you > are. The study of Arithmetic and, later on, the study of Algebra and > Geometry did more to break me of this carelessness and inattention to small > things than all my studies put together... I am glad to know that you have a > good head. A person can learn to attend to the details but a 'dumbell' can > never learn to think. I am glad to know that you can think. We are looking > forward to having you back home next week! While at Choate, Bernard Lee's health mysteriously began to fail. He received several inconclusive diagnoses such as \\"discouragement, rheumatism, sugar in the urine, or a heart problem.\\" The doctors cautioned him to cease competitive sports, sleep on the first floor of his dormitory, get a full night's rest, and carefully restrict his diet. However, none of these worked; his health continued to affect his studies, and he was sent home. For his final year of life, he studied under private tutors–mostly faculty from St. Stephen's–and was considering a career in medicine. Then he died unexpectedly four days after contracting meningitis. He was 17 years old. Bell claimed that there were \\"two blows from which he never recovered\\": the student strike of 1926 and his son's death in 1930. In a letter to a friend, Bell wrote: > It seemed to me at first that I could not bear his going. He was more than a > son to me. He was an understanding friend such as I shall never have > again...His life judged by quality rather than by quantity of achievement, > was a true success, and for what more can a parent ask?

I cannot grieve that the boy is dead, —but I am most horribly lonely > at times, for all that.  Resignation  After Bernard Lee's death, tensions between Bell and the Board of Trustees came to a head. Despite his success in improving the college's standing, it was still short of funding when the Great Depression hit in 1929. The Trustees pressured Bell, who was already in the habit of overextending his presidential role, to that of financier. He found various ways to enroll more students from diverse backgrounds and improve existing programs in the social and natural sciences. It was not enough. They asked him to focus primarily on obtaining donations and forego teaching, though he believed teaching necessary to stay in touch with students' and professors' needs. At the college's most desperate, a telegram with then-Governor and Trustee Franklin D. Roosevelt's signature was sent out to ten of America's ten wealthiest entrepreneurs containing a plea for support. There was no response. Meanwhile, American education was trending towards the progressive philosophy of John Dewey. However, St. Stephen's was under complete control of the Episcopal Church; and since his arrival, Bell had been conforming the campus to his own brand of classically inspired Anglo-Catholic education. He had very high academic and social standards for manners, professional dress, sportsmanship, and attitude toward studies. One student claimed, \\"I would say that 90% of us went on to graduate studies upon graduation. He expected that of us.\\" One of his most contested rules – informed by his military days – was that students must pay respect to the professor by standing to attention when he entered the room. This was eventually overruled due to pressure from both parents and the Board, because it engendered 'elitism.' Over the years, incidents like this continued, much to the stress of Bell and the Board. On May 26, 1933, Dr. Donald Tewksbury from Columbia University was quietly appointed Acting Dean of St. Stephen's College. Four days later Bell was notified. The two sat down to discuss arrangements, coming to a terse agreement that \\"it was of the utmost importance... to maintain a satisfactory student body.\\" Bell stepped down and Tewksbury took his place. Under Tewksbury's leadership, the college established an arts-based, progressive curriculum, severed its relationship with the church, and was renamed Bard College after its founder.  Legacy and the \\"Curse\\"  Subsequently, there arose a rumor that Bell had cursed Bard College for apostatizing from the Episcopal Church. As the legend goes, he penned a Commination in the chapel service book and stained it in either blood or ink before departing, never to return. However, this story has been put to rest. On June 29, 1933, Bell officiated chapel for the last time before a small group of seven people. He regularly used purple ink with a quill pen, and on this occasion signed off: > With this service, I, Bernard Iddings Bell, completed my fourteen years as > Warden of this College, convinced that it is the will of God that I go > elsewhere in God's Kingdom and persuaded that it is probably not the will of > God that the College survive; grateful for many masses offered at this altar > and for visions of God's mercy and pity granted me here; commending to Him > and to Our Lady my son who here made his first Communion and whose body is > buried from this Church; and with the giving of the College and all who here > have lived and worked into the hands of SS. Peter and Paul, our Holy Lady > Mary, St. Stephen the patron; the Holy Innocents, St. Edward the Confessor > (my own patron) — the little brother Francis, that they may ever pray as I > do, a poor priest, for this College to the most blessed Trinity. Pax! When he had finished writing, Bell accidentally caught the ink bottle with the edge of the service book, thereby soaking at least fifteen pages. The stained book can be viewed today in the Bardiana room in the library. The origin of this \\"curse\\" likely stems from the note's supposition that \\"it is probably not the will of God that the College survive.\\" However, it can be seen that the vast majority of the paragraph is dedicated in prayer for God and his saints to intercede for it. It is true that Bell never set foot on campus again. However, he was witnessed periodically through the window by an administrative officer, who saw Bell parking his car on the edge of the highway and crossing the field to visit his son's grave. = Later Years and Death = Bell was made canon of both St. John's Cathedral in Providence, Rhode Island and the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Chicago, as well as a William Vaughn Moody Lecturer at the University of Chicago. He continued to lecture, write, travel, and pastor students. While completing Crowd Culture: An Examination of the American Way of Life (1952), his health began to decline. He retired in 1954. Diagnosed with acute glaucoma, he was completely blind in his final years. In a letter to Russell Kirk dated Feb. 3 1956, he wrote: > It was good to get your letter. I find that when one is blind one misses > one's friends. You ask if I am doing any writing. The answer is \\"almost > none\\"... It is not that this new job of mine is impossibly onerous.

Upon returning, his doctors insisted that he \\"take it easy and rest, at least until the early Autumn.\\"Letters to Russell Kirk. Unpublished, June 1, 1956. Retrieved from the Russell Kirk Center archives. He died in Chicago two years later. He is buried alongside his son in the Bard College Cemetery in the same grave as his wife, who died in 1985 at the age of 98.  Personality  Bell was known to students and faculty at Bard College as \\"B.I.\\" In public, he was always immaculately groomed and dressed in clerical clothing. He wore a long black cape rather than a coat, which was unusual for the time period. Reporters tended to compare his appearance to that of an owl or bulldog. Despite being roughly 5' 5\\" tall, the presence of his personality has been universally described as huge, energetic, formidable: a force of nature. He was known for having strong, heavily researched opinions, holding High Church sensibilities, and being \\"broad-minded\\" when listening to others. He corresponded with and offered guidance to many influential figures of the day such as Maisie Ward, Alan Watts, T.S. Eliot, Peter Viereck, Dorothy Thompson, and Russell Kirk. Naturally, he was divisive among students and colleagues, who either loved or hated him depending on their own beliefs, attitudes, and opinions.  Views  = Science v. Religion = Due to his college presidency and frequent university lectures, Bell was acquainted with many prominent scientists of the day. He maintained the catholic position that while science is distinct from religion, the two are interdependent. One can neither prove, disprove, nor pose authority over the other, yet both are necessary means of drawing a more intimate portrait of Reality. He cited the long line of great scientists as being predominantly religious: Charles Darwin, Roger Bacon, Pierre Simon Laplace, John Dalton, Antoine Lavoisier, Werner Heisenberg, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Georges Lemaître, Luigi Aloisio Galvani, Galileo Galilei, Robert Boyle, Michael Faraday, Louis Pasteur, Lord Kelvin, and Robert A. Millikin. \\"There is in me no rebellion against science,\\" he remarked, \\"only gratitude for all that by it we have learned or yet may learn.\\" According to Bell, the conflict is due to a degradation of science and religion, propagated by the conceit of \\"demi-educated\\" scientists and theologians. During the Renaissance and Enlightenment, the natural relationship between science and religion was severed, resulting in scientific materialism and religious fundamentalism. These he considered \\"logical suicide,\\" because each took an unfounded premise to its extreme logical end. Materialistic science denied all non-measurable realities, and thus the inner life of humans—love, creative expression, beauty, and goodness—were reduced to behavior theory, biochemical reactions, mere neurons firing. Religious fundamentalism, on the other hand, attempted to stifle scientific evidence in order to preserve Victorian sentiments associated with the Bible. = Mysticism v. Magic = Most great scientists and theologians will admit that the more one learns, the more one becomes aware of his or her ignorance. For as one comes closer to the Truth, in both the natural and spiritual realms, the evidence begins to \\"unravel\\" with such limitless complexity that human comprehension falls short. This is the point at which human reason, even language, breaks down and one becomes conscious of the existence of a non- demonstrable Reality, a mystery. A mystic is one who pursues that mystery, whose evidence supersedes reason, and seeks to align him or herself with it. Bell considers mysticism to be synonymous with sanity. Magic is the selfish belief that one can coerce or alter Reality into getting the things that he or she cannot get for him or herself. Bell calls magic the \\"bastard brother\\" of mysticism, explaining that in the same way an artist can paint in order to manifest Beauty, so another artist can paint \\"because he is a conceited ass and loves applause.\\" In short, magic is bad religion, bad science, bad art. = Agnosticism = Bell held that agnosticism was an important intellectual period during which one rigorously questioned the values, beliefs, and attitudes of the present age, even going so far as to claim that all intelligent Christianity is based upon it. The following thesis explains the personal, philosophical reasons by which he had become a theist and then a Christian. # Scientific data, observed by human senses and processed by human reason, is insufficient for discovering Truth. Modern peoples' underlying anxiety is the result of dependence upon such incomplete data for innovating technology and infrastructure. Our ability to reason is not a way to discover Truth but rather a way to organize our knowledge and experiences somewhat sensibly. Without a full, human perception of the world, one's reason tends to lead them in the wrong direction. # Beyond what can be measured with scientific tools, there are two other types of perception: one's ability to communicate inner truths through creative expression and one's ability to \\"read\\" another person and find harmony with them, which we call love. One's loves cannot be dissected and logged in a scientific journal, but we know them far better than we know the surface of the sun. They show us an undefinable reality that is nevertheless intimate and personal, and they reveal qualities lovelier and truer than sensory facts can provide. # Reality, as experienced by humans, must be understood through all three ways of knowing: science, creative expression, and love. Only by experiencing this Reality as a person can we come closer to the Truth, for an ultimate Person can be loved, but a cosmic force cannot. A scientist can discover peripheral, material truths, but a lover is able to get at the Truth. # There are many reasons to believe in God, but they are not sufficient to convince an agnostic. It is not enough to believe in an ancient holy book, even though when it is accurately analyzed without bias, it proves to be more trustworthy and admirable than what one is taught in school. Neither is it enough to realize how probable it is that a personal God would have to show human beings how to live, considering they have so much trouble on their own. Nor is it enough to believe for the reason that, throughout history, millions of people have known Reality only through religious experience. The aforementioned reasons may warm one toward religion, but they fall short. However, if one presupposes that God is in fact a knowable, loving person, as an experiment, and then lives according that religion, he or she will suddenly come face to face with experiences previously unknown. One's life becomes full, meaningful, and fearless in the face of death. It does not defy reason but exceeds it. # Because God has been experienced through love, the orders of prayer, fellowship, and devotion now matter. They create order within one's life, continually renewing the \\"missing piece\\" that had previously felt lost. They empower one to be compassionate and humble, not small-minded or arrogant. # No truth should be denied outright, but all should be questioned on the scale of evidence. Science reveals an ever-growing vision of our universe that should not be discounted due to bias toward older understandings. Reason is to be trusted and cultivated. To believe in God is not to forego reason or to deny scientific facts, but to venture into the unknown and discover for oneself what is True.

Agrarian Revolutionary Drive  The chancellor of Landmark University has on multiple occasions highlighted that the university is aimed at improving the agricultural sector of the Nigeria and Africa at large. Before the Oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria's economy was thriving as an agrarian economy and the nation gave attention to Agriculture. After the Oil Boom, the agriculture industry in Nigeria has been on a decline, the Nation that was a onetime exporter of several cash crops has become import-dependent so much that it cannot on its own feed its population talk less of exporting to other countries. Landmark University aims to start off an agrarian revolution in Nigeria and Africa that would restore the Nations lost glory and redirect its attention to the many natural earthen resources that it has. The university encourages its students to venture into agriculture whether it is their core discipline or not and encourages the enrollment of Nigerian students into Agriculture-related courses through scholarships and Career talks. In addition to this, the university has pioneered a Certificate and Diploma Course in Agripreneurship in Nigeria, a program designed to enlighten its participants on the entrepreneurial opportunities that exist in Agriculture. The University has made ties with several leading Agriculture Institutions both in Research and practice and many other institutions in the pursuance of their agrarian revolutionary drive. Some of these institutions are the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA). In nearly 7 years of existence, the university runs 6 Agriculture related programs, namely Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Extension and Rural Development, Animal Science, Crop Science, Soil Science and Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering and has graduated over 388 agriculture professionals. The school also has a total of 1,059 hectares of farming land; 320 hectares on the university property in Omu-Aran, Kwara State, 354 hectares at Eleyin Village along the Omu-Aran-Ilorin highway and 385 hectares at Agbonda also in Kwara State. According to the former Vice-chancellor of the school, Professor Aize Obayan, Landmark University produces most of the food items consumed on its campus and sells farm produce to its neighboring communities. Some of the agricultural products of the University's farm are eggs, frozen chicken, fish, soya beans, cassava, rice, fufu flour and many others including innovative agricultural products like the Brown Rice.

Magazine articles can roughly be divided into works, news and others. The articles are mostly written for the highschool level, although there are those for the higher level, meant for the smaller circle of readers. History The first two issues of the magazine have been printed in the second half of 1953. The magazine was started by the Astronomical Society Ruđer Bošković and Astronautical Society of the Aeronautical union of Yugoslavia, as a magazine for astronomy and astronautics. For the Astronomical Society, Vasiona was the continuation of work on the magazine Saturn, which was published before World War Two. Nenad Đ. Janković, the last editor of Saturn, was also the first editor of Vasiona. Cooperation with the \\"astronauticists\\" was very successful until 1962 when they have stopped financing the magazine, and so Vasiona had to reduce its format. In the 1970s the number of astronautical articles reduced so much that since 1980 Vasiona is purely astronomical magazine. Editors Editors-in-chief of Vasiona were: # Nenad Đ.

It is a sequel to the second Witcher novel Time of Contempt (Czas pogardy) and is followed by The Tower of the Swallow (Wieża Jaskółki). Plot In the aftermath of the Thanedd incident, war is still raging between Nilfgaard and the Northern Kingdoms. The elf sorceress Francesca Findabair has been installed by Nilfgaardian Emperor Emhyr as client queen of Dol Blathanna. In exchange for her throne, however, she is obliged to withhold aid from the elven Scoia'tael commandos, who supported Nilfgaard's initial advance into the North, but now find themselves alone and unsupported as the Northern Kingdoms retaliate. = Geralt = Geralt of Rivia recovers in Brokilon Forest under the care of the dryads, but he is intent on leaving as quickly as possible and searching for Ciri. The Dryads' queen introduces him to Milva, an expert archer who ranges outside the forest, guiding scattered bands of Scoia'tael to refuge in Brokilon. Despite not particularly liking the convalescing witcher, she agrees to accompany him and his friend Dandelion, on his way towards Nilfgaard and hopefully, Ciri. The journey is not easy, the war is encroaching seemingly from all directions and nearly every city is ablaze. Along their journey they meet a group of dwarves led by Zoltan Chivay. As it seems they are all going in the same direction, Geralt's party joins the group who are also shepherding some refugee women and children. They are also shadowed by Cahir, the \\"Black Rider\\" who featured prominently in Ciri's nightmares. Initially, the knight is being transported as a prisoner by some hawkers, when Geralt spares his life for the second time. However, the witcher wants nothing to do with the young Nilfgaardian and leaves him to his own devices, Cahir is ever persistent and continues to shadow the witcher and his entourage. Eventually, through Milva's intervention, the young knight comes to join the group. Finally, the troupe is joined by Regis, a vampire with invaluable medical skills. Despite his avocation as a monster hunter, Geralt concedes a liking for the vampire. Cahir also reveals that both he and Geralt have been having the same prophetic dreams about Ciri, which evidence that she is not in Nilfgaard at all, and the young woman produced by Emhyr bearing that name is an imposter. As the group travels east, Milva admits that she is pregnant, the result of a brief liaison with a group of elves she was escorting back to Brokilon. At first she asks Regis for a potion to help her abort the child, but then converses with Geralt, who reveals how he never expected to feel love for a child until he became responsible for Ciri, and she decides to keep her baby. Unfortunately, they are inevitably caught between the warring factions which leads them into the thick of the Battle for the Bridge on the Yaruga where the group is pivotal in Queen Meve avoiding capture by Nilfgaardian forces, but Cahir is badly wounded and Milva miscarries. Geralt had previously named himself \\"Geralt of Rivia\\" despite not actually being from there, however, after the battle Geralt is knighted by the queen and his title \\"of Rivia\\" becomes official. = Ciri = Ciri, under the alias \\"Falka\\" has settled into life with a party of young outlaws, \\"the Rats\\". Experiencing killing on a regular basis, she ultimately becomes obsessed with it. = Yennefer = With the collapse of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers after the Thanedd incident, Francesca Findabair gathers a group of sorceresses - including Yennefer, whom Francesca transformed into a jade statuette during the chaos on Thanedd and has kept sequestered in the three months since then - and proposes the founding of a new organization, the Lodge of Sorceresses. Francesca and Phillipa Eilhart explain their belief that, rather than act as advisors to the monarchs of the various kingdoms, their magical abilities make them best qualified to rule themselves. But the only way the nobility of the Northern Kingdoms would accept such rule is if they were all unified under a single monarch, who possesses both royal blood and magical ability - i.e., Ciri. Yennefer's knowledge is essential to finding Ciri, but a Nilfgaardian sorceress, Fringilla Vigo, helps Yennefer escape so she can find Ciri on her own. Unlike Geralt, Yennefer decides to track down the rogue mage Vilgefortz, who she believes has kidnapped Ciri and who is owed retribution for his treacherous actions on Thanedd Island.

Police have attempted to retrieve the lost data. HCL Technologies, an Indian technology company, was requested by News International on thirteen different occasions to delete large numbers of emails. In September 2011 having been ordered to search its internal email system, News Group Newspapers \\"found 'many tens of thousands' of new documents and emails that could contain evidence about the scale of phone hacking at the paper...Two very large new caches of documents have been [discovered] which the current management were unaware of.\\" NGN was ordered in the summer to search its internal email system for any evidence that mobile phones belonging to a list of public figures were targeted by the paper...very large new caches of documents have been [discovered] which the current management were unaware of.\\" # Advisory (written?) from The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to The Metropolitan Police Service Regarding Voicemail. (2006) \\"Police investigation was hindered by the advice from the CPS that phone hacking was only an offence if messages had been intercepted before they were listened to by the intended recipient.\\" The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) at the time was Ken Macdonald. # \\"Transcript For Neville\\"; (29 June 2005) This is one of the documents seized from Glenn Mulcair's home in 2006.

The email was received by the paper's legal adviser, Tom Crone about 12 May 2008, and he promptly discussed it with the paper's editor, Colin Myler. These two claim they then promptly met with James Murdoch and indicated the significance of the email to him, resulting in agreement to make a large settlement payment to Gordon Taylor. Murdoch has denied he was aware of the email when he agreed to the settlement or that he had reason to believe there was more than one reporter involved in phone hacking at News International's publications. # Letter from Les Hinton to Clive Goodman dismissing him and subsequent correspondence; (5 February 2007-14 March 2007) between Mr. Goodman and News International. # Letter from Clive Goodman to Daniel Cloke regarding Unfair dismissal (2 March 2007); key portions are redacted. Alleges that phone hacking was widely discussed at News of the World editorial meetings chaired by the editor, who at that time was Andy Coulson. Also alleges Goodman was promised he could return to News of the World if he did not implicate the paper or any of its staff in the issue. # \\"Lengthy list of documents\\" requested by Clive Goodman from News International; Documents reportedly included emails between Goodman and \\"various News of the World executives. # 2,500 emails reviewed by Colin Myer; (2007) then editor of News of the World and Daniel Cloke, Director of Human Resources of News International.

These emails reportedly \\"appear to show Andy Coulson, editor of the News of the World from 2003-2007, authorising payments to the police for help with stories.

He was Secretary General of the National Front and president of the Municipal Council of Paris. Biography =Early years= Charles Trochu was born in Chile in 1898 of a Breton father and a Basque mother. He was a descendant of the Napoleonic General Jean Baptiste Kléber. His grandfather was General Louis Jules Trochu, who had been President of the Government of National Defense during the Franco-Prussian War. World War I began in July 1914. Trochu joined the army when he was seventeen, and was wounded and decorated. He was taken prisoner by the Germans. =Inter-war years= After the war Trochu became a wholesale cod merchant. He was also involved in architecture. He was a member of the editorial board of the avant-guarde urban planning journal Plans (1930-1932), which became Prelude (1932-1936), with Albert Laprade, François de Pierrefeu (1891-1959), Hubert Lagardelle and Pierre Winter. Bonapartist in background, Trochu was close to the Action Française of Charles Maurras, and participated in all the squabbles of the extreme right in the 1930s. In 1932 he was the Jeunesses Patriotes candidate for the Paris municipal council. Violently antisemitic, he called Jews the \\"scum of the orient.\\" In March 1934 he was director of journal La Révolution nationale and an executive committee member of the Democratic Republican Alliance. On 7 May 1934 he was chosen as the first secretary-general of the National Front. The Croix-de-Feu did not join. However, it was indirectly associated. In 1935 he was elected municipal councilor for the Auteuil quarter of Paris, a position he continued to hold until being made president of the council in 1941. In 1936 Trochu and 29 other councilors proposed building underground highways so the population could be evacuated safely in case of an air attack with chemical weapons. Trochu was president of the National Association of Returned Officers, a veterans' organization. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, he used this position to recruit Frenchmen willing to fight for the right-wing forces led by General Francisco Franco. He and his private secretary, Jacques Pecheron, arranged for these men to travel to Bordeaux to join the Jeanne d'Arc Battalion being assembled by Henri Bonneville de Marsagny. In October 1938 he called for Jewish refugees from Austria who had recently arrived in Paris to be expelled from the city. In 1938, Trochu attacked the pacifists and anti-militarists such as Jean Zay and Léon Blum who refuse to take the rearmament of Germany seriously. Thus, during the municipal council meeting of 21 December 1938, he spoke out against \\"ignoble Jews\\" such as Bernard Lecache and his friends of the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism, which, among other infamies, trample on military honor.\\" On 4 March 1939 in the Salle Wagram he gave Charles Maurras his sword as an academician, funded by national subscription and designed by Maxime Real del Sarte. =Later career= World War II broke out in September 1939. Trochu volunteered in 1940, and was mentioned in dispatches.Action Française, n° 49, 28 May 1940. He was taken prisoner, but was released after a short captivity. A law of 16 October 1941 gave a new administrative organization to the City of Paris and the Department of the Seine under the traditional name of the Municipal Council, but with appointed rather than elected members. The PUP members remained in office, but new councilors were selected from the syndicalist workers' movement to replace the communists, an illegal party since 1940, and socialists who had been excluded because they were Jews or Freemasons. On 3 October 1941 Trochu was named president of the new assembly, before the law officially came into effect. In 1942 Trochu and Le Corbusier published a special issue of Architecture et urbanisme devoted to Le Corbusier's work. Truchu was not considered to be conformist with the Vichy regime, and continued to push for the independence of France. The assembly was given little scope for political action. In 1943 Trochu was removed from office as president. A new administration was named on 30 April 1943 headed by Pierre Taittinger. Taittinger said later that Trochu combined the most stunning imagination with the most rigorous punctuality, and that the Municipal Council of Paris owed much to him. After leaving office, Trochu no longer attended council meetings. Trochu managed to leave France, and arrived in allied-occupied Algiers on 12 January 1944. He was dropped from the council on 10 June 1944, shortly before the liberation of Paris. Presented as a veteran and a former member of the resistance, he testified in favor of Pétain during his trial in 1945. During the trial Trochu also said that he had \\"nothing but admiration\\" for the communists, whom he had bitterly opposed in the 1930s. Charles Trochu died in 1961.

The events ended with the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état after mass protests across Egypt demanding the immediate resignation of the president. The rallies were partly a response to Tamarod, an ostensibly grassroots movement that launched a petition in April earlier that year calling for the government to step down claiming to have collected 22 million signatures, a figure not verified by independent sources with skepticism over the rise in number by millions in a matter of days, with the Freedom and Justice Party putting the figure at 170,000 signatures. A counter campaign was launched in support of Morsi's presidency which claimed to have collected 11 million signatures.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/tamarod-egypt-morsi- campaign-oppsition-resignation According to the Egyptian military, which calculated figured via helicopter scans of demonstration perimeters across the country, this was \\"the biggest protest in Egypt's history\\", with 32 million protesters. However, independent observers have raised concerns about wild exaggeration of the number of actual anti-Morsi protestors with one crowd statistical expert study indicating that a total of a little more than 1 million people protested against Morsi across the whole country. Reasons for demanding Morsi's resignation included accusations of increasing authoritarianism and his pushing through an Islamist agenda disregarding the predominantly secular opposition or the rule of law. The uprising concluded seven months of protests that started when the Morsi government issued a highly controversial constitutional declaration that gave him temporary sweeping powers over the state's judicial system until the new constitution was passed. The demonstrations, which had started peacefully, turned violent when the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood were stormed in Mokattam in Cairo and when 5 members of the organization were killed amid clashes. At the same time, mass protests in support of Morsi gathered in Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Nasr City, a district of Cairo. A total of 16 people were reported to have lost their lives on Sunday and approximately 200 injured as of late Tuesday during the unrest as a result of clashes between pro and anti-Morsi demonstrators, according to the state-run news agency. Another 10 people were also reported to have been killed in the cities of Alexandria, Mersa Matruh and Minya. On 1 July, amid the turmoil the country was facing, the military delivered a nationwide TV and radio statement giving both the government and the opposition a 48-hour ultimatum to resolve the political crisis and meet the people's demands or it would intervene to restore order. The following day, Morsi delivered an evening speech where he declared his rejection of the declaration claiming he was the elected president who represented the will of the people. The same day, another statement was released on the official Facebook page of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces titled \\"The Final Hours\\" that read: \\"We swear by God that we are ready to sacrifice our blood for Egypt and its people against any terrorist, extremist or fool\\". On the night of 3 July, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Minister of Defense, announced in a live televised address that President Mohamed Morsi had been deposed and that he was appointing the chief justice of the constitutional court Adly Mansour as acting president and that the constitution had been suspended. Morsi was immediately detained and kept under house arrest at the Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo while several other government officials and Islamist figures supporting Morsi were also arrested. The move marked a turning point for the country's future and for the fate of the Muslim Brotherhood, as it was designated a terrorist group later that year in response to a bombing in Mansoura (even though Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility) and was subjected to an unprecedented crackdown amid ongoing Islamist unrest. A crackdown by the military on the sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square led to the August 2013 Rabaa massacre, which Human Rights Watch described as crimes against humanity and 'one of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history' and led to the deaths of at least 817 people in Rabaa itself and 904 people across the country by the end of 14 August. Eight members of the security forces were also killed. Terminology The events are also widely called the 30 June Revolution (Arabic:ثورة ٣٠ يونيو) or simply 30/6 Revolution by the Egyptian and Middle Eastern media. They are also referred to as the Second Egyptian Revolution by several international media outlets. The Tamarod movement's highly successful goal to mobilize the protests is also strongly associated with the naming of the uprising and some organizations like the Washington Institute for Near East Policy dubbed it the Tamarod Revolution. Background Amid growing anger towards the regime, President Hosni Mubarak, whose reign was marked by increasing corruption and authoritarianism, resigned on 11 February 2011 following 18 days of mass protests that marked the beginning of a new era of political instability in Egypt. The subsequent transitional period, which saw the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) taking power under Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi immediately after Mubarak's ouster, saw renewed deadly clashes and human rights abuses. A round of elections started to take place in the country starting with the 2011 referendum, in which a majority approved of reforms drafted by a military-formed committee. The election however proved to be highly controversial despite some positive reforms such as limiting the president's time in office to two four-year terms. Many opposition figures and activists were upset with the reforms as they were drafted in just ten days and were offered to the public for only three weeks before the referendum. Two of the country's largest political forces back then, the Muslim Brotherhood and remnants of the former National Democratic Party, have endorsed the reforms. This turnout proved highly beneficial for the Brotherhood in the following months as they achieved nearly all of their political ambitions including a majority win for the Islamist current in the 2011–12 parliamentary election, during which the Brotherhood was accused by many opposition figures of making deals with the military while protesters were being killed by security forces. Their efforts culminated with Mohamed Morsi winning against Ahmed Shafik by 51.7% in the 2012 presidential election. =Constituent Assembly of 2012= In April, a couple of months prior to Morsi's inauguration, the Administrative Court suspended a constituent assembly previously appointed in March without giving any clear reasons for this decision and which the Brotherhood claimed was politically motivated. In mid-June however, another 100-member assembly was officially selected a week after a deal was reached between the ruling military council and representatives of 22 parties. Tensions later resumed after a court ruled that the entire Islamist-dominated parliament was illegally elected and ordered the body to dissolve, which angered the Brotherhood and Mohamed Beltagy called it a \\"full-fledged coup\\". On 18 June, the SCAF issued a supplementary constitutional declaration that limits the to-be president's power over the military and gives it complete control over all army decisions. However, those controversial moves never changed the status of the constituent assembly as it was elected by the Shura Council not by parliament. Also, the same day the military delivered its statement, Hossam El-Gheriany was elected as chairman of the assembly. Military chief Mohamed Hussein Tantawi was forced to retire by Morsi on 12 August, a month and a half after the latter was elected and a week after a militant attack in Sinai that had the military preoccupied, leaving the constituent assembly's drafting process unchallenged. =Morsi's declaration and aftermath= =Tamarod campaign= Amid a climate of dissent and division, Tamarod (Arabic for \\"rebellion\\"), a grassroots movement, was founded in April 2013 by five young activists with ages ranging between 22 and 30 years old. They orchestrated a door-to-door, street-level campaign collecting signatures from Egyptians across the country calling for, among other demands, President Morsi's resignation, early presidential elections and the start of a renewed constituent process. Tamarod was supported by various opposition parties and autonomous social movements. The campaign, reminiscent of 1919's collection of petitions against British occupation, called for massive protests all over the country on 30 June 2013, which was the first anniversary of Morsi's inauguration, to create popular pressure on the government to see through their demands. The campaign's leading members Mahmoud Badr, Hassan Shahin, Mohamed Abdel Aziz, Mai Wahba and Mohamed Heikal, initially unfamiliar to the public, started to continuously gain strong popularity among Egyptians reflected in the people's eagerness to publicly register their names, identification card numbers and signatures on the petition form. The movement was also intensifying its political activity, uniting all anti-Brotherhood parties and most political factions in its mission. Among the groups supporting it were the National Salvation Front, the Kefaya Movement and the April 6 Youth Movement. These also included members of the former National Democratic Party who, as stated by Mohamed ElBaradei, were allowed to participate as long as they weren't convicted of any crimes such as Morsi's 2012 rival candidate Ahmed Shafik who supported the protests. On 26 June, Tamarod launched the 30 June Front to administer the upcoming protests and to manage the transitional period following Morsi's ouster. This was in collaboration with a number of political movements and parties. Founders included Ahmed Douma, former member of the 6 April movement, as well as youth activists such as Esraa Abdel Fattah. According to the roadmap offered by the front, the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court will be the acting interim president and all executive powers would be handed over to a new prime minister. The demands also included the suspension of the 2012 constitution, the dissolution of the Shura Council and forming a committee of experts to draft a new constitution and put it to a referendum. At the press conference where the front was announced and in the presence of many prominent revolutionary and political figures, Mohamed Abdel Aziz, co-founder of the campaign, said: > We announce the 30 June Front as an initiative from Tamarod to represent > Egyptians who refuse Muslim Brotherhood rule and to share with the great > Egyptian people their political vision in order to avoid the mistakes of the > past period and to continue on the path of January 25 Revolution\\" However, the presidency and its supporters had a different reaction to Tamarod which was far from appeasing the population. A counter-campaign called \\"Tagarod\\" (Arabic for \\"impartiality\\") was started by Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya member Assem Abdel Maged, who called on Morsi's supporters to sign this petition to keep the \\"legitimately elected president in his post\\". Abdel Maged's campaign however, proved unsuccessful in terms of impact compared to Tamarod which was able to penetrate and mobilize the \\"Couch Party\\", the silent majority of Egyptians who usually avoid participating in political events but prominently joined anti-Morsi demonstrations this time. The movement's effectiveness in sparking the uprising directly inspired many other copycat campaigns throughout the Arab world such as Gaza, Morocco, Tunisia and Yemen, as well as a new wave of protests in Bahrain. = Allegations of military involvement in Tamarod = Egypt's military has long showed discontent at Morsi's policies and viewed the political tensions between the government and its opponents as a threat to the nation's stability. This had come to light following a huge Islamist rally in support of the Syrian uprising sponsored by the Brotherhood in Cairo Stadium. What worried the army though, is that Morsi, while not explicitly calling himself for holy war, delivered a speech in which he called for a foreign intervention against Bashar al-Assad's government by establishing a no-fly zone over Syria. The military responded by issuing a statement where it argued that its only role is to guard Egypt's borders. On 23 June, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued a statement warning all sides saying that the army will not allow the country to fall into a \\"dark tunnel of conflict\\". He also added: > Those who think that we (the military) are oblivious to the dangers that > threaten the Egyptian state are mistaken. We will not remain silent while > the country slips into a conflict that will be hard to control After Morsi was ousted on 3 July, most of the country's energy crises, that were very common during Morsi's presidency, were surprisingly diminished following the Revolution. David D. Kirkpatrick, Cairo's bureau chief of The New York Times, claimed there might have been a campaign orchestrated by members of the old Mubarak regime and top military generals that was meant to undermine Mohamed Morsi's one-year rule. Kirkpatrick also claimed that a smear media campaign against Morsi, that began immediately following Morsi's inauguration, helped feed popular discontent towards the authorities by adopting a contradictory stance through favoring the military while honoring Morsi's position as president of the republic. Later in 2015, leaked tapes from the summer of 2013 that were later verified by J. P. French Associates emerged recording figures of the Egyptian military, including then-Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, suggesting Egyptian military involvement in the mass-protests preceding Morsi's ouster. In one of the leaked tapes the generals are heard discussing the withdrawal of a large sum of money for the army's use from the bank account of Tamarod, the independent grassroots group that was organizing protests against President Morsi. The tapes also suggest high-level collusion between the coup plotters and the Government of the United Arab Emirates as the money that is to be transferred from Tamarod's account into the army's account was provided by the UAE. The tapes were first released on the Turkish Islamist channel Mekameleen, a fact that the Egyptian government says discredits the tapes as fakes. American officials later confirmed that the United Arab Emirates was indeed providing financial support for the protests against Morsi. Issues =Economic crisis= Preparation and security precautions During security measures in Upper Egypt, the Luxor security directorate announced that it had transferred all those jailed in the local police station to Qena prison as a mean of avoiding the 2011 scenario due to the risk of violence. Aswan saw heavy security presence and the police chief announced that he will personally head the operation room to receive complaints and information during the demonstrations and said that security personnel will protect their stations as well as state property, and added that the people will be protected, not the regime or any political party. Members of the FJP have gathered in front of their party headquarters to secure the complex. These procedures took place on 30 June, the day of protests. According to information that came out after the removal of Morsi, officials claimed that Morsi stopped working at the presidential office as early as 26 June in anticipation to the protests and moved with his family to Koubbeh Palace, just a few blocks away from the main palace. =Fears of violence against Copts= Weeks prior to the protests, Coptic Christians, particularly in Upper Egypt, received threats from Morsi's Islamist supporters, pressuring them not to take part in the protests. Sheikh Essam Abdulamek, a member of parliament's Shura Council, said in an interview on television that Christians should not participate in the protests and warned them \\"do not sacrifice your children [since the] general Muslim opinion will not be silent about the ousting of the president.\\" Letters were delivered to Christian families in Minya where they were threatened not to join the protests, otherwise their \\"businesses, cars, homes, schools, and churches\\" might \\"catch fire\\". The letters, signed by \\"People zealous of the nation\\", read: > If you are not worried about any of these, then worry about your children > and your homes. This message is being delivered with tact. But when the > moment of truth comes, there will be no tact. There had been incitements against Copts by some of Morsi's staunchest allies. For instance, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya's leading hardline cleric Assem Abdel Maged directly threatened the country's Christian community by saying \\"if you go down into the streets on 30 June, you will bring black days onto yourselves.\\" President Morsi himself invited Pope Tawadros II to a meeting at the country's presidential palace in what has been seen as an attempt to put pressure on him. The pope told Morsi to do what is necessary to bring the nation together and work for the peace of Egypt, not to stir up quarrels. \\"I am still hoping to see improvements in the economic and social life of the country,\\" he said, while Morsi suggested that the church should advise Egypt's Christian community not to participate in the protests. Pro-Morsi cleric Safwat Hegazi addressed the country's Christians by saying: \\"You share this country with us, but there are red lines, and one red line is the legitimacy of Dr. Morsi. Whoever splashes water on that, we will spill his blood.\\" Early events =28 June= Anti-Morsi poster on a car in Cairo. On Friday 28 June, protests against Morsi started to build throughout Egypt including in such cities as Cairo, Alexandria, Dakahlia, Gharbiya and Aswan as a \\"warm up\\" for the massive protests expected on 30 June that were planned by Tamarod. Pro-Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood supporters started counterdemonstrations at the Rabia Al-Adawiya Mosque in Nasr City. Anti-Morsi demonstrators marching in Cairo on 28 June =29 June= Deadly clashes broke out this day in several Egyptian cities, most notably Alexandria, where armed confrontations between Morsi's supporters and his opponents, with both sides in the fighting armed with different kinds of firearms, left many injured and three dead, a 14-year- old boy, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was shot dead and an American student, Andrew Pochter, was killed after being stabbed in the chest during an anti-Morsi rally. Protesters stormed the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood's ruling Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and set the building ablaze. In Port Said, a bomb detonated in the city's Martyrs Square where protesters had gathered to protest against Mohamed Morsi. The explosion, which AFP reported to have been a hand-grenade thrown by unidentified men, injured 14 demonstrators and killed a journalist. A police general in Sinai was gunned down by militants in an ambush when he was leaving his car, before they ran away. In Cairo, the president's opponents started building up in anticipation for 30 June's uprising as thousands of anti-Morsi demonstrators took to Tahrir Square with the number of tents increasing to 150. At the presidential palace, protesters set up 18 tents and erected a stage at the entrance of Heliopolis Sporting Club. Five CSF trucks and a fire-fighting vehicle went to reside in the location as a security precaution. This day, Tamarod claimed to have collected more than 22 million signatures their petition calling for Morsi to step down. The numbers were announced in a press conference statement in which the group's leaders described 30 June protests as a new wave of the 2011 revolution that and stressed that \\"Morsy has lost legitimacy after millions of signatures calling for his removal were collected, and after he refused to respect the constitution and the law\\". The statement also urged protesters to remain peaceful. On the other hand, thousands staged an open-ended rally since Friday which was called for by 40 Islamist parties and groups led by the FJP and was held under the banner \\"Democratic legitimacy is a red line\\". Events ;Cairo The much anticipated day began with several marches throughout Cairo on Sunday heading to either Tahrir Square or Ittihadiya Palace with other comparatively smaller protests taking place at Rabaa al- Adawiya square, where pro-Morsi demonstrators were mainly centered, and another around the Ministry of Culture in Zamalek with artists and intellectuals staging a sit-in chanting against the Morsi-appointed culture minister. The 30 June Front announced that open-ended sit-ins have been staged in Tahrir and across the country until President Mohamed Morsi steps down and until the people's legitimate demands have been answered. Protesters started to fill Tahrir as early as 8:00 AM with streets emptied of traffic and nearly all shops were closed for this day. The people started chanting \\"Down, down with the rule of the Morshed (Supreme Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood)\\" and \\"He will leave, we won't leave\\". By 11:00 AM, thousands had already gathered in the square and organizers claimed in advance the support of millions to come. Two main marches that headed to Tahrir came from Giza. One saw tens of thousands rallying along Dokki's Tahrir Street and were joined by opposition leader Hamdeen Sabahi and prominent leftist filmmaker Khaled Youssef. It later merged with the other march in Al Nahda square near Cairo University and was led by Mohamed ElBaradei forming the bigger 'Mostafa Mahmoud march' that later reached Tahrir Square at around 18:10 PM while still stretching back into Dokki. Other rallies that also arrived in Tahrir are the Dawaran Shubra march coming from Shubra, the Maadi march whose participants first gathered in Maadi's Horreya Square, and several other rallies whether organized or individual ones including the journalists' march led by the Press Syndicate chairman Diaa Rashwan that began from the union's headquarters in Downtown Cairo. Later that day, the crowd in Tahrir Square has reached its maximum capacity of 500,000 demonstrators. This prompted other joining protesters to fill up the square's neighboring alleys instead such as the nearby Talaat Harb Street and Qasr al-Nil Bridge. A less notable sit-in took place at the Culture Ministry in Zamalek's Shagarat al Dur Street and was organized by artists, among them actors, musicians and painters, who were banging clogs and were led by some intellectuals, such as Bahaa Taher, who called for the toppling of the regime, and especially the newly appointed Islamist minister whom they accuse along with the Brotherhood of attempting to \\"Islamize\\" the country's cultural traditions. They later headed to the Cairo Opera House to stage public performances and manifestations and they were expected to continue to Tahrir but it is unclear whether all of them went there or if some remained. In Shubra El-Kheima, nearly 3,000 demonstrators, mostly women, formed human chains extending over one kilometer and were organized by the Popular Current and the Constitution Party. In addition, the April 6 Youth Movement and Constitution Party announced a sit-in in front of Abdeen Palace as soon as they received information that Prime Minister Hesham Qandil was there. Another thousand protesters gathered in front of the Qubba Palace only three kilometers away from Ittihadiya following rumors that Mohamed Morsi was residing there at the time, which was later semi-confirmed when the presidency announced it would hold a press conference at the palace later in the afternoon. The satellite town of 6 October also saw hundreds rallying in Juhayna Square. Demonstrations have taken place in other similar locations around Cairo such as the wealthy district of New Cairo, where several dozens have gathered in front of Morsi's residency waving Egyptian flags and red cards calling for his resignation while security forces deployed barriers to keep protesters away from the building. This day, the main opposition National Salvation Front (NSF) issued a statement it called \\"Revolution Statement 1\\" and which goes: Although Morsi opponents had staged protest camps outside Ittihadiya Palace, one of the country's main presidential palaces, in Cairo's Heliopolis suburb two days prior to the revolution, the number of protesters was relatively low with only a few hundred demonstrators present at the vicinity around 5:30 PM, compared to the big masses staged in Tahrir Square and Sidi Gaber in Egypt's second city of Alexandria at the time. At the beginning, this was surprising to some commentators who considered the location to be a second focal point of anti-Morsi protests in Cairo along with Tahrir. Most of the palace's gates were left unguarded except for gate 5 which saw a high concentration of armoured vehicles and police was nowhere to be seen but three were reportedly arrested by night in possession of weapons including blades and firearms, according to state news agency MENA. By 5:45 PM however, demonstrators started pouring in with tens of thousands coming individually or in rallies such as the march coming from Saray el-Qubba carrying Egyptian flags, red cards and waving banners of previously slain protesters such as Khalid Said while chanting anti-Morsi slogans, most notably \\"The people demand the fall of the regime\\". At around 7:30 PM, the palace's surroundings were reportedly packed with protesters filling a broad boulevard for blocks and spilling into nearby avenues and Al-Ahram reported that the site was extremely crowded with even moving small distances taking a long time and according to the Health Ministry, one protester suffocated to death as a result of a crowd crush. The demonstrations' mood was seemingly jovial with fireworks keeping the atmosphere upbeat and protesters cheering patrolling military helicopters the vicinity with laser lights. MENA reported that political forces present there announced that they will stage an open-ended sit-in till the president steps down. Only five kilometers away from the presidential palace, Islamist supporters of Mohamed Morsi and the government held their sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya square in the Nasr City neighborhood of Cairo for a third consecutive day. They called their demonstration this day \\"Tagarod\\" as a counter name to the Tamarod campaign aimed at ousting Morsi. The number of demonstrators was reportedly estimated at hundreds of thousands although the ruling Muslim Brotherhood-linked Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) claimed on its Facebook page that the number was four million and a Shura Council member of the party had also claimed that the number of people in Rabaa al-Adawiya exceeded the numbers of anti-Morsi protesters in Cairo and all of Egypt. The number however, could not be verified as some experts ruled it out and said that the square and surrounding areas could hardly contain such a number. Most of them chanted for the protection of the president's democratic legitimacy while some believed that the president needed more time to deal with the country's difficulties. The sit-in was prominently joined by the hardline Salafist group Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya which called on the army and police to protect the president and, although initially wishing for non- violence to be exercised, threatened that if the police and army \\"fail to do their job in protecting the president's legitimacy … we will do so ourselves,\\" said Mohamed Hassan, the group's spokesman while refusing to clarify whether he implicated the group would use violence or not and also added that Al- Gama'a al-Islamiyya would not allow the overthrow of the democratically elected president by any means. However, the demonstrations continued peacefully with no reported clashes occurring between supporters and opponents of Morsi either at Rabaa al-Adawiya or at the presidential palace. ;Alexandria Egypt's second city of Alexandria saw protesters gathering at Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, a meeting point for the city's rallies and also at the railway station in the neighborhood of Sidi Gaber. Hundreds of protesters had gathered by 4:35 PM, according to Al-Ahram, but in the following few hours the square started filling with demonstrators who poured in from all over the coastal city in thousands, including hundreds of lawyers and court room officials heading from the Lawyers' Union headquarters toward the station, chanting \\"Leave! Leave!\\". By approximately 7:00 PM, the vicinity of the station was reportedly packed and people could hardly move. A sit-in was also declared with a stage and tents being erected, including a large one near Omar al-Islam Mosque, as a preparation for the coming days. The situation was alarming though to political activists who organized the demonstrations in the few days prior to the revolution due to the violent clashes that erupted between opponents and supporters of Morsi resulting in a number of deaths including an American student. The city hasn't seen the kind of clashes it had witnessed in the previous days but the FJP however accused anti-Morsi protesters of rioting and of being behind the ransacking of their party's office in the El-Hadara district earlier on Sunday. ;Other governorates Nearly every governorate saw its own demonstrations with big ones taking place in several cities all over Egypt, including Mansoura, Damanhour, Mahalla, Suez, Port Said and Minya. In the Nile Delta's Menoufia, hundreds staged anti-Morsi protests in the city of Ashmoun. Some in other parts of the governorate have cut off the Cairo- Alexandria agricultural road while others have closed off seven city council buildings, among them Menouf's, with chains and signs reading \\"Closed by order of the people\\". Sharqia, where Morsi had lost before to his rival candidate Ahmed Shafik by about 160,000 votes in the 2012 election, had thousands demonstrating across the province with the capital Zagazig hosting several protests concentrated around the governorate building and in Orabi Square. The FJP office was attacked by armed assailants just hours after an Al-Ahram interview with the local party leader Ahmed Shehata when he presented his own version of Sunday's protests claiming that the number of \\"real revolutionaries\\" protesting peacefully that day would not exceed 20,000 across Egypt. The attack claimed the life of 21-year-old student Hossam Shoqqi, who had previously served tea for the reporters. Zagazig overall had a strong anti-Morsi sentiment already and was prominent with graffiti and posters slamming the Muslim Brotherhood. Gharbia saw tens of thousands of demonstrators in the capital Tanta. Several marches were delayed till afternoon prayers in Mahalla, known for its strong revolutionary spirit. But the city witnessed major protests and the numbers dramatically increased afterwards, with workers forming the majority of the protesters. Textile workers went on strike across the city, have previously warned several times that under Morsi their factories are threatened with closure altogether. The protesters chanted slogans like \\"Abdel Nasser said it before, the Muslim Brotherhood are not to be trusted\\". Prominent labour activist Kamal el-Fayoumi told Al-Ahram that \\"Mahalla contributed heavily to the removal of Mubarak from power, and we will do the same thing with Morsi\\". Hundreds participated in demonstrations in Kafr El Zayat against Morsi with anti-Muslim Brotherhood chants such as \\"National unity against the Brotherhood\\" and \\"You who rule in the name of religion, where is justice and where is religion?\\" The Dakahlia Governorate city of Mansoura saw hundreds of thousands continuously flocking in the city's main Al-Shaheed Square from several rally points. Chants included \\"Go, you're two-faced, you've divided the people in two\\" and the protests had notable persons participating such as Mohamed Ghonim, a leading Middle East urologist, in a different mass march in the city. Similarly to the events in Sharqia and Gharbia, the city of Desouk in Kafr el-Sheikh had demonstrators closing the city council building and the governorate complex. The protesters said the buildings would be locked down until the regime was ousted. This kind of action also took place in Beheira. Thousands demonstrated in Damanhour's main square, where some carried police officers on their shoulders chanting against the government, and marches in the city attracted around 30,000 protesters, along with 10,000 in Kafr el-Dawwar and 5,000 in Kom Hamada. The port city of Damietta in the north was estimated to have several thousand demonstrators in the streets, according to a member of the Socialist Popular Alliance, with some in Al-Saa'a Square demanding early presidential elections. Around 250 fishing boats sailed in the Nile heading to the square using megaphones to chant anti-Mori slogans. They have taken over the governorate headquarters and the offices of the local educational authority and also planned to occupy other government buildings to prevent governor Tarek Khedr from entering his office. A similar scene took place in the Upper Egyptian governorate of Luxor, where a flotilla consisting of boats and motor launches packed with people in hundreds waving Egyptian flags and chanting \\"Leave Morsi!\\" accompanied by drums, reportedly sailed down the Nile voicing their opposition to the president. Both river banks saw a significant number of protesters in a city that rarely witnesses unrest, with masses demonstrating across Luxor en route to one of their rallying points at the governorate building, where a sit-in was planned until their demands are met. There was a line of men on the corniche holding hands and making a corridor packed with women of all ages into the front, sealing off area of the governor's office. Luxor Temple was the site another gathering, where marches from Karnak, Sawagi and Awamea had met and the temple's exterior became full in the afternoon despite the stifling heat that day. 3,500 anti-Morsi demonstrators were reported in the city of Aswan south of the Luxor and Qena governorates. There were escalating verbal confrontations between opponents and supporters of Morsi in Aswan's main Shohadah Square as lawyers had gathered for a march heading to the square from the city court. Tamarod, joined by a number of parties such as the Wafd Party, announced an open ended sit-in and blockade at the government offices in Sohag. In the provincial capital's Culture Square, the city's largest, revolutionary forces have announced their intention to march after mid-day prayers. Shops were closed and the city's trading activity was relatively calm. The protesters chanted against the Brotherhood and called for national unity between Muslims and Christians while other marches were arriving from all over Sohag and from surrounding villages. On the other hand, hundreds of Islamists and their supporters gathered in front of the city's Korman mosque in support of Morsi. A near confrontation would inevitable between pro and anti-Morsi demonstrators if the police had not intervened forcing the Islamists to abandon the site for Tamarod. Tahta, another city in the Sohag Governorate, witnessed thousands in its main streets demanding the removal of President Mohamed Morsi. The governorate of Assiut, an Islamist stronghold which was the site of this day's deadliest clashes, a drive-by took place in the capital Assiut where it was estimated that more than 50,000 were protesting in the city by night. Gunmen on a motorcycle opened fire on a protest in which tens of thousands were participating, killing one person and wounding four, sending the panicked crowd running. The enraged protesters later marched on the nearby FJP offices, where gunmen inside the compound shot at them, killing two more demonstrators, according to security officials who were speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk to the press. The clashes later escalated with protesters fighting alongside security forces on one side and Morsi's supporters on the other. Another deadly confrontation occurred in Beni Suef where opponents of Mohamed Morsi torched the ruling FJP's offices earlier in the morning, hours before mass protests were about to take place in the province. Nasser Saad, the FJP's media spokesman in Beni Suef, said that several protesters threw Molotov cocktails at the building's balconies around two o'clock in the morning before moving to a secretariat office and torched it too. Later that day, one protester was killed and 30 were injured, according to Beni Suef's security chief, when unknown assailants fired at anti-Morsi protests in El-Modereya Square. Following the shooting, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya claimed in a statement that the person killed was a member of the Islamist group while the office of Hamdeen Sabahi's Popular Current claimed that members of the \\"jihadist movement\\" in the city was the one behind the attack. The health ministry confirmed however that 25-year-old Ammar Gouda was the protester who died while participating in anti-Morsi protests. The army arrived to break up the situation and the demonstrations quietly continued later on. There were other violent clashes in the Faiyum Governorate in which hundreds of Morsi opponents clashed with his Islamist supporters outside the Muslim Brotherhood's local FJP office. Both sides were pelting sticks and stones at each other in the Al-Masala district and there were also unconfirmed reports of rubber bullets being used mutually by the clashing demonstrators. =Storming of the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters= Around midnight, the Muslim Brotherhood's national headquarters in Cairo's Mokattam district, whom Morsi's critics view as the government's real seat of power in the country, came under attack when anti-Morsi protesters started throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks at the six-story building's windows. There were also reports of shotguns being used from the side of the protesters according to the Brotherhood's spokesman Gehad El-Haddad who said that the attackers had been successfully repelled by the officials present in the building. This however proved untrue as clashes immediately followed the all-night siege with birdshot and live ammunition reportedly exchanged between the two sides. According to the Health Ministry, eight people have been killed as the rioting continued until next morning when anti-Morsi protesters eventually stormed the compound, despite being barricaded with sandbags prior to the attack, and the building was later ransacked and torched. Looting took place the next morning with rioters carting off furniture, blankets, rugs, files and air-conditioning devices among others. Fire was reportedly still raging from one floor as protesters tore down the Muslim Brotherhood signs from the building's front facade and another waved the Egyptian flag from an upper-story window.  Continuing protests  =1 July= As the protests headed into their second day, the plundering persisted at the Brotherhood's headquarters compound, the site of fierce clashes the previous night. The protesters were already gearing up for new rallies this day, with some having spent the night in several tents that were installed in Tahrir Square and around Ittihadiya Palace. Protesters in Tahrir staged a sit-in around the Mogamma building and completely surrounded the government complex early in the morning, demanding the departure of President Mohamed Morsi and early presidential elections. Around 600 families who were affiliated with the so-called \\"Couch Party\\" staged demonstrations in the up-scale Greater Cairo district of Mohandessin, along with others in the El-Manial district in southern Cairo, calling for Morsi to resign and some brought sofas with them as a way of displaying how unashamed they are of belonging to this movement. In the evening, the band Cairokee performed for thousands of protesters in front of the presidential palace after receiving an invitation by volunteer organizers. They later thanked all the protesters who sang along with them during their performance. There have been calls by organizers for sit-ins at the Cabinet building, interim parliament, and another presidential place by the demonstrations' organizers, as well as other calls for nationwide labor strikes to pressure the government but there were no reported responses by the country's trade unions. Tamarod released a statement giving Morsi a deadline to step down until the next day at 5:00 PM, warning him they would hike up the demonstrations marching on all palaces and that he would face a mass campaign of \\"complete civil disobedience\\". They also requested a new presidential election as part of their declaration and called on the military and police to make it clear that they support the protesters. In addition, five cabinet ministers resigned in solidarity with the protests. They were Minister of Communication and IT Atef Helmy, Minister of Environment Khaled Abdel-Aal, Minister of Water Utilities Abdel Qawi Khalifa, Minister of Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Hatem Bagato, who had previously stated on Sunday that the Supreme Constitutional Court (SCC) cannot dismiss the president from office, and finally Minister of Tourism Hisham Zazou, who had previously submitted his resignation to PM Hesham Qandil earlier in June after Morsi appointed as governor of Luxor an ex-militant linked to a group that was responsible for the massacre of tourists in 1997, but later came back to office when the governor resigned instead. Also, eight independent parliamentarians from the Islamist-dominated Shura Council officially resigned from the body in protest and solidarity with the opposition's demands. In Assiut, thousands attended the funerals of the three protesters who were killed on Sunday during evening clashes chanting against the Brotherhood. The body of Mohamed Abdel Hamid, a director at the National Bank, was carried to the cemetery by hundreds of activists who proceeded in front of the governorate building where the confrontation took place the night before, waving national flags and calling for retribution. The funeral of the second victim, Mohamed Nasef, was marked by anger on the part of the family and tight security. The service for Abanoub Atef, the third victim, took place in the Church of the Resurrection, and was attended by a number of activists. The local Wafd Party held the Brotherhood and the Islamist group al-Gamaa al-Islamiya responsible for the deaths and injuries and accused them of encouraging their supporters to attack unarmed civilians under the guise of jihad for God. Supporters and opponents of Mohamed Morsi exchanged gunfire in Suez as the sound of shots rocked the city, while the governor of Ismailia, Hassan el-Rifaai, resigned from office. =2 July= In Cairo, demonstrators were pouring into Tahrir Square, where popular committees were blocking all roads leading in and out of the already packed square after two major marches arrived from Shubra and Mohandessin. An artists' rally, smaller in size than the one from Sunday but still counting several hundreds, marched to Tahrir through Qasr al-Nil Bridge after gathering once again in front of the culture ministry. They were led by some professional vocalists into singing the Egyptian national anthem along with chants such as \\"Egypt is a secular country\\" and \\"Revolution continues\\". Mass rallies of thousands in Ittihadiya Palace's surroundings were peaceful and were jubilant as well, with men and women dancing to patriotic music. Al-Ahram reported that the numbers were bigger than Monday with an increase of tents in al-Merghany Street by the palace. There were also volunteer-manned checkpoints that have been tightened up since the day before, searching car trunks and women's purses. Tens of thousands have gathered at the Qubba presidential palace and the numbers kept increasing till the end of the day. Fireworks are lighting up the sky. At a nearby underground metro station, crowds were so large that the station workers have opened the metro barriers to allow people to exit easily. Groups of people wearing high-visibility jackets were spreading out patrolling the demonstration. Qubba's vicinity, one of this day's highlights, became a major location for protests only this weekend because during the previous months anti-Morsi marches usually headed to Tahrir Square or to Ittihadiya instead. The reason behind that is because the president moved from the Egypt's official presidential palace to Quba Palace, and as a result, the site became a popular rallying point for demonstrations during this uprising. Many protesters were chanting in favour of the military and General el-Sisi, as chants of \\"the people and the army are one hand\\" were very common and spray- painted \\"Game Over\\" on the gates of the palace. Another wave of resignations similar to Monday's included Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr who decided to step down in response to the unrest, along with presidential spokesman Ehab Fahmy and cabinet spokesman Alaa al-Hadidi. This day saw significant numbers of pro-Morsi marches across the country as many started to suspect a Revolution would take place. Hundreds of Morsi supporters gathered in front of Cairo University in Al-Nahda Square as nationwide demonstrations entered their third consecutive day. The protesters, whose numbers were increasing, blocked roads leading to the front gates of the campus and erected a stage in a show of support for the embattled president's legitimacy following a statement issued by the armed forces on Monday. The rallies, along with many other similar ones in several parts of Egypt, were organized by Salafist groups such as Al-Gamaa al-Islamiyya which stated that pro-Morsi demonstrations this day would take place in 11 different governorates. Around Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque in Nasr City, the president's supporters gathered in their hundreds of thousands, a clear defiance of the millions of anti-Morsi demonstrators who gathered in dozens of squares across Egypt. In Upper Egypt, thousands of Morsi supporters prominently gathered in the cities of Minya, Assiut and Qena among others. In front of Minya's Al-Rahman mosque which is known in the city as an Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya spot, thousands gathered in a march towards the city's Palace Square where hundreds of anti-Morsi protesters had been staging a sit- in against the recently appointed Islamist affiliated governor. According to Al-Ahram, a number of people from the pro-Morsi rally reportedly fired at protesters in front of the governorate building which resulted in a violent confrontation. Thousands of Morsi's supporters took to the streets in Sa'a Square in Qena in a rally organized by the ruling Freedom and Justice Party, along with their allies, Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya, the Raya Party and the Homeland Party. Assiut's Omar Makram Mosque vicinity also saw thousands gathering in support of what they called \\"the present's legitimacy\\". At the same time however, hundreds of Morsi's opponents gathered in a demonstration in front of the city's governorate headquarters. Thousands of pro-Morsi demonstrators took over Sohag's Culture Square pushing anti-Morsi protesters to retreat into other streets of the city in fear of clashes. Protests also took place in the northern city of Marsa Matruh. There were deadly clashes across the country, as the Cairo University demonstration in Giza's Al-Nahda Square witnessed a violent confrontation between pro and anti-Morsi demonstrators in the surrounding streets. Human Rights Watch reported that the clashes left 18 killed, 4 of whom were confirmed residents, and scores injured when, according to Muslim Brotherhood supporters, armed \\"thugs\\" attacked their sit-in as an exchange of automatic gunfire intensified after 10:00 PM. Residents acknowledged they armed themselves with rocks and knives, while Morsi's supporters acknowledged to have carried guns during the riot in the intersection of the campus' main road and Ahmed Zewail Street. Security forces intervened as a goal of restoring order but ended up clashing with Morsi supporters instead and teargas was used. There was conflict in another parts of Giza earlier that day, such as in Faisal Street where seven were wounded after their march was shot at from the side of Morsi's supporters. In the Imbaba district, gunfire was exchanged during clashes in Kit Kat Square using pellets and Molotov cocktails. There was one death confirmed by the health ministry and the injured were taken to hospitals in Imbaba and Agouza leaving the site of confrontation with rocks and glass scattered all over. Other parts of Egypt also saw violent clashes such as Agami in the governorate of Alexandria, where the police tried to contain the scuffles between pro and anti-Morsi protesters by firing teargas with the head of Alexandria's investigative department reporting 25 injured. In Qalyubia's city of Banha, the Brotherhood's FJP local headquarters was torched after it was stormed by anti-Morsi protesters. The building was ransacked and the banner that carries the name of the party was removed. Other clashes were confirmed in the Beheira and Luxor governorates. Morsi's speech Later that night, President Mohamed Morsi made his first official speech since the events began on Sunday where he appeared defiant to the military's ultimatum and refused to back down. He admitted that he made mistakes but insisted that he was the legitimate democratically elected president. In the speech he said: The speech was immediately denounced by opposition activists. =3 July: Reaching deadline= Before the deadline passed, Tahrir Square was still filling up with anti-Morsi demonstrators with the central square partially full while surrounding streets were still relatively empty. It started to crowd however, and when the 48-hour period ended, Tahrir was completely packed with hundreds of thousands of protesters who were awaiting a statement by General el-Sisi. Protesters closed the gates of Tahrir's iconic Mogamma building in the southern part of the square for the second time since Monday, two days before, but reopened it on Tuesday. Hundreds of demonstrators carried a coffin representing President Mohamed Morsi in a symbolic funeral which roamed around Tahrir Square as three lambs were slaughtered representing Mohamed Morsi, Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohamed Badie and Brotherhood deputy leader Khairat el-Shater, referring to \\"sheep\\", a derogatory term popular among Brotherhood opponents used to describe followers of the group in Egypt. The atmosphere was generally celebratory as the thousands of demonstrators were waving national flags and chanting against Morsi. Hundreds of women holding hands were chanting \\"Morsi, get out!\\", while they were encircled by a human shield that was viewed as necessary to curb the number of sexual assaults that were reported in Tahrir and its surroundings since the uprising began on 30 June. Anti-sexual violence groups such as Tahrir Bodyguard and Operation Anti Sexual Harassment wore recognizable neon yellow vests and helmets and were monitoring the scene. The vicinity of Ittihadiya Palace was almost full with people protesting against Morsi, as the band Cairokee attended the demonstrations for a second time since Monday's demonstrations in the Heliopolis suburb of Cairo and performed in front of hundreds of thousands of protesters cheering them, with lyrics such as \\"we are the people… and our path is right\\" and \\"you say 'justice', and they call you a betrayer\\". Several miles away from the presidential palace, anti-Morsi demonstrators started to congregate outside the ministry of defense building and were chanting patriotically. The group of pro-military protesters was building up until the much waited announcement and they have been holding a sit-in in the location for twelve days. 93 diplomats, some based in the foreign affairs ministry declared a strike as an objection to the \\"failure of the president to meet the people's demands.\\" Alexandria's streets witnessed protests in masses with anti-Morsi rallies marching along its main streets, including the seafront. Several thousands kept flocking into Sidi Gaber's station square, its surroundings and the Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque in the city center, two typical rally points for anti-government demonstrations in the city. There were also tens of thousands of Morsi opponents who were stationed in the Sidi Bishr district's Mahatta Square calling for the fall of the regime. Clashes, however, took place in the neighborhood when supporters of Mohamed Morsi scuffled with the residents, leaving five injured. There were violent clashes that erupted in other parts of the city when a rally by estimated hundreds of Morsi's Islamist supporters, who were chanting \\"The people want to apply the law of God!\\", was intercepted by residents of the Agami district who tried to obstruct the march in objection to the demonstration's slogans. The confrontation left nearly seventeen injured and later required police intervention, the latter using teargas to disperse the fighting. There were hundreds of thousands rallying in Mansoura's Thawra Square, who significantly increased after el-Sisi's statement later that night. Protesters in the city continued to blockade a number of state institutions for a fourth consecutive day of their civil disobedience campaign. \\"The people already brought down the regime,\\" protesters chanted, as well as \\"Mansoura will turn you back into a banned group\\". Damietta saw 10,000 protesters gathering in Al-Bosta Square since Sunday. In different acts of civil disobedience across the country, Kafr el-Sheikh saw protesters still besieging the governorate headquarters and announced their intention to keep doing so until Morsi and his Brotherhood- appointed governor resign. In Tanta, members of youth protest groups shut the gate to the Gharbiya governorate offices with metal chains, preventing employees from entering the building. In Menoufia, demonstrators blocked one of the city's main roads. In Sharqia, Morsi's hometown, crowds of protesters gathered outside the president's residence there, chanting anti-regime slogans, stating that they will start an open-ended sit-in until their demands are met, threatening to bring the whole city to a halt. Port Said witnessed protesters shutting down the Investment Authority compound. Coup d'état On 3 July 2013, General el-Sisi led a coalition to remove Morsi from power and suspended the constitution. The move came after the military's ultimatum for the government to \\"resolve its differences\\" with opponents was ignored. The military arrested Morsi and Muslim Brotherhood leaders, and declared Chief Justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court Adly Mansour as the interim president of Egypt. The announcement was followed by demonstrations and clashes between supporters and opponents of the move throughout Egypt. The military's action was supported by the Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar Ahmed el- Tayeb, the Coptic Orthodox Pope Tawadros II and opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei. Characteristics =Anti-American sentiment= Since Mohamed Morsi's inauguration in June 2012, a sense of anti-Americanism grew stronger within a large portion of the Egyptian society that opposed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood. Anne W. Patterson, the US Ambassador in Egypt, was singled out during the events as the one to blame for allegedly conspiring to bring Morsi to power and for holding deals with senior Brotherhood officials. Patterson previously said that the White House supported Mohamed Morsi. \\"Some say that street action will produce better results than elections. To be honest, my government and I are deeply skeptical,\\" she said. A number of prominent activists such as George Ishaq called her \\"an evil lady who is creating divisions\\" while Hassan Shahin, a co-founder of Tamarod, said that \\"America and the Brotherhood have united to bring down the Egyptian people\\". Morsi's opponents made a symbol out of her in the streets, reflecting their anger at what they believe to be the American government's meddlesome role in the country's affairs. In Tahrir Square and other protest locations across Egypt, there were large banners expressing love for the American people but hatred towards the US administration. Anti-American posters were common among anti-Morsi demonstrators with some having Patterson's image plastered on banners crossed out with a blood-red X or smeared with insults, the most common being \\"Hayzaboon\\" (Arabic for \\"ogre\\"). Solidarity and expatriate protests Hundreds, Egyptians and Australians, took part in demonstrations against Mohamed Morsi in Australia's Melbourne where jubilant crowds gathered at the city's State Library before marching to the Egyptian Consulate. They chanted in unity for a better future. Another protest took place in Sydney, where hundreds from the Egyptian community gathered to protest against Morsi, demanding him to leave. The demonstration was organised by members of the Tamarod movement in Australia. There were demonstrations in front of the Egyptian consulate in Canada's Montreal, where members of the Egyptian community in the city and their supporters called on the United Nations to publicly condemn the Muslim Brotherhood regime as well as policies of the United States, whom they accuse of supporting the \\"rise of political Islam\\" in the Middle East and of transforming the region into a den of terrorism. They also called on the Canadian government not to adhere to this position. Other cities such as Toronto, Calgary and the capital Ottawa, also witnessed protests against Morsi. The French capital Paris, where the local Tamarod campaign claimed to have collected 1,800 signatures, also saw a rally joined by activists from diverse organizations protesting against Mohamed Morsi in the Place Saint-Michel and was organized in coordination with several revolutionary and secular forces in the city. The April 6 Youth Movement organized a demonstrations in the Place de l'Opéra, while another in front of the Egyptian embassy took place on both Saturday and Sunday. A rival demonstration however, was reported in Trocadéro in support of the president. In Italy, anti-Morsi protests took place in five cities across the country: Milan, Rome, Bologna, Napoli and Palermo. According to MENA, most Egyptians in Italy joined the anti-Morsi demonstrations and that the biggest protests were located in the industrial city of Milan where two demonstrations were held, one in Duomo Square and the other in front of the Egyptian consulate in Via Restelli by the Egyptian community ending at the city's central station. Another fifty people gathered in Piazza Duca d'Aosta calling for Morsi's resignation. The Constitution Party reported protests in other European cities such as Denmark's capital Copenhagen, Sweden's capital Stockholm, Ireland's capital Dublin as well as several German cities, including the capital Berlin, where around 80 demonstrators gathered in front of the Egyptian embassy carrying red cards in a show of solidarity with the Tamarod movement. Switzerland's Geneva also witnessed protests against Morsi. From South Korea, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) delivered a message of solidarity with the Egyptian workers participating in the protests, where it said:\\"The struggle of Egyptian people is our struggle\\". The statement begins with: > We, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) extend our warm hearted > solidarity to the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions (EFITU) > and all the workers and people of Egypt who took the street for bread, > freedom and social justice. Unjum Mirza of Britain's RMT Union gave a speech of solidarity with the protesters in Egypt on behalf of the union in front of the Egyptian embassy in London, where he was joined by nearly 200 people, in which he said: > I've decided to extend a very short message of solidarity from the Transport > Union in Britain to the hundreds of thousands of millions marching across > Egypt to bring down this corrupt Morsi regime Hundreds of Egyptians raised their national flag in front of the United Nations Headquarters in New York City voicing their opposition to President Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood. Also, several hundred demonstrators gathered in Washington D.C. in front of the White House. Many of them were young and chanted against Mohamed Morsi with slogans such as \\"Leave\\" on both Saturday and Sunday. In Saudi Arabia, a number of Egyptian demonstrators raised red cards signifying their rejection of the government in front of the Egyptian embassy in Riyadh, while the embassy in the Yemeni capital Sana'a saw some of Yemen's political groups calling on Morsi to step down. International reactions ;Supranational bodies * - The European Union released a brief statement where it says: \\"We call all political forces in Egypt to remain calm, avoid violence and start a political dialogue\\". * - UN spokesman Eduardo del Buey stated that while most of the protests appear to be peaceful, \\"the reports of a number of deaths and injuries, of sexual assault against women demonstrators, as well as acts of destruction of property are to be strongly condemned.\\" :On Tuesday, Rupert Colville of the UN human rights office read a statement. \\"We are following with great concern the extremely tense situation in Egypt and wish to convey a strong message of solidarity and support to the Egyptian people.\\" ... \\"We call on the President of Egypt to listen to the demands and wishes of the Egyptian people [...] and to address key issues raised by the opposition and civil society in recent months, as well as to heed the lessons of the past in this particularly fragile situation,\\" he said. ;States * - While issuing a travel warning for Australians wishing to visit Egypt, Foreign Minister Bob Carr addressed the violence in Egypt. \\"Regrettably, there are also reports that Islamic extremists have threatened violence against Coptic churches and communities. We urge all parties to renounce violence in holding street rallies, and for the Egyptian police and military to exercise appropriate restraint in keeping public order,\\" he said. * - Canada temporarily closed its Egyptian embassy. Immigration Minister Jason Kenney commented: \\"We're very concerned with the uncertainty that exists and that's why we closed the Canadian embassy for security reasons.\\" * - French Foreign Ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot called Egyptian authorities to listen to \\"the legitimate concerns\\" of protesters. * - Iran's government on Tuesday, called on the Egyptian military to support national reconciliation and respect the \\"vote of the people\\". \\"Mohamed Morsi is the incumbent president based on the people's vote,\\" Iranian deputy foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian told the official IRNA news agency. \\"It is expected of the armed forces of Egypt that they play their role in supporting national reconciliation and respect the vote of the people\\". * - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: \\"Like everybody, we are watching very carefully what's happening in Egypt\\". \\"Remember that for 30 years now we have had an anchor of peace and stability in the Middle East, and that was the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. We hope that peace will be kept\\". :Former Israeli ambassador to Egypt, Eli Shaked, said, \\"Instability is bad for Israel. Instability is bad for the Middle East.\\" He added, \\"Even with the extremists in power, they have shown they understand the value, or the interests of Egypt.\\" * - Foreign Affairs Minister Olugbenga Ashiru has urged the Nigerian community in Egypt to remain calm on Monday following the latest violence. \\"I am in touch with our ambassador in Cairo. We are watching developments carefully but there is no cause for alarm. I do believe that the authorities in Egypt will contain the situation. Also the ambassador is in contact with the leadership of the Nigerian community in Egypt on the need to remain calm,\\" he said. * - Mahmoud al-Habbash, Minister of Religious Affairs of the Palestinian Authority, urged Arab Idol star Mohammed Assaf to cancel the concerts he planned for the West Bank stating that \\"certain conditions and developments necessitate that we delay festivities for two or more days\\".

He started learning violin and then studied cello in the Peabody Institute with such teachers as W. Wirts, Willem Willeke or Leo Schulz.Lyse Vézina, Le violoncelle: Ses origines, son histoire, ses interprètes, Varia (Editions), 2006, p. 285 (fr) Soloist, as early as 1916, of the Philadelphia Orchestra under Stokowski’s conducting, he became in 1918 principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, then conducted by Walter Damrosch. In 1921 he met and even played with Pablo Casals who was touring the United States. The latter encouraged him further studying in Europe which he did with Julius Klengel, Hugo Becker, Nadia Boulanger and Diran Alexanian; Pablo Casals remained however his most important mentor and they became lifelong friends.Web site of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (Cello Music Collections) Eisenberg spent the years between 1926-1939 playing and teaching in Europe: * Soloist with the main European and American orchestras, he premiered, in 1938 with the Pasdeloup Orchestra, the Concerto ballata composed and conducted by Glazunov as well as the Rhapsodie Hébraïque Schelomo composed and conducted by Ernest Bloch. His interpretations of the Cello Suites (Bach) were a reference and he was playing in the Trio Menuhin. * He founded and was the artistic director of the « London International Violoncello Center » and taught at the Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris where he succeeded Diran Alexanian. In the U.S., he held teaching positions at the Academy of Music (Philadelphia), the University of Southern California as well as at the Cambridge Longy School and, for the ten last years of his life, at the International Summer Courses of Cascais (Portugal).

The film was produced the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) with the participation of Copperheart Entertainment and the Seneca College Animation Arts Centre. The film is made with computer animation, as well as pixilation sequences at the beginning and end of the film, featuring animation director John R. Dilworth as the friend whose name Landreth cannot recall. Subconscious Password is Landreth's first 3-D film and third with the NFB, Copperheart Entertainment and Seneca College. The idea for the film came to Landreth after watching a rerun of Password in 2010. Synopsis The film presents the mental process of remembering a friend's name as it were an episode of the old Password game show, with various celebrities attempting to assist Landreth. Production More than fifteen Seneca College graduating students worked on Subconscious Password, supported by five faculty members, as part of the Seneca Summer Animation Institute. After graduation, a number of these students were hired to work on the project until it was completed in February 2013. Most of the film was produced at Seneca's Animation Arts Centre in Toronto, with three Seneca students also working on the film at the NFB's Animation Studio in Montreal. Subconscious Password was the first stereoscopic 3D film for Seneca College. The images of celebrities used in the film were developed from a variety of sources, with Sammy Davis, Jr. appearing via live-action footage available in the public domain and James Joyce derived from photos projected onto a pseudo-3D character. The computer animation was created with Autodesk Maya, with opening title sequences animated with SANDDE (Stereoscopic Animation Drawing Device), a digital animation technology created by IMAX that allows artists to create hand-drawn animation in 3D space, and which has been licensed to the NFB to develop creative applications. Landreth has stated that the film begins \\"relatively flat\\", using more stereoscopic depth to immerse audiences as the film progresses. Release Subconscious Password was named best short film at the 2013 Annecy International Animated Film Festival. The film had its Canadian premiere at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. In December 2013, the film was named to the Toronto International Film Festival's annual top ten list, in the short film category. On March 9, 2014, Subconscious Password was named best animated short at the Canadian Screen Awards.

It was written by Andrew Hutchings and published by The Fourth Dimension. The game is loosely set in the First World War, though many elements are simplified and anachronistic. Gameplay The player flies a single British Tiger Moth aircraft (despite the design dating from peacetime and being a trainer) on various missions against German forces. Free movement is allowed around each mission's map, though the aircraft does not have the fuel capacity to allow infinite roaming - instead it must return to the home airfield to refuel. The Tiger Moth carries a single fixed forward-firing machine gun with infinite ammunition. The player pilots the plane from an in-cockpit view, though a chase camera is used if they are shot down, showing the helpless demise of their aircraft. The missions involved a mix of target ground attack and interception, all undertaken solo and all requiring the player to land safely at home base afterwards. A number of German aircraft will attempt to intervene by attacking the player's aircraft, which can take six hits before being shot down and crashing - though it can be repaired at the home air strip if the player is capable of reaching it. Later missions take part on a much- simplified and undersize map of Western Europe, with the UK as the player's base. For some missions an aircraft carrier is used as the base instead of an airstrip. Enemy aircraft include primitive, simple representation of German World War I types such as the Fokker Eindecker, Fokker Triplane and Gotha G.IV bomber. AI skill varies on these machines, which all have varying attributes - the Triplane is highly manoeuvrable whereas the Gotha is slow but has a flexible range of fire. Ground-based anti-aircraft turrets are used by both sides. The only time another British aircraft is seen is if a player attacks a friendly base, at which point a second Tiger Moth - with very high AI - is dispatched to attack the player; these are swiftly replaced if destroyed by the player, while the home base's anti-aircraft fire also attacks the player, making landing for repair or refuelling nearly impossible. At the end of a mission - successful or otherwise - a player will be presented with a tally of kills, including the player's own aircraft if the mission has been unsuccessful. In addition to the missions the game includes skirmish-style scenarios, ranging from simple landing and takeoff exercises to dogfights through to attacking a large enemy aircraft formation. Unlike the missions, which always start with the player stationary on their home base, these sometimes start with the Tiger Moth mid-air. The game uses two discs - a 'game' disc required for loading up, then a missions disc. 4th Dimension brought out a supplement called Chocks Away Extra Missions which could provide a new set of scenarios but required the first disc from the initial release to run. Hutchings then began work on Spitfire Fury, a World War 2 equivalent of the game for 4th Dimension, but this hit development trouble and was abandoned. Instead 4th Dimension's next flight simulator would be the ambitious and long-gestating Birds of War. Reception Acorn User praised its two player mode, saying it was \\"...brilliantly good fun\\".https://archive.org/stream/1993-94_Acorn_User_Games_Review_The_1993-12_Redwood_Publishing_GB_supplement#page/n9/mode/2up References Category:1990 video games Category:Acorn Archimedes games Category:Combat flight simulators Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:World War I video games Category:Video games set in the British Empire ","title":"Chocks Away"},{"id":"39860091","text":"MoneyForceMoneyForce is a programme that aims to improve the financial capability of the UK Armed Forces by providing money guidance to all those serving in the military and their families.

A 1949 stained window to RAF fighter pilot Philip Dales =Exterior= St Peter's is built in ashlar-dressed limestone rubble, and is Norman and Early English in style. It consists of a chancel, nave, two aisles, a west-facing tower with spire, a south chapel, and a south porch. The 13th-century tower is in three stages, surmounted by a later 14th-century broach spire incorporating three tiers of lucarnes. Of the tower's two upper stage belfry openings, one is bounded on its sides by narrow columns and headed by a tympana arch containing trefoils. The nave clerestory could be of either Decorated or Perpendicular period. It has four windows north and south and is headed by a plain parapet of little height. The nave roof, drained by two gargoyles on its north side, is lead, and the chancel roof, red tile. The Perpendicular south porch is surmounted by pinnacles and by a panelled parapet decorated with shields in quatrefoils. An inscription on the outside face of the porch reads: \\"Hac non vade via, nisi dicas Ave Maria\\" (go not away unless you say an Ave Maria). =Interior= St Peter's accommodates seating for 200. The interior contains a north arcade of three bays with circular piers, square abaci, and rounded arches. The chancel arch is Early English, as is the south arcade where one octagonal pier is a 1380 replacement attributed, by inscription, to Thomas Bate, mason of Corby: \\"Ista columna facta fuit ad festum Sancti Michaelis, Anno Domini MCCCLXXX et nomen factoris thomas bate de Corby.\\" There are two tomb recesses, one in the south aisle and plain, the other, in the chancel. Pevsner describes the chancel recess as 13th-century, with English Heritage noting it as 14th. Within the chancel is an aumbry, and a double-niche sedilia or Easter Sepulchre, both 14th-century. A further aumbry, and a piscina, are part of the early 13th-century south chapel. The 15th-century font is octagonal, and of Perpendicular style with quatrefoils and shields. The pulpit dates from the 20th century, the altar rails, the 18th, and the pews, the 19th but retaining 15th-century poppy head bench ends. Within an east window of the north aisle are fragments of medieval glass with an inscription indicating a 1376 reference to Sir John Welby. =Monuments= In a south aisle recess, beneath an ogee arch with carved small figures, is an effigy of a lady in 14th-century costume, her head resting on two small cushions. An alabaster war memorial plaque to parish war dead of the First World War hangs in the church. Further church memorials include a commemorative brass plate on a choir pew to a soldier killed in battle at Arras in 1917. A south wall stained glass window was erected in 1949 in memory of Sgt.

It was 13 episodes long and starred Aubry's son Mehdi as Sebastien, whilst Aubry appeared as the episode host and co-directed episodes with Jean Guillaume. Synopsis Six-year-old orphan Sebastian and his friend, six-year-old Pyrenean bitch Belle, live in the French Alps with the villagers of Belvédère. Production It was filmed as a live-action show in black-and-white in France under its original name in 1965. In 1967 it was dubbed and the title was anglicised. It first appeared in the UK on BBC1 on Monday afternoons, running from 2 October 1967 to 1 January 1968. Shown in the time slot after Blue Peter, it was repeated several times and became an important ingredient of school holiday television. Filmed in and around the village of Belvédère in Alpes-Maritimes, its authentic locations, sensitive writing, and winning performances by the actors, makes it an enduring classic. Its deep theme is the power and importance of love. The part of Sebastian was played by Mehdi El Glaoui, Cécile Aubry's son from her marriage to a Moroccan man.  Reception  The serial spawned two further 13 part colour film sequels 'Sébastien parmi les hommes' (Sebastian Among Men) (1968) retitled 'Belle, Sebastian and the Horses' by the BBC and 'Sébastien et la Mary-Morgane' (Sebastian and the Mary Morgan) (1970) which was not broadcast by the BBC. The Scottish indie pop band Belle and Sebastian took their name from the TV series.

For example, almost all languages have the stop consonants /p/, /t/, /k/, and almost all have the vowels /a/, /i/, and /u/. Other phonemes differ considerably among languages, but not nearly as much as they would if each language were free to choose arbitrarily. Proposed by Ken Stevens at MIT, quantal theory formalizes the intuition that some speech sounds are easier to produce than others. Sounds that are easier to reliably produce, in the formal way described below, are more common among the languages of the world; those that are harder to reliably produce are less common. The Quantal Nature of Speech Let Y=f(X), where X is any particular articulatory parameter (tongue tip position, for example), and Y is any particular perceptual parameter (perceived frequency of the peak in the acoustic spectrum, for example). Like any nonlinear relation, f(X) has regions of low slope (df/dX small) and regions of high slope (df/dX large). Values of Y drawn from a high-slope region are unstable, in the sense that a small change in X causes a large change in Y; values of Y drawn from a low-slope region are conversely stable, in that they are little perturbed by large changes in X. Stevens proposed in 1968 that the stability of low-slope regions makes them more likely to be chosen as discrete linguistic units (phonemes) by the languages of the world, and that the distinction between any pair of phonemes tends similarly to occur across an unstable high-slope boundary region. Examples include =Consonant Place of Articulation= * Alveolar versus palatal. The hard palate is horizontal for up to 1 cm behind the teeth, before suddenly opening upward in a feature known as the alveolar ridge. By moving the tongue a few millimeters before or behind the alveolar ridge, therefore, it is possible to dramatically change the acoustic spectrum, resulting in the distinction between \\"sip\\" and \\"ship\\". * Palatal versus retroflex. The tongue tip is flexible about 1.5 cm below its tip, permitting the tongue tip to fold back on itself. If the tongue tip is close to the palate when this action is performed, the air cavity under the tongue is suddenly lengthened thereby from 2.5 cm to 4 cm, resulting in the change from \\"chip\\" to \\"trip,\\" or from \\"you\\" to \\"rue.\\" =Consonant Manner= * Plosive versus fricative versus glide. Producing turbulence in the vocal tract requires a very careful adjustment: the minimum constriction cross-section must be typically less than 1.5mm, but greater than 0mm. If the tongue (for example) closes all the way against the palate, then releases again, the result is a plosive (as in \\"tip\\"). If the tongue closes most of the way, but doesn't pass the magic 1.5mm boundary, the result is a glide (as in \\"yip\\"). If the tongue reaches a minimum constriction width between 0 and 1.5mm, the resulting sound is a fricative (as in \\"ship\\"). Despite the high degree of control required, most languages maintain a three-way contrast between glides, fricatives, and plosives, because of the large acoustic difference so achieved. * Plosive versus nasal. If the passage between your mouth and nose is opened by even 1mm during the /b/ closure of \\"bug,\\" the word becomes \\"mug.\\" Further opening of the soft palate (2mm, 5mm, even 20mm) has almost no effect on the acoustics; most languages distinguish /b/ from /m/, but few (if any?) distinguish different degrees of soft palate opening. * Strident versus nonstrident. When a fricative is produced, the turbulent jet of air can either be pointed against an obstacle (e.g., in the word \\"sin,\\" the jet is directed against the lower teeth), or pointed directly out of the mouth (as in the word \\"thin\\"). A jet directed against an obstacle makes a lot more noise (sound power is typically ten times greater), therefore many languages use this distinction to enhance an otherwise tiny place of articulation difference. =Vowels= * Lehiste demonstrated that when the peak frequencies in a vowel spectrum (the so-called \\"formants\\") are closer together than about half an octave, listeners respond as if the two peaks were merged into a single peak. Many vowel distinctions straddle this half-octave threshold, e.g., the first two formants of \\"bought\\" are closer than half an octave, while those of \\"but\\" are not; the second and third formants of \\"bit\\" are closer than half an octave, while those of \\"bet\\" are not. Enhancement Features Quantal theory is supported by a theory of language change, developed in collaboration with Jay Keyser, which postulates the existence of redundant or enhancement features. It is quite common, in language, to find a pair of phonemes that differ in two features simultaneously. In English, for example, \\"thin\\" and \\"sin\\" differ in both the place of articulation of the fricative (teeth versus alveolar ridge), and in its loudness (nonstrident versus strident). Similarly, \\"tell\\" and \\"dell\\" differ in both the voicing of the initial consonant, and in its aspiration (the /t/ in \\"tell\\" is immediately followed by a puff of air, like a short /h/ between the plosive and the vowel). In many cases, native speakers have strong and mistaken intuition about the relative importance of the two distinctions, e.g., speakers of English believe that \\"thin\\" versus \\"sin\\" is a place of articulation difference, even though the loudness difference is more perceptible. Stevens, Keyser and Kawasaki proposed that such redundant features evolve as an enhancement of an otherwise weak acoustic distinction, in order to improve the robustness of the language's phonological system.

Such railways can use a number of different technologies to overcome the steepness of the grade.  Usage  Many steep grade railways are located in mountain regions, and are hence also mountain railways. Such railways may form part of infrastructure provided for use by tourists, or as provision for winter sports. Other steep grade railways are located in hilly urban areas. Again these may be largely tourist oriented, or may be used as part of the local public transport provision.  Technology  On steep grades the friction between the wheels and the rails cannot apply sufficient adhesion to the train's wheels so as to overcome gravity, and the train is in danger of sliding down the track. In practice this affects downhill braking capability before it affects uphill climbing ability, and some mountain railways at the lower end of the steepness spectrum rely on standard adhesion for propulsion, but use special track brakes acting directly on the rails. Where the line is too steep to rely on adhesion for climbing, a rack railway may be used, in which a toothed cog wheel engages with a toothed rack rail laid between the tracks. A now little used alternative to the rack and pinion railway is the Fell system, in which traction and/or braking wheel are applied to a central rail under pressure. Rack and pinion animation Another alternative is a cable car in which the car runs on rails, but grasps a continuously moving cable underneath the rails for propulsion, releasing the cable to stop. This is used in San Francisco's famous cable cars. Finally at the steepest end of the spectrum, a funicular railway may be used. Here a cable is used to haul counterbalanced trains up and down the track. The cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops, starts and reverses as required. Cars are often custom built for the slope, with specially raked seating and steps rather than a sloped floor. Taken to its logical conclusion as the slope becomes vertical, a funicular becomes an elevator.

The Goods (1989–1999) The Goods were an American rock band formed in Miami in 1989. The band comprised Jim Camacho (lead vocals/bass/guitar), John Camacho (lead vocals/piano), Tony Oms (guitar/bass/vocals), Kasmir Kujawa (drums/vocals). Camacho, along with his brother John, founded the group on 13 January 1989. In 1998, legendary producer Tom Dowd produced their major label release, Good Things Are Coming. Throughout the 1990s, the band released five albums including the rock opera 5 Steps to Getting Signed, in 1992, which won the prestigious \\"Album of the Year\\" honors at the Florida Jammy Awards. The single \\"I'm Not Average\\", from their critically acclaimed 1995 album Mint, reached number one on the Radio & Record charts in Florida and eventually led to a signing with Blackheart Records, a division of Polygram Records. In 1989, the band made headlines in the Miami Herald and on the TV news program Inside Story when they began tossing condoms into audiences from stage in a public display of joining the fight against AIDS. A one-hour biographical documentary directed by Miguel Delgato aired on VH1 on October 8, 1998. In 1999, The Goods appeared on The Jenny Jones Show in episode 8122, \\"I'm Too Sexy to Get a Date.\\" The Goods disbanded in 1999. Marilyn Manson, who got his first break as The Goods' opening act, commented: \\"I think that they are extremely talented and great musicians.\\" Solo career Jim Camacho at the Fremont Abbey in Seattle, 2014 After The Goods disbanded in 1999, Camacho resumed his career as a solo artist and has released multiple albums to critical acclaim including: Trouble Doll (2001), Hey Hey* (2003), Stalker Songs (2005), and Beachfront Defeat (2009).

Born ca. 1245, Holobolos entered the service of Michael VIII as a grammatikos in his teens, and composed several orations for the early years of Michael's reign that are an important primary source. In 1261, however, when Michael ordered the blinding and imprisonment of the legitimate emperor, John IV Laskaris (r. 1258–1261), Holobolos expressed public grief, and his lips and nose were mutilated as punishment. Holobolos then retired from public service and became a monk at the Prodromos Monastery in Constantinople, with the monastic name Maximos. In 1265/66, through the intervention of Patriarch Germanus III, Holobolos was able to get a post as a teacher, possibly at the orphanage of the Church of St. Paul. Because of his fervent anti-Unionism, he was exiled to the Megalou Agrou monastery on the Sea of Marmara in 1273, and was not allowed to return to the capital until after Michael's death, when his son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328) repudiated the Union. Thus Holobolos participated in the Council of Blachernae in 1285, which formally condemned the Union, and was restored to imperial favour: he received the title of rhetor and became protosynkellos by 1299. According to one of his students, George Galesiotes, he continued teaching until his death, sometime between 1310 and 1314.

The story is narrated by Jacquetta of Luxembourg, mother of Elizabeth Woodville, and covers the reign of the Lancastrian King Henry VI. The novel serves as a prequel to Gregory's The White Queen (2009), the story of Elizabeth's reign as Queen consort of England. Plot Fourteen- year-old Jacquetta, whose noble family claims descendance from the water goddess Melusine, learns the secrets of her inherited powers from her great- aunt Jehanne, the Demoiselle of Luxembourg. Jacquetta befriends Joan of Arc, who is a prisoner at her uncle's castle, but later watches in horror as Joan is burned at the stake by the English-backed church. Three years later at age 17, Jacquetta is given in marriage to John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle to King Henry VI and the English regent in France. On their wedding night, however, the Duke explains that he wishes to keep her a virgin so that she may use the powers of her family in their purest form in his alchemical experiments seeking the ability to turn iron into gold. He later dies and leaves Jacquetta a wealthy widow at 20. She and the Duke's handsome squire Richard Woodville realize that they have fallen in love and become lovers. Returning to England, they marry in secret before the king can remarry her to someone else. Exiled from court in disgrace, Jacquetta and Richard soon have their first child, Elizabeth. Once Jacquetta and Richard are forgiven and allowed back to court, the pair become close companions of the young king Henry VI and his new French bride Margaret of Anjou, a kinswoman of Jacquetta's. Soon after their marriage, however, the royal couple become increasingly unpopular and there are several uprisings. They rely heavily on the advice of favourites and lavish wealth and titles on them, including Richard and Jacquetta. Margaret becomes frustrated with her husband and when she eventually becomes pregnant, it is strongly implied that the baby has actually been fathered by Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. After the King slips into a coma, Jacquetta is a constant companion to the pregnant Queen and remains by her side for the next few years. When the King eventually awakens, the country is plunged into civil war between Lancaster and York led by Richard of York. Margaret becomes Queen Militant and raises armies to fight in her husband's name, including an army of Scots to fight the Yorkists, which makes her even more unpopular with the people. A defeated Margaret is forced to flee to France, and Jacquetta returns to Grafton manor. A widowed Elizabeth also returns with her children, and petitions the new King Edward IV for the return of her lands. Jacquetta looks from the window of her house to see Elizabeth walking up with Edward, finishing where The White Queen begins. Critical reception Publishers Weekly wrote of the novel, \\"Gregory portrays spirited women at odds with powerful men, endowing distant historical events with drama, and figures long dead or invented with real-life flaws and grand emotions.\\" The review adds that the author \\"makes history (mostly accurate) come alive for readers (mostly women) by giving credence to persistent rumors that academic historians (mostly men) have brushed aside.\\" AudioFile magazine gave its Earphones Award to the audiobook recording of The Lady of the Rivers, calling the story \\"fabulous\\" and praising narrator Bianca Amato, noting that \\"Amato’s striking performance draws lifelike portraits from Gregory’s blend of research and imagination.\\" References External links * Official Philippa Gregory website * Category:2011 British novels Category:Historical novels Category:Novels by Philippa Gregory Category:Novels set in the 15th century Category:Works about women in war ","title":"The Lady of the Rivers"},{"id":"39860444","text":"Vasco Caves Regional Preserve is located on the eastern slope of Mount Diablo, on Vasco Road within eastern Contra Costa County, California.

Life He was born in Brompton Row, London. His father, Fileter N. Stephanoff, was a Russian who settled in England and worked painting ceilings and stage scenery, until he committed suicide around 1790; his mother Gertrude Stephanoff (died 7 January 1808) was a flower-painter with Sir Joseph Banks as patron. James Stephanoff (1788?–1874), also an artist, was his elder brother. Stephanoff became a popular painter of historical and domestic subjects, working both in oils and watercolours. He exhibited at the Royal Academy and British Institution from 1807 to 1845, and with the Old Watercolour Society from 1815 to 1820. His wife, Selina Roland, died suddenly. Stephanoff ceased to work as artist many years before his own death, which occurred at West Hanham, near Bristol, on 15 May 1860. Works Falstaff and Mistress Quickly by Philip Francis Stephanoff Stephanoff's works The Trial of Algernon Sidney, Cranmer revoking his Recantation, Poor Relations, and The Reconciliation were engraved; he also furnished designs for The Keepsake and other annuals. For Sir George Nayler's sumptuous work on the coronation of George IV he drew in watercolours a series of costume portraits, which went to the South Kensington Museum. At the Westminster Hall competition in 1843 Stephanoff gained a prize of £100 for a scene from John Milton's Comus.

He won the regional Senior Journalist of the Year Award at the age of 21 and rose to become assistant chief sub- editor before leaving newspapers to read Law at Sussex University. Tempted back into newspapers by becoming the first journalist hired in two years at the Daily Mirror in mid 80s at a time when the paper was considered \\"the mink lined coffin\\" - so highly regarded and so well paid that no-one ever left.

Plot The railroad is coming to Clover City. Railway owner Jim Knox (Edward Arnold) wants to increase his profit by purchasing more than just the right of way for his railroad. He wants the surrounding land and he is willing to use illegal methods to get what he wants. When Pop Wilkie (George 'Gabby' Hayes) refuses to sell, his home is burned to the ground. Witnesses are willing to testify that Knox's employee, Gagan (Trevor Bardette), started the fire but when the case is taken to the local court, Judge Bronson (Guy Kibbee), loyal to Knox, dismisses the charges. Farmer Thomas Logan (Lionel Barrymore) also refuses to sell. Logan is expecting his son Steve (Nelson Eddy), a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, to fight for the rights of the farmers of Clover City. Knox visits Logan at his farm and while everyone is busy in the house, Gagan goes to the barn to start a fire. Steve Logan arrives. Assessing the hopelessness of fighting Knox in court, Steve pretends to side with Knox. Knox is puzzled as to why the fire wasn't set until Gagan is found unconscious thrown across the back of a horse with a note stating that he \\"forgot the matches.\\" The people of the town, who had been hoping for Steve to handle Knox, consider Steve a coward. Maggie Adams (Virginia Bruce), who runs the local restaurant, loves Steve but she can't forgive him for siding with Knox. The only person in town who knows the Steve is not a coward is \\"the Mackerel\\" (Charles Butterworth) who sees that Steve was wounded the night that Gagan was found unconscious. He realizes it was Steve who fought with Gagan and prevented the farm from being burned down. Knox has been paying the editor of the local paper, Underwood (Raymond Walburn), to make certain the newspaper is supportive of the railroad and supportive of Judge Bronson, who is up for re-election. Then, the railroad arrives in Clover City along with 250 railroad workers. Knox tells his men to make certain the workers are all registered to vote in the upcoming election. Steve, with the help of the Mackerel, abducts Underwood, and steals the printing press and printing supplies. Keeping Underwood prisoner in a cave in the nearby mountains, they print newspapers exposing the corruption of Jim Knox and supporting the election of Thomas Logan as Judge. The newspapers are written under the pseudonym, \\"the Wasp.\\" Steve and the Mackarel make certain the newspapers show up all over town. Knox, concerned, about the influence of the newspapers, offers a large reward for the capture of the Wasp. Chris Mulligan (Victor McLaglen) searches the mountains for the Wasp and is almost successful but he is headed off by the Mackarel who offers to search the immediate area and send Mulligan to the next mountain over. Maggie heads into the mountains to find the Wasp and warn him of that Mulligan is searching for him but she finds Steve. She assumes Steve is searching for the Wasp. She leaves, expressing her disgust for him. On the eve of the election, the Wasp is expected to pick up the latest edition of the paper which is being stored at the Logan Farm. Tom Logan and his friends are expecting the Wasp and they are surprised when Steve shows up to pick up the papers. Steve apologizes for deceiving his father but must leave quickly as Knox and his men have heard where the papers are stored and arrive looking for the Wasp. Steve gets away with the papers but Mulligan finds him. After a good fistfight, Steve is victorious over Mulligan, and he has won him over to his side. Steve distributes the papers and gives a stirring speech to the railway workers about freedom and liberty. Knox counters by telling the workers they will lose their jobs if they don't vote for Bronson. When all seems lost, Maggie begins singing \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee.\\" Steve joins in and soon almost everyone is singing. The workers are convinced. They will vote for Logan.

Hayward (c. 1865 - December 11, 1895) was an American socialite, gambler, arsonist, and murderer. Due to his ability to manipulate others, the newspapers of the era dubbed Hayward, \\"The Minneapolis Svengali,\\" \\"the most cold-blooded murderer that ever walked God's footstool\\", and, \\"the most bloodthirsty soul ever to usurp the human frame.\\"Schechter (2012), page 240. A seemingly respectable member of Victorian polite society, Hayward shocked almost everyone who knew him when he was exposed as the mastermind of one of America's most infamous crimes during the Gilded Age—the 1894 murder for hire of dressmaker Catherine Ging. In the hours before his hanging at Hennepin County Jail in Minneapolis, Hayward gave a detailed interview to his cousin Edward Goodsell and a court reporter. He admitted to numerous arsons, assaults, swindles, and three unsolved murders. Historian and true crime writer Jack El-Hai has written that, if Hayward's admissions are true, then he predates Dr. H. H. Holmes as America's first documented serial killer.\\"The Killer who Haunts Me,\\" by Jack El-Hai, Minnesota Monthly, February 2010. Early life Harry T. Hayward was born in Macoupin County, Illinois, the son of William and Lodusky Hayward, and was brought to Minneapolis at the age of one year. When he was about six years old, his family briefly returned to Illinois and stayed for about one year. Following his return to Minneapolis, Hayward \\"went to a private school conducted by Mrs. Lockwood on Sixth avenue north, and stayed there perhaps six months.\\" Afterwards, he attended the Minneapolis public school system until graduating high school.Goodsell (1896), pages 33-34. According to Minneapolis alienist W.A. Jones, Hayward's boyhood, \\"shows marked characteristics. In early life he was recognized by his school fellows as a bully, brutal in his instincts, enjoying the sufferings of others, and delighting in the torture of domestic animals.\\"Goodsell (1896), page 195. According to Fr. James M. Cleary, a Roman Catholic priest who briefly served as his spiritual director,Goodsell (1896), pages 131-135. Hayward, \\"received no positive religious instruction\\", beyond being, \\"taught the difference between right and wrong\\", and being encouraged, \\"to do the right and avoid the wrong\\". However, \\"no motive was assigned\\", as to, \\"why he should shun evil and do good. All was vague and shadowy.\\"Goodsell (1896), pages 207-208. Upon graduating, Hayward became a clerk before beginning to gamble at the age of twenty. Hayward later stated that even before this, \\"my god was always money.\\"Goodsell (1896), page 34. According to Fr. Cleary, Hayward, after succumbing to what a later age would call gambling addiction, began \\"to quiet the stings of conscience\\" by carefully studying Atheist writings. He reportedly avoided writings critical of Atheism, \\"for he sought what he found in the ridicule of religion, encouragement for his disordered and deceitful life.\\"Goodsell (1896), page 208. Dr. Jones elaborates, \\"He seemed without a conscience and felt no more concern in planning or executing a criminal deed in manhood than, when a boy, he deliberately impaled a live cat on the side of a fence. He did not seem to realize the enormity of his acts and the influence they exerted on the community as everything he did builded and strengthened his personal egotism.\\"Goodsell (1896), page 196. Ging murder In January 1894, Hayward met Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Ging, a tenant of his parents at the Ozark Flats building on Hennepin Avenue and Thirteenth Street. He persuaded her to front him large sums of money, which he used gambling. When Ging demanded the return of her money, Hayward paid her with counterfeit currency. Privately, however, he described her as, \\"an easy mark.\\" On December 3, 1894, Ging's body was found, shot behind the ear, on a road near Lake Calhoun. It was later revealed that Hayward had persuaded her to purchase a $10,000 life insurance policy which named him as sole beneficiary. Hayward appeared to be in the forefront in the search for the killer. He began playing up the fact that Kitty had borrowed money from him, and how he was certain someone killed her for it. However, Harry's brother Adry confided to a family friend Levi Stewart that Harry had asked him to do away with Kitty. Stewart contacted the Hennepin County Attorney’s office. Adry revealed that the actual killer was Claude Blixt. After the confession of Claude Blixt, he and Harry Hayward were arrested.The Notorious Harry Hayward Trial Harry Hayward's trial for first degree murder began, before Judge Seagrave Smith, on January 21, 1895. Hennepin County Attorney Frank M. Nye appeared for the prosecution. Hayward's defense team included William Erwin, known as \\"The Tall Pine Tree of the Northwest\\",Trenerry (1962), page 149. and John Day Smith,Bessler (2003), page 135. a Baptist Deacon and Republican State Senator. Smith's experiences as a soldier in the 1st Regiment Minnesota Volunteer Infantry during the American Civil War had inspired him to become Minnesota's foremost death penalty abolitionist.Bessler (2003), pages 117-140. The trial lasted, according to Walter Trenerry, a total of 46 days and consisted in the calling of 136 witnesses.Trenerry (1962), page 149. The prosecution's main witnesses were triggerman Claus Blixt and Harry's older brother Adry Hayward. The defense unsuccessfully tried to have Adry Hayward's testimony ruled in- admissible, calling him insane on the subject\\". In overruling the objection, Judge Smith quipped, \\"Well, I don't see that he is any more insane at the present time than the attorney is.\\"Trenerry (1962), pages 149-150. After the defense took over, Hayward took the stand himself and denied all allegations. The case went to the jury on Friday March 8, 1895 at 11:30 AM. At 2:15 PM, the jury returned with the verdict, \\"We, the jury, find the defendant, Harry T. Hayward, guilty of murder in the first degree.\\"Trenerry (1962), page 151. On March 11, 1895, presiding Judge Smith sentenced Hayward to death by hanging. Interview Prior to his execution, Hayward gave a detailed series of interviews to his cousin Edward H. Goodsell. During this conversation, he admitted to numerous acts of illegal gambling, arson and three other murders. Transcripts were taken down by a court stenographer. His victims included a twenty-year-old \\"sporting girl\\" whom he met in Pasadena, California. Hayward claimed to have lured her into a remote location in the Sierra Madre, shot her in the back of the head, and buried her in the woods. Hayward then made off with $7000 which she had carried in her wallet.Schechter (2012), page 252. Hayward also claimed to have fatally shot a \\"consumptive\\" near Long Branch, New Jersey, robbed him of $2000, and disposed of his body in the Shrewsbury River. According to Harold Schechter, \\"His most brutal crime, however, was the slaying of a 'Chinaman' in a New York City gambling joint on Mulberry Street. Getting into an altercation over a card game, Harry, 'knocked the Chinaman down and kicked him in the stomach.' He then picked up a chair and jabbed the pointed end of one wooden leg into the man's eye. Then, while he was, 'down and howling,\\" Harry sat down on the chair. 'His skull was kind of thin,' Harry related with a chuckle, 'and I heard the chair leg smash down through his skull.'\\"Schechter (2012), page 252. Hayward only admitted his involvement in Ging's murder, however, when it became clear that no reprieve was going to arrive from Minnesota Governor David Marston Clough. At the end of the interview, Hayward quoted the poem, \\"Happy the man,\\" by John Dryden, saying that it encompassed his philosophy of life.Goodsell (1896), page 112. According to Harold Schechter, \\"Throughout the confession, Harry does in fact display many of the traits that we now know are typical of serial murderers: overweening narcissism, juvenile sadism... pyromania, a total lack of empathy for other human beings. Like other serial killers, he would experience his 'murderous impulse' as a kind of autonomous 'second self that would suddenly 'come over him.' Interestingly, he also seems to have suffered from convulsions as an adolescent, possibly as a result of a head injury -- a factor found in the background of many serial killers.\\"Schechter (2012), page 253. Execution On the early morning of December 11, 1895, Harry T. Hayward was hanged at Hennepin County Jail. On the evening of December 10, he said, about members of the clergy, \\"I like these men and want to show them respectful consideration, but I do not care for religion. As a general thing, men in this sort of predicament get religious because they think it will brace them for the final ordeal. I do not need it. I am perfectly contented.\\"Goodsell (1896), page 135. At midnight on December 11, Hayward was visited by John Day Smith, who extracted from him a promise that he would publicly proclaim his faith in Jesus Christ from the scaffold.Bessler (2003), page 137. Moments later, Hayward was clothed in a black robe and cap and led to the gallows by Hennepin County Sheriff John Holmberg. As he ambled to the scaffold, Hayward cheerfully bade the spectators, \\"Good evening\\" and requested three cheers for himself.Schechter (2012), page 254. Upon being asked if he had any last words, Hayward gave a long and verbose speech and cracked so many jokes about his imminent death that one eyewitness later recalled that the spectators, \\"looked upon him almost as if he were a stage performer who would soon take his bow, receive his modicum of applause, and retire.\\"Schechter (2012), page 254. Eventually, Hayward kept his promise to Smith, \\"He is a religious man and I told him I would pledge him what he asked of me to say. I pledged it to him, although if I honestly believed it, I would say it, and satisfy myself, and it was this: 'Oh, God, for Christ's sake, forgive me for my sins.'\\"Bessler (2003), pages 137-138. Hayward also said of his brother Adry, \\"He has done me no wrong. I have done him a great injustice and wrong, and I have asked for his forgiveness and received it.\\"Bessler (2003), page 138. Hayward's, \\"flippant monologue,\\" continued until Sheriff Holmberg cut in and ordered him to, \\"Die like a man.\\" Hayward's arms and legs were then pinioned and the noose was thrown around his neck. He sneered and quipped, \\"Keep up your courage boys!\\"Schechter (2012), page 254. Harry Hayward's last words were those of a gambler, \\"Pull her tight; I'll stand pat.\\" The gallows trap swung open at 2:12 AM, but death was not merciful. The rope had been mis- measured and Hayward slowly strangled. He was finally pronounced dead at 2:25 AM December 11, 1895.Trenerry (1962), page 153. Sheriff John Holmberg was paid $250 for his services.Bessler (2003), page 138. Burial After being conveyed to the city morgue, Hayward's body was autopsied. His brain was removed and weighed in at 55 ounces. In accordance with the then-popular pseudoscience of phrenology, measurements were taken of Hayward's skull in accordance with the theories of Italian criminologist and physician Cesare Lombroso, who believed that criminals were a distinctive humanoid type. It was announced that Harry Hayward had possessed a \\"symmetry of skull, brain and face; the protrusion of the front teeth, and the narrow and arched palate\\". In conclusion, doctors ruled that Hayward was \\"a degenerate biological phenomenon somewhat below the savage and above the lunatic.\\"Trenerry (1962), page 153. Following a funeral ceremony at Lakewood Cemetery,Trenerry (2003), pages 153-154. Harry T. Hayward was interred in a family plot at the Minneapolis Pioneers and Soldiers Memorial Cemetery. Serial killer? In 2010, Minneapolis-based historian and true crime writer Jack El-Hai again brought the crimes of Harry Hayward to national attention. El-Hai had first learned of Hayward while writing an article for the 100th anniversary of the Kitty Ging murder in 1994. Deeply chilled by Hayward's cold-blooded nature, El-Hai continued his research on the case for decades. When Edward Goodsell's 1896 book about his cousin was digitized and put on Google Books, El-Hai read the transcript of Hayward's last interview for the first time and learned of his admission to 3 other unsolved murders.Jack El-Hai, The Killer Who Haunts Me, Minnesota Monthly, February 2010. In a February 2010 article for Minnesota Monthly, El-Hai argued that if Hayward's claims are proved to be true, then his crimes predate those of H. H. Holmes and are contemporary with those of Jack the Ripper. El-Hai expressed hope that Hayward's other alleged victims would rise from obscurity, as no other justice for them is now possible. He argued that, if this ever happened, Harry Hayward would be proven to have been America's first serial killer.Jack El-Hai, The Killer Who Haunts Me, Minnesota Monthly, February 2010. True crime author and historian Harold Schechter has written, \\"In the end, it is impossible to know whether Harry Hayward killed one victim or (as he claimed) four. All that can be said with certainty is that, as a case of criminal psychopathology - 'moral insanity,' in the terms of his contemporaries - Harry Hayward was, as Goodsell and others saw it, one of the most remarkable specimens of his age.\\"Schechter (2012, page 253. Conspiracy theory According to Walter Trenerry, rumors soon spread that Hayward had been secretly resurrected by a secret society. When researching the Ging murder during the early 1960s, Trenerry heard claims that the Freemasons' Grand Lodge of Minnesota had resurrected him. Trenerry, however, expressed skepticism that Hayward could have survived both hanging and dissection.Trenerry (1962), page 154. Ballad The murder ballad The Fatal Ride, which describes Hayward's involvement in the Kittie Ging murder, was written in 1895 by Joseph Vincent Brookes, a songwriter and \\"tragic poet\\" from Brainerd, Minnesota. When Brookes published the song, however, he used the pseudonym \\"Marius\\", possibly to hide the fact that he had borrowed the tune from the 1893 song The Fatal Wedding, by Gussie Davis.

In the previous election Daley faced opponents who lacked significant campaign experience. With Brown's entry into the 2007 election, Daley was faced with an opponent with significant electoral experience. In her 2004 reelection as clerk, Brown had received just under 800,000 votes in the city of Chicago. While both Brown and Walls were African Americans, neither were able to coalesce strong support from black voters. They also failed to enthuse much support from other groups. While the election was nonpartisan, all three candidates were members of the Democratic Party. Brown ran an issue-focused campaign, releasing policy papers on housing, ethics, transportation, public safety, and economic development. Some argued that, in her campaign, Brown was too light on Daley, failing to hammer him with criticism.https://m.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2007/01/10/no- more-ms-nice-gal Brown's campaign failed to garner endorsements. Walls criticized Daley's hiring practices.https://m.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2007/01/11/new-boss- same-as-the-old-boss Daley massively eclipsed his opponents in fundraising. Daley had nearly $6 million in funds, while Brown had less than $200,000 and Walls had less than $10,000. Daley's fundraising advantage allowed him to run a three-week long barrage of television advertisements in advance of the election. Daley made use of Democratic organizations in the city's wards to run his field operations. As was the case in all of his reelection campaigns, Daley did not attend any debates. Chicago Housing Authority head Terry Peterson resigned his position to serve as Daley's campaign manager. =Endorsements= Results Daley won a plurality in each of Chicago's fifty wards, and obtained an absolute majority in forty-nine.

By winning the election Daley had secured a sixth term as mayor (his fifth full four-year term, since he had first become mayor in a special election to a partial term following the death of Harold Washington). By winning his sixth mayoral election, Daley tied the record set by his father for the most Chicago mayoral election victories. During his subsequent term, Daley surpassed his father as the longest-tenured mayor in Chicago history. This term was ultimately Daley's last, as he opted to forgo seeking reelection in 2011. In her concession speech Brown congratulated Daley but urged residents of Chicago, \\"to hold this mayor accountable\\". She also declared that voters had, \\"not seen the last of Dorothy Brown\\". Brown would explain her loss by declaring that she believed that voters had failed to, \\"understand the magnitude of the crime and corruption,\\" which had occurred under Daley's tenure. Brown was subsequently reelected as Clerk in 2008, 2012, and 2016. She ran unsuccessfully for President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 2010. She ran for mayor again in the 2019 election, but failed to qualify for inclusion on the ballot. Walls ran for mayor again in 2011, 2015 and 2019.

Daley easily reelected against small and divided opposition, resulting in his best electoral showing of his career, winning by a landslide 64 point margin. By winning his fifth mayoral election, Daley tied Carter Harrison Sr. and Carter Harrison Jr. for the second-most mayoral election victories in Chicago history. Daley would subsequently win an additional mayoral election in 2007, thereby surpassing both Harrisons and tying his own father's record for the most mayoral election victories. Campaign On December 9, 2002, a spokesperson for Daley confirmed that Daley would be announcing his candidacy for reelection. Daley's candidacy was widely anticipated. A popular incumbent, Daley had won strong victories in the preceding four consecutive mayoral elections.

On December 23, his squadron shot down a Finnish aircraft, a VL Kotka, near Paldiski.

The aircraft was not heard from since 1310 by the Mäkiluoto fort, which was located southwest of Helsinki. 35 minutes later, an explosion was seen in the air to the southwest. It was then reported by the Soviet radio that a Finnish reconnaissance aircraft at Pakri had been shot down by interceptors at 1405 and that both crew members were killed when they tried to escape the burning aircraft. It is believed that this was the aircraft that was shot down by Borisov's crew.

Initially, Arcadia—the medieval name of Kyparissia on the western coast of Messenia—formed part of the princely domain of the Villehardouin family. It was created as a separate barony by Prince William II of Villehardouin shortly after the Byzantine reconquest of Constantinople in 1261, to recompense Vilain of Aulnay, one of the Frankish lords of the Latin Empire of Constantinople who sought refuge in Achaea.Bon (1969), pp. 104, 128, 412–413Topping (1975), p. 120 After Vilain's death in 1269 it was divided between his sons, Erard and Geoffrey. Erard disappears after 1279, when he was captured by the Byzantines, but Geoffrey did not manage to reclaim his brother's portion until 1293, due to the obstructions of the Angevin baillis, who sequestered the domain.Bon (1969), pp. 157, 413 He was succeeded in 1297 by Vilain II, who was in turn succeeded by his two children, Erard II and Agnes.Bon (1969), pp. 236, 413 Erard II died some time before 1338, but Peter dalle Carceri, Triarch of Negroponte, is already attested as lord of half the barony in 1324, and it is usually assumed that Erard II left his half of the barony to his widow, Balzana Gozzadini, who took Peter as a second husband. Balzana died soon after.Bon (1969), pp. 205, 236, 413 Agnes married in 1324 Stephen le Maure (\\"The Moor\\"), Lord of Saint- Sauveur and Aetos, and had a son, Erard III, who by 1344 managed to reunite the barony, and was named marshal of Achaea in 1345.Bon (1969), pp. 236–237, 413, 418 In 1348, a Burgundian knight, Louis of Chafor, with some companions, managed to take over the castle of Arcadia and hold Erard's wife and children captive until Erard paid a large ransom.Bon (1969), p. 239Topping (1975), pp. 132–133 Erard was succeeded in 1388 by one of his daughters, who married Andronikos Asanes Zaccaria, and the barony became part of the Zaccaria domain. The Zaccaria claim was disputed by Erard Laskaris, a nephew of Erard III by his sister, but without success; Laskaris died childless in 1409.Bon (1969), pp. 276, 413–414 Arcadia was the last holdout of the Principality.

Gottlieb (1936–2012) was a US biologist described by the Botanical Society of America as \\"one of the most influential plant evolutionary biologists over the past several decades.\\". He was employed at the University of California, Davis for 34 years, and published widely. In addition to his primary work in plant genetics, Gottlieb was an advocate for rare and endangered plant conservation. Education Following a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from Cornell University in 1957, Gottlieb's career began at Oregon State University in the Botany and Plant Pathology Department. He earned a master's degree in December 1965 with major professor Dr. Kenton Chambers and wrote a thesis on hybridization between species of manzanita (Arctostaphylos) trees in southwestern Oregon. His PhD at the University of Michigan 1969 examined patterns of diversity and mechanisms of speciation in Stephanomeria. He was a faculty member of the Department of Genetics at the University of California, Davis from 1970 until 2004. Research Gottlieb researched a broad array of subjects including plant systematics, plant speciation (Quantum Speciation), polyploidy, gene duplication, biochemical evolution of isozymes and molecular genetics, and published more than 120 research papers and received a number of awards including a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship (1975), and Fellowship of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1985). In 1993 he was named Alumni Association Fellow of Oregon State University. In 1965 he earned his master's degree and wrote a thesis on hybridization between species of manzanita in southwestern Oregon. =Quantum speciation= Leslie D. Gottlieb pointing to Stephanomeria malheurensis Photo taken by Ken Chambers Gottlieb was occupied with new species formation via \\"quantum speciation\\" throughout his career. As defined by Verne Grant, and cited by Gottlieb in his 2003 summary of the subject in plants \\"we can define quantum speciation as the budding off of a new and very different daughter species from a semi-isolated peripheral population of the ancestral species in a cross-fertilizing organism...as compared with geographical speciation, which is a gradual and conservative process, quantum speciation is rapid and radical in its phenotypic or genotypic effects or both.\\" Grant thought that it would be accompanied by inbreeding in the founder population. Therefore, \\"quantum speciation\\" would be related to, if not identical with, in Gottlieb's use of the term, sympatric speciation. In fact Gottlieb's first publication on \\"sympatric speciation\\" in Stephanomeria', published in 1971, was summarised by him in the above 2003 paper on \\"quantum speciation.\\" Gottlieb did not believe that sympatric speciation required disruptive selection to form a reproductive isolating barrier, as defined by Grant, and in fact Gottlieb stated that requiring disruptive selection was \\"unnecessarily restrictive\\" in identifying cases of sympatric speciation. In terminology used by Gottlieb, \\"progenitor species \\" would be the parental or \\"ancestral\\" species and the newly formed daughter species was \\"derived.\\" In his first study of progenitor-derivative pairs of species, Gottlieb examined the diploid, geographically limited, self-pollinating derived species Stephanomeria malheurensis with the diploid, geographically widespread obligate outcrossing ancestral species Stephanomeria exicua ssp. coronaria. In this case the reproductive isolating barrier was probably a change from outcrossing to selfing, and was maintained by this and a high degree of inter- specific sterility with ssp. coronaria as a result of chromosomal structural differences. Using what was then the most modern molecular technique, starch gel electrophoresis, to determine the genetics of populations Gottlieb found that S. malheurensis had a subset of the genetic variability of ssp. coronaria. This, as well as its geographical close proximity, led Gottlieb to propose that S. malhurensis was a product of \\"quantum speciation.\\" Additionally, S. malheurensis was found to be much less adapted to the local habitat than ssp. coronaria (hence the name malhurensis, which in French, \\"Malheur\\" means unhappiness or misfortune), indicating that it was probably not formed by disruptive selection. In his second study of progenitor- derivative pairs of species, Gottlieb looked at the putative progenitor diploid Clarkia rubicunda and its hypothesized derivative, diploid C. franciscana. In 1958 Lews and Raven hypothesized that C. franciscana, which was highly self-pollinating and geographically limited, was derived from the outcrossing and more widespread C. rubicunda by large chromosomal structural rearrangements. Lewis and Raven hypothesized that C. franciscana had rapidly speciated from C. rubicunda by a mechanism Harlan Lewis called \\"catastrophic selection.\\" As with Stephanomeria, Gottlieb hypothesized that if C. franciscana was a derived species by \\"rapid speciation,\\" then the derived species should have a genetic compliment that is similar to its progenitor, \\"i.e., possess few novel alleles.\\" In fact, Gottlieb found that C. franciscana was genetically distinct from C. rubicunda; it did not, as expected, have a subset of the genes found in C. rubicunda. A subsequent analysis published in 1992 on another population of C. franciscana, unknown to Gottlieb 20 years earlier, led to similar conclusions. Importantly Gottlieb ended his 1973 study of C. franciscana by stating: \\"To strengthen phylogenetic analyses of rapid speciation, the criterion is proposed that a species accepted as having had a rapid and recent origin by chromosomal reorganization be substantially similar to its progenitor upon electrophoretic examination.\\" In this context Gottlieb equated \\"electrophoretic examination\\" with genetic examination by the use of isozymes. And, using this criterion, Gottlieb was not able to conclude that C. franciscana was derived from its putative progenitor C. rubicunda, as hypothesized by Lewis and Raven in 1958. The next progenitor-derived pair of species Gottlieb examined were diploid Clarkia biloba and diploid Clarkia lingulata. C. biloba is geographically widespread, while C. lingulata is known from only two populations on the southern periphery of C. biloba; both are highly outcrossing, and there is no evidence that C. lingulata is better adapted to its habitat than C. biloba. They differ from each other by chromosomal structural differences, and hybrids between them are sterile. Lewis and Roberts proposed in 1956 that C. lingulata arose from C. biloba rapidly and in close proximity; in 1962 Lewis coined the term \\"catastrophic selection\\" to define its mode of origin. Gottlieb using starch gel electrophoresis, determined that indeed C. lingulata had a high degree of genetic similarity to C. biloba, with fewer alleles and reduced heterozygosity. Subsequent studies confirmed a sister species relationship using chloroplast DNA as well as nucleotide sequences of the gene phosphoglucose isomerase. Gottlieb stated that this species pair, too, arose from quantum speciation. Layia discoidea'Layia glandulosa Similar work was done with species pairs in the genus Layia. Here, the widespread progenitor was the diploid L. glandulosa, while the more restricted was the diploid L. discoidea. Both are obligate outcrossers, though the former has ray flowers while the latter only has disc flowers. Further, both are completely interfertile, while L. discoidea is restricted to serpentine habitats. As with the former species pairs, Gottlieb applied the electrophoretic test to these species and found that they had a very high genetic identity for the isozymes studied. Therefore, the Gottlieb and Ford concluded that these two species were related as progenitor and derivative. Gottlieb proposed that L. discoidea arose relatively recently from adaptation to serpentine soils, also as an example of quantum speciation. In his 2003 review, Gottlieb summarized: > The general lesson from the review of these studies is that quantum > speciation remains an important and useful concept that can be applied to a > greater variety of situations than initially envisaged. The genetic and > chromosomal changes need not be as radical as once supposed, and a new > species may originate and persist even without novel adaptations. Another species pair that Gottlieb studied involved Gaura longiflora and G. demareei; both species are annuals, diploids, highly inter-fertile and obligate outcrossers. In this study Gottlieb demonstrated that G. demareei was genetically highly similar to Gaura longiflora. Although he did not use the words \\"quantum speciation\\" in this study, Gottlieb concluded that these species pairs represented, as with Clarkia and Stephanomeria above, that \\"speciation in annual plants that are obligately outcrossing can occur with minimal genetic differentiation and accords with previous results for self- pollinating species.\\" And further, that \\"speciation in annual plants appears not to be consistent with the orthodox views of the process (e.g., Mayr, 1963), which propose that organisms acquire reproductive isolation as an important by-product of adapting to habitats different from that of the parental ones, that this process marks a substantial genetic reconstitution, and that it occurs gradually over long periods of time.\\" =Polyploidy= Another subject that intrigued Gottlieb throughout his career was that of polyploidy. In a commemorative 2014 review, Soltis et al. refer to Gottlieb and Roose's 1976 paper on Tragopogon as a \\"classic\\" in the field. In Soltis et al.'s words: \\"This classic paper addressed the link between genotype and biochemical phenotype and documented enzyme additivity in allopolyploids. Perhaps more important than their model of additivity, however, was their demonstration of novelty at the biochemical level. Enzyme multiplicity—the production of novel enzyme forms in the allopolyploids—can provide an extensive array of polymorphism for a polyploid individual and may explain, for example, the expanded ranges of polyploids relative to their diploid progenitors.\\" Although Gottlieb was not the first to hypothesize that enzyme multiplicity from dimeric isozymes could benefit the adaptedness of polyploids, his work on glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase in 1973 on the allotetraploid Stephanomeria elata was amongst the earliest as well as the first in a wild plant. Their classic 1976 paper also demonstrated the utility of isozymes in sorting out a complicated systematics in Tragopogon, the presence of fixed heterozygosity in its polyploids, as well as the occurrence of novel isozymes (multimers) in the Tragopogon allopolyploids. Gottlieb's further studies on polyploidy were concerned with the fates of those genes that were duplicated by an allopolyploidization event. That is, he was interested to know if the homeologus genomes of allopolyploids were changed by being in the same nucleus—were there novel patterns of gene expression that may influence fitness; or, to quote Gottlieb in 1999 do \\"...polyploid species evolve differently than their diploid parents\\". To sort this out, Gottlieb maintained that one had to know if any differences one saw in the allopolyploid were indeed differences from polyploidization or were they a \\"legacy\\" of the diploid progenitors. In 1980 Roose and Gottlieb showed that in the recent (less than 100 years old) allotetraploid T. miscellus the genes for alcohol dehydrogenase reflected their expression in the diploid parents—there was no gene silencing, changes in tissue expression, or other effect on the catalytic properties of the enzyme. In 1999 Ford and Gottlieb found that the tetraploid Clarkia gracilis expressed the same genes for cytosolic phosphoglucose isomerase as the diploid parents; in this case gene silencing was identified in C. gracilis but they concluded that it probably occurred in one of the diploid parents, which was extinct. This was not the case when Gottlieb and Ford looked at the recent allotetraploids Clarkia delicata and C. similis. In C. similis a gene producing phosphoglucose isomerase (called PgiC2) was silenced after the polyploidization event, while in C. delicata it was polymorphic for a normal gene and a silenced gene. As the authors concluded PgiC2 in C. delicata \\"presents an example of a natural experiment in progress because the defective allele may yet be fixed or lost from the species.\\" Further, Ford and Gottlieb postulated that silenced genes in polyploid plants could be repositories of silenced genes for \\"plant breeding, for example, to alter metabolism or development of cultivated relatives.\\" =Gene duplication= Although Gottlieb did much pioneering work on gene duplication in polyploids, he also pioneered studying gene duplication in diploids. He conducted many studies on various genes in several species, summarizing his work up to 1982 in Clarkia and Stephanomeria with duplicated genes producing phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI). In that review he reported that PGI in Clarkia was produced in both the cytosol and plastids, by one or two nuclear genes controlling the cytosolic PGI and one nuclear gene controlling the plastid PGI. The cytosolic genes received the majority of his attention, which were found to be either single or duplicated. Further, the duplicated genes were hypothesized to have arisen by translocations rather than by un-equal crossing over. Gottlieb applied gene duplications in determining the phylogeny of \\"Clarkia\\", because \\"Duplications originating by chromosomal rearrangements have a high probability of being unique. Thus species with the PGI duplication presumably descended from a single references ancestor and can now be grouped into a monophyletic assemblage...\\" He conducted biochemical studies of the cytosolic PGIs in Clarkia xantiana, and found that there was very little difference in PGI's produced by the duplicated genes. In this same review he reported on a \\"family\\" of duplicated genes in Stephanomeria exigua that controlled the production of ADH. Here Roose and Gottlieb found that several tightly linked genes were inherited as one unit, and that populations could be polymorphic for duplicated and non-duplicated genes. He reported in Stephanomeria exigua that TPI was produced by two nuclear genes that assorted independently, and that hybrid enzymes between the two loci were not found. In Clarkia species both cytosolic and plastid TPI are produced by duplicated genes, and that both loci have genetic variability. Post 1982 Gottlieb continued to work on other enzyme systems produced by duplicated loci in different species. In Clarkia he reported that duplicated genes for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) occurred throughout the genus for both cytosolic and plastid 6-PGD. In homosporus ferns he found a duplicated gene for TPI, resulting in the only case of heterozygosity resulting from gene duplication in ferns—counter to previous theory. In Layia Gottlieb found that isocitrate dehydrognease (IDH) isozymes had one gene controlling plastid IDH and 2-3 duplicated genes controlling cytosolic IDH. In this same study with Layia he found that phosphoglucomutase (PGM) also had one gene controlling plastid PGM, and duplicated cytosolic genes. He also examined six additional genera in the Madieae, and, with Layia representing 7 of the 10 genera in this tribe of the Asteraceae. Since he found that the duplicated cytosolic PGM were found in all the genera, he postulated that the duplication may have been present at the formation of this tribe, and hypothesized that examining PGM in other tribes may help understand phylogenic relationships in the Asteraceae. Further, he asserted that the discovery of duplicated genes in the tribe Madinae, along with the work of others, supported the view that duplicated genes in flowering plants was widespread. Additionally, since all such duplicated genes were unlinked, he favored the view that duplications were the result of overlapping reciprocal translocations rather than by unequal crossing-over. Gottlieb also applied PGM isozymes to species in the genus Clarkia, and found that some species had duplicated plastid PGM, others had duplicated cytosolic PGM, and that their phylogenetic distribution was consistent with earlier work on PGI. By far the majority of Gottlieb's gene duplication work was done with PGI in Clarkia, though he also compared the PGI from the bacteria Escherichia coli with Clarkia, showing that the nuclear encoded chloroplast (plastid) isozyme of PGI from Clarkia xantiana when compared to Escherichia coli shared 87.6% of its amino acid sequences. They also predicted that the cytosolic PGI's in higher plants would be considerably different than the plastid PGI's, given the hypothesized prokaryotic origin of plastid DNA, though would be more similar to eucaryotes. In 1996 Gottlieb and Ford reported that the cytosolic duplicated genes PGI1 and PGI2 were ancestral to all Clarkia, but that some species had a silenced PGI2, and that the PGI2 had been silenced at least four times independently. Gottlieb's second to last paper studied PGI duplications in other genera of the Onagraceae. From this work Gottlieb and Ford found that their PGI results supported work based on chloroplast genes and nuclear ITS sequences, and that cytosolic PGI genes showed a greater rate of divergence than that based on chloroplast genes, and therefore supplied more information. Further, they found that the PGI gene duplications of PGI1 and PGI2 occurred well before the \\"radiation of extant species\\" of Clarkia. =Plant systematics and molecular techniques= Gottlieb's first published scientific paper in 1968 was based on his M.S. Thesis, and concerned itself with the taxonomy of Arctostaphylos viscida and A. canescens. In this he was concerned with hybrids between the two and the taxonomic status of their hybrids, concluding that such hybrids were not eligible for taxonomic status as a previous investigator reported. His next publication in 1971 was based on his Ph.D. thesis, and was concerned with phylogenetic relationships in Stephanomeria. This followed in 1972 with a taxonomy of Stephanomeria. During these early years he developed an interest in isozymes, and he published a 1971 paper discussing their use in evolutionary studies. Using this new technique he applied isozymes to a taxonomic problem in Stephanomeria, and was able to demonstrate the origin of Stephanomeria malheurensis by quantum speciation (see above). He continued to apply isozymes to other taxa, and clarified species relationships in other genera such as Clarkia, Layia, Gaura, and Tragopogon, largely relying on gene duplication and silencing results (discussed above). From 1971 onward Gottlieb used all traditional cytogenetic, ecological, morphological, and molecular techniques as they became available to solve systematics problems, primarily within Clarkia and the Onagraceae as well as Stephanomeria and the Cichorieae. Isozymes were used during most of his career. It wasn't until 1986 that he applied a newer molecular technique: chloroplast DNA variation using Restriction fragment length polymorphism in determining the origin of Heterogaura from Clarkia, as well as clarifying species relationships in Clarkia. In these two papers Gottlieb and Systma confirmed previous phylogenic results found with earlier isozyme work, as well as exposing limitations of earlier phylogenetic models that only used morphology and reproductive isolation. Post 1986 he continued working with others using gene duplication of PGM in Clarkia and IDH in Layia (references above), including flavonoids in Stephanomeria. In this latter work he showed that the two progenitor- derivative species S. exigua ssp. coronaria and S. malheurensis were also nearly identical, concordant with earlier genetic studies. He continued work on the phylogeny of Clarkia, using restriction site mapping of chloroplast DNA and then in 1996 Ford and Gottlieb using nucleotide sequencing of the duplicated PGI genes further clarified Sections within Clarkia. In 2002 he used an analysis of 18S-26S nuclear rDNA and its ITS and ETS sequences to further examine the phylogeny of Stephanomeria; in this he concluded that the annuals probably evolved more recently than the perennials, and further confirmed the progenitor-derived status of S. malheurensis. In 2006 he and others examined sequences of PgiC in Stephanomeria, and showed that it had more resolution for determining species differences than the earlier ITS/ETS results. In 2003 using 18S-26S nuclear rDNA ITS and ETS sequences he expanded his examination of the phylogeny of Stephanomeria to include all 24 North American genera within the tribe Cichorieae, and produced the first modern comprehensive phylogeny of the group. This work gave him the background for his contributions to the 2006 Flora of North America as well as his contributions to The Jepson Manual in 2012, his last publication. Gottlieb was involved with the description of several new species and subspecies, including new species Stephanomeria malheurensis, new species S. fluminea, a subspecies of Clarkia concinna, and a subspecies of Clarkia mildrediae. =Morphological evolution in plants= In 1984 Gottlieb summarized a large body of literature regarding the genetic control of plant morphology. He was motivated because of \\"recent controversies about macroevolution.\\" That is, a central tenet of neo- darwinian evolution is that evolution occurs by the accumulation of small genetic changes over time as opposed to the involvement of fewer genes with larger effects. In his review he concluded that > Many differences, particularly those of presence versus absence, and those > of changed structure, shape, or architectural orientation are frequently > governed by one or two genes; discrete phenotypic alternatives are common. This paper resulted in a rebuttal by Coyne and Lande in 1985, which was countered by Gottlieb in 1985. Gottlieb concluded his rebuttal by stating > I agree with Coyne and Lande...that \\"counting gene differences and measuring > their effects form in themselves important tests of neo-Darwinism,\\" but I > find that it is frequently not apparent which genes should be counted, and > that the proposed test cannot be convincing in the absence of developmental > evidence that identifies the ontogenetic and anatomical details of character > divergence. In 1986 Gottlieb reviewed the literature in crop plants and reiterated his assertion that plant architecture was controlled by only a few genes. A series of subsequent studies in wild plants by Gottlieb bolstered his assertions that important evolutionary changes need not involve many small genes. In 1988 Gottlieb and Ford reported on floral pigmentation in Clarkia gracilis and discovered a basal spot allele that was unique and normally was unexpressed. They concluded: \\"It is an interesting speculation that many loci include alleles that normally remain unexpressed. Segregation following hybridization, frequent in plants, may place such alleles, as well as normally expressed alleles, under new patterns of regulation resulting in the abrupt appearance of novel forms.\\" In 1989 Gottlieb concluded that floral spot patterns in Clarkia were controlled by only a few genes, and that \\"The flower is a complex structure in which many specialized tissues and cell types form distinctive organs in a precise and orderly manner. The differentiation of structures is most likely independent of pigmentation pattern, and this is one reason the patterns may be changed by a few genes. Although the patterns may have a simple and readily modified developmental basis, pigment patterns are likely to have complex effects on pollination and eventual seed set.\\" Ford and Gottlieb performed an extensive analysis of the genetic control of flower differences between the two closely related species Layia glandulosa and L. discoidea, related as progenitor and derivative, respectively. The two species differ primarily by presence versus absence of ray florets. They confirmed earlier results that the primary difference in ray flowers was due to a single gene. However, they also found a novel floret called \\"gibbous,\\" and demonstrated that there were numerous gene differences between the species that affected the ray florets size, shape, and color. They concluded: > Characterization of evolutionary morphological changes as major or minor is > illusory unless founded on genetic analysis: the demonstration that the > absence of ray florets in L. discoidea is conferred by a simple genetic > difference shows that this was not a large change despite the accretion of a > considerable number of differences between the species. The discovery of > gibbous fiorets has particular interest because it demonstrates that novel > combinations of developmental processes can be readily assimilated without > evident adverse effects. The complex admixture of genes with large and > small, qualitative and quantitative, effects may prove typical as more > instances of morphological evolution are subjected to intensive genetic > analysis. In his last paper discussing the impact of simple genetic changes having large effects on plant morphology, Ford and Gottlieb in 1992 described a naturally occurring recessive gene that converts the petals of Clarkia concinna to sepals, making an eight sepaled plant with no petals. They concluded: > The absence of deleterious pleiotropy or fitness-reducing epistatic > interactions in bicalyx suggests that mutations with extensive morphological > consequences can be successfully accommodated by plant developmental > systems. If such mutants were to become associated with chromosomal > rearrangements reducing the fertility of hybrids between them and their > progenitors, a process that has occurred repeatedly in Clarkia, the new > population would probably be accorded species status. Although the frequency > of establishment of such mutations is unknown, bicalyx demonstrates that the > kind of regulatory mutations being studied by plant developmental biologists > may contribute to morphological diversification in nature. Gottlieb also examined the genetic effects of single gene mutations by examining the protein expressions in the historically important Round v. Wrinkled isogenic pea genes examined by Gregor Mendel. Being isogenic, these lines only differed at the r-gene locus; however, Gottlieb found that approximately 10% of the proteins were different between these two lines, indicating that these single gene mutations had many pleiotropic effects. Another study in peas involving genes controlling leaves, tendrils, and stipules did not find evidence of pleiotropy. =Plant conservation= Given that some of the species Gottlieb worked with were restricted to very small populations, such as Clarkia lingulata, Clarkia franciscana, and Stephanomeria malheurensis, it is not surprising that he became an advocate for rare and endangered plant conservation. His impact is perhaps best seen by his work on S. malheurensis, which he discovered, and for which S. malheurensis received Federal protection in 1974. Gottlieb was involved in its protection and as well as re-establishment when it became threatened by cheatgrass in Oregon. =Literary work= In 1975 Gottlieb wrote a comparison of the two ways Charles Darwin, as a scientist, and Herman Melville, as an artist, viewed the Galapagos Islands. According to Gottlieb, Darwin saw the Galapogos Islands as a \\"laboratory where he was able to examine closely process of evolution and the origin of species,\\" while Melville \\"used them to derive a set of symbols to express his perception of the human condition.\\" Gottlieb concluded that the Galapogos of Darwin and Melville \\"have different uses and appeal to different sensibilities.\\" Later life and death During 2011, Gottlieb received treatment for pancreatic cancer and had a good period of recovery until the end of the year. Early in 2012 the cancer had returned and following complications associated with the disease, Gottlieb died on January 31, 2012. Legacy Gottlieb has been described as \\"one of the most influential plant evolutionary biologists over the past several decades.\\" Leslie Gottlieb was honored at a Colloquium in 2013 which updated and extended many of his research areas, as well as by a 2014 theme issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. Crawford et al. state \\"Leslie Gottlieb was interested in floral development before the age of genomics and the evolution of development (evo-devo)...\\" Hileman states that the genetic changes studied in the model plant Antirrhinum majus were identified by Gottlieb as being of the type that \\"may provide genetic information about floral traits that distinguish species or genera.\\" Consequently, the development of modern evolutionary thought that now incorporates evo-devo was clearly anticipated by Gottlieb. The Leslie and Vera Gottlieb Research Fund in Plant Evolutionary Biology was established in 2006 to provide funds to graduate students to support both laboratory and field research in the evolutionary biology of plants native to western North America. This is a broad field that includes evolutionary and population genetics, systematics and phylogenetic studies, comparative analyses of development, and physiological and biochemical studies of plant adaptations. The Research Fund will provide an annual award of $5000.

In 1949, Ruiz was awarded Spanish patent 190,698 for the \\"Mechanical Encyclopedia\\" (Spanish: la Enciclopedia Mecánica). Ruiz Robles wanted to lighten the weight of the books carried by her students, so she devised a device consisting of a series of text and illustrations on reels, all under a sheet of magnifying glass with a light for reading in the dark, and was to incorporate spoken descriptions of each topic. Her device was never put into production but a prototype is in display at the National Museum of Science and Technology in A Coruña. Mechanical Encyclopedia The following is a translated description of the device:Gaceta de la Actualidad Técnica. Year II, No. 14, September 1955 'When opened, it consists of two parts. On the left there is a series of automatic alphabets, in any language: slight pressure on a button displays the required letters, making words, sentences, a lesson or a topic, and all manner of writings. In the upper right-hand part of the alphabets is a coil with all manner of line drawings, and on the left there is another coil with ornamental and figure drawings. In the lower part of the alphabets there is a plastic sheet for writing, editing or drawing. On the inside there is a box where subjects can be stored. The subjects are stored in the right-hand part, passing beneath a transparent, unbreakable sheet; these can be enlarged, and the books can be illuminated so that they can still be read if there is otherwise no light. The right-hand and left-hand sides of the section the materials pass through contain two coils in which the books the user wants to read in any language are placed; moving these allows all the topics to pass by, stopping as and when the user wishes, or to be collected. The coils are automatic and can be moved from the box and expanded, so that the whole subject remains visible. The device may be placed either on a table (like an ordinary book) or perpendicular to it, which is handy for the user, since it eliminates a great deal of mental and physical effort. All the components are replaceable. When closed, it is the same size as an ordinary book, and easy to handle. For authors and publishers it greatly reduces production costs, for it does not require either paste or binding, and can be printed either in a single print run, or section by section (if there are several) – a procedure of value to all.'

The Olympic Dam mine is a large poly-metallic underground mine located in South Australia, NNW of Adelaide. It is the fourth largest copper deposit and the largest known single deposit of uranium in the world. Copper is the largest contributor to total revenue, accounting for approximately 70% of the mine's revenue, with the remaining 25% from uranium, and around 5% from silver and gold.http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=jsct/8august2006/subs2/sub34_1.pdf BHP has owned and operated the mine since 2005. The mine was previously owned by Western Mining Corporation. Since it opened in 1988, an extensive underground mine, an integrated metallurgical processing plant and expansive open-air tailings storage facilities have been constructed. The adjacent Olympic Dam mining centre and the nearby township of Roxby Downs service the mine and accommodate its workforce. Daily flights to and from Adelaide are provided via the Olympic Dam Airport. BHP planned to expand the mine by establishing a new open cut pit and building extensive supporting infrastructure. In 2012 the expansion was postponed indefinitely pending investigation of a \\"new and cheaper design\\". As of 2013, Olympic Dam is the second largest uranium-producing mine in the world, having produced 4,100 tonnes in the financial year ending June 2013. The only larger producer is the MacArthur River uranium mine in Canada.  Early history  In 1979 a joint venture partnership was established between WMC Resources and BP Minerals with the intention of establishing the mine. Three years later, the Roxby Downs (Indenture Ratification) Act 1982 was signed, creating a legal framework for the development to proceed. The first shaft was constructed that year, and named the Whenan Shaft after Ted Whenan, one of the exploration drillers who discovered the ore body. The new municipality of Roxby Downs was also created in 1982, as an intended service centre and community hub for the mine workers and their families. In 1983, the mine's first Environmental Impact Statement was approved, authorising copper production of up to 150,000 tonnes per annum. Over a decade would pass before this production target was achieved. In 1987, a decline entrance to the mine was created, and the Olympic Dam Special Mining Lease was connected to the South Australian electricity grid. The mine was officially opened the following year, and the first shipments of copper cathodes and uranium oxide were made. Roxby Downs township was officially opened, and the town's newspaper, the Roxby Downs Sun commenced publication. In 1989, the Olympic Dam refinery produced its first gold and silver bars.  Western Mining Corporation buys out BP  In 1993, Western Mining Corporation bought BP's 49% shareholding and assumed total control of the project. Several stages of expansion occurred around this time and production increased. In 1986, the mine's target production had been set at 45,000 tonnes of copper per annum. In 1992, output reached 66,000 tonnes, then 84,000 in 1995. The mine's first major expansion was announced in 1996 with the objective of producing 200,000 tonnes per annum once complete. A second Environmental Impact Statement was approved, allowing the mine to expand production up to 350,000 tonnes of copper per annum. In 1998 the mine poured its 500th bar of gold. Two years later the mine produced 200,000 tonnes of copper in a year for the first time. Optimisation efforts increased output to 235,000 tonnes per annum in 2002.  BHP take-over  BHP made a successful bid for WMC Resources in March 2005 and the offer was accepted by the ACCC in April. BHP Billiton was not the only resources company to express interest in the project. Xstrata had made prior takeover bids in late 2004, and French state-run nuclear industrial company Areva had entered into what were rumoured to be partnership discussions with WMC Resources in February. After the acquisition, BHP began to plan what would become a proposed $30 billion expansion project, involving the excavation of a new open cut mine within the existing Special Mining Lease. The expansion plan was expected to be a boon to the South Australian economy- forecast to generate an estimated 23,000 direct and indirect jobs. Major new infrastructure would need to be constructed to facilitate the expansion, including a new airport at Olympic Dam, a rail link, a seawater desalination plant at Point Lowly, a barge-landing facility near Port Augusta and a worker village near Andamooka. The company's access to the Government of South Australia was enhanced by the formation of the Olympic Dam Task Force in 2006, which has since served as a single entry-point for the company's interactions with the state. BHP also began to develop relationships with scientific and academic institutions with the objective of facilitating relevant technical, environmental and policy research. = Research sponsorship and partnerships = Academic research related to the Olympic Dam mine and funded by BHP Billiton has been undertaken at least four major South Australian institutions since the take-over. Works have included producing a projection of future skill requirements for Olympic Dam by Flinders University, research into novel \\"liquid mining\\" techniques conducted by a team at the South Australian Museum, numerous studies at the Environment Institute and Institute for Mineral and Energy Resources (IMER) at the University of Adelaide and numerous more at the Ian Wark Research Institute at the University of South Australia. In 2008, the Ian Wark Research Institute entered a research partnership with BHP. The company committed to provide $500,000 per annum for five consecutive years for research programs. The institute's annual report that year referred to BHP Billiton as having had a representative on their advisory board for \\"many years\\". In 2012, the Institute for Mineral and Energy Resources at the University of Adelaide was awarded over $2.5 million as part of the Australian Research Council's Industrial Transformation Program. Funds were to be spent over six years during the establishment of a research hub for advancing copper-uranium production. BHP Billiton partnered with IMER on the project and is providing $2.5 million in cash plus additional in-kind contributions. BHP executives have also held numerous board memberships within academic institutions since the Olympic Dam take-over. Andrew Shook, general manager of BHP Billiton's Uranium Customer Sector Group, held a position on the advisory board of the Ian Wark Research Institute from 2009 to 2011, and Robert Sumner held a position as an adjunct senior research fellow there for the same period. John England, the vice president of technology, Uranium Customer Sector Group at BHP Billiton, was appointed to the advisory board of IMER from its establishment in 2009 until 2014. President of Uranium Dean Dalla Valle also held a position on the IMER advisory board in 2009 to 2010 and another on the board of the South Australian Museum from 2011 to 2012. Vice President Sustainability at BHP Billiton, Carl Binning, has held a position on the Board of the Environment Institute since at least 2011. He ceased working for BHP Billiton in 2012 but continues to hold his board position. = Industry associations = BHP Olympic Dam is a member of the World Nuclear Association, whose mission is \\"to promote a wider understanding of nuclear energy among key international influencers by producing authoritative information, developing common industry positions, and contributing to the energy debate.\\" BHP Billiton is also a full member of the Minerals Council of Australia's Uranium Forum, where the interests of the Olympic Dam project are represented. = Sponsorships = BHP sponsors a variety of events and organisations. Some are directly linked to the company's uranium portfolio, which is exclusively represented by the Olympic Dam mine. In 2016, BHP Billiton was the major sponsor of the Australian Radiation Protection Society's (ARPS) 2016 Conference, held in Adelaide. Tours of the Olympic Dam mine have also been offered to delegates of uranium and mining industry conferences held in South Australia.  Proposed expansion  At the time of the BHP takeover, WMC Resources was investigating ways to expand the mine, including considering constructing a prospective seawater desalination plant at Port Bonython (Point Lowly). In 2008, BHP completed a pre-feasibility study into the expansion of the mine's operations, with the first step of expansion scheduled for completion by late 2013. In December 2008, South Australia's Premier Mike Rann revealed advice from BHP that the project would proceed as an open-cut operation.$7bn BHP Billiton mine giant to go ahead: Mike Rann While being welcomed at the time by state and federal governments as a major boost to the economy, the proposed expansion of mining operations also attracted considerable criticism. In 2007, BHP Billiton attracted public attention for delaying the release of its environmental impact statement for the Olympic Dam expansion, and for the company's response to inconsistencies in the scope and configuration of the proposed expansion.Uranium mining and the question of corporate social responsibility In May 2009, the company released an extensive environmental impact statement for public comment. It revealed the detailed plans for the proposed construction and its future operation. Among the project's new infrastructure requirements were: a desalination plant at Point Lowly (Port Bonython), a rail link to Pimba, a worker accommodation village between Olympic Dam and Andamooka and a barge landing facility near Port Augusta.ABC - PM \\"BHP Billiton Environmental Impact Statement released for Olympic Dam expansion\\" (2009-05-01) In May 2011, the company released a Supplementary Environmental Impact Statement in response to the 4,197 submissions received during a 14-week public comment period. On 10 October 2011, state and federal government approvals for the mine expansion were granted. =Seawater desalination at Point Lowly= The Point Lowly cuttlefish aggregation may be impacted by Olympic Dam desalination plant brine. Seawater desalination had been considered by Western Mining Corporation as early as 1997, but at that time it was considered to be neither economically nor environmentally viable. By 2005, Western Mining Corporation had revisited the possibility of seawater desalination from upper Spencer Gulf. A pre- feasibility study was underway at the time of the BHP Billiton takeover, and was completed by the project's new owners. In order to meet the project's increasing demand for water, the BHP Billiton expansion plan proposed to construct a large-scale reverse osmosis seawater desalination plant at Point Lowly in upper Spencer Gulf. The water would then be pumped over 300 km north to the Olympic Dam mine site and Roxby Downs township. The proposed plant's location remains controversial due to the proximity of the proposed brine discharge to critical breeding habitat for the Giant Australian Cuttlefish, which are sensitive to increases in ocean salinity.Schliebs, Mark \\"Fears remain that safeguards won't save giant cuttlefish\\" The Australian 2011-10-11. In August 2009, a South Australian parliamentary committee recommended that BHP Billiton investigate alternative locations for the proposed plant after concluding that brine could harm the marine ecology of upper Spencer Gulf. In 2010 and 2011, three petitions (signed by a total of 910 South Australians) were tabled in the Parliament of South Australia calling for the relocation of the proposed desalination plant, so that it would discharge brine into an oceanic environment rather than into Spencer Gulf. =Public opposition= Kevin Buzzacott In February 2012, Arabana elder Kevin Buzzacott legally challenged the Commonwealth Environment Minister Tony Burke's environmental approval of the Olympic Dam mine expansion. Buzzacott was represented by the Environmental Defenders' Office and appeared in the Federal Court in Adelaide on 3 and 4 April 2012.\\"Elder Kevin Buzzacott challenges decision to expand Olympic Dam\\" The Advertiser (2012-04-03) His case was dismissed on April 20, 2012.Friends of the Earth Adelaide \\"Legal challenge of federal approval of the Olympic Dam expansion continues\\" Retrieved 2013-11-27. An appeal of the judge's decision in 2013 was also unsuccessful.The Australian \\"Aboriginal elder loses bid to block $30bn Olympic Dam mine expansion\\" (2013-10-08) In July 2012, more than 400 people joined the \\"Lizard's Revenge\\" protest at the Olympic Dam site. The anti-nuclear activists, including Buzzacott, protested against the mine expansion and the uranium industry. They say the company and the government have put short-term economic gain ahead of environmental and health concerns. Organiser Nectaria Calan said police harassed protesters, demanding identification and controlling access to and from their campsite. The original development of the mine also attracted public opposition from Australia's anti-nuclear movement. Hundreds of arrests occurred at and around the mine site during a variety of actions and demonstrations in 1983 and 1984. The protesters alleged that they had been provoked by police and that they had been unfairly represented as the antagonists in various media reports. Deferral of open-cut expansion In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that the expansion was being postponed indefinitely pending investigation of a \\"new and cheaper design\\". The South Australian Mineral Resources and Energy Minister, Tom Koutsantonis in response to this announcement stated \\"they will be developed (and) it will bring a great deal of prosperity.\\" However the Premier, Jay Weatherill, warned BHP \\"given that this is the second time they have disappointed South Australians, there can be no doubt that this community permission will come at a (greater) cost\\" next time.= \\"BHP Billiton's decision won't be covered by tax hike says SA Premier Jay Weatherill\\" News.com.au 2012-08-23. = Eight months later, the service town of Roxby Downs was reportedly \\"in a slump\\". In December 2013, the federal government expressed its support for the revival of the Olympic Dam expansion project. The announcements were made in the wake of news that General Motors Holden would be ceasing its car production operations in South Australia in 2017.Maher, Sid & Shanahan, Dennis \\"Tony Abbott's push for Olympic Dam revival\\" The Australian, 2013-12-24.

In September 2014, environmental approval was received for heap-leaching trials to commence at the mine in an effort to reduce processing costs. In 2015, the Olympic Dam mine's workforce began a staged contraction in company-wide efforts to reduce operating costs. A review of the workforce was announced in January. Since the review commenced, 50 contractor positions were shed in March and 140 jobs were lost in June. A spokesperson from BHP Billiton told Australian Mining: > \\"All areas of our business, including labour productivity, are being > examined. A review is currently progressing in our operational areas and we > expect there will be further workforce reductions.” Operations Monument at the discovery hole of Olympic Dam, RD1 Chalcopyrite-rich ore specimen from Olympic Dam = Underground mine = The Olympic Dam mine works an extremely large iron oxide copper gold deposit with estimated reserves of 2.95 billion tonnes of ore grading 1.2% copper, 0.04% uranium, .5 g/t of gold and 6 g/t of silver. The deposit was originally discovered by Western Mining Corporation in 1975 near Roxby Downs Sheep Station and production officially commenced in 1988. It now belongs to BHP Billiton, which acquired WMC Resources in 2005. The mine currently operates by an underground mining method called sublevel open stoping, using modern and highly productive mining equipment. The March 2005 mine production rate is an annualised 9.1 million tonnes making it one of Australia's larger mines. 2005 metal production is thought to be in excess of 220,000 tonnes of copper, 4500 tonnes of uranium oxide, plus gold and silver. The copper and uranium oxide are exported through Port Adelaide. Most of the mine workers live in the nearby towns of Roxby Downs and Andamooka. Regular flights between Adelaide and the Olympic Dam Airport serve the mine project. Yellowcake = Uranium production = The production of uranium at Olympic dam accounts for approximately 20% of the mine's revenue. Since 2013, Olympic Dam has been Australia's largest producer of uranium oxide or 'yellowcake'. = Electricity supply = The Olympic Dam mine is South Australia's single largest consumer of electricity, and is connected (at 275kV) at end of the grid via Port Augusta. In 2009, BHP Billiton defined its typical annual electricity consumption as 870,000 MWh (or 125 MW). In 2015, BHP requested a more reliable grid connection.Network capability The 2016 storm and heatwaves disrupted production and caused financial losses. The state started initiatives to increase grid reliability. = Water supply = The Olympic Dam mine uses 35 megalitres of Great Artesian Basin water each day, making it the largest industrial user of underground water in the southern hemisphere. Water is pumped along an underground pipeline from two bore fields which are located 110 km and 200 km to the north of the mine. The salty bore water requires desalination before it is used. Contaminated water from mining operations is passed through a series of sealed ponds where it evaporates. 3 megalitres of the 35 megalitres extracted daily is supplied to the township of Roxby Downs. Water usage has increased significantly since the 1990s. In 1995, the Olympic Dam project, including the Roxby Downs township, consumed an average of 14.3 megalitres of water daily. The high use of artesian water as a result of mine operations threatens areas of high ecological significance. In particular, the pumping of water from the bore fields has been linked to observations of reductions in flow or drying out in nearby mound springs. As mound springs are the only permanent source of water in the arid interior of South Australia a delicate yet intricate ecological balance has been establishedKeane, D, 1997, The Sustainability of Use of Groundwater from the Great Artesian Basin, with Particular Reference to the South-Western Edge of the Basin and Impact on the Mound Springs, Environmental Engineering, RMIT, 76 p. with prolonged isolation causing the existence of many rare and endemic species.Kinhill, 1997, Olympic Dam Expansion Project Environmental Impact Statement, Prepared for WMC (Olympic Dam Corporation) Pty Ltd by Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd, May 1997, 500 p. = Air pollution = Airborne pollution emissions from the Olympic Dam processing facility are reported annually to the National Pollution Inventory. Emissions exceeding 500 tonnes per annum as of 2013 are (from largest to smallest): particulate matter (10 um), oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. = Public sector support = Paul Heithersay, Olympic Dam Task Force CE In 2006, the Government of South Australia established the Olympic Dam Task Force to assist BHP Billiton with their mine expansion plans. Paul Heithersay is the task force's Chief Executive and as of 2015 also serves as Deputy Chief Executive for the Department of State Development. Current and former senior public servants who have also worked on the Olympic Dam project as employees of BHP Billiton or Western Mining Corporation include Richard Yeeles and Kym Winter-Dewhirst.

It was located near the town of Szebnie approximately east of Jasło and south-west of Rzeszów. The facility was constructed in 1940 originally as horse stables for the Wehrmacht, adjacent to a manorial estate where the German officers stationed (photo). Over the course of the camp's operation thousands of people perished there, including Soviet prisoners of war, Polish Jews, non-Jewish Poles, Ukrainians, and Romani people. The charred remains of the camp were entered by the Soviets on Operation The camp covered an area of about 10 hectares with some 35 barracks eventually. First, it became a POW camp (Kriegsgefangenenlager) in late June 1941 for some 6,000 Red Army soldiers, captured in the Soviet zone of occupied Poland after the implementation of Operation Barbarossa. The POWs built the first 20 barracks with three-level bunk-beds (not enough for all). Most of them perished from disease and hunger with no heat in winter, and no laundry or bath; up to 200 a day. The only person who courageously helped the sick during typhus epidemic was a young lady, Helena Gorayska, who paid for it with her own life in 1942 infected with typhus. Some other locals also offered foodstuffs. In the spring of 1943 the camp was reinstated as a forced-labor camp for Poles, Jews, Ukrainians, and Gypsies. The first new prisoners arrived in Holocaust trains from the Jewish ghettos liquidated across occupied Poland. By August, it held 1,040 people. By the fall of 1943 the number of prisoners reached 5,000 including Jews and non-Jews from Rzeszów, Tarnów, Bochnia, Jasło, Frysztak, Dukla and Pustków. The Jews had been appointed the camp's only Kapos compelled to maintain discipline and administer torture. Eventually, the camp held about 10,000 deportees, men, women, and children. Some prisoners were employed at a tailor shop for the German military, but most worked at various earth works in the area; at the gravel pit, in the SS farm, at the oil refinery in Niegłowice, and at the Hitler's Bunker in Stępina. The camp was surrounded by barb-wire fences with six guard towers and search lights around the perimeter. The camp commandants included Untersturmführer Anton Scheidt (inventor of prisoner \\"crew train\\" running 12-hour shifts round-the-clock), Hauptsturmführer Hans Kellermann (connoisseur of young camp-women, put in jail by the SS for stealing from the Reich), and SS-Hauptsturmführer Karl Blank (as the last, for just two weeks). Notably, stealing collected gold and money for personal enrichment was a common practice among concentration camp commandants; two of them, Koch and Florstedt both from Majdanek, were executed by the SS for the same reason in April 1945. Through the whole existence of the camp the commandants resided in the Gorayski manor, holding wild drinking parties for the SS several times a week (Scheidt) and trapping scores of attractive Jewish and non-Jewish \\"house maids\\" (Kellermann).  Liquidation Bierowskie Doły with unmarked mass graves covering the entire perimeter. Notably, the old monument mentions only the Soviet prisoners of war from Szebnie (2008) In August 1943, the Jews were separated from the rest of prisoners in a special Jewish zone on the north side of the camp behind a barb-wire fence (see map). Subsequently, almost two thousand were murdered in mass executions at the Dobrucowa Forest nearby in the fall and winter of 1943, on the orders of SS-Hauptsturmführer Amon Goeth from Płaszów. Some 700 Jews were killed in one day on 22 September 1943, forced to undress. Their bodies were incinerated on site by the end of the month. On 6 October, another group of 500 Jews were shot and burned. On 5 November 1943, some 2,800 Jews were loaded onto Holocaust trains to meet their death in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Seven are known to have escaped. By February 1944 only 80 Jews remained in the camp. They were transported to Kraków-Płaszów. Most of the remaining non-Jewish prisoners were evacuated in 14–25 August 1944 further west to Grybów camp, except for some 300 of the weakest. The camp was used temporarily for four months (between February and July 1944), to keep additional Soviet POWs. It was known as Stalag 325 even though in 1942 it was known as Stalag 327, apparently not perceived as sequential by German administration. The POWs were massacred by the Ukrainian 14th Waffen SS Division soldiers, brought in specifically for this purpose from the SS Heidelager troop-training facility in Pustków nearby. Most of the barracks were burned down. The remains of the camp were entered by the Soviet Red Army on 8 September 1944. The site has not been protected legally. Usable building materials were eventually hauled away.

His dance instruction tapes of Persian and Arabic dance have become popular inside Iranian society. In 2006, during a TV interview he came out and became one of the few Iranian celebrities who declared to be homosexual. He resides in Los Angeles, California. Biography The youngest of four children, Mohammad Khordadian was born in Sabzevar. Inspired by Jamileh, a famous Iranian female dancer of the 60s and 70s, he started dancing when he was a child. Then he joined the National Folk Company of Iran, a local troupe, and performed in Roodaki Opera House where he met his future wife, Jean Beaini. Before leaving Iran he was a taxi driver in Tehran, after the Islamic Revolution he fled his country to build a new life as a dance teacher and performer in Los Angeles. He released Workout and Dance Lesson #1, his first video of dance instruction, in the early 1980s. In 1987, he published Persian dance #2. Despite legal prohibition of dance under the new regime, both his works found their way to Iranian families mainly through the black market and television stations run by Iranian exiles. On 22 March 2008, Khordadian and his company performed at Los Angeles Music Center. Currently he lives in Los Angeles and gives lessons in Iranian dance to Iranian residents of the United States. Trial Following the death of his mother and because of his father's ill health, Khordadian returned to Iran to visit his family. This was his first visit after more than 20 years. On May 2002, as he was trying to leave the country, he was arrested in Tehran's Mehrabad Airport. He spent 21 days in solitary confinement and 40 days in the Evin Prison. On 7 July 2002, Khordadian was convicted on charge of \\"promoting depravity and corruption among the youth\\" through his dance videotapes. His sentence to 10 years prison was later suspended, but he was barred from giving dance lessons for life, even outside Iran. The court also banned him from attending weddings for three years, except for his relatives'. He was finally released from prison and returned to Los Angeles. He later stated that he had not been tortured physically and the judge did not interrogate him over his private life. Personal life Khordadian married an English woman named Jean Beaini. After the Iranian Revolution he moved to London with his wife who was a ballerina. After working in a club as dancers, they went to Los Angeles in the United States where they eventually divorced. In 2006, Khordadian told Alireza Amirghassemi of Tapesh TV that he was gay. According to him, his family accepted his homosexuality. He met and dated a younger Iranian man while he was visiting Iran. They lived together in Dubai for a time but eventually separated. Khordadian and his ex-wife, Jean Beaini, met up again in England and worked together on writing a book about their relationship and the time they spent together in Iran during the Iranian revolution. The title of the book is, For the Love of Mohammad: A Memoir and it was published in July 2014.

The main actors are Julio Chávez, Facundo Arana, Griselda Siciliani, Benjamín Vicuña and Alfredo Casero. Premise Farsantes is a legal drama concerning a law firm located in Greater Buenos Aires. It fills the timeslot of the telenovela Sos mi hombre. It was initially conceived as a miniseries, but as the host show Showmatch did not have a 2013 edition, it was expanded into a regular telenovela. The series is written by Mario Segade and Carolina Aguirre and directed by Daniel Barone and Jorge Bechara. The cast is composed of many notable actors, including Julio Chávez, Griselda Siciliani, Benjamín Vicuña, Leonor Manso, Gabriela Toscano and Facundo Arana. Arana received proposals from both El Trece and Telefe. Telefe had proposed that he work in a telenovela with Pablo Echarri; he finally chose to work for El Trece. Actors Gonzalo Heredia and Joaquín Furriel were proposed as cast members during the early stages of production, but declined to stay in the project. Furriel's character was finally played by Benjamín Vicuña. Actress Griselda Siciliani suffered a bone fracture during filming. Facundo Arana, who was being filmed struggling with a pair of extras and with Siciliani next to him, pushed her by accident. She was taken to the hospital \\"Sanatorio de la Trinidad\\", and received an orthopedic cast for a couple of months. The actress confirmed that the fracture was the result of an accident, and subsequent filming managed to hide her orthopedic cast. Plot Guillermo Graziani (Julio Chávez) is a lawyer who establishes a new law firm in the Greater Buenos Aires, after serving a time unable to work as a lawyer. He is gay, but stays married with Ana (Ingrid Pelicori) to conceal his homosexuality. He has a crush on fellow lawyer Pedro (Benjamín Vicuña), who is married to Camila (Julieta Cardinali). Alberto Marini (Facundo Arana) is a former prisoner, and the other lawyers of the firm are Marcos (Alfredo Casero) and Gabriela (Griselda Siciliani).

The riots began on 5 January 1974 after the police attempted to disperse a rally of the Dalit Panthers that had turned violent. Regular clashes between the Dalit Panthers, the Shiv Sena, and the police continued for several months. Six people were killed in the riots, and approximately 113 injured; widespread property damage also occurred in the tenements. The riots have been described as anti-Dalit violence by scholars. Background A larger number of unemployed youth lived in the Worli neighborhood of Mumbai in the 1970s. These youth frequently organized themselves into gangs which included individuals from multiple caste backgrounds, brought together by their lower- class status and their shared life in the Worli chawls, or tenements. These youth were often associated with the Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist political party, which gave them \\"ideological and organisational focus\\", and which used them to mobilise support during elections. However, the formation of the Dalit Panthers, which drew inspiration from the Black Panthers in the United States and advocated for Dalit rights, led to Dalit youth moving towards the new organisation, leading to conflict between the two groups. Support for the Sena declined. The Sena accused the Dalit Panthers of damaging Maharashtrian unity by raising issues of caste. The Panthers stated that the Sena only represented upper-caste Hindus, and did not offer Dalits a way to overcome systemic inequality. The Worli riots occurred during a time of dissatisfaction with the Indian National Congress government in Maharastra. This dissatisfaction resulted in political tension; for example, on 2 January 1974, various communist organisations had called for a \\"Maharashtra Bandh Day\\" (\\"Shut Down Maharashtra Day\\"); the call had the support of several opposition parties, as well as the Dalit Panthers. A by-election to the Maharashtra legislative assembly had been scheduled for January 1974. The candidate of the Congress had the support of most of the Republican Party of India, which had historically commanded substantial support among Dalits. The Dalit Panthers opposed any agreement with the Congress, and asked Dalit voters to boycott the bypoll. Riots The riots began on 5 January 1974. The events which triggered the riots are in dispute. The violence began after speakers at a rally of the Dalit Panthers were stoned: they were accused of having made obscene statements about Hindu deities. Bhagwat Jadhav, a member of the Dalit Panthers, was killed by a grinding stone thrown at the rally. Reacting to the violence, the police attempted to disperse the crowd using tear gas and baton charges. The crowd was pushed into the close-packed slum area of the neighborhood; 70% of the inhabitants of this area were non-Dalits. Members of the Shiv Sena followed the gathering, and began to attack them; the Dalits retaliated. Dalits and non-Dalit Hindus were reported to have attacked each other with stones and glass bottles. The violence continued the next morning; intermittent violence would continue in the Worli tenements until April 1974, and also spread to other parts of the city of Mumbai; an eyewitness stated that gangs of people threw stones at each other, often from terraces of the tenements. Electric bulbs, acid, and kerosene bombs were also thrown. Being in a numerical minority in these neighborhoods, Dalits bore the brunt of this violence. The local police supported the attacks on the Dalits; one of the Dalit men killed in the violence was the victim of police firing. A number of the eye-witnesses stated that the police sided with the Shiv Sena, and that members of the Police who were not on duty were part of the Hindu mob. Six people were killed in the violence, and 113 were estimated to have been injured. The police opened fire on violence mobs on 19 occasions. 70 complexes within the Worli tenement were damaged, affecting over half of its residents. Scholarly analysis of the 1974 riots has generally described the incidents as anti-Dalit violence. Historian Eleanor Zelliot described the riots as an attack on Dalit Buddhists by their Hindu neighbors. Scholar Jayashree Gokhale‐Turner stated that the nature of the police's response to the violence was seen as a warning to the Dalit Panthers to moderate their methods. Scholar Anupama Rao stated that the Worli were part of a systematic attempt by non- Dalit Hindus to undermine the influence of \\"neo-Buddhists\\", or Dalits who had followed B. R. Ambedkar in converting to Buddhism. Rao referred to the riots as \\"an important landmark in Dalit politics\\". Inquiry and aftermath The Maharashtra Government ordered a judicial inquiry into the matter. The inquiry was led by S. B. Bhasme, a high court judge, and lasted until April 1974. The commission's report described the riots as a conflict between \\"caste Hindus and neo-Buddhists\\" and attributed much of the severity of the conflict to the physical proximity of Hindu and Buddhist chawls which facilitated stone throwing. Much evidence was also presented to the commission regarding partisan police behavior against Dalits, with some witnesses describing a \\"police riot\\". The report did not mention the role of the Shiv Sena as an organisation, but stated that a large number of the perpetrators of the violence were supports of the Sena. The violence significantly lowered voter turnout among Dalit voters, and the Congress candidate lost the election to Roza Deshpande, a candidate of the Communist Party of India. The repression faced by the Dalit Panthers after the riots led to the organisation moderating its methods. The riots brought the neighborhood of Worli into national prominence. The performance of the police was criticized in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly by a member of the legislature. The riots have been described as triggering the end of a period of unity among the Dalit Panthers; the organisation would break into two factions later in 1974. Members of the Congress party were rumoured to have attended the rally, hoping to come to an agreement with the Panthers about the election. Though the rumours were never substantiated, they were the subject of a disagreement between factions of the Panthers, which played a role in the split that followed. The riots were referred to several times in Dalit poetry from the period. In 2010, Dalit activist Namdeo Dhasal described the Worli riots as \\"showcasing the worst of [Indian] democracy.\\" Further reading * References Category:Riots and civil disorder in India Category:Dalit history Category:Caste-related violence in India Category:History of Mumbai (1947–present) Category:1974 in India Category:20th century in Mumbai Category:1974 riots Category:1974 crimes in India ","title":"Worli riots"},{"id":"39861783","text":"Aerial view of the eastern part of Blekinge archipelago with Karlskrona in the centre Blekinge archipelago is an archipelago in the Baltic Sea, located in Blekinge in the south of Sweden.

The island of Utlängan is the farthest out to sea of the archipelago's islands; only the lighthouse rock Utklippan is farther out. The landscape is a diverse cultural landscape, characterised by mainly a mix between oak pastures and deciduous forest. For its size, the archipelago exhibits an unusually high biodiversity. Endangered species who find a habitat in the archipelago include Osmoderma eremita and Lecanographa amylacea. Culture The towns of Karlshamn and Karlskrona are both located within the archipelago area; indeed, Karlskrona is mainly situated on Trossö island. The latter, having been founded as a naval base, is noted for its Baroque architecture and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shipbuilding has been a traditional local trade within the archipelago and the area is known for a traditional type of small boat, called blekingeeka and used for tasks like fishing and transporting stone locally. In the 1970s, the local diving club discovered a shipwreck in the Blekinge archipelago that was eventually identified by archaeologists as Gribshunden, a 15th-century Danish warship.

Carrapateena represents one of the largest copper reserves in Australia and in the world having estimated reserves of 292 million tonnes of ore grading 1.31% copper and 3.64 million oz of gold. It was discovered by explorer and metallurgist Rudie Gomez in 2005. The project was acquired by OZ Minerals in 2011,Carrapateena project OZ Minerals (Accessed 2013-12-26) and the project was referred to the EPBC Act for Federal environmental approval in 2012. Construction of the decline to access the mine commenced in 2016. The mining technique used to extract the ore is sub-level caving. The Tjati decline was officially opened in November 2016. The company expected that it would take two years to complete excavation of the decline which is long and descends . The mine owners also have a signed agreement with the traditional owners of the land, the Kokatha people. The company announced board approval for continued development on 24 August 2017, expecting to spend on development before the mine would begin to produce ore in late 2019. The first copper concentrate was produced in December 2019, by which time the mine had cost between $950 million and $980 million. Mine life is forecast to be about twenty years. During the construction time for the decline, surface construction continued. This included an accommodation village and airstrip in 2017-2018. They were followed by processing plant, access road and electricity infrastructure from mid-2018 and installation of underground materials handling. The mine site is on Pernatty Station with other infrastructure on Oakden Hills Station. Construction of the airstrip was completed in July 2018 with the village providing 550 accommodation rooms completed about a month later. Cobham Aviation Services provides fly-in fly-out services between Adelaide, Port Augusta and Carrapateena since October 2018 using an RJ-100 aircraft. It operates 14 flights per week on the route. The Program for Environment Protection and Rehabilitation (PEPR) for the mine was approved by the state government on 29 March 2018. Downer EDI was then awarded the contract to take over from PYBAR Mining services to continue underground mining operations from 1 July 2018.

With Manon Massé, he is the co-spokesperson of the left-wing party Québec solidaire since May 21, 2017, and was elected as a member of the provincial legislative assembly on May 29, 2017.\\"Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois wins Gouin byelection in landslide\\". Montreal Gazette, May 29, 2017. Before his arrival in active politics, he was well known for his role during the 2012 Quebec student protests as co-spokesperson of the Coalition large de l'Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (CLASSE), a broad coalition of student associations opposed to the $1,625 tuition hike introduced by Jean Charest's government. He quit that position on August 9, 2012. Early life Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois was born in a family of activists: his parents met in the Jeunesse Etudiante Chrétienne (Young Christian Students). His father was also an environmental and union activist. When he was young, he went with his father to demonstrations and union assemblies where he was supposed to do his homework, but listened to the speeches instead. He became interested in politics and began reading La Presse hoping to become an international journalist. At the Collège Regina Assumpta, a highly ranked private school in Montreal, he obtained good grades but questioned everything, although he \\"was not a rebel\\", according to his father, Gilles Dubois. When the school's management wanted to appoint student representatives, he opposed the decision, saying that students should elect them instead. His request was realized the following year. Post-secondary student life In Fall 2007, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois joined the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante (ASSÉ) as a student at the Collège de Bois- de-Boulogne. That year, the student association decided in a general assembly to no longer be affiliated with the ASSÉ. Nadeau-Dubois unsuccessfully tried to get the student association to rejoin the ASSÉ. The young activist was nevertheless elected as vice-president of his student association and was in charge of external affairs. In 2009, he started a humanities degree at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM). In order to focus on the student struggles, he enrolled as a part-time student, with only three credits per session. He received a Millennium Scholarship. During the 2010–2011 session, he was elected as a member of the ASSÉ's newspaper committee. In April 2010, he was also elected as Communications Secretary and spokesperson. In December 2011, he became a co-spokesperson of the ASSÉ's Coalition large (CLASSE), a broad coalition of student associations opposed to the $1,625 tuition hike introduced by Jean Charest's government, along with Jeanne Reynolds. Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois first obtained a degree in Humanities from UQAM, then pursued a minor in philosophy at Université de Montréal. At the end of 2016, he finished a master's degree in sociology at UQAM. =2012 student protests= Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois at a news conference during the June 22, 2012 protest in Quebec City. Ever since the beginning of the 2012 Quebec student protests, Nadeau- Dubois was considered by the media as one of the leaders the student movement, along with Léo Bureau-Blouin and Martine Desjardins (fr), if not the leader (although they were officially referred to as spokespersons). Indeed, the CLASSE is based on direct democracy; it does not have any leaders, but instead has spokespersons, of which Nadeau-Dubois was one along with Jeanne Reynolds. This personification of the movement led to several rumours, personal attacks and even five death threats a week, both on Twitter and by mail. He was consequently protected by three or four bodyguards at demonstrations. In June, he admitted that he was \\"psychologically tired\\" and announced that while he would request a renewal of his term as spokesperson at the CLASSE's congress, he would quit his position at the end of the strike, citing \\"both internal and external pressure\\". He qualified the media coverage of him as \\"ironic\\", since he was the least powerful of the three student association leaders, yet he was also the one who was watched the most by the media. As a result of the constant attacks on him, Nadeau-Dubois resigned from his role as CLASSE spokesman on August 9, 2012. In his resignation letter, published by Le Devoir, a left-leaning periodical, he expressed his opinion that the strike movement had raised deeper issues and \\"questioned corrupt institutions\\". However, he regretted the fact that Jean Charest was still Premier [of the province of Quebec], saying that his government was \\"the incarnation of corruption\\". Morasse v. Nadeau-Dubois On April 12, 2012, a visual arts student at Laval University, Jean-François Morasse, asked for and obtained an injunction from Justice Jean Hamelin of the Quebec Superior Court against his student association to be able to continue his studies. The student, whose provisional injunction was renewed twice, was able to go to class. He nevertheless decided to press charges of contempt of court against Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois after having heard what he said to the TV channel RDI on May 13: Even though the injunction was no longer effective since Bill 78 was passed by the National Assembly on May 28, Article 32 of the special law allows for contempt of court procedures to continue. This article was nicknamed the \\"Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois clause\\" by Parti Québécois MNA Véronique Hivon. Morasse, who is represented pro bono by Maxime Roy Martel, asked that Nadeau- Dubois be given a prison sentence. The prosecutor, who was referred by the Quebec Bar Association, said that Nadeau-Dubois \\"incited other people not to respect the court's decision. And this incitation had a very wide reach, because [Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois] has a lot of media coverage.\\" It is the only court case regarding contempt of court relative to an injunction which was given during the student protests. Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, who pleaded not guilty to the accusation, said that the situation was \\"sad and regrettable\\". The hearings for this case were undertaken on September 27 and 28, 2012, at the Court of Quebec. He was found guilty of contempt of court on November 1, 2012. On December 2, Nadeau-Dubois launched a campaign called Appel à tous (\\"appeal to everyone\\") to raise funds to appeal the verdict. On December 5, Justice Denis Jacques sentenced Nadeau-Dubois to 120 hours of community service, but his sentence was suspended until his appeal was decided. In January 2015, Quebec's Court of Appeal overturned the ruling. Three justices found for Nadeau-Dubois, who was acquitted. Morasse appealed that decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. In October, 2016, writing for the majority, Justices Clément Gascon and Rosalie Abella stated that in Nadeau-Dubois's comments, picketing does not equal blocking classes, the latter being contra to the injunction.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/gabriel-nadeau- dubois-contempt-court-case-1.3823726 Career 285px In the past, Nadeau- Dubois has said he was not interested in being a politician. He stated that the best way to achieve social justice and free education is by being an activist in social movements. He said to a journalist in March 2012 that partisan politics discourage him from getting involved. Shortly after quitting as CLASSE spokesperson, Nadeau-Dubois was hired by the CSN-Construction on a contractual basis. His job mainly consisted of research on the history of collective agreements in the construction industry. In 2013, he was awarded the Prix impératif français for his \\"commitment to defending accessibility to post-secondary education for all, in a society that is as just as possible.\\" In 2014, he won the Governor General's Award for French-language non-fiction for Tenir tête, a memoir of the events of 2012. Speaking on the popular Quebec television show Tout le monde en parle on 23 November 2014, he announced he had donated his $25,000 Governor-General's Award prize money to fight the Energy East pipeline project, and that he has raised a further $385,000 to support the fight against the project, which is owned by TransCanada Pipelines and would funnel oil sands bitumen via Eastern Canada for export to foreign markets. In March 2017, Nadeau-Dubois decided to seek the nomination to be Québec solidaire's co-spokesperson, and also its candidate in the Montreal riding of Gouin vacated by Françoise David. Québec Solidaire is a left-wing socialist party which also supports Quebec sovereignty. He stated that the Parti Québécois and the Liberals were his adversaries, with Option nationale, another sovereignist and left-wing party, being the only party who shares his worldview. Later that year, Option nationale merged into Québec solidaire. Nadeau-Dubois won the byelection on May 29, 2017, and became MNA for Gouin. In the Quebec general election of October 1, 2018, Nadeau-Dubois again won Gouin for Québec solidaire, with 59.14% of the vote.https://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/provincial/election- results/general-elections.php?e=83&c;=1098&s;=1 He is currently the party's parliamentary leader.http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/deputes/nadeau-dubois- gabriel-16827/index.html  In fiction  A novel titled Tenir parole was published in Spring 2017, whose protagonist is an embattled Nadeau-Dubois during the 2012 student strike and which is narrated from a first-person perspective.

He was severely persecuted for his work and Roman Catholic beliefs during Czechoslovakia's Communist era from 1948 to 1989, including thirteen years in prison.

The Prague Daily Monitor has called him \\"one of the most distinguished personalities of the Catholic stream in Czech poetry of the latter half of the 20th century.\\" Rotrekl was born in 1920 in Brno, Czechoslovakia. He published his first full volume of poetry when he was just 20 years old. He enrolled at Faculty of Arts in Brno in the aftermath of World War II, where he pursued studies in Sanskrit, history, and art history. However, he was expelled from the university following the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état for supporting democracy. Prior to 1948, Rotrekl had published three books of poetry. Following his expulsion from his university, Rotreki was sentenced to death in a 1949 show trial. His sentence was later commuted to life in prison, ultimately spending thirteen years imprisoned by Czechoslovakia's Communist authorities. Rotreki worked in blue collar positions after his release.

One day Henry Peto asked William Woods (an old waiter at his favourite lunch-time dining room, the Rainbow Chophouse in Fleet Street) whether he would like to keep a hotel. Woods replied there was nothing he would like better, but that he could not afford it. Henry Peto installed Woods at a hotel in Furnival's Inn which he had just built and which he owned.

There was also a continuing lawsuit regarding the Customs House. In his will he left his building business to his two nephews, Thomas Grissell and Morton Peto.

The painting measures , and is exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, England. The museum acquired it in 1864. Background Holyrood Palace as viewed circa 1900. The abbey is on the left. Holyrood Abbey is located next to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, built by James IV of Scotland in 1501, which became the official residence of the Monarch of the United Kingdom situated in Edinburgh, Scotland.Clarke, pp. 27–28. The Abbey started operation in 1128, with various rounds of destruction and reconstruction over the centuries. It has been used as the Parliament of Scotland, the site of coronations, royal weddings, and the location of royal tombs.Gallagher, p.1084 During a storm in 1768 the roof collapsed, leaving the abbey as it currently stands. Daguerre, who worked at the time as a stage designer for the theatre, was enamored by dioramas and the contrast of light and shadow. Although it is not known whether Daguerre visited the abbey in person, he created and exhibited a diorama of Holyrood Abbey (along with many other dioramas) in Paris around 1824. The diorama measured wide. When lit from behind, a small figure could be seen inside the chapel. Real-life ruins inspired Daguerre, and he used the Holyrood Abbey ruins as a source of inspiration for two paintings, both with the same title. The first painting had the same figure from the diorama visiting the grave of her friend. Daguerre was able to study the way the light hit the interior of the ruins by emulating the scenario with his diorama. Description The painting depicts the ruins of Holyrood Abbey during a moonlit scene, which was a popular attraction (in real life) for visitors to the abbey at the time. The perspective and scale of the ruins was altered slightly to fit the walls onto the canvas. In Literature Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem Holyrood was written in response to a visit to the diorama in Regent's Park, London, in 1825.

Gameplay The game takes place in 5 different locations Montana, Mexico, Texas, Namibia and Alaska. Each location features three different primary days with five different hunts available from the start of the region. The game features a big variety of environments available including lush forests, dry deserts, craggy mountains, flooded plains, scorching savannas and the freezing tundra. The game also features multiple scenarios where \\"decisions\\" will have to be made. Each region features a variety of animals each specific to the environments in which can be hunted throughout the game. The game incorporates many new and returning elements not found in previous main series games, such as having shooting blinds, shooting rests and tree stands, a caller, and other things to aid the player. \\"Hunter Sense\\" returns, and now upon finding evidence, the player creates a flashback in the form of a black-and-white moving image of the animal's last known location and what that animal was doing. But other new things are implemented in this game to work against the player, such as animals now having some of the most improved and most realistic AI in any game, meaning they could easily see, smell, or hear you if you make a wrong move. Similar to Dangerous Hunts, predators can now randomly surprise the player by jumping out of a bush or off a cliff, so the player's \\"killer instinct\\" slow-motion mode activates, turning the player towards the animal to shoot before it lands a hit. Getting to your target is now more challenging with the implementation of stealth hunts and timed hunts. Stealth hunts are when the males are not within reach and the player must use stealth and cover (usually thick bushes, logs, and rock formations) to avoid females, noisy terrain, and other animals like birds. The player is also given a device called a UTD that measures your presence to the animals. A low-pitched beep means that the animals are calm and can't detect you, medium-pitched beeps indicate that animals are starting to detect your presence, and high-pitched beeps tell the player that animals have clearly spotted the player and they are about to run away. A timed hunt is activated either when you reach your target, a predator or another force that could disturb the animals appears and the player must kill the target in a certain amount of time; or when the animals appear as a large herd and the player must kill a certain number of males before time runs out. Many birds and small mammals roam around for the player to shoot at their leisure. Sometimes the player can reach a hidden area, where they have an opportunity to photograph rare animals and natural behaviors. There's also a gun store where players can buy, customize, and upgrade their weapons. The game also features multiplayer where players can create or customize their own map from a template (based on campaign or gallery) or from scratch. Players can place trees, foliage, water, terrain formations, and animals found in the game or create custom animals, which they can hunt with friends with online connectivity. Players can set challenges to compete in hunting the rarest animals and like Campaign mode, players can also buy and customize their weapons for each type of situation (a typical weapon is usually a variation of a scoped bolt-action hunting rifle). There are multiple shooting galleries like arcade, where you can kill as many animals as want, target, which you can use to practice your marksmanship by shooting wood cutouts of animal targets, or reflex which tests your hunting skills by instructing the player to kill certain animals in a chronological order. The game was released packaged with the Top Shot Elite, a plastic peripheral for the Wii controller. Story Twenty-five-year-old John Sharp, a rookie big game hunter, is invited to participate in the Cabela's 2012 International Safari hosted by John Hathcock, a high-ranking member of the Order of Orion, an elite club of world-class big game hunters from all over the world. The player starts in Montana, Sharp's homeland, where he hunts red deer, white- tailed deer, pronghorn, and hunt an elk before wolves scare it away. The next day a wounded mountain lion terrorizes the area, and Sharp must kill it. The player heads to Mexico, where he hunts whitetail, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and mule deer. After taking shelter in an arroyo during a sandstorm, Sharp finds boot tracks, confident that someone trespassed into his zone. Just as he's approaching a bison herd, a rifle fires and misses, scaring them off. It's revealed Matisse fired, trying to make Sharp miss his chance. The two argue, but Hathcock shames them. Then the player goes to Hathcock's private ranch in Texas, hunting white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, wild boar, bison, and moose. The radio gets a distress call from Freidkin, with Hathcock telling Sharp to check it out. Sharp finds that Freidkin's stand was knocked over by a startled bison, making him fall 70 feet down into a gorge. Sharp must then defend him from meat-craving boars until medical assistance arrives. Freidkin is taken to a hospital, where his left leg is amputated, making him drop out. The player goes to Namibia, where he hunts blackbuck, impala, zebra, wildebeest, greater kudu, White rhino and Cape buffalo. Sharp comes across lion tracks, confirming that a hunting pride is scouring the area. Sharp hears as Cassidy alerts everyone that he and his kill are surrounded by lions. As Cassidy starts to panic, Sharp instructs him to abandon his trophy and jump into a nearby ravine. There are several roars and a scream as several birds are flushed from the trees. Sharp runs to the site, finding nothing but Cassidy's rifle and pack with smears of blood. Sharp sees the male lion in the distance, and must dispatch the lionesses. He's then ambushed by the lion, and as he's about to kill Sharp a shot fires, and the lion pauses and falls to his side. Sharp sits up and sees Matisse, revealing he shot the lion for himself, saving his life. Authorities scour the area, but Cassidy's body is never found. The player and Matisse finally go to Kodiak Island in Alaska, the final location as an approaching Arctic blizzard threatens the cancel the tournament. Meanwhile, a man-eating grizzly bear named Bloody Ben has been terrorizing the island for the last decade, and poses a huge threat to the hunters, spectators, and game animals in the area. The player hunts red deer, Sitka deer, elk, Dall sheep, caribou, and moose. In the midst of the blizzard, Sharp finally finds Ben's tracks, and just as he's about to shoot, a man jumps in front of his scope, revealed to be Matisse. He aggravates the bear by shooting twice, but is mauled. Sharp runs to Matisse, badly injured and passed out. Sharp is then startled by the bear, and jumps to the ground for his rifle as Bloody Ben closes in for the kill. Sharp kills Ben after shooting him 6 times in his vitals. Matisse wakes up, only to see Sharp looking at him with a confident smirk and Bloody Ben dead behind him. Matisse admits defeat to Sharp and apologizes for everything he's done. Sharp then sells Ben's skin to the Order, and he uses the money to go to Hawaii the next summer. The game ends.

The heads of humans and other animals are frequently occurring charges in heraldry. The blazon, or heraldic description, usually states whether an animal's head is couped (as if cut off cleanly at the neck), erased (as if forcibly ripped from the body), or cabossed (turned affronté without any of the neck showing). Human heads are often described in much greater detail, though some of these are identified by name with little or no further description. Heads of humans Heads of humans are sometimes blazoned simply as a \\"man's head\\", but are far more frequently described in greater detail, either characteristic of a particular race or nationality (such as Moors' heads, Saxons' heads, Egyptians' heads or Turks' heads), or specifically identified (such as the head of Moses in the crest of Hilton, or the head of St. John the Baptist in the crest of the London Company of Tallowchandlers). Several varieties of women's heads also occur, including maidens' heads (often couped under the bust, with hair disheveled), ladies' heads, nuns' heads (often veiled), and occasionally queens' heads. The arms of Daveney of Norfolk include \\"three nun's heads veiled couped at the shoulders proper,\\" and the bust of a queen occurs in the arms of Queenborough, Kent. Infants' or children's heads are often couped at the shoulders with a snake wrapped around the neck (e.g. \\"Argent, a boy's head proper, crined or, couped below the shoulders, vested gules, garnished gold,\\" in the arms of Boyman). Heads of animals A leopard's head Jessant-de-lys While lions passant guardant (i.e. walking with head turned to full face) are often called leopards in heraldry, the heads and faces of natural leopards occur frequently in armory, as crests as well as charges. The key distinction being that a leopard's head shows the neck, the leopard's face (turned affronté and cut off cleanly behind the ears) occurs far more frequently. A curious development, unique to the leopard's face, is when it is run through with a fleur-de-lis, called a leopard's face Jessant-de-lys. When the face of a fox is shown (i.e. cabossed), it is termed a fox's mask. Predatory creatures, including eagles, lions, griffins, bears and boars, are often armed of a different tincture, referring to the colour of the creature's claws or talons and beak, teeth or tusks. In the case of the boar, its armaments include only its tusks, but not its hooves, which may be unguled of another tincture. Deer and moose are antler-bearing herbivores, so their antlers are not considered armaments but their attire, so these may be attired of a distinct tincture, while horn-bearing beasts such as bulls, rams and goats may be armed.

The film screenings prompted ordinary villagers to share their own stories of wartime suffering and resistance. Often the projection space would be spontaneously transformed into a folk concert. Through these interactions with village audiences, the young projectionist came to 'relearn' the wider history of the Liberation War, and the continuing struggle of ordinary people for a more just and democratic society.  Synopsis  Muktir Katha is a film about the liberation struggle of 1971. The film is an archive of the ways in which ordinary people fell victim to genocide, rape and other atrocities. The struggle still ranging in the countryside, and struggle for a more just and democratic society. The combined footage shot used in the film was taken from American film maker Lear Levin.

As a two-year-old in 2004 he won four of his seven races including the Anglesey Stakes, Futurity Stakes and Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère as well as finishing second in the Phoenix Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. He showed his best form when tried over a mile and a quarter in 2005, when he defeated strong international fields in the Eclipse Stakes and the Irish Champion Stakes, beating The Derby winner Motivator on both occasions. He was retired to stud at the end of 2005 and has had some success as a sire of winners. Background Oratorio is a good-looking bay horse with a small white star and three white socks bred jointly by the County Wicklow-based Barronstown Stud and Orpendale, a breeding organisation associated with John Magnier's Coolmore Stud. Oratorio's sire Danehill (who died in 2003) was one of the most successful stallions of the last twenty years, producing the winners of more than a thousand races, including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Duke of Marmalade, Dylan Thomas, Rock of Gibraltar, George Washington and North Light. His dam, Mahrah, was a moderate racehorse who won one minor race from six starts before being retired to the breeding paddocks. She was a granddaughter of Katonka, who was a full-sister to the dam of the Preakness Stakes winner Codex. Apart from Oratorio, her best runners has been Fahim, who finished second to Awad in the Sword Dancer Invitational Handicap. Like many Coolmore horses, the details of Oratorio's ownership varied from race to race: he was sometimes listed as being owned by Susan Magnier, while in other races he was listed as the property of a partnership of Magnier and Michael Tabor. The colt was trained throughout his racing career by Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Racing career =2004: two- year-old season= Oratorio made his debut in a six furlong maiden race at the Curragh on 24 May. Ridden by Jamie Spencer, he started the 4/5 favourite and won very easily by two and a half lengths from six opponents. The colt was then moved up sharply in class for the Group 2 Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, where he made little impression, finishing seventh of the thirteen runners behind Iceman. Oratorio returned to the Curragh for the Group 3 Anglesey Stakes over six and a half furlongs on 18 July. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, he recorded his first important success as he took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by a length from his better fancied stable companion Cougar Cat. Oratorio was moved up to Group 1 level for the Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh in August and finished second the filly Damson, who had been made the odds-on favourite. Two weeks later he moved up in distance for the Group 2 Futurity Stakes over seven furlongs. Spencer settled the colt in second place before taking the lead approaching the last quarter mile. Oratorio won by two lengths from Democratic Deficit, with Spencer easing the colt down in the final strides for an impressive win. The remainder of Oratorio's racing career was conducted exclusively at Group 1 level. In October he was sent to France to contest the Prix Jean-Luc Lagardère over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Spencer produced the 5/2 second favourite with a strong challenge in the straight, taking the lead in the closing stages and winning in a three-way photo-finish from the French colts Early March and Layman. Having won the most prestigious French event for two-year-old colts, Oratorio was sent to Newmarket Racecourse two weeks later for Britain's most important juvenile race, the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs. He started at odds of 15/2 and finished second of the nine runners behind the Mark Johnston-trained Shamardal, beaten two and a half lengths. =2005: three- year-old season= Spring Oratorio made his three-year-old debut in the 197th running of the 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course on 30 April, starting at odds of 8/1 in a field of nineteen runners. Ridden by Johnny Murtagh, the colt was unable to obtain a clear run inside the last quarter mile but made progress in the closing stages to finish fourth behind his stable companion Footstepsinthesand. Three weeks later, he started 7/4 joint favourite for the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh and finished second to his betting rival Dubawi, six lengths clear of the rest of the field. In this race, he was ridden for the first time by Kieren Fallon, who became his regular jockey. Summer On 4 June, Oratorio was moved up in distance when he was one of four O'Brien-trained colts to contest the 226th running of the Derby Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. He started the 8/1 fourth favourite, but was never in contention and finished tenth of the thirteen runners, twenty-five lengths behind the winner Motivator. Oratorio was brought back in distance for the one mile St. James's Palace Stakes which, with Ascot Racecourse being closed for redevelopment, was run at York. Ridden by Fallon, he finished third of the eight runners behind Shamardal and Ad Valorem. Oratorio raced over ten furlongs for the first time in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse on 2 July, when he was tested against older horses. The betting was dominated by Motivator, who started the 2/5 favourite, with his most serious opposition appearing to come from the New Zealand-bred five-year-old Starcraft. Fallon positioned Oratorio in third place as the lead was disputed by Motivator and Diomed Stakes winner Hazyview. In the straight. Motivator went two lengths clear, but Fallon produced Oratorio with a strong late challenge to catch the Derby winner 75 yards from the finish and win by half a length. Commenting the colt's improved performance, O'Brien explained \\"the horse has taken a long time to get here because he is unbelievably calm. All he does is eat and sleep at home but racing is bringing him on. We would run him every week if we could. His run in the Derby was just a mystery. He just wasn't right.\\" Fallon, who received a two-day ban for improper use of the whip on the winner said \\"I wasn't worried about the favourite. I thought if this guy gives me his best he can win,\\" and also pointed out that the colt was very well suited by the course and distance. Autumn Oratorio and Motivator met for the third time in the Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 10 September, when the field also included the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Azamour, the Irish Derby winner Grey Swallow and the leading racemare Alexander Goldrun. Fallon held the colt up towards the rear of the field before moving up to second place behind Motivator early in the straight. He repeated his performance from the Eclipse by overtaking the English-trained colt in the closing stages to win by half a length, with Alexander Goldrun in third and the favourite Azamour in fifth. In the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October, Oratorio was made favourite for the first time over a year when he started at odds of 9/4 in a field which included Alexander Goldrun, Alkaased, Rakti, Pride, Maraahel, Chic and David Junior. Fallon positioned the colt just behind the leaders but was unable to obtain a clear run and was forced to switch to the right inside the final furlong. Oratorio made ground in the closing stages but finished fourth of the fifteen runners, three and a quarter lengths behind David Junior. At the end of the month, Oratorio was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Classic at Belmont Park. Running on dirt for the first time he was never able to challenge the leaders and finished eleventh of the thirteen runners behind Saint Liam. Assessment In the 2005 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Oratorio was assessed at 123, making him the fourteenth best horse in the world, and the world's joint-best performer on turf in the Intermediate division. Stud record On his retirement from racing, Oratorio became a breeding stallion for the Coolmore Stud. He has been based in Ireland and was shuttled to Australia for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. Oratorio made a very promising start to his stud career, when two colts from his first crop of foals finished first and second in the 2009 Dewhurst Stakes. The best of his progeny to date include: *Beethoven (bay colt 2007), won Dewhurst Stakes, Desmond Stakes *Lolly for Dolly (bay filly 2007), won Windsor Forest Stakes *Torio's Quest (bay gelding 2007), won Queensland Guineas *Military Attack (bay gelding 2008), won Hong Kong Gold Cup, Queen Elizabeth II Cup, Singapore Airlines International Cup *Manawanui (bay gelding 2008), won Golden Rose Stakes, Stan Fox Stakes *Moonwalk in Paris (bay gelding 2008), won Prix Edmond Blanc *Temida (bay filly 2008), won Rheinland-Pokal *Conditions Apply (bay gelding 2008), raced but never placed. *Cherry Collect (bay filly 2009), won Oaks d'Italia *Biz the Nurse (bay colt 2010), won Derby Italiano, Gran Premio di Milano In August 2012 Oratorio was sold by Coolmore to the Avontuur Stud and moved to South Africa in 2013. Pedigree *Like all of Danehill's offspring Oratorio is inbred 4 × 4 to the mare Natalma. This means that she occurs twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Career Born in Broxburn, Scott was spotted by then-Colchester United manager Jock Wallace playing for Whitburn Junior. He had previously been on the books at Hamilton Academical and played for Linlithgow Rose. Colchester signed Scott at the midway point of the 1988–89 season, where until joining United he had scored 38 goals during the campaign for Whitburn. As a trialist, Scott impressed by scoring a hat-trick in a reserve team game, and later contributed five goals to steer Colchester away from relegation to the Football Conference in his first 12 games for the club. His debut came on 24 March 1989 in a goalless draw with Grimsby Town at Layer Road. His first goal came one week later, opening the scoring in a 3–0 win against Rochdale before being substituted for Stuart Hicks. The success of his first half-season with Colchester didn't transcend into the second, as he could only muster three goals in 14 starts and 11 substitute appearances for the club as they were relegated to the Conference. Scott failed to settle so far from his native Scotland, as he scored his eighth and final goal for the club in a 2–0 win over Gillingham on 23 February 1990 and played his last match on 29 April 1990, a 4–0 away defeat at Cambridge United where he came on as a substitute for Gary Bennett. In total, Scott made 37 league appearances for the U's, scoring eight times. Scott returned to Scotland with Scottish Football League side East Fife, where he made 205 league appearances between 1990 and 1997, scoring 79 goals. He then had a brief spell with Ayr United, where he amassed six goals in 18 appearances in the second half of the 1996–97 season. This prompted a move to Clyde, but he could only manage two goals in 15 league appearances, both of which came during a 4–3 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle. Scott made seven appearances for Forfar Athletic in the second half of the 1997–98 season, but failed to register a goal. He then returned to Whitburn Juniors where he ended his career.

In May 1910, his own election result was declared void, and he was unseated because of election irregularities by his constituency agent.

Life Pierre-André-Eugène Winter was born on 29 June 1891 in Asnières, Hauts-de-Seine. His father was Charles-Pierre Winter, a publicist and old collaborator of Georges Clemenceau, and his mother was Marie-Armande Duclois. He attended the lycée Charlemagne, and then was admitted to the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. In 1911 he was an extern of the Paris hospitals. During World War I (1914-1918) he was adjutant to the 46th battalion of Chasseurs Alpins. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Legion of Honour. In 1919 Winter became an intern in the Paris hospitals, and the next year become assistant to Dr. Clovis Vincent at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital. In 1925 he was named head of the oto-rhino-pharyngology clinic at the Paris faculty of medicine. He was also a founder of the center of medical diagnosis. Starting in the 1920s, as well as writing in the Gazette Médicale he contributed to various reviews including L'Esprit Nouveau (1920-1925). In 1921 he met Le Corbusier, and became the architect's friend and supporter. The right-wing Faisceau party was formed by Georges Valois in 1925 and began to break up the next year. Winter joined the Faisceau. In 1928 Winter and the lawyer Philippe Lamour (1903-1992), who had been expelled from the Faisceau, formed the Revolutionary Fascist party. They then formed the Plans group with the financial assistance of Jeanne Walter, wife of the wealthy architect Jean Walter. Several of the leaders of Plans had been followers of Georges Valois. Winter was a member of the editorial board of the avant-guarde urban planning journal Plans (1930-1932). Later he was one of the editors of Prelude (1932-1936), with Francois Pierrefeu (1891-1959), Hubert Lagardelle and Le Corbusier. Winter became a member of the international congress of modern architecture and president of the hygiene section of the assembly of constructors for an architectural renewal. During World War II (1939-1945) Winter and Marcel Martiny were appointed to the permanent committee on occupational medicine that was created in 1941. He died at Boulogne- Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine, on 29 June 1952. Views Winter advocated a national health program. He was against existing urban conditions, as was Le Corbusier. In an article in Valois's weekly Nouveau Siècle he described them as dirty, ugly, over-crowded and quickly deteriorating, lacking light, air and hygiene. He argued for healthy modern homes with open space and greenery for workers and their families. In the same paper he promoted the Plan Voisin for the reconstruction of Paris proposed by Le Corbusier. The fascist new order and Le Corbusier's new city were seen as complementary concepts. Writing in September 1926 Winter noted that Le Corbusier's use of reinforced concrete freed him from the constraints of old materials and concepts. His new architecture, with its pure lines, planes and volumes was a precursor of the fascist revolution. Some commentators see Winter's language as carrying racist concerns when he quoted Le Corbusier as saying urban congestion created a \\"zone of odours, [a] terrible and suffocating zone comparable to a field of gypsies crammed in their caravans amidst disorder and improvisation.\\" He failed to mention Le Corbusier's views on how social structure and class relations should be managed. Sport was important to Winter as a remedy to problems of the machine age. In a modern urban environment, sport let man continue the activity of the outdoor life for which his body was designed. In this area, Winter came close to the concepts of the \\"biological man\\" and eugenics. Praising Le Corbusier's modern dwellings, Winter said, \\"useless remains are disposed of, life leaves no traces, it does not hoard its waste products, does to wallow in dirt and disease.\\" Winter became interested in homeopathy, and in particular in acupuncture and Chinese medicine as practiced in France. He contributed the chapter on the Middle Ages to Laignel-Lavastines Histoire générale de la médecine (1938). In this he said that the sacred and profane sciences, for a long time considered part of a single body of knowledge, could be reunited. Medicine was a natural area in which this synthesis could occur. He was one of the closest in the French medical community to the philosopher René Guénon, and in 1938 created the Groupe d'études métaphysiques, inspired by Guénon. After the war, he founded the Groupe d'études des techniques mystiques et du yoga in 1946. This was very different from the Groupe d'études Métaphysiques, focused on medicine rather than on broader intellectual topics. Boris and Françoise Dolto were notable members. Winter carried on correspondence with the Swami Siddheshwarananda and the Orthodox father Kovalevsky. After his death on 1952 his group began to be called the Groupe Winter.

The town that grew up around the mine was named Rockland, probably for the rocky cliffs that surrounded the area. History Near Rockland was found gold in 1868, after the discoveries in Pine Grove. In 1870 Rockland had 150 inhabitants, several saloons and stores, post office. In the spring of 1871 miners didn't receive their salaries and all mining activities ceased. The credit for the founding of Rockland is given to a Mr. Keene, a Pine Grove resident. Gold was discovered in Rockland in 1868, shortly after discoveries were made at Pine Grove three miles to the northwest. By 1870 the town site had a population of around 150, and the town had several saloons, several stores, post office, and an express office. in the spring of next year the miners did not receive their pay and all mining operations ceased. A furious miner because of the situation set fire to the mill and was convicted of arson and was sent to the state prison in Carson City. The post office was closed in 1872. In the early 1900s, new miner activities took place in Rockland and the post office once more opened. The area stayed active through World War I, but was closed permanently in 1934. In all about $1 million was pulled out of the local mines over fifty years.

It was distinguished from earlier Roland biplane designs by the elimination of flying wires. Two later aircraft, also called LFG Roland D.XV, were completely different designs with slab sided fuselages. Design and development =The first D.XV version= The D.XV was the last LFG design to use the Klinkerrumpfe (clinker built fuselage) structure, which produced a round cross section fuselage with thin, overlapping, longitudinal spruce strips supported by a light wooden frame, used on a succession of fighter types beginning with the D.IV. Its wings had constant chord and blunt tips, mounted with more stagger than on their earlier designs. The D.XV was a cantilevered single bay biplane with a lower wing of shorter span than the upper, so the interplane struts leaned outwards. There were no bracing wires. The second prototype differed in having a broader chord, slightly greater span upper wing and narrower chord lower planes. The larger upper wing had a trailing edge cut-out to enhance vision from the cockpit, a feature absent from the first aircraft. A single I interplane strut on each side, broadly faired to the wings at top and bottom, replaced the earlier pairs. Only the upper wings carried ailerons. Both had a flush mounted radiator similar to those used in the Albatros D.V fighters mounted within the upper wing ahead of the pilot. Initially both prototypes of the D.XV were powered by Mercedes D.IIIa six cylinder in-line engines, mounted with the tops of the cylinders just exposed. This unit was later exchanged on the second prototype for a BMW IIIa on the same type, mounted within a more circular cross section, slender nose but with more of the cylinders visible. At the rear the tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage. The vertical tail was ovoid, with a broad, balanced rudder that extended down to a sizeable ventral fin which also carried a tailskid. The main fixed, conventional undercarriage had wheels on a single axle, mounted to the fuselage by V-struts. The first prototype flew before the end of April 1918 but came back to the factory for modifications the following month. The second flew that June. In September the Idflieg, who had originally requested three D.XVs, called for further alterations in response to their flight testing. The company responded with two examples of a completely different design, which retained the D.XV designation. =The redesigned D.XV= LFG Roland D.XV third prototype The third prototype of the D.XV had a completely different fuselage and empennage which dispensed with the molded wooden shell of previous Roland aircraft and used a more conventional fabric over frame construction typical of the period, although it tapered to a horizontal knife edge that doubled as the hinge for the single-piece overhung elevator. It was an unequal span, single bay biplane, with constant chord unswept wings separated by N-form interplane struts. The wing cellule was also redesigned compared to the earlier D.XVs. A radiator extended out from the leading edge of the top wing. The cabane structure was built up of four tubular steel vees which angled out from the fuselage to connect both upper and lower longerons to the upper wing spars. Overhung ailerons were used on the upper wing only. The fin carried a rounded, balanced rudder smoothly profiled with it, which bottomed well above the elevator. The undercarriage was similar to that of the first D.XVs.

Background Close was one of six children of a country physician, Edgar Close (1871-1948), originally from Carbondale in southern Illinois, and the former Mary Louvenia Patton (1873-1948), a native of Harrison in Boone County in northwestern Arkansas. Close was born in rural Robertsville near Morrilton in Conway County in north central Arkansas. Edgar and Mary Close married in 1891 and died in 1948 some eight months apart. In 1935, Carl Close married Sarah Ella Jordan (1907-1959) of Atkins in Pope County, Arkansas. Their son and only child, Carl Close, Jr., was born in 1936 in New Orleans. The junior Close graduated from Bolton High School in Alexandria and Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, was an officer in the United States Air Force, and worked as data processing specialist in Alexandria, where he died in 2000 at the age of sixty-three.Obituary of Carl Close, Jr., Alexandria Daily Town Talk, July 21, 2000 Close, Sr., subsequently married the former Ilie Jewel Willis (1907-1995). Political career Close served in the House during the administration of Governor Jimmie Davis alongside the two other at-large representatives from Rapides Parish, John R. Hunter, Jr., and C. H. \\"Sammy\\" Downs, later a state senator and a gubernatorial aide under John J. McKeithen. Close became mayor halfway into an unexpired term. He served with Commissioners Ben F. Bradford and W. H. Smith, who like Close was a former state representative. In 1948, Close attracted attention by discounting the debilitating effects of a drought in Central Louisiana.The Town Talk, June 10, 1948 Two weeks later, W. W. Thomas at the municipal airport seeded a cloud with forty pounds of dry ice.

Oddly, Close was succeeded in the House and as mayor by the same man, his fellow Democrat, W. George Bowdon, Jr., who held the mayoralty for sixteen years until his third-place finish in the 1969 Democratic primary. Ed Karst then defeated John K. Snyder for the position. Close, Bowdon, Karst, and Karst's successor, John K. Snyder, all served under the former city commission system, which was superseded in 1977 by the mayor- council home rule charter. Carroll E. Lanier in the spring of 1977 became the first mayor under the mayor-council government. Close died in Alexandria at the age of seventy-three. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park near Pineville, along with his first wife and son. His daughter-in-law, Betty Anne Reeves Close (born 1937) of Alexandria, and two grandsons survive.

The barony was one of the smallest, with four knight's fiefs attached to it.Miller (1921), pp. 71–72Bon (1969), pp. 107, 459 The first baron was G. (probably Guy) of Dramelay (or Trimolay, Tremolay) from the namesake village in Burgundy, who is attested in the 1209 Treaty of Sapienza. Many older histories, following Jean Alexandre Buchon and Karl Hopf, have Audebert de la Trémouille as the first baron.Topping (1975), p. 119 His successor, Robert of Dramelay, is attested ca. 1230. It was he who built the castle of Chalandritsa according to the Greek and Italian versions of the Chronicle of the Morea. The Aragonese version of the Chronicle on the other hand reports a completely different story, according to which the castle of Chalandritsa had been built by Conrad of Aleman, Baron of Patras, and that it and other lands, comprising eight knight's fiefs, were purchased around 1259 by Prince William II of Villehardouin and given to a knight named Guy of Dramelay, who had only recently arrived in the Morea. While otherwise reliable, the Aragonese version is considered erroneous in this regard.Bon (1969), pp. 107–108 Robert's successor, Guy (II) of Dramelay (the Aragonese version's Guy), is known to have enlarged the barony by acquiring parts of the Lisarea as well as the neighbouring fief of Mitopoli (in 1280), served as bailli of the Principality for Charles I of Naples in 1282–85, and died shortly after.Bon (1969), pp. 106 note 2, 459 He was succeeded by his unnamed daughter and her husband, George I Ghisi, who was killed at the Battle of Cephissus in 1311.Bon (1969), pp. 183, 234–235, 459 The last baron of the family was Nicholas of Dramelay, whose exact familial relation with the other Dramelays is unknown. Like most Achaean magnates, he initially supported the infante Ferdinand of Majorca's bid for the princely throne in 1315, but switched back to Matilda of Hainaut when she arrived in the Morea in early 1316. He died a few weeks later, and Chalandritsa was occupied by Ferdinand's troops, who defended it with success against an attack by Matilda's husband, Louis of Burgundy.Bon (1969), pp. 192–193, 235, 459Topping (1975), pp. 112–113, 119 According to the Assizes of Romania, Nicholas' fief of Mitopoli was divided between Aimon of Rans and an otherwise unidentified Margaret of Cephalonia. According to the Aragonese version of the Chronicle of the Morea, however, after his victory over Ferdinand at the Battle of Manolada, Louis gave the entire vacant barony to two of his Burgundian followers, the aforementioned Aimon of Rans and his brother, Otho. Otho died soon after, and Aimon sold the domain to Martino Zaccaria, Lord of Chios, and returned to his homeland.Bon (1969), pp. 235, 459Topping (1975), pp. 119–120 The barony thereafter remained in the hands of the Zaccaria, although in a letter of 1324, half of it appears to be in the hands of Peter dalle Carceri. By 1361, however, Martino's son, Centurione I Zaccaria, is attested as holding the entire barony.Bon (1969), pp. 205, 235–236, 460 He and his descendants retained it until 1429, when Centurione II Zaccaria was forced to hand it over to Thomas Palaiologos, the Byzantine Despot of the Morea, after a brief siege. Centurione was also forced to marry his daughter Catherine to Thomas, and retreated to his only remaining possession, the Barony of Arcadia, where he died in 1432.Bon (1969), pp. 292–293, 460Topping (1975), p. 165 References Sources  * Category:States and territories established in 1209 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1429 Category:Medieval Achaea Category:Baronies of the Principality of Achaea ","title":"Barony of Chalandritsa"},{"id":"39862624","text":"Common Ground Main Stage The Common Ground Music Festival is an annual week- long music festival that takes place in downtown Lansing, Michigan.

The house is on a corner of Kings Square.  History  The dragons at night Commissioned in 1900 by Francisco Cerni González, Mayor of Ceuta between 1897 and 1903, in partnership with his brother Ricardo, the building was designed by Valencian architect José M. Cortina Pérez and completed in 1905. Perez was an eclectic architect who designed the bottom of the building from artificial stone, and as a pièce de résistance adorned the roof with bronze dragons. The house is on the corner of Paseo de Camoens and Millán Astray Street in Kings Square. The building was meant to take the name of the Cerni González brothers, but it became known as the House of the Dragons. This is a similar name to one of the architect‘s 1901 works in his home town of Valencia which is called the Building of the Dragons . The Valencia house also incorporates dragons, although more subtly, which also gives that house its name.Images of the House of Dragons, Mary Ann Sullivan, bluffton.edu, accessed 9 July 2013 The next owners of the house were the sons of Ricardo Cerni González. The Spanish Falange party had their offices here after the 1936 revolution. The house was sold in 1946. The facade was repaired at the expense of Salomón Benhamú Roffé in 1973 and 1996. The original dragons were removed in 1925 and lost, but four new dragons has been designed by Antonio Romero Vallejo. Made largely of resin and fiberglass which is painted to appear bronze, the new dragons consequently weigh less than 200 kg each. They were installed and formally opened in November 2006. Vallejo is a local artist who was born in 1958. He is also responsible for the bronze Tribute to the Artillery which is outside the walls on Avenida Martinez Catena in Ceuta.

It was founded in 1893 and cultivated over land for sheep farming and private factories like Puerto Bories to process, freeze and export sheep meat. History In 1881, the Treaty of Boundaries was negotiated between Argentina and Chile to settle overlapping boundary dispute to Patagonia, which had occurred when each country gained their independence from Spain. By 1886, José Nogueira, a Portuguese shipping magnate, had begun to plan a ranching enterprise for the area. He leased 180,000 hectares of Fuegian land in April 1889 and in November, his brother-in-law, Mauricio Braun acting as Nogueira's agent, leased an additional 170,000 hectares of land. In 1890, Nogueira and his wife, Sara Braun, secured a lease from President José Manuel Balmaceda's administration on 1/3 of the available land in Tierra del Fuego, containing 1,009,000 hectares. A condition of the last lease was that Nogueira establish a Chilean business to manage the land. As he was Portuguese and his wife was Latvian, Nogueira made a deal with Ramón Serrano Montaner to sell him 1/3 of the lease, at cost, in exchange for Serrano's recruitment of Chilean investors. Before they were able to finalize the organization of the business, Nogueira died, leaving his vast estate to his wife. Upon her husband's death, Braun contacted her brother Mauricio to determine what to do about the lease assignment of Serrano. Both siblings agreed that Serrano's involvement complicated the business venture and after a lengthy negotiation, Braun was able to secure Serrano's exchange of his lease rights for 100 shares in the business. On 31 August 1893, the Sociedad Explotadora de Tierra del Fuego (Exploitation Society of Tierra del Fuego) was founded by the Braun siblings with the major shareholders being Sara Braun; her brother Mauricio and other family members; Juan Blanchard, a partner in the firm Braun & Blanchard; and Peter H. McClelland, the head of the firm Duncan, Fox & Co Ltd. This group controlled slightly less than 1/2 of the shares to meet the requirement that the business venture have a majority of Chilean participants. Among the remaining shareholders were Serrano, Juan and Gustavo Oehninger, Cruz Daniel Ramírez, and Guillermo Wilms, who each owned 100 shares of the stock and various minor shareholders from Magallanes and Valparaíso. Initially the company was involved in sheep raising and land speculation, but as their desire to obtain additional land in Argentine Patagonia grew they recruited José Menéndez and his son-in-law, Francisco Campos to join in the venture. Initially the Braun and Menéndez families were business rivals, but in 1895, Menéndez would become Mauricio's father-in-law when Braun married Menéndez's his daughter, Josefina. While the investors varied over time, until her death de Nogueira remained the largest individual shareholder in the association. While the business acquisitions created an oligarchical group which controlled production and development of southern Chile, it also displaced the original inhabitants of those lands. Fences created obstacles for the nomadic life of the Selk'nam people and introduction of sheep herds displaced their main food source, the guanaco. Facing starvation and with no concept of ownership, they began to steal livestock. The Exploitation Society asked and received permission from the Chilean government to remove the indigenous population from the area. Menéndez gave orders for the extermination of the Selk'nam, paying a bounty for each death. Repression against the Selk'nam peoples, who now numbered only roughly a hundred, continued after the genocide. Chile moved the remaining Selk'nam people to Dawson Island, where they were placed into concentration camps. Argentina eventually allowed Salesian missionaries to aid the Selk'nam and attempt to culturally assimilate them, with their traditional culture and livelihoods at this point completely destroyed. Under agrarian reforms in the 1960s, the society changed its name in 1964 to Ganadera Tierra del Fuego S.A. and was dissolved officially in 1973.

It was built to the design of Giacomo Quarenghi in the 1780s. A few months before her death, Catherine the Great presented the edifice to Prince Nikolai Saltykov, the tutor of her eldest grandsons.  History  Catherine the Great initially granted the land to her personal secretary Pyotr Soimonov who soon sold it to the merchant Philipp Grootten (1748-1815). The latter asked Giacomo Quarenghi to build him the mansion whose neo-classical façade can still be seen from across the Neva.Simon Dixon, Personality and Place in Russian Culture, MHRA, 2010, pages 331 à 335. In 1793 Grootten sold the mansion to another merchant, Thomas Sievers, who sold it on to Princess Ekaterina Petrovna Bariatynskaia. The Neva frontage The opposite (South) façade In 1796, the mansion became the property of Count (later Prince) Nikolai Saltykov (Nicholas Soltikoff), the interim head of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. For more than a century (from 1796 to 1918) the mansion remained the property of the Saltykov family. In 1828 the Saltykovs rented the mansion out fully furnished. It was leased by the Austrian government as its embassy in the Russian capital. From September 1831, for a period of eleven years the Saltykov Mansion was the residence of the Austrian ambassador Charles-Louis de Ficquelmont (1777-1857). The Saltykov Mansion became the venue for two of the most famous salons of the period: in the evenings the one hosted by Filquemont's wife Dolly (1804-1863) and in the mornings another hosted by her mother Elisabeth Khitrovo (Kutuzov's daughter). The Count was recalled to Vienna in 1840, but the Austrian government continued to rent the Saltykov Mansion until 1855. Later, the second and the third floors were rented by the Danish diplomat Otten Plessen. In 1863, the British government leased the Saltykov Mansion and it became the British Embassy until 1918.  Architecture  The Saltykov Mansion is situated in central Saint Petersburg. It stands on Suvorov Square by Trinity Bridge between the south bank of the Neva and the Field of Mars. Its official address is 4, Palace Embankment. The building fronts Palace Embankment and has its back on Millionnaya Street. Water frontage on the Neva was highly prized by the Russian aristocracy, while Millionnaya Street was considered one of the Russian Empire's grandest addresses. The façade is a remarkable example of Palladian architecture in Russia. This style, imported by foreign architects, especially during the reign of Empress Catherine II, had become very fashionable with Russian nobility by the 1780s when the mansion was built. The façade is shaped with great simplicity, combining harmonic proportions and moderate ornamentation that highlight few decorative elements, such as the piano nobile balcony facing the Neva and the palace's pediments.

He was a Knight of the French National Order of Merit in 1991. Life and career Bidermann was born in Anderlecht, the son of Tauba (Rodstein) and Joseph Zylberberg, a restaurateur. His parents were from Poland. Being Jewish, he lived along with his sister Evelyne from 1941 to 1943 with a Christian family in Aix-en-Provence; while his sister Regina was hidden in a convent. In 1943, the German police detained him and he was sent to a clinic in Bandol due to health problems. In 1946, Maurice Zylberberg arrived in Paris. In 1948 he left Paris and voyaged to Israel and joined the Israel Defense Forces for 18 months but returned to France to work in a food factory. In April 1950, he entered the business of textiles and clothing of his uncle George Bidermann. Bidermann quickly introduced new technical manufacturing processes and personnel management revolutionizing the textile industry. These innovations allowed the company Bidermann to reach a production level unrivalled in Europe, paving the way for export. In 1966 he signed an agreement with the Soviet Union on 310,000 menswear. In France, the Bidermann group then had the licensing models menswear brands Yves Saint Laurent, Daniel Hechter, Daniel Cremieux and André Courrèges. In the United States, the Bidermann Group acquired the brandsand?Calvin Klein sportswear men, and Ralph Lauren women's wear. The family business that employed 60 people in 1950 became twenty-five years later an industry group of some thirty factories employing about 18,000 people across the world (12,000 foreign and 6,000 in Europe). The Iraq War and new competition disrupted the growth of Bidermann Group experiencing difficulties that required it to restructure its production, both French and American. Maurice Bidermann preferred to save jobs and tried to revive the group through acquisitions in the 1990s including the farm's brands Burberry, Arrow and Gold Toe licenses. However, in 1995 Maurice Bidermann was forced to cede part of his French group to the Deveaux Group. =Elf Case= Bidermann was sentenced to three years in prison, two suspended and fined one million euros for the leaders of \\"abuse of corporate assets, the misuse of corporate assets to expense Elf, presenting false accounts \\"and\\" spreading false information \\"on the consolidated statements of Bidermann group\\" in 1992. Philanthropy Maurice Bidermann contributed to the development of the spirit of cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples such as supporting NGOs like Action against Hunger, or the Museum of Warsaw in Poland, the country of origin of his parents. In 1974 he created the Association of Friends of French university AFBGU (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev), the development of a program between Jewish and Muslim students at the University of Haifa, development and training of mediators and a training school for teachers at the University of Tel Aviv, the creation of the Lycée Franco-Israeli Raymond Leven in Tel Aviv or the granting of micro-credits for projects involving Israelis and Palestinians.

It was founded in 1965 as the Federation of Debate Clubs and renamed in 1969. It inspired various offshoots, including Devrimci Yol, the Revolutionary Workers and Peasants Party of Turkey, and the Kurdistan Workers' Party. Dev-Genç members set U.S. Ambassador Robert Komer's car on fire in 1969 while he was visiting an Ankara university campus.

The book was first published in German on August 1, 1998, through Arche Verlag and follows a romance between a nameless older man and Agnes, a young woman that is almost half his age. Of the book, Stamm commented that he saw the book's landscape and climate as an important way of setting the tone for the novel and its characters. The book has been adapted into a radio play and in 2012, Agnes was adapted into a stage play by Christian Papke. Synopsis The book takes place in Chicago and is told through the eyes of a narrator whose name is never given and begins with him announcing that Agnes is dead. He then recalls how he had first met Agnes at the Chicago Public Library in April, nine months prior to the novel's beginning. The two hit it off and eventually have sex, with Agnes telling him that it is her first time. Agnes and the narrator go through a series of everyday events, eventually culminating in her getting pregnant. He doesn't want the baby and suggests an abortion, much to Agnes's dismay. She leaves him and he's left heartbroken. The two eventually reunite after she grows ill and miscarries, but the loss takes an irreversible toll on their relationship. But one of the main themes in the novel is the story that Agnes wants the narrator to write. He starts of by writing their story so far: how they met, how they fell in love and so on. But when he reaches the present he keeps on writing. He decides what Agnes should wear, what they should eat and even what they should say. Agnes plays along at first, obeying everything that the narrator writes in 'their story'. But when Agnes tells the narrator that she's pregnant the reality and the narrator's story start to drift apart. The narrator actually tries to 'fix reality' in his writing. This ultimately leads to the end of the relationship, after which the narrator seems to have a mental breakdown while it's completely unclear what happens to Agnes.

Born in Vero Beach, Florida, Lamb grew up as a child who loved playing music, specializing in the tuba. He left high school to join the United States Air Force as a musician for their military band. He was stationed in Texas and then Montana, where the long winters left him ample time to practice. When the band's usual string bass player was unavailable for a gig in 1951, the bandmaster asked Lamb if he could play the bass; Lamb immediately said yes, and before long became the band's new string bassist. He credited his tuba experience for giving him the \\"feel\\" to pick up string bass quickly without any prior experience. Lamb joined Duke Ellington's orchestra in 1964, and toured with them for three years. Lamb was more of a fan of Miles Davis and Red Garland when he was with Ellington, later saying, “I was very young and very cocky. I thought I knew more than Duke at that time...I have more time today to reflect on the things that were accomplished back then, and the places we traveled to and all the wonderful people that we met. So one has to be careful what one does in his young years, because if they’re fortunate to live long, it all comes back.” In 1966 Lamb performed with Ellington and Sam Woodyard for artist Joan Miró at the Fondation Maeght in Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Lamb later moved to St. Petersburg, Florida and taught music in public schools as well as St. Petersburg College. Alphonso Johnson was one of Lamb's students. Lamb was awarded the Jazz Club of Sarasota’s “Satchmo Award” for service to jazz.

It was originally termed as an offshoot of Japan's Western-influenced \\"new music\\", but came to include a wide range of styles associated with the country's leisure class and nascent economic boom, such as AOR, soft rock, R&B;, funk, and boogie. It was also identified with new technologies such as the Walkman, cars with built-in cassette decks and FM stereos, and various electronic musical instruments. There is no unified consensus among scholars regarding the definition of city pop. In Japan, the tag simply referred to music that projected an \\"urban\\" feel and whose target demographic was urbanites. Many of the artists did not embrace the Japanese influences of their predecessors, and instead, largely drew from American soft rock, boogie, and funk. Some examples may also feature tropical flourishes or elements taken from disco, jazz fusion, Okinawan, Latin and Caribbean music. Singer-songwriter Tatsuro Yamashita, who was among the genre's pioneers and most successful artists, is sometimes called the \\"king\\" of city pop. City pop lost mainstream appeal after the 1980s and was widely derided by younger generations of Japanese as \\"shitty pop\\". In the early 2010s, partly through the instigation of music-sharing blogs and Japanese reissues, city pop gained an international online following as well as becoming a touchstone for the sample-based microgenres known as vaporwave and future funk. Definitions Definitions of \\"city pop\\" have varied and many of the artists tagged with the genre have played in styles that are significantly different from each other. Yutaka Kimura, an author of numerous books about city pop, defined the genre as \\"urban pop music for those with urban lifestyles.\\" In 2015, Ryotaro Aoki wrote in The Japan Times: Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone concurred that city pop was \\"less a strict genre term than a broad vibe classification.\\" According to Japan Archival Series supervisor Yosuke Kitazawa, there \\"were no restrictions on style or a specific genre that we wanted to convey with these songs\\" but that it \\"was music made by city people, for city people.\\" Kitazawa identified two distinct styles that exemplified city pop: \\"the former a lush, tropical romp, the latter a thumping rug-cutter\\". Pitchforks Joshua Minsoom Kim called it \\"a vague descriptor for Japanese music that incorporated jazz and R&B;\\", while PopMatters Chris Ingalls categorized it as \\"a type of soft rock/AOR/funk\\". Wax Poetics Ed Motta offered, \\"City Pop is really AOR and soft rock but with some funk and boogie too. Because when you hear funkier City Pop tunes, you hear not only the influence, but in some parts they steal from groups like Skyy, BB&Q; Band, and those kinda American boogie and funk groups.\\" An Electronic Beats writer characterized city pop as Japan's \\"answer to synth pop and disco\\". Musical origins Musically, city pop applies relatively advanced songwriting and arranging techniques – such as major seventh and diminished chords – that are drawn directly from the American soft rock of the era (bands such as Steely Dan and the Doobie Brothers). Yutaka cited the band Happy End as \\"ground zero\\" for the genre, whereas Motta traces it to the mid-1970s with the work of Haruomi Hosono and Tatsuro Yamashita. Vice contributor Rob Arcand similarly credited Hosono as a \\"key influence\\" on city pop. In the mid-1970s, Hosono founded the band Tin Pan Alley, which fused southern R&B;, northern soul and jazz fusion with Hawaiian and Okinawan tropical flourishes. In the view of Fact Mags Mikey I.Q. Jones, this led to the style of music that would be dubbed \\"city pop\\". The genre became closely tied to the tech boom in Japan during the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the Japanese technologies which influenced city pop included the Walkman, cars with built-in cassette decks and FM stereos, and various electronic musical instruments such as the Casio CZ-101 and Yamaha CS-80 synthesizers and Roland TR-808 drum machine. According to Blistein, electronic instruments and gadgets \\"allowed musicians to actualise the sounds in their heads\\" and cassette decks \\"allowed fans to dub copies of albums\\". According to Blistein: \\"An opulent amalgamation of pop, disco, funk, R&B;, boogie, jazz fusion, Latin, Caribbean and Polynesian music, the genre was inextricably tied to a tech-fueled economic bubble and the wealthy new leisure class it created.\\" Popularity City pop became a distinct regional genre that peaked in popularity during the 1980s. According to Vice, the most popular figures of the genre were \\"accomplished composers and producers in their own right, with artists like Tatsuro Yamashita and Toshiki Kadomatsu incorporating complex arrangements and songwriting techniques into their hits, ... The booming economy also made it easier for them to get label funding\\". Yamashita is sometimes referred to as the \\"king\\" of city pop. The genre lost mainstream appeal after the 1980s. In the description of Kitazawa, \\"Many Japanese people who grew up with this kind of music considered city pop as cheesy, mainstream, disposable music, going so far as calling it 'shitty pop'.\\" Since the 2010s, city pop has seen a resurgence with artists such as Mariya Takeuchi gaining an international online following, as well as becoming a touchstone for the sample-based microgenres known as vaporwave and future funk. Kim credited \\"Blogspot blogs and Japanese reissues\\" circa 2010 with \\"introduc[ing] music nerds to a strain of AOR, funk, disco, and yacht rock trafficked under the amorphous term ... The music had largely been neglected by Westerners and derided by many Japanese as cheesy, but as YouTube algorithms launched songs into the wider collective consciousness, city pop surged in popularity ...\\" In 2020, The Japan Times contributor Patrick St. Michel reported that, \\"Abroad, boutique labels are reissuing rare records or releasing compilations, though millions have largely experienced city pop through songs such as [Takeuchi's 1984 song] \\"Plastic Love\\" or the seemingly endless playlists backed by anime snippets on YouTube.\\" See also *List of city pop artists * Yuppie References External links  Further reading * Category:Japanese styles of music Category:Soft rock Category:1970s in Japanese music Category:1980s in Japanese music Category:Music in Tokyo Category:J-pop ","title":"City pop"},{"id":"39863064","text":"Paul Shinners (born 8 January 1959) is a preacher, exorcist, spiritual healer, proponent of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act and former footballer who played as a forward in the Football League for Gillingham, Colchester United and Leyton Orient. Career Born in Westminster, London, Shinners began his career at Southern League club Fisher Athletic, where he hit over 200 goals and finished as the league's top scorer in the 1983–84 season, alerting Gillingham who signed Shinners in October 1984. Shinners also holds the Fisher Athletic record of most career goals for the club with 205 goals scored. Shinners made just four appearances for Gillingham in the 1984–85 season, starting just one game. Colchester United manager Cyril Lea took Shinners on loan in March 1985, with his debut delayed until mid-April due to injury. His debut finally came on 16 April 1985 in a 1–1 away draw at Torquay United. Shinners scored one goal in six games for the U's, coming in the penultimate game of the season, a 3–2 defeat to Port Vale at Layer Road on 6 May 1985. Shinners left Gillingham for Leyton Orient in the summer of 1985 where he was top scorer for the club in his first season with 19 goals in all competitions. Following this, he suffered numerous injuries, rounding off his stint with the O's with 32 goals in 77 league games. He then joined Conference side Barnet in January 1989, later becoming a fitness education consultant after hanging up his boots. After selling dance machines to schools in conjunction with Pulse Fitness, Shinners now runs a café and Christian bookshop in St Neots, Cambridgeshire under the umbrella of his \\"Passion for Souls Ministries\\" charity. He has made frequent trips to Africa (particularly Uganda) over the last decade as an Evangelical preacher. He was embroiled in controversy regarding a trip to Uganda in December 2012, when Ugandan newspaper, The Daily Monitor,http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Calls-to-pass-the-anti-gays- Bill-dominate-New-Year-messages-/-/688334/1655670/-/11vv8ob/-/index.html alleged that he had spoken in favour of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Act, 2014 also known as the \\"Kill the Gays\\" Bill. Shinners denied his involvement and support for the Bill, however video footage later came to light that proved he supported the death penalty for homosexuals.

Beginnings A dip in the jet stream over the Plains states brought a continuous flow of tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico and East Pacific into the southeastern United States. Meanwhile, a large ridge of high pressure over the Western United States combined with another in the North Atlantic Ocean to block the pattern on July 2. By the morning of July 3, heavy rains were falling over western Georgia and the Atlanta metropolitan area along with the Florida Panhandle. On July 4, the low pressure retrograded to southwest Missouri, allowing another band of heavy rain to develop over northwest Alabama and Middle Tennessee. The following day, heavy showers and rainbands developed across Alabama, eastern Mississippi and the Florida panhandle.https://weather.com/news/news/stalled-weather- pattern-flooding-heat-20130702?pageno=2#/1http://earthsky.org/earth/wet- july-4-for-some-as-heavy-rains-inundate-u-s-southeast Impacts =Georgia= Several inches of rain fell across north and west Georgia on July 3, leading to flash flooding and washing out roads in parts of the Atlanta metropolitan area. Water briefly covered the road at the intersection of Interstate 75 and 285. Creeks ran out of their banks in some areas of North Georgia, causing many roads to be shut down overnight. =Florida= Heavy rainfall in excess of 10 inches led to severe flash flooding over the Florida Panhandle. Homes were inundated and roads were washed out in Bay and Washington counties, including Panama City, and evacuations were required in some areas. Also, strong winds caused rip currents on the coast that caught several swimmers off guard, leading to dozens of water rescues along the Florida gulf coast. On July 5, a waterspout came ashore as a tornado in Destin, causing minimal damage.http://www.sandyscenes.com/july-4-2013-epic- flood =Alabama= Minor street flooding was reported in the Birmingham area on the evening of July 3. Flash floods occurred across northwestern Alabama, including the Huntsville area, on July 4. Many roads throughout Huntsville and Madison were flooded and closed. Severe flooding was reported in Hartselle as well, where authorities closed a portion of State Route 36 and several side streets. Flash flooding and mudslides were reported in Winston County. In addition, heavy winds blew down trees in extreme southeastern Alabama on Thursday afternoon. Several towns across Alabama cancelled or postponed Independence Day festivities due to the rain and flooding. On July 5, heavy rains once again formed over West Alabama. Street flooding was reported in Tuscaloosa. That evening, extremely heavy rainfall once again led to widespread flooding across northwest Alabama. Significant flash flooding affected Haleyville and covered sections of State Route 13 in the town with over one foot of water. Roads were also shut down due to floodwaters in Brilliant.http://www.10tv.com/article/flood-waters-damage-homes-businesses- central-ohio =North Carolina= Floods were reported in the Asheville area on both July 3 and 4. Several roads were closed. Flash floods also occurred in the southwestern part of the state on July 4. Flash flooding struck Asheboro during the evening of July 5. =Mississippi= During the early morning hours of July 5, flash flooding closed roads and inundated homes in Wayne County in the far southeast portion of the state. Dozens of homes were evacuated due to rising waters. Heavy rains fell on the afternoon of July 5, producing floods that covered 40 streets and closed several county roads in and around Columbus.http://www.breakingnews.com/item/2013/07/06/at-least-40-streets- closed-due-to-flash-flooding-i/ =South Carolina= Flash flooding prompted several road closures around Greenville on July 4. One person was killed in Gaffney due to high winds from flood-producing thunderstorms. =Kentucky= Heavy rains over central Kentucky caused flash flooding on July 4. During the afternoon and evening, rural roads were inundated with floodwaters. Rains redeveloped on July 5, leading to flooding in downtown Campbellsville. Heavy rains once again fell on July 6, causing severe flash flooding in the Frankfort area. Homes and businesses were inundated, and numerous roads were submerged. Later in the morning, flooding spread to the Cincinnati metropolitan area with many creeks and small rivers running out of their banks. =Tennessee= The heavy rain on July 5 caused street flooding in the Nashville metropolitan area. Minor flooding also affected Montgomery County in the late evening hours. Another flash flood event occurred in the Mount Juliet area (east of Nashville) in early August.https://mjpdnews.org/2013/08/08/mt- juliet-police-respond-to-flash-flooding/ =Virginia= Life-threatening flooding also occurred in Roanoke, Virginia on July 10 and 11.http://floodlist.com/america/usa/roanoke-july-2013 See also *January 2013 Southeastern United States floods *2009 Southeastern United States floods References Category:2013 floods Category:2013 in Alabama Category:2013 in Florida Category:2013 in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:2013 in Kentucky Category:2013 in Mississippi Category:2013 in North Carolina Category:2013 in South Carolina Category:2013 in Tennessee 2013 Southeastern United States floods 2013 Southeastern United States floods ","title":"July 2013 Southeastern United States floods"},{"id":"39863129","text":"Bleed Between The Lies is the debut album by British alt-metal band, Never A Hero. It was recorded at Monkey Puzzle House Studios in Woolpit and Mad Hat M2 Studios in Wolverhampton. On their YouTube channel, there are several videos documenting the band's recording sessions. Background Originally titled Theatre of Disaster, the album saw many changes from its conception in 2010. Due to line-up changes and style changes, many of the songs on the album were dropped or re-written for release. Half of the album had been composed by the band while ex-member Toby C was still present but after his departure the group had around 6 months before recording to write the other half of the album. This can explain the eclectic mix of songs and genres present on the record. The majority of pre-production was done by Toby C in his studio Fat Nelly Recording Studios and in Drummer Daisy’s bedroom with a mac-book and pro-tools. Style and themes Almost all of the album is played in standard or drop-D tuning apart from Sunbeam and Untouchable in which rhythm parts are in drop-Csharp. Experimenting with electronics was always present in the band’s previous endeavours but the arrival of dance music techniques (dubstep wub wubs, more elaborate synth lines) became forefront for some of the more heavier tracks. Lyrically, the themes range from anger aimed at certain individuals to stories about abuse, tales from beyond the grave and most notably the band’s reaction to criticism on YouTube.

Life Spitzer was born in Đakovo on 18 October 1892 to a Jewish family. From his early youth, he was a member of the Zionist and Jewish organizations in Croatia. He co-founded in Zagreb, in 1919, together with Aleksandar Licht and other Zionists the \\"Union of the Jewish confessional municipalities in the Kingdom of SHS\\" (Savez jevrejskih vjeroispovjednih općina u Kraljevini SHS), later known as \\"Federation of Jewish confessional communities of Yugoslavia\\" (Savez jevrejskih vjeroispovjednih općina Jugoslavije - SJVOJ). In 1937 he was elected general secretary of the \\"SJVOJ\\". Spitzer election induced the rebellion among the Jews from the Jewish communities Sarajevo and Belgrade who favored their own nominee, Sarajevo born Jew Mihael Levi. All Sarajevo and some Belgrade members of the central committee of the SJVOJ have resigned. They all asked that Spitzer, who was an nominee of the Jewish community Zagreb, resignes. Leadership of the SJVOJ insisted on Spitzer election. In 1937 Spitzer protesed at the office of Žika Simonović, Minister of Justice in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, against the antisemitic articles in the newspapers such as: \\"Balkan\\", \\"Mlada Hrvatska\\", \\"Erwache\\" and \\"Sturm\\". He also made an outcry toward the fact that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion are, again, distributed freely. As early as 1933, and especially after the Anschluss in 1938, the expulsion of Jewish citizens became eminent. During the 1930s Spitzer and other notable members of the Jewish community Zagreb helped the refugee Jews from Austria and Nazi Germany. He headed the refugee relief committee in Belgrade. Spitzer and \\"Federation of Jewish confessional communities of Yugoslavia\\" cared for 11,200 refugee Jews. After the outbreak of World War II Jews from the Nazi Germany were strictly forbidden to directly immigrate into Mandatory Palestine. As Jews born in Austria and Germany they were considered, by the British authorities, enemy aliens. Only refugees who had already reached a neutral country were able to obtain an immigration papers. On 31 December 1939 three Yugoslav excursion boats, \\"Car Nikola\\", \\"Car Dušan\\" and \\"Kraljica Marija\\" were carrying refugees to a winter harbor in the city of Kladovo when the Danube river froze. On 22 September 1940 the refugees reached the Šabac in Serbia. There, under Spitzer leadership, ongoing aid was provided to the group. Spitzer tried desperately to obtain passage for the refugees and immigration certificates, so that they could legally proceed to Mandatory Palestine. Unfortunately, after the Axis occupation of Serbia in 1941, most of the refugees were murdered by the German occupation forces. Out of 1,400 Jewish refugees, only 200 to 280 survived. In October 1941 Spitzer was murdered at the Banjica concentration camp. He was survived by his wife who later made Aliyah to Israel.

In the Tour de France, a team of four podium girls is employed by the race's main sponsor, the French bank LCL S.A. They are responsible for entertaining clients of the sponsors before the morning departure of the race and in parties after the end of the race, but their most visible and prestigious role is in the award ceremony at the close of each day's racing. The job requires working long hours in all weather conditions but is well-paid and sought-after, with candidates selected on the basis of their looks, endurance, personalities, and linguistic abilities. Although they are forbidden to interact with the riders, other than kissing them in the award ceremonies, several podium girls have ended up marrying cyclists. The employment of podium girls has prompted a certain amount of criticism about sexism in professional cycling, though current and former podium girls have defended their role as part of the sport's traditions. Role The women work as ambassadors for the race's sponsors, serving drinks and snacks to clients and VIPs in the morning, presenting prizes in the afternoon and hosting parties in the evening. According to one Tour de France podium girl, Anne-Marie, \\"we start every day between 6 am and 7 am. We're present in the 'departure village' at the LCL stand to attend the departure of the caravan and the race.\\" During the awards ceremony at the end of each stage, two of the women, working in pairs on alternate days, present the winning riders with their jerseys and prizes and give them a kiss on the cheek. In the evening, says Anne-Marie, \\"we often host parties for LCL with gifts to win.\\" The most prestigious part of a podium girl's Tour is the final presentation ceremony in Paris, which is seen worldwide in photographs and on television. However, only two of the four women get to carry out the ceremony. According to Sophie Moressee-Pichot of LCL, the decision on which women to select comes down to \\"who will photograph the best on that day, and some women might have a pimple or might look tired in the eyes.\\" Selection criteria Danilo Napolitano is applauded by the podium girls on the 2007 Tour of Poland Podium girls were originally selected from the population of the town where each day's finishing stage was held, and the only requirements were for them to be under 30 and about the same height as each other. Today, they are selected from applications put forward by modelling agencies or individual applicants. The women are chosen by the sponsors of the four coloured racing jerseys (yellow, green, polka dot, and white) awarded to those leading in particular categories. Although the hours are long – often over 12 hours per day and in all weather conditions – the job is well-paid, at a rate of about €1,000–2,000 for three weeks' work, and food and accommodation are provided. The women are selected not just for their looks but for their endurance, personality and linguistic abilities. Many are students; in the 2009 Tour de France, three of the four were students. One woman, Elisabeth Petzl, was a doctoral candidate in political science who could speak four languages. Laura Antoine, a former showgirl from Paris who worked as a podium girl in the 2010 Tour de France, was chosen because of \\"her upbeat personality, her willingness to work long hours without complaint and her ability to speak French and English\\". According to Laura, \\"They asked me if I could share a bathroom with two other girls for a month and if I could drive a car up a mountain if I needed to. Then they asked me about my endurance level and if I could smile even if I’m tired. And I said I could work all day, with a smile. I quickly realized that hey, this isn’t as glamorous as I thought it was.\\" Relationship with the riders Peter Sagan embraces two podium girls on the 2010 Tour de Romandie The podium girls are only allowed very limited interaction with the riders; they can present prizes and jerseys, help the riders put the jerseys on, and kiss the riders on their cheeks, but are not allowed to talk with them. Transgressions are a disciplinary offence for both sides; during the 2003 Tour de France, one of the podium girls, Melanie Simonneau, was dismissed accepting a note from rider George Hincapie, while in April 2013 Slovak cyclist Peter Sagan videoed an apology after he pinched the buttocks of Tour of Flanders podium girl Maya Leye during an awards ceremony. Following Simonneau's departure from the Tour, she eventually married Hincapie and now has two children with him. Hincapie admits that he \\"pretty much ended up chasing her throughout the entire Tour de France,\\" though she told him that she was \\"totally not allowed to talk to you.\\" Nonetheless, they began exchanging text messages and meeting in the departure villages before she was given an ultimatum to choose Hincapie or the job. She chose Hincapie, left the Tour three days before the finish, and now says that it was \\"the best thing I ever did.\\" Another podium girl, Laura Leturgie from Bethune, married Belgian rider Gert Steegmans after the 2007 Tour de France. According to the German cyclist Jens Voigt, they are not the only podium girls who have married riders: \\"I could name 10 off the top of my head.\\" Controversy Although podium girls are a long-standing tradition in European cycle racing, they have attracted some controversy. Laura Weislo of Cyclingnews.com has criticised the way that professional cycling has reduced women to \\"just beautiful ornaments to stand beside successful men\\". She comments that \\"the only time that you see a female presence on television in professional cycling is the models on the podium, and it only heightens the inequality in the sport.\\" Kelly Riordan, a former cyclo-cross podium girl who now works as a journalist, rejects this: \\"It wouldn't be a proper ceremony without them. These are talented women in their own right. They shouldn't be dismissed simply as eye candy.\\" Magalie Thierry, who has worked as a Tour de France podium girl in 2012 and 2013, describes the podium as \\"just 'a plus'. Maybe the ceremony could seem out of date but most of the public loves it. I think podium girls give a little touch of femininity to this sport.\\" While acknowledging that the Tour de France is very male-dominated – there is no women's Tour and there were no women in the Tour organisation for 30 years – Tour director Christian Prudhomme has said that he is trying to bring women into the management of the Tour. For the 2009 Tour, he selected champion cyclist Claire Pedrono to ride pillion on a motorcycle ahead of the riders, holding up the tour blackboard to give them time information. It is regarded as a prestigious role, and Prudhomme says that he gave it to Pedrono \\"because of her accomplishments as a cyclist. But I have to be honest with you, it also doesn’t hurt that she has a nice smile.\\" See also *Cheerleading *Promotional model *Ring girl References Category:Women by occupation Category:Road bicycle racing Category:Sports occupations and roles Category:Gendered occupations Category:Female beauty ","title":"Podium girl"},{"id":"39863329","text":"Volhynian-Podolian Upland () is a system of uplands in West Ukraine and Right- bank Ukraine.

According to its official website, it is \\"[a] collective that elects aesthetic transfiguration has a civic and communitary participation\\".Nota Biográfica na ESTC It is a Portuguese National Entity of Public Utility and a Certified Actor's Training establishment. Founding The Cooperativa de Produção Artística Teatro e Animação o Bando (Artistic Production Cooperative for Theatre and Animation o Bando) was founded on October 15, 1974, at Algés by the artists João Brites, Jaqueline Tison, Cândido Ferreira, Carmen Marques, Jorge Barbosa and Maria Janeiro.vários autores \\"O BANDO - monografia de um grupo de teatro no seu vigésimo aniversário\\", em: grupo de teatro o bando. (1994), Corlito/Setúbal. The name o Bando is the Portuguese expression for a flock of birds. When it was founded, the company was structured within the childhood theatre area, a free concept that fought the post-revolutionary tendency to infantilize children created by commercial children's theatre. According to Teatro O Bando's approach, the child should be an active part of society, able to have a political and artistic point of view and to manage the limits between concrete reality and dreams. This opposes the average commercial approach that underestimates the child's creative potential by using disarming fairy tales and other stereotyped worlds built by grownups.\\"Trilhos\\", Real. Rui Simões, Prod. Real Ficção/teatro o Bando, Lisboa, 1994 VIDEO Singularism as an aesthetic trend Teatro O Bando maintains its original collectivist methodology based on a long achieved experience named singularism. The singularism aesthetic methodology has the objective of achieving unexpected and singular works because they are not the result of a single illuminated individual. Those works can be recognized because the artistic leadership seeks the transpersonal dimension of its results and not by being merely based on variations of a same style that repeats itself.DO OUTRO LADO/ON THE OTHER SIDE direcção [de] João Brites, Rui Francisco, Miguel Jesus. PQP 2011, ed.. DGARTES. 2011 This way, Teatro O Bando refreshes its acquired knowledge when it searches for a constant unease and defy in its unclassifiable shows. The group's theatrical creations are fueled by cultural activities, mainly in training and audience sensitization, that interact with several types of participants and contributes to a growing impact in the community, in the artistic métier and in the professional actor's training. Dramaturgy The company adapts Portuguese non-theatrical texts to theater, so that novels, poems and folk stories are staged and are the basis of Teatro O Bando's dramaturgic work. Teatro O Bando has the most shows created from masterworks of Portuguese authors. Its adaptations include: *'Gente Feliz com Lágrimas' based on the homonymous work of João de Melo *'Bichos' based on the homonymous work of Miguel Torga *'Gente Singular' based on the homonymous work of Manuel Teixeira Gomes *'Pino do Verão' from poems by Eugénio de Andrade *'Ensaio sobre a Cegueira' (\\"Blindness\\") based on the homonymous work of José Saramago Scenic spaces and scene machines THRONE(Afonso Henriques) photo by Rui Cunha Teatro O Bando has always sought unconventional spaces to put on productions. Even when the show happens in a conventional theatre, different solutions are studied. For example, the front of the stage can advance inside and over some of the audience's chairs in a big diagonal, creating a break from formal, frontal stage.THRONE(Afonso Henriques) photo by Rui Cunha The group also creates shows with devices called scene machines that are not static scenes merely at the service of actors; they are equivalent to characters because they create tensions and emotions even when they are stationary. Theater critic Jorge Listopadits said, \\"a theatre that draws a new landscape but a landscape with a wider scope then the one of nature\\".MÁQUINAS DE CENA/SCENE MACHINES direcção João Brites, 2005, ed. Campo de letras Porto 2005 Artigo Gulbenkian As a result of intense touring activity, the scene machines have become important in Teatro O Bando and in Portuguese Theatre history. Theatre professor and historian Maria Helena Serôdio calls them \\"polysemic objects\\" that achieve a function or meaning according to the position they occupy on stage. One example of this is in Afonso Henriques' show, on stage since 1983 and still working today, is called the throne, but depending on its position can be a cradle, a cart, a castle, a cathedral or a bed. From this patrimony of several shows throughout the decades, Teatro O Bando has most of scene machines scattered throughout the landscape within its headquarters, in a perpetual exposition called Ao Relento. Various parts of Teatro O Bando's shows can be isolated and still be of artistic value. For example, the characters usually continue in small-scale shows after the large- scale shows are discontinued, the text can be read and have literary value on its own, the musical composition with its abstract meaning is reused by others in agreement with Teatro O Bando and the composer.Teatro O Bando : afectos e reflexos de um trajecto / direcção [de] João Brites. 1a ed.. Palmela : Grupo de Teatro O Bando,. 2009. . Headquarters View of the headquarters from top of the hill After having several homes in Lisbon since its foundation, in 2000 Teatro O Bando moved its headquarters to Vale dos Barris in Palmela, inside the Natural Reserve of the Arrábida in a farm of 80 hectares. Two pavilions, constructed from old pig styes, were remodeled to have offices, workshops, warehouses, dressing rooms, interior and exterior stages. This rural space is used for artistic residences and workshops, allied with Teatro O Bando's training knowledge, actors, musicians and singers discover new approaches to the stage. Cooperative's structure (2013) Teatro O Bando is organized as cultural cooperative since its foundation and is one of the first and oldest Portuguese cultural cooperatives, although in fiscal terms it is the same as a private corporation. =General Assembly and the elected Board of Directors= The highest organ is the General Assembly of Cooperants, composed of 22 members who elect the current board of directors. These three manage Teatro O Bando's team in its daily work. Other nominations made by this assembly are the functions within the cooperative, such as the president of the assembly, the secretary and any new members, and a Board of Artistic Directors. =Board of Artistic Directors= The Board of Artistic Directors is the creative core that analyzes and discusses future projects. It conceives and executes the projects leading them from the concept/idea/draft to stage. International touring Teatro O Bando tours it shows in Portugal and abroad. The company puts on more shows on the road throughout the world than it does at home. Its members traveled in Portugal's deserted rural interior in the 1970s, undertook European tours in the 1980s and later toured worldwide to theatre festivals. Teatro O Bando builds large, heavy, scenic spaces and to take them around. It has been to five continents, taking the shows but maintaining a long-term artistic and effective relationship with the hosts in Brazil, Germany, Russia, and various African nations.

The films were designed for a café- concert stunt in which Paulus would sing behind the screen as the films were projected, giving the illusion of a sound film. All five films are currently presumed lost. Summary The English and French release titles, as well as the Star Film Company catalog numbers, for the films were as follows: *Comedian Paulus Singing \\"Derrière l'Omnibus\\" (Paulus chantant: Derrière l'Omnibus, 88) *Comedian Paulus Singing \\"Coquin de Printemps\\" (Paulus chantant: Coquin de Printemps, 89) *Comedian Paulus Singing \\"Duelliste Marsellais\\" (Paulus chantant: Duelliste marseillais, 90) *Paulus chantant: Père la Victoire (no English title or catalogue number) *Paulus chantant: En revenant d'la revue (no English title or catalogue number) Production and release Paulus, then nearing the end of his long and celebrated career as a pro-Boulangist entertainer, approached Méliès with the concept for the stunt.Frazer 1979, p. 37 The series was filmed at Méliès's theater of illusions, the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris. In order to provide enough light for his film camera, Méliès included fifteen arc lamps and fifteen mercury-vapor lamps in his setup, making the Comedian Paulus Singing series the first known use of artificial light in a motion picture. Three of the films (Derrière l'Omnibus, Coquin de Printemps, and Duelliste Marsellais) were sold through the catalogs of Méliès's studio, the Star Film Company, for both French and American film markets. The other two, which featured Paulus singing hymns of praise to the controversial political figure Georges Ernest Boulanger, were filmed for the café-concert performance but not included in the Star Film catalogs, as Méliès himself was a fervent anti- Boulangist.Hammond 1974, pp.26–27 References External links  * * Category:1897 films Category:French silent short films Category:Lost French films Category:Films directed by Georges Méliès Category:French films Category:Films about singers Category:French black-and-white films ","title":"Comedian Paulus Singing"},{"id":"39863425","text":"S11D, or Serra Sul, is an iron ore mining project undertaken by Vale in Serra dos Carajás, Brazil. It is the largest iron ore mine project in the world, at 90 million tonnes per year. Project The project is a $19.5 billion investment, which is key to Vale's future. Production began in December 2016, and the first ore was loaded on ships in January 2017. Production will reach 90 million tonnes of iron ore by 2018, but the transport infrastructure built as part of the S11D project will also support 230 Mt/y of production from other mines to the northeast near Carajas. S11D will use truckless mining; shovels and mobile crushers will work at the mine face and feed directly onto conveyor belts, which take the ore to processing facilities. This lowers environmental impact and also mitigates the difficulty of finding many skilled staff in a remote area. Iron ore will be transported by rail to the Ponta da Madeira port terminal, which is being expanded to handle a very large increase in iron ore shipments. 504 km of new railway is being built, along with upgrades to 226 km of rail already serving the Carajas mines. It is one of the world's largest mines. Location The mine is located in the mining concession area of the Carajás National Forest, accessible via road from Canaã dos Carajás in the Pará region of Brazil.

Life and career Born February 11, 1789, in England, little is known about Marlor’s early years, but it has been speculated that he was apprenticed to a builder or taught himself from house-builders' plan-books. He moved from Charleston to Milledgeville in 1815, and began a nearly 20-year career that shaped the town's architectural heritage. Marlor's reinterpretation of prevailing Georgian and Federal structures brought about an early classical revival in central Georgia architecture. The sophistication of his creations is more in keeping with that of an architect than an artisan.James C. Bonner: Milledgeville, Georgia's Antebellum Capital, University of Georgia Press, Athens, Ga., 1978, p. 37. As he gained experience, his signature architectural features became increasingly complex, as evidenced in his structures preserved in Milledgeville. When builder Daniel Pratt moved to Milledgeville in 1821, Marlor hired him, beginning a collaboration that later grew to include builder Elam Alexander. Marlor’s construction labor was performed primarily by seven enslaved African- Americans, all of whom were trained carpenters. He owned several thousand acres of timber land and a lumber mill, from which he drew for his building materials. Marlor died on October 13, 1835 in Milledgeville, where he is interred in Memory Hill Cemetery,Friends of Baldwin County Cemeteries, Inc.: Memory Hill Cemetery Walking Tour, http://friendsofcems.org/MemoryHill/Brochure8_5X14.pdf, 2012. his tombstone featuring engraved builder's tools.Evening Blues: Find A Grave Memorial# 8256023, http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=Marlor&GSfn;=John&GSbyrel;=all&GSdyrel;=all&GSob;=n&GRid;=8256023&df;=all&, Record added: Jan 10, 2004.

The habitability of red dwarf systems is presumed to be determined by a large number of factors from a variety of sources. Although the low stellar flux, high probability of tidal locking, small circumstellar habitable zones, and high stellar variation experienced by planets of red dwarf stars are impediments to their planetary habitability, the ubiquity and longevity of red dwarfs are factors which provide ample opportunity for any possibility of habitability to be realized. Astronomers study how each of the many factors, and the interactions among them, could affect habitability to learn more about the frequency and most likely locations of extraterrestrial life and intelligence. Intense tidal heating caused by the proximity of planets to their host red dwarfs is a major impediment to life developing in these systems. Other tidal effects, such as the extreme temperature differences created by one side of habitable-zone planets permanently facing the star and the other perpetually turned away and lack of planetary axial tilts, reduce the probability of life around red dwarfs. Non-tidal factors, such as extreme stellar variation, spectral energy distributions shifted to the infrared relative to the Sun, and small circumstellar habitable zones due to low light output, further reduce the prospects for life in red-dwarf systems. There are, however, several effects that increase the likelihood of life on red dwarf planets. Intense cloud formation on the star-facing side of a tidally locked planet may reduce overall thermal flux and drastically reduce equilibrium temperature differences between the two sides of the planet. In addition, the sheer number of red dwarfs, which account for about 85% of at least 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, statistically increases the probability that there might exist habitable planets orbiting some of them. There are expected to be tens of billions of super-Earth planets in the habitable zones of red dwarf stars in the Milky Way. Red dwarf characteristics Red dwarf starsThe term dwarf applies to all stars in the main sequence, including the Sun. are the smallest, coolest, and most common type of star. Estimates of their abundance range from 70% of stars in spiral galaxies to more than 90% of all stars in elliptical galaxies, an often quoted median figure being 73% of the stars in the Milky Way (known since the 1990s from radio telescopic observation to be a barred spiral).Dole, Stephen H. Habitable Planets for Man 1965 Rand Corporation report, published in book form--A figure of 73% is given for the percentage of red dwarfs in the Milky Way. Red dwarfs are either late K or M spectral type.the term is sometimes used as coterminus with M class. K class stars tend toward an orange color. Given their low energy output, red dwarfs are never visible by the unaided eye from Earth; neither the closest red dwarf to the Sun when viewed individually, Proxima Centauri (which is also the closest star to the Sun), nor the closest solitary red dwarf, Barnard's star, is anywhere near visual magnitude. Research =Luminosity and spectral composition= photospheric temperatures. Any planet around a red dwarf, such as the one shown here (Gliese 229A), would have to huddle close to achieve Earth-like temperatures, probably inducing tidal lock. See Aurelia. Credit: MPIA/V. Joergens. For years, astronomers ruled out red dwarfs, with masses ranging from roughly 0.08 to 0.70 solar masses (), as potential abodes for life. The low masses of the stars cause the nuclear fusion reactions at their cores to proceed exceedingly slowly, giving them luminosities ranging from a maximum of roughly 3 percent that of the Sun to a minimum of just 0.01 percent. Consequently, any planet orbiting a red dwarf would have to have a low semimajor axis in order to maintain Earth-like surface temperature, from 0.268 astronomical units (AU) for a relatively luminous red dwarf like Lacaille 8760 to 0.032 AU for a smaller star like Proxima Centauri, the nearest star to the Solar System. Such a world would have a year lasting just six days. Much of the low luminosity of a red dwarf falls in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, with lower energy than the visible light in which the Sun peaks. As a result, photosynthesis on a red dwarf planet would require additional photons to achieve excitation potentials comparable to those needed in Earth photosynthesis for electron transfers, due to the lower average energy level of near-infrared photons compared to visible. Having to adapt to a far wider spectrum to gain the maximum amount of energy, foliage on a habitable red dwarf planet would probably appear black if viewed in visible light. In addition, because water strongly absorbs red and infrared light, less energy would be available for aquatic life on red dwarf planets. However, a similar effect of preferential absorption by water ice would increase its temperature relative to an equivalent amount of radiation from a Sun-like star, thereby extending the habitable zone of red dwarfs outward. Another fact that would inhibit habitability is the evolution of the red dwarf stars; as such stars have an extended pre-main sequence phase, their eventual habitable zones would be for around 1 billion years a zone where water wasn't liquid but in its gaseous state. Thus, terrestrial planets in the actual habitable zones, if provided with abundant surface water in their formation, would have been subject to a runaway greenhouse effect for several hundred million years. During such an early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor would allow hydrogen escape to space and the loss of several Earth oceans of water, leaving a thick abiotic oxygen atmosphere. = Tidal effects = At the close orbital distances, which planets around red dwarf stars would have to maintain for liquid water to exist at their surfaces, tidal locking to the host star is likely. Tidal locking makes the planet rotate on its axis once every revolution around the star. As a result one side of the planet would eternally face the star and another side would perpetually face away, creating great extremes of temperature. For many years, it was believed that life on such planets would be limited to a ring-like region known as the terminator, where the star would always appear on the horizon. It was also believed that efficient heat transfer between the sides of the planet necessitates atmospheric circulation of an atmosphere so thick as to disallow photosynthesis. Due to differential heating, it was argued, a tidally locked planet would experience fierce winds with permanent torrential rain at the point directly facing the local star, the subsolar point. In the opinion of one author this makes complex life improbable. Plant life would have to adapt to the constant gale, for example by anchoring securely into the soil and sprouting long flexible leaves that do not snap. Animals would rely on infrared vision, as signaling by calls or scents would be difficult over the din of the planet-wide gale. Underwater life would, however, be protected from fierce winds and flares, and vast blooms of black photosynthetic plankton and algae could support the sea life. In contrast to the previously bleak picture for life, 1997 studies by Robert Haberle and Manoj Joshi of NASA's Ames Research Center in California have shown that a planet's atmosphere (assuming it included greenhouse gases CO2 and H2O) need only be 100 millibar, or 10% of Earth's atmosphere, for the star's heat to be effectively carried to the night side, a figure well within the bounds of photosynthesis. Research two years later by Martin Heath of Greenwich Community College has shown that seawater, too, could effectively circulate without freezing solid if the ocean basins were deep enough to allow free flow beneath the night side's ice cap. Additionally, a 2010 study concluded that Earth-like water worlds tidally locked to their stars would still have temperatures above on the night side. Climate models constructed in 2013 indicate that cloud formation on tidally locked planets would minimize the temperature difference between the day and the night side, greatly improving habitability prospects for red dwarf planets. Further research, including a consideration of the amount of photosynthetically active radiation, has suggested that tidally locked planets in red dwarf systems might at least be habitable for higher plants. The existence of a permanent day side and night side is not the only potential setback for life around red dwarfs. Tidal heating experienced by planets in the habitable zone of red dwarfs less than 30% of the mass of the Sun may cause them to be \\"baked out\\" and become \\"tidal Venuses.\\" Combined with the other impediments to red dwarf habitability, this may make the probability of many red dwarfs hosting life as we know it very low compared to other star types. There may not even be enough water for habitable planets around many red dwarfs; what little water found on these planets, in particular Earth- sized ones, may be located on the cold night side of the planet. In contrast to the predictions of earlier studies on tidal Venuses, though, this \\"trapped water\\" may help to stave off runaway greenhouse effects and improve the habitability of red dwarf systems. Moons of gas giants within a habitable zone could overcome this problem since they would become tidally locked to their primary and not their star, and thus would experience a day-night cycle. The same principle would apply to double planets, which would likely be tidally locked to each other. Note however that how quickly tidal locking occurs can depend upon a planet's oceans and even atmosphere, and may mean that tidal locking fails to happen even after many gigayears. Additionally, tidal locking is not the only possible end state of tidal dampening. Mercury, for example, has had sufficient time to tidally lock, but is in a 3:2 spin orbit resonance. =Variability= Red dwarfs are far more variable and violent than their more stable, larger cousins. Often they are covered in starspots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% for months at a time. On Earth life has adapted in many ways to the similarly reduced temperatures of the winter. Life may survive by hibernating and/or by diving into deep water where temperatures could be more constant. Oceans would potentially freeze over during extreme cold periods. If so, once the dim period ends, the planet's albedo would be higher than it was prior to the dimming. This means more light from the red dwarf would be reflected, which would impede temperatures from recovering, or possibly further reduce planetary temperatures. At other times, red dwarfs emit gigantic flares that can double their brightness in a matter of minutes. Indeed, as more and more red dwarfs have been scrutinized for variability, more of them have been classified as flare stars to some degree or other. Such variation in brightness could be very damaging for life. Flares might also produce torrents of charged particles that could strip off sizable portions of the planet's atmosphere.Guinan, Edward F.; Engle, S. G.: \\"Future Interstellar Travel Destinations: Assessing the Suitability of Nearby Red Dwarf Stars as Hosts to Habitable Life-bearing Planets\\"; American Astronomical Society, AAS Meeting #221, #333.02 Publication Date:01/2013 Scientists who subscribe to the Rare Earth hypothesis doubt that red dwarfs could support life amid strong flaring. Tidal-locking would probably result in a relatively low planetary magnetic moment. Active red dwarfs that emit coronal mass ejections (CMEs) would bow back the magnetosphere until it contacted the planetary atmosphere. As a result, the atmosphere would undergo strong erosion, possibly leaving the planet uninhabitable. It was found that red dwarfs have a much lower CME rate as expected from their rotation or flare activity, and large CMEs occur rarely. This suggests that atmospheric erosion is caused mainly by radiation rather than CMEs. Otherwise, it is suggested that if the planet had a magnetic field, it would deflect the particles from the atmosphere (even the slow rotation of a tidally locked M-dwarf planet—it spins once for every time it orbits its star—would be enough to generate a magnetic field as long as part of the planet's interior remained molten). This magnetic field should be much stronger compared to Earth's to give protection against flares of the observed magnitude (10-1000G compared to the terrestrial 0.5G), which is unlikely to be generated. But actual mathematical models conclude that, even under the highest attainable dynamo-generated magnetic field strengths, exoplanets with masses like that of Earth lose a significant fraction of their atmospheres by the erosion of the exobase's atmosphere by CME bursts and XUV emissions (even those Earth-like planets closer than 0.8 AU—affecting also GK stars—probably lose their atmospheres). Atmospheric erosion even could trigger the depletion of water oceans. Planets shrouded by a thick haze of hydrocarbons like the one on primordial Earth or Saturn's moon Titan might still survive the flares as floating droplets of hydrocarbon are really efficient at absorbing ultraviolet radiation. Another way that life could initially protect itself from radiation, would be remaining underwater until the star had passed through its early flare stage, assuming the planet could retain enough of an atmosphere to sustain liquid oceans. The scientists who wrote the television programme \\"Aurelia\\" believed that life could survive on land despite a red dwarf flaring. Once life reached onto land, the low amount of UV produced by a quiescent red dwarf means that life could thrive without an ozone layer, and thus never need to produce oxygen. It is worth noting that the violent flaring period of a red dwarf's life cycle is estimated to only last roughly the first 1.2 billion years of its existence. If a planet forms far away from a red dwarf so as to avoid tidelock, and then migrates into the star's habitable zone after this turbulent initial period, it is possible for life to have a chance to develop. =Abundance= The major advantage that red dwarfs have over other stars as abodes for life: they produce light energy for a very long time. It took 4.5 billion years before humans appeared on Earth, and life as we know it will see suitable conditions for 5 billion more years or so. Red dwarfs, by contrast, could exist for trillions of years, because their nuclear reactions are far slower than those of larger stars, meaning that life both would have far longer to evolve and to survive. Furthermore, although the odds of finding a planet in the habitable zone around any specific red dwarf are unknown, the total amount of habitable zone around all red dwarfs combined is likely equal to the total amount around Sun-like stars given their ubiquity. The first super-Earth with a mass of a 3 to 4 times that of Earth's found in the potentially habitable zone of its star is Gliese 581g, and its star, Gliese 581, is indeed a red dwarf. Although tidally locked, it is thought possible that at its terminator liquid water may well exist. The planet is thought to have existed for approximately 7 billion years and has a large enough mass to support an atmosphere. Another possibility could come in the far future, when according to computer simulations a red dwarf becomes a blue dwarf as it is exhausting its hydrogen supply. As this kind of star is more luminous than the previous red dwarf, planets orbiting it that were frozen during the former stage could be thawed during the several billions of years this evolutionary stage lasts (5 billion years, for example, for a star), giving life an opportunity to appear and evolve. =Water retention= Planets can retain significant amounts of water in the habitable zone of ultracool dwarfs, with a sweet spot in the 0.04–0.06 M⊙ range, despite FUV-photolysis of water and the XUV -driven escape of hydrogen. Water worlds orbiting M-dwarfs could have their oceans depleted over the Gyr timescale due to the more intense particle and radiation environments that exoplanets experience in close-in habitable zones. If the atmosphere were to be depleted over the timescale less than Gyr, this could prove to be problematic for the origin of life (abiogenesis) on the planet. =Methane habitable zone= If methane- based life is possible (similar to the hypothetical life on Titan), there would be a second habitable zone further out from the star corresponding to the region where methane is liquid. Titan's atmosphere is transparent to red and infrared light, so more of the light from red dwarfs would be expected to reach the surface of a Titan-like planet. =Frequency of Earth-sized worlds around ultra-cool dwarfs= TRAPPIST-1 planetary system (artist's impression) A study of archival Spitzer data gives the first idea and estimate of how frequent Earth-sized worlds are around ultra-cool dwarf stars: 30–45%. A computer simulation finds that planets that form around stars with similar mass to TRAPPIST-1 (c. 0.084 M⊙) most likely have sizes similar to the Earth. In fiction The following examples of fictional \\"aliens\\" existing within Red Dwarf star systems exist: * Shadeward Saga: In Drew Wagar's Shadeward Saga, the story unfolds in Esurio, a tidally-locked Earth-sized planet colonized by humans that is orbiting Lacaille 9352, a red dwarf 10 light years away from Earth. The book adequately describes the stark contrasts of extreme cold and blazing hot regions and the human confination to the temperate corridor among both zones, while describing some of the likely hardships a medieval-type human population would experience in such a world, such as the problematic navigation of the deep seas in a world of perpetual sunlight with no reference points such as stars, or the occasional energetic flares that occur periodically in a typical red dwarf. *Ark: In Stephen Baxter's Ark, after planet Earth is completely submerged by the oceans a small group of humans embark on an interstellar journey eventually making it to a planet named Earth III. The planet is cold, tidally locked and the plant life is black (in order to better absorb the light from the red dwarf). * Draco Tavern: In Larry Niven's Draco Tavern stories, the highly advanced Chirpsithra aliens evolved on a tide-locked oxygen world around a red dwarf. However, no detail is given beyond that it was about 1 terrestrial mass, a little colder, and used red dwarf sunlight. * Nemesis: Isaac Asimov avoids the tidal effect issues of the red dwarf Nemesis by making the habitable \\"planet\\" a satellite of a gas giant which is tidally locked to the star. * Star Maker: In Olaf Stapledon's 1937 science fiction novel Star Maker, one of the many alien civilizations in the Milky Way he describes is located in the terminator zone of a tidally locked planet of a red dwarf system. This planet is inhabited by intelligent plants that look like carrots with arms, legs, and a head, which \\"sleep\\" part of the time by inserting themselves in soil on plots of land and absorbing sunlight through photosynthesis, and which are awake part of the time, emerging from their plots of soil as locomoting beings who participate in all the complex activities of a modern industrial civilization.

Instead of climbing the great mountain, Hercules used his superhuman strength to smash through it. By doing so, he connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and formed the Strait of Gibraltar. One part of the split mountain is Gibraltar and the other is either Monte Hacho in Ceuta or Jebel Musa (known as the Mons Abyla in classical times) in Morocco. These two mountains taken together have since then been known as the Pillars of Hercules, though other natural features have been associated with the name.\\"Close to the Pillars there are two isles, one of which they call Hera's Island; moreover, there are some who call also these isles the Pillars.\\" (Strabo, 3.5.3.); see also H. L. Jones' gloss on this line in the Loeb Classical Library. Diodorus Siculus,Diodorus 4.18.5. however, held that instead of smashing through an isthmus to create the Straits of Gibraltar, Hercules narrowed an already existing strait to prevent monsters from the Atlantic Ocean from entering the Mediterranean Sea. The Greek mythology version is that Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from the garden of his daughters, the Hesperides which was also guarded by the dragon Ladon. Upon his return with the apples, however, Atlas attempted to trick Heracles into carrying the sky permanently by offering to deliver the apples himself, as anyone who purposely took the burden must carry it forever, or until someone else took it away. Heracles, suspecting Atlas did not intend to return, pretended to agree to Atlas' offer, asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders. When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again, Heracles took the apples and ran away.

They reside in Beverly Hills, California. Criticism Growing water-intensive nut tree crops in the Central Valley (a single almond requires 1.1 US gallons [4.2 l] of water) has drawn criticism during California's ongoing drought. According to Forbes Magazine Wonderful Company uses \\"at least 120 billion gallons [450 million m3] a year, two-thirds on nuts, enough to supply San Francisco's 852,000 residents for a decade.\\" In addition the Resnicks own a majority stake in the Kern Water Bank, \\"one of California's largest underground water storage facilities. It is capable of storing 500 billion gallons [1.9 billion m3] of water. The acquisition, continuing private ownership, and water sales profit from this taxpayer- developed resource infrastructure while California suffers under drought is controversial. In an effort to make their impact on the region more positive, the Resnicks have invested in the growth of the local economy and nutrition centers. As the New York Times notes, \\"in Lost Hills there are new health centers, new pre-K facilities, new housing projects, new gardens, new sidewalks and lights, a new community center and a new soccer field.\\" They have partnered with the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project to bring water to Kern County spending $35 million in recent years buying up more water from nearby districts to replenish the Central Valley's supplies. At the same time as exporting almonds to Asia and other locations, they import Fiji bottled water from the South Pacific. Some foreign conservationists criticize the Resnicks for \\"hogging the archipelago's precious water supply... while island natives didn't always have water to drink themselves, due to crumbling and insufficient infrastructure.\\" However, local officials support the investment Fiji water makes in the economy as \\"a critical contributor to the Fijian Economy... and a gift to the Fijian tourism industry.\\" In addition, their claims for the \\"POM\\" pomegranate drink have been contested. Forbes reported, \\"The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint in 2010 that the Resnicks' POM Wonderful had used deceptive advertising when marketing the antioxidant-rich drink as being able to treat, prevent or reduce the risk of heart disease, prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction. In 2012 a federal judge agreed that some of the ads were misleading. In 2013 FTC commissioners denied the Resnicks' appeal. In October of 2015, the Resnicks asked the Supreme Court to take the case.\\"Forbes Magazine: America's Nuttiest Billionaire Couple: Amid Drought, Stewart And Lynda Resnick Are Richer Than Ever November 23, 2015 In May 2016 the Supreme Court declined.\\"LA Times: Pom Wonderful case not wonderful enough, Supreme Court says\\" May 4, 2016 In 2015 it was revealed that the Resnicks and other farmers had been watering their orchards with treated fracking waste water.Harkinson, J.

It aired on September 29, 2011. The episode was written by Richard Hatem and it was directed by Colin Bucksey. Plot Now that the Circle has been bound, it seems that its members have lost their individual magic. The only way to do magic is to have at least two of the Circle's members present and that is something that Faye (Phoebe Tonkin) does not like at all. There is a school dance coming and Sally (Logan Browning) asks Cassie (Britt Robertson) to help her organize it. Sally does not remember clearly what happened the previous night at the deck, so she tries to make Cassie tell her. Cassie avoids answering, saying that she did not see what exactly happened either. Luke (Zachary Abel), a student at the school, likes Cassie and he asks Adam (Thomas Dekker) to introduce him to her. Adam does it and Luke asks Cassie to go to the dance with him, but she rejects him. Later, trying to find a way to stay away from Adam, she tells Luke that she will go with him to the dance. Melissa (Jessica Parker Kennedy) takes the opportunity and uses the dance as an excuse to get closer to Nick (Louis Hunter) by asking him to the dance while Faye is trying to figure out a way to get her individual magic back. Meanwhile, a man named Zachary (Dave Baez) appears in town and when he sees Cassie, he starts to ask questions about the Circle. He seems to know the truth about them and who they are and, as he says, he will not allow what happened in the past to happen again. The members of the Circle search for information about him and they find out that he and his girlfriend Heather (a woman who died in the fire that killed the members of the adult's Circle sixteen years ago) were close friends of Amelia, Cassie's mom. Finding out about this, they believe that he blames their parents for Heather's death and now he is coming after them. Dawn (Natasha Henstridge) and Charles (Gale Harold) find out that Zachary is back in town and he is asking about the Circle. They are trying to warn him to stay away from the kids. Charles meets him to warn him but Zachary hits him and goes to the school dance aiming to kill one of the kids. The members of the Circle and Zachary confront him at the school and they manage to knock him down with magic. Dawn gets to the scene and they find an excuse for what happened to cover it up. Dawn tells them that she knows that man and that he has been vandalizing the school for years. Saying that she will take care of him now, she asks the kids to go back to the dance. The episode ends with the members of the Circle trying to understand what Zachary meant when he said that Heather did not die in the fire but what Amelia did to her was much worse, while Dawn and Charles \\"mark\\" Zachary telling him to not get close to their children again. Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Loner\\" was watched by 2.12 million; exact same rating as the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"Loner\\" received mediocre/positive reviews.

Schnorr von Carolsfeld was born in Königsberg, the son and pupil of the artist Veit Hanns Schnorr von Carolsfeld. His younger brother was Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and his nephew was the opera singer Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld. At the age of 16 he moved to Vienna, where he lived for the rest of his life. In 1804 he was registered as a student in the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna under Heinrich Friedrich Füger, who had become acquainted with his father in 1801. He became part of the group of Academy students around Friedrich Overbeck, who were looking for new paths beyond the strongly formal Classical ideals of the Academy. The outcome of their efforts was the Nazarene movement. Unlike Overbeck and others, however, Schnorr von Carolsfeld avoided a complete break with the Academy, did not join the Lukasbund (a group founded by the other Nazarene artists), and remained in Vienna. His first patron was Duke Albert von Sachsen-Teschen. Schnorr von Carolsfeld maintained close relations with the Catholic Romantics Zacharias Werner and Friedrich von Schlegel. In about 1808 he formed part of the circle of friends centred on Therese Malfatti and her family and drew portraits of Ludwig van Beethoven and his friend Ignaz von Gleichenstein.Der Freundeskreis der Familie Malfatti in Wien, gezeichnet von Ludwig Ferdinand Schnorr von Carolsfeld, ed. by Sieghard Brandenburg, Bonn 1985 On 23 September 1812 in Vienna he married Karoline von Jankwitz, born in Silesia. In 1818 his bid to obtain the directorship of the Vienna Academy failed because of the opposition of Prince Metternich, the curator of the Academy, who mistrusted Schnorr von Carolsfeld because of his artistic and personal closeness to the artists of the Lukas group. He did however obtain a position from Archduke John of Austria, and provided the artworks for Brandhof, the Archduke's refurbished country house, up to 1828. In 1821 he became the teacher of Moritz von Schwind. In the same year he converted to Roman Catholicism. Schnorr von Carolsfeld undertook study trips to Southern Germany, Switzerland and Paris (1834), and to Northern Germany (1837). Thanks to the Archduke he came into contact with the Austro-Hungarian Imperial family, who gave him commissions. In 1835, thanks again to the Archduke, and also thanks to the fact that Romantic painting was beginning to become popular throughout Germany, he became after all a member of the Academy in Vienna. From 1841 he was the curator of the Imperial gallery in the Belvedere Palace. He died in Vienna in 1853. In 1937 the \\"Schnorrgasse\\", a street in Floridsdorf in the 21st district of Vienna, was named in honour of him and his brother Julius.

Tolkien and Anglo Saxon literature. Formerly a professor at Washington College, Olsen now dedicates his time to Signum University, an online learning facility he founded in 2012.  Education  Corey Olsen obtained his B.A in English and Astrophysics from Williams College in 1996, going on to Columbia University where he obtained his M.A. in 1997, MPhil in 2000, and his PhD in medieval literature in 2003.  Academic career  Upon graduation from Columbia University, Olsen obtained teaching positions at Temple University, Columbia University, and Nyack College. He then proceeded to his longest standing position to date, Assistant Professor of English at Washington College with a specialty on J.R.R. Tolkien, Arthurian Literature, Chaucer, and Sir Thomas Malory. It was at Washington College that Olsen was first able to teach a literary class on Tolkien. In 2013 Professor Olsen left Washington College to focus on Signum University and the Mythgard Institute, online learning websites offering classes in the work of J.R.R. Tolkien, Fantasy Literature, Latin and Creative Writing. = Online Education = With the success of his podcasts, Olsen founded the Mythgard Institute and Signum University, where he is now President. These institutes offer a range of classes on Latin, the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, Creative Writing, and fantasy and science fiction literature (such as \\"The Story of The Hobbit\\"). Olsen founded Signum University and the Mythgard Institute because: > \\"We at Signum University believe that this kind of academic experience > should be available to 'everyone, everywhere'.\\" Several of the courses that are offered at the Mythgard Institute have also been offered as free downloads through iTunes U; the first of these courses was \\"The Lord of the Rings 1: The Road Goes Ever On\\". On 8 April 2018, Corey announced that Signum University was to be formally entered for New Hampshire state certification via the New Hampshire Department of Education. Following some days of crowdfunding they raised the $23,720 required, and later in 2018, Signum University began the ascension process. On 24 April 2018, Signum University announced that the New Hampshire Department of Education had accepted the request for Signum University to do business in New Hampshire, but (as of 17 February 2019) had yet to receive permission to grant degrees. However, a Bill passed in the Senate, which was yet to go to the house, proposing that \\"Signum University [will be authorised] to grant degrees in this state\\".  Podcasting  In June 2009 Olsen launched the Tolkien Professor podcast. The Podcast was originally created to explore the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, primarily The Hobbit, with latter episodes focusing on The Silmarillion. The podcast achieved over a quarter of a million downloads in its first year alone. It expanded to cover the history of fairy stories and their influence on modern fantasy along with supplementary podcasts on the movie adaptations of the works of Tolkien. The supplementary podcasts, often co-hosted by former students, were recorded under the title Riddles in the Dark. Another infrequent aspect of the Tolkien Professor podcasts was the Tolkien Chat call-in shows. These shows were hosted through Skype where listeners could call in and ask Olsen questions directly. The shows were then edited and published as podcasts. Olsen also published several of his Washington College courses, including Faerie and Fantasy that covered some of the well known works of Middle English such as Sir Orfeo, Sir Launfal, and The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle. To go along with his book Exploring J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\", Olsen published a series of lectures on The Hobbit that gave chapter reviews and interpretation of the story, poetry, and prose of The Hobbit.

History The Nizam's Contingent was formed when Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, became Governor-General of India and formed a plan to rid India of French influence. His first action, on arriving in India in 1798, was to effect the disbandment of the Indian units of the Nizam under the command of a Frenchman, Monsieur Raymond, officered by non-British Europeans. These soldiers were formed into the British-officered Nizam's Contingent which fought at the Battle of Seringapatam in 1799 against Tippu Sultan in the final battle of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. The Contingent In 1813, Sir Henry Russell, then British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad, raised the Russell Brigade, comprising two battalions. Later, four more battalions were raised and they were known as the Berar Infantry. In addition, two battalions known as the Elichpur Brigade were raised by Nawab Salabat Khan, Subedar of Berar, but formed part of the Nizam's forces. The men of the Russell Brigade were chiefly Hindus, recruited from Oudh and other parts of Uttar Pradesh. Renaming as Hyderabad contingent By 1853, at the time of the signing of a treaty between the Nizam and the British, the Nizam's forces consisted of eight battalions. The force was renamed as the Hyderabad Contingent, and served closely alongside the Madras Army of the East India Company. On 23 October 1917, during the First World War, a Kumaon Battalion was raised at Ranikhet as the \\"4/39th Kumaon Rifles\\". In 1918 this unit was redesignated as the 1st battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles, and a second battalion was raised. These were merged with the Hyderabad Contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923. Some units of the regiment were demobilized after the First World War, but the regiment was again expanded during the Second World War. Kumaon Regiment As links with Hyderabad and Deccan lessened, calls to rename the regiment were heard. On 27 October 1945, the 19th Hyderabad Regiment was incorporated into the Indian Army and renamed the 19th Kumaon Regiment. It later became the Kumaon Regiment. Meanwhile, with the departure of the British from India in 1947, the Nizam of Hyderabad decided not to accede either to Pakistan or India. For a year, the state was fully independent. In September 1948 in Operation Polo Indian forces invaded Hyderabad and overthrew its Nizam, annexing his state into the Indian Union.

Life Claude Houghton Oldfield was born in 1889 in Sevenoaks, Kent, the son of George Sargent Oldfield (a public secretary) and his wife Elizabeth Harriett née Thomas. After being schooled at Dulwich College, he trained as an accountant. During the First World War, he was rejected for combat service because of poor eyesight and served instead in the Admiralty. He married an actress, Dulcie Benson, in 1920, and the couple moved to a cottage in the Chilterns.Valentine, Mark (2013). \\"Introduction\\". This Was Ivor Trent by Claude Houghton. Kansas City, MO: Valancourt Books. p. v. . He died in 1961 in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Writing and reception Houghton's literary career began in the 1910s, with the publication of some of his poems in G. K. Chesterton's magazine The New Witness. He would later cite Gustave Flaubert, Honoré de Balzac, and William Blake as influences on his writing. Several of his novels contain fantastic elements, including the afterlife fantasy Julian Grant Loses His Way and the borderline science- fictional This Was Ivor Trent, about an author who has a vision of a future human being. Houghton stated that all his fiction was based on the belief that modern civilization would collapse \\"because it no longer believes it has a destiny\\". Though he never achieved great popularity with the general public, Houghton's work was praised by such fellow writers as J. B. Priestley, Hugh Walpole, Clemence Dane, and Henry Miller. In 1935, Walpole wrote: > I believe Claude Houghton to be one of the most interesting and one of the > most important novelists now writing in England. With none of his > contemporaries can one compare him—his odd mixtures of reality and fantasy, > his gifts of drama and philosophy, his unusual and significant and > courageous themes, his natural aptitude for narrative, this last one of the > rarest of gifts among novelists today.Walpole, Hugh (1935). \\"A Note on the > Novels of Claude Houghton\\". I Am Jonathan Scrivener by Claude Houghton. New > York: Doubleday, Doran. Rpt. in the edition of the novel by Valancourt > Books, 2013, p. xiii. In the same year a slim volume of Walpole's and Dane's commendations of Houghton's novels was published. Henry Miller was particularly partial to Houghton's Hudson Rejoins the Herd, of which he wrote: \\"What so startled me, in reading this book, was that it appeared to give a picture of my most intimate life during a certain crucial period. The outer circumstances were 'disguised,' but the inner ones were hallucinatingly real. I could not have done better myself.\\" In 1995, some of the correspondence between Miller, Houghton, and the Chicago bookseller Ben Abramson was published in Writers Three: A Literary Exchange. Houghton's novels were translated into French, German, and Czech, and President Tomáš Masaryk of Czechoslovakia was another admirer of his work. Houghton's best-known novel is I Am Jonathan Scrivener, which Michael Dirda has called \\"a highly diverting, philosophical novel of considerable merit\\". It has been suggested (by the film's musical director, Bernard Herrmann) that the novel influenced Orson Welles's technique, in Citizen Kane, of presenting the personality of the eponymous character through the recollections of other characters. New editions of I Am Jonathan Scrivener and This Was Ivor Trent were published in 2013 by the U.S. publisher Valancourt Books, which also published new editions of Houghton's first novel, Neighbours, in 2014 and Julian Grant Loses His Way, A Hair Divides, and Chaos Is Come Again in 2015. Both I Am Jonathan Scrivener and Birthmark were adapted as episodes of the U.S. television anthology series Westinghouse Studio One. The former, adapted by Brainerd Duffield and starring John Forsythe and Everett Sloane, was broadcast on 1 December 1952; the latter, broadcast on 4 May 1953 under the title \\"Birthright\\", was adapted by Emerson Crocker and starred Jackie Cooper, Everett Sloane, and Estelle Winwood.

Taxonomy Aedes canadensis was originally described as Culex canadensis by the British entomologist Frederick Vincent Theobald in his 1901 monograph entitled A monograph of the Culicidae of the World, published by the British Museum (Natural History), from specimens collected in Ontario. In recent revisions of the genus Aedes it was found that the genus was paraphyletic and workers suggested that the genus be divided into two genera. A. canadensis was placed in the newly raised genus Ochlerotatus by these workers, these studies also placed it in its own monotypic sub-genus Culicada. Two subspecies are recognized. *A. canadensis canadensis (Theobald, 1901) from northern North America *A. canadensis mathesoni (Middlekauff, 1944) from the southern parts of the species range Identification Aedes canadensis often occurs with con-generic species and to be sure of identification of either adults or larvae a, Identification key and microscope are required. In general the adults of this species have dark, the females often reddish, bodies which have contrasting white banded tarsi with the bands at each end of the segments. Biology Female Aedes canadensis gain blood meals from a wide range of large and small animals, birds and reptiles. It is particularly associated with turtles and clouds of this species are frequently observed surrounding turtles crossing roads to lay their eggs during May. Animals fed on by the females includes large and small mammals, birds reptiles and amphibians, there is a record of the females feeding on a leopard frog. The larvae of A. canadensis grow in temporary or semi permanent woodland pools which contain fallen leaves and which tend to be shaded, they are less frequently found in pools in small stream beds or in standing water next to wooded areas. They can also be found in swamps and marshes with emergent vegetation such as reeds and cattails, muskeg pools and peat bogs, and in some areas have been found in open prairie pools with little shade. They overwinter as eggs and in late winter and spring large numbers of larvae hatch. The females are seldom troublesome to humans in eastern North America, even when recently emerged females are extremely abundant, however, in the western part of its range they readily and persistently bite people, especially in areas of shade and throughout most of the day. The presence of larvae in the breeding pools after the Spring suggests that these mosquitoes are either laying non diapausing eggs or that the hatching of the eggs is staggered. The males have been recorded swarming in the early evening and have been recorded as obtaining nectar on orchids. Distribution Aedes canadensis occurs in North American from the Yukon Territory and Washington state east to Newfoundland and south to Florida and Texas, south into Mexico. Medical importance The viruses which transmit Eastern equine encephalitis, California encephalitis and West Nile virus have been detected in samples of Aedes canadensis and have also been shown to be a vector of dog heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis). It has also shown to be a secondary vector for the La Crosse virus in Ohio.

It is based on two books by Tom Buk-Swienty about the Second Schleswig War of 1864 between Denmark and an alliance of Prussia and Austria which ended in defeat for Denmark and the loss of a quarter of its territory to Prussia. It follows two brothers from a remote village on Funen who enlist in the Danish army just before the outbreak of war, and experience the horrors of combat in Schleswig. It also features actual historical figures such as Danish prime minister D. G. Monrad and Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck. It was the most expensive Danish TV series to be made to date. Production 1864 was produced by Miso Film for DR. It was a co-production with Film Fyn, TV2 (Norway), TV4 (Sweden), SF Studios, ARTE, ZDF Enterprises and Sirena Film (Czech Republic). DR had recently produced the highly successful series The Killing, Borgen and The Bridge, and several of the stars of those series, such as Lars Mikkelsen, Sidse Babett Knudsen and Søren Malling, were among the cast. 1864 was filmed on location at Dybbøl, scene of the climactic battle of the war, in the Svanninge Hills on Funen, and at Hagenskov, Egebjerggård and Hvidkilde Manors, also on Funen. The battle scenes were filmed in the Czech Republic over a period of seven weeks. Tom Buk- Swienty, on whose books the series was based, was a historical consultant on the series. It was the most expensive television series ever made in Denmark, with a projected cost of 173 million kroner (about $25 million). The director, Ole Bornedal, described it as \\"a classic story about power and the abuse of power...of people getting separated.\\" The BBC's John Wilson said it had \\"the sense of the epic in scale\\" but with \\"a great undertone of tragedy.\\" The background to the opening credits is the painting (From the outposts, 1864) by Vilhelm Rosenstand. Plot summary =1850s= In 1851, the people of a Danish village await the return of the victorious soldiers from the First Schleswig War. Among the soldiers is farmer Thøger Jensen, who has suffered a severe leg wound and returns to his wife Karen and sons 12-year-old Laust and 11-year-old Peter. Also returning is Didrich, son of the local landowner, the Baron, who served as a captain. Didrich has been severely damaged psychologically by the war and has also been tainted by cowardice; his father reveals that he bribed his fellow officers not to report him to the military authorities. Didrich's mother died giving birth to him, and his father (Waage Sandø) has never forgiven him; while kind to his tenants, he treats his son with scorn.\\"1864 review: 'as compelling as any Nordic noir'\\", The Telegraph, 15 May 2015. Accessed 2 June 2015 Overjoyed to have their father home, Laust and Peter also befriend Inge Juel, the spirited daughter of the Baron's new estate manager. Didrich, too, who is increasingly becoming a dissolute alcoholic, has feelings for Inge, although she is only a child. At the harvest festival celebrations he propositions her, but she slaps his face and runs away. Later, Thøger, whose wound has never really healed, dies suddenly while working in the fields. Laust goes to work for the Baron as a stable boy. In Copenhagen, the leader of the National Liberal Party, D. G. Monrad, meets famous actress Johanne Luise Heiberg, who begins to encourage him in his nationalist ideas. =1860s= In the 1860s, Monrad is now Council President (prime minister), and has become a convinced nationalist. He actively tries to provoke a war with Prussia over the Schleswig-Holstein Question, still encouraged by Mrs Heiberg. Monrad tries to persuade the new king, Christian IX, that declaring war would show the people that Christian, who was born in Schleswig and grew up speaking German, is a true Dane. In Berlin, King Wilhelm, his minister-president, Otto von Bismarck, and his chief of the general staff, General Helmuth von Moltke, greet Denmark's sabre-rattling with disbelief but also relief as such a war would fit perfectly into Bismarck's plan of placing Prussia as the dominant power in the German Confederation. In the village, Laust and Peter have grown into young men, now both in love with Inge.\\"The week in TV: Mad Men; 1864; Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell; The Island with Bear Grylls; 24 Hours in the Past\\", The Guardian, 24 May 2015.

Later, he and his dissolute friends catch Ignazio's son, Djargo, poaching pheasant on the Baron's land and severely flog him. He is found by Laust, Peter and Inge, who take him to the Baron. The Baron chastises his son and gives the gypsies work in the harvest. He also persuades Laust and Peter and their friend Einar to join the army.Nordic Noir & Beyond. Accessed 10 June 2015 The brothers complete their basic training and return to the village on leave, arriving at the harvest festival celebrations. They leave with Inge and both end up kissing her. However, after they leave her, Laust, on the pretext of going to search for his lost knife, returns to her without Peter's knowledge and they make love. Later, Didrich, drunk as usual and unable to find Inge, rapes Ignazio's beautiful, mute daughter Sofia, who keeps the attack to herself. The brothers return to the army, where they and Einar are assigned to a company of the 8th Brigade. There they befriend Alfred, a naive young man from Skagen, Erasmus, a cheerful bearded giant who is a miller in civilian life, and Johan Larsen, a middle-aged veteran who has a reputation for being psychic and is soon promoted to corporal. They also form good relations with the company's second-in-command, the young Second Lieutenant Wilhelm Dinesen, and with their senior NCO, Sergeant Jespersen. Monrad's plans are finally realised when he announces that Denmark has fully annexed Schleswig and Prussia decides to declare war. The 8th Brigade is sent south to occupy the Danevirke, a line of fortifications which has always been regarded as the country's southern border and which is regarded in Danish mythology as impregnable. However, when they arrive they find the Danevirke dilapidated, with no barracks accommodation. They are also assigned a new company commander to replace the former ancient and senile officer, who has died en route; it is Didrich, who has been recalled to the colours. The company is ordered to Mysunde, where they witness the devastation of the Battle of Mysunde, the first battle of the war giving the Danes an early victory, although Didrich keeps them well behind the action. Laust and Peter have both been writing to Inge and she to them, but she and Laust have also been exchanging further secret letters. Peter receives one of these by mistake and realises that his brother has slept with Inge. Devastated, he disowns Laust. Didrich later promotes Johan to sergeant and Laust to corporal. It becomes obvious to the Danish commander, General Christian de Meza, that he cannot hold the Danevirke because the marshes and water on which he had relied to defend its flanks have been frozen solid by the hard winter, and he asks for permission to withdraw to Dybbøl, but Monrad refuses. De Meza withdraws anyway and is replaced by the unimaginative General , who is guaranteed to do anything he is told to do. Peter, Einar and Jespersen are among a small party led by Dinesen who volunteer to remain behind at the Danevirke to spike the guns after the Danish withdrawal. They escape just before the Prussians arrive and are pursued by a group of Prussian hussars, who capture them and execute one man before Dinesen, who has managed to escape, reappears and surprises them; caught off guard, all the hussars are killed by the Danes. Dinesen begins to get a reputation for ferocity and invincibility.\\"1864 recap: episodes five and six – the party is over\\". The Guardian, 30 May 2015. Accessed 10 June 2015 Meanwhile, during the retreat to Dybbøl, Didrich orders Laust to jump into a frozen pond to retrieve a cannon that has fallen in. After his friends pull him out he begins suffering from severe hypothermia and he and his friends, including Johan, Alfred and Erasmus, begin to fall further behind the column. They thereby miss the Battle of Sankelmark, although they come upon the bloody aftermath. Back in the village, Inge realises she is pregnant by Laust. Her mother disowns her and she leaves with the gypsies when they head south to see whether they can make any profit from the war. During the journey she and Djargo realise Sofia too is pregnant and Djargo swears to kill Didrich, whom he correctly surmises has raped his sister. They reach Dybbøl, where Inge encounters Didrich, who tells her that both brothers are dead. The Danish army digs in at Dybbøl. Both Laust's and Peter's groups arrive, although they do not encounter one another. Laust, now dying from pneumonia, is taken to a military hospital where Inge and Sofia are working as nurses, although they do not meet. Djargo disguises himself as a soldier to try to kill Didrich, but is caught. Didrich wants him executed, but Jespersen persuades him that this would be a crime and he instead has him locked in a dugout. Dinesen leads his group in a nighttime raid to kill the German bandsmen who have been playing marches near the Danish lines. Celebrating after the successful raid, Alfred, who has joined the group, has too much to drink and climbs onto the parapet, where he has both hands blown off by an exploding shell. He later dies of blood loss in a hospital, where Inge and Peter pass next to each other but do not notice the other. Johan mysteriously manages to cure Laust of his pneumonia and he returns to the company. Finally, the Prussians attack, beginning with a remorseless six-hour artillery barrage. They are now commanded by the highly competent Prince Friedrich Karl, the Prussian king's nephew, who has replaced the 80-year-old and increasingly senile Field Marshal von Wrangel. Most of Didrich's company are holding the trenches, although Dinesen's men are with the main body of the brigade who are forming a reserve behind the lines. The Prussian infantry attack and Erasmus is killed. Djargo, who has escaped during the barrage, finds Didrich and stabs him in the thigh, but is killed by a stray bullet before he can finish off his sister's rapist. Didrich, terrified and cowering, tries to surrender to a group of Prussian soldiers, but they ignore him. The 8th Brigade attacks, led by Dinesen after its commanding officer refuses to advance without orders from his superiors, and manages to push the Prussians back temporarily. A counterattack, however, destroys the brigade and kills Jespersen, and Peter, trapped behind enemy lines, finally realises that he has to find his brother. Meanwhile, Laust has discovered the wounded and frightened Didrich and begins carrying him to safety. However, he is spotted and shot dead by the Germans. Peter, arriving too late but witnessing his brother's death, falls into shock and is captured and confined to a prisoner of war hospital in Austria. Meanwhile, Inge gives birth as the battle rages. Realising his country is defeated, King Christian surrenders, although Monrad, abandoned by Mrs Heiberg, still tries to persuade him to continue fighting. Johan infiltrates the Prussian lines the night after the battle and collects all the papers, letters and photographs from the bodies of his dead comrades. He then travels throughout Denmark handing them to their families. When he reaches Laust and Peter's village he tries to give Laust's last letter to Inge, who has been taken back in by her parents, but her mother Ingrid (Helle Fagralid) refuses to let him see her and later reads and burns the letter without giving it to her. The Baron asks Johan about Didrich, who is in a prisoner of war camp in Hamburg, and Johan bitterly tells him the truth: that his son is a coward and a deserter. As he leaves, the Baron shoots himself. Later Didrich is released and returns to the village, to find himself the new Baron. He asks Inge to marry him, implying an estate manager's daughter would be a fool to refuse such an offer from a nobleman. Still believing both Laust and Peter to be dead, she accepts, although she becomes hysterical when her child, whom she has named Laust after his father, is taken from her; Didrich has made it clear that he does not want another man's bastard. Two years later, Peter, now sane, fit and healthy once more, is finally released and works his way back across Austria and Prussia to Denmark, encountering en route Prussian troops now marching to fight their former allies, the Austrians. He returns to the village to find Sofia and her baby, whom she has named Peter after him, living with his mother. He goes to see Inge, who, pregnant with her and Didrich's first child, breaks down when she sees him and realises Didrich lied to her. Peter knocks a typically offensive Didrich down and leaves. He finds little Laust in the orphanage in which he has been abandoned and adopts him as his own son. He falls in love with and marries Sofia, who is now capable of at least limited speech, celebrating with his family and friends, including Einar, who has also survived the war. Monrad and his family make plans to leave for New Zealand. Inge's voiceover tells us that she and Didrich had a number of children, each of whom seemed to calm him a little more, although he was never truly normal. =2010s= A parallel and linked story takes place in the modern day. Troubled teenage tearaway Claudia and her drug dealer boyfriend Zlatko are taken on a school trip to the Dybbøl battlefield, where they are bored and smoke marijuana. Soon afterwards Claudia, whose brother was killed while serving in the army overseas (probably in Afghanistan) and whose parents have retreated into depression, leaves school and is found a temporary job as carer for Baron Severin. In his nineties, nearly blind, confined to a wheelchair and probably suffering from dementia, Severin lives alone in his mansion, which it is soon clear is the same mansion formerly owned by Didrich. While looking for things to steal to finance her boyfriend's drug dealing, Claudia finds a handwritten journal, which turns out to be Inge's memoirs, written just before her death in 1939. Inge was Severin's grandmother and he asks Claudia to read it to him. She begins reluctantly, but soon warms to the story and to the old man, and it is this story, read by both Claudia and Inge, that forms the voiceover at various points in the series. Later Claudia discovers that through her mother she is Sofia's great-great-great-great-granddaughter and that she and Severin are therefore distant cousins (presumably her great-great-great-grandfather was little Peter, who was Didrich's son, as was Severin's father). She tries to sell the jewellery she has stolen from Severin, but the jeweller becomes suspicious and calls the police and she flees back to the mansion. Tearfully she admits to Severin what she has done, but he says he knows and forgives her. As she reads the end of the story to him, she realises that he was with Inge at the end and wrote the whole thing down for her. Excitedly she asks him about it, but then realises that the old man has died as she was reading.

The 1864 war had a profound effect on Denmark, setting the country's course for its modern development. As a result, Tom Buk-Swienty, the series' historical consultant, believed that that sort of debate was inevitable.

History  It was initially a simple fountain built around a spring by the Military engineering after the occupation of Sétif. Its water was warm during winter and fresh in summer. But its progressive deterioration obliged the municipal council to think about its restoration. Especially M. Bastide, councilor, who addressed the issue of the reparation of the fountain in 1894. Two years later in 1896, the mayor of Sétif, M. Aubry, during a trip in Paris, asked the director of “Les Beaux-Arts” to donate a statue that will be used for the decoration of the fountain. In 1898, the mayor received a letter informing him that the statue made by Francis de Saint-Vidal was ready. The establishment of the statue and all work was finished in 1899.

He was the third president since its inception in 1928, the first person outside the Braniff family to be CEO of the airline. Beard, along with Braniff Board Chairman Fred Jones (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Ford dealer magnate), managed the airline conservatively, but recorded record growth and traffic statistics between 1954 and early 1965. Early years Beard was born September 5, 1906, in Toledo, Ohio. His parents were Hiram Edmund Beard and Mamie Reiser Beard. He attended Lake Forest Academy in Lake Forest, Illinois, where he completed grades nine through twelve. . Beard entered the United States Navy at the age of 16 as a Carpenter's Mate, after convincing them that he was 18 and therefore allowed to enlist. He signed up for aerial gunnery school and graduated third in a class of 400. He was assigned to the Great Lakes Training Station as a Chief Gunner's Mate instructor.  Education and early careers  Beard was honorably discharged from the military and continued his education at the university level. He returned to Lake Forest, Illinois, and attended nearby Lake Forest College to take basic courses. He then transferred to the University of Toledo to prepare for a career in the newspaper business. At Toledo he took courses including history, journalism, and English. He could not graduate from the university, as he left the school in 1922, to begin working to support his family. Charles Beard was offered a job as a reporter with the Chicago Daily News. He accepted and moved to Chicago at the age of 21. Beard's career in journalism was short-lived, and he became interested in acting. In 1922, he moved to New York City, and began his stage career on what was called the Subway Circuit, a group of legitimate New York theaters not on Broadway that featured shows that had left Broadway and were to be \\"going on tour\\" or shows being tried out in the Subway Circuit first to see if they would get a positive review on Broadway. In 1922, he met Rose Esther Wheaton of Kokomo, Indiana, and married her on February 23, 1923, in Toledo, Ohio, after moving from New York to Toledo where he accepted a position working in a warehouse. The pay was eighteen dollars per week and Beard remained with the warehouse job until 1928, eventually being promoted to sales manager. In 1929, Beard was offered a job in Chicago with the Chicago Air Traffic Association as a ticket manager. He did well there, and was asked to go to New York to open a consolidated ticket office for the Association in 1932. Beard was then offered a job with Northwest Airways in 1933, as Passenger Traffic Manager. He remained with the carrier for only a short period until an industry-wide economic slowdown caused him to be laid off. Beard then took various jobs at the Chicago World's Fair working for Chevrolet and finally Goodyear Tire and Rubber between 1933 and 1935. His career path would soon change and he would find his career home for the next thirty years at a small Oklahoma-based airline.  Braniff Airways, Inc.  Beard was hired by Braniff Airways, Inc. of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in October, 1935. His first position was as General Traffic Manager. Braniff grew from a small local service carrier to the tenth largest carrier in the world in terms or passengers carried, becoming a major international carrier in 1948 with service extended from the mainland US to the southern reaches of South America. In 1937 Beard would be elevated to Vice President of the Texas airline, and was also elected to the Board of Directors. His duties were administration of advertising, sales and airline traffic. He was further promoted in 1943 to the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors and in 1947 was again promoted to Executive Vice President. Beard was second in command behind company founder Thomas Elmer Braniff, and was in general running the company by the early 1950s. On January 11, 1954, company founder Tom Braniff was killed in a private plane crash while on a fishing trip. Beard was elected President of Braniff Airways with Fred Jones, an original Braniff investor, as Chairman of the Board. Tom Braniff had managed the company with a fatherly and personal touch and that, together with Beard's pragmatic management style, created the perfect team. Beard was now on his own and his overly conservative management methods began to alienate employee groups who had always felt that Braniff was a family, a belief publicized by Tom Braniff. In 1955 Beard wrote a biography of Tom Braniff Thomas E. Braniff (1883-1954) Southwest Pioneer in Air Transportation, published by the Newcomen Society Press, . Beard was, however, a personable manager and was known to arrive at a ticket counter or out in the hangar and extend his hand for a shake followed by \\"Hello, I'm Chuck Beard, and I work here too.\\" He led the company through the loss of their founder and began planning to take the airline into the fast approaching jet age. He ordered new Lockheed Electra four-engine turboprop aircraft and soon followed with five Boeing 707-227 pure jet aircraft for the longer haul routes of South America and mainland USA transcontinental operations. He also ordered 26 new British Aerospace Corporation BAC-One11 twin jet aircraft for the shorter haul low density operations. In 1964, Braniff International Airways was purchased by insurance magnate Troy V. Post's Greatamerica Corporation along with National Car Rental. The new owner decided that the airline was in need of a new management team, hiring Harding Lawrence, the Executive Vice President of Continental Airlines, to be President and Greatamerica's Ed Acker as Vice President. This led to Beard's retirement at the age of 64. In April, 1965, Charles Edmund Beard retired from Braniff after 30 remarkable years of service with the Texas-based carrier. He left on a high note and was at Dallas Love Field on March 11, 1966 for the first delivery of the new BAC-One11 twinjet from England. Beard was largely credited for increasing traffic and profits during each year he was President of Braniff from 1954 until early 1965. However, the phenomenal growth and profits that Braniff would produce after his departure would be the envy of the industry.

On May 12, 1982, the day Braniff International ceased operations, he suffered a major heart attack. He died on July 18, 1982, and was buried with his first wife, Rose E. Beard, who died of cancer in 1963. He had two children with her: a son, Rev. Robert D. Beard, and a daughter Barbara Rose Magee. After her death he married Doris Stewart Beard in 1964.

Established in 1953 by Victor Kamkin and his wife Elena Kamkina, the store maintained continuous operation throughout the Cold War era, specializing in material published in the Soviet Union. Company history =Establishment= The Victor Kamkin Bookstore was founded in 1953 by Viktor Petrovich Kamkin (1902-1974), a St. Petersburg-born son of an ethnic Russian financier,T.V. Kuznetsova, \\"Victor Petrovich Kamkin\\" in Деятели русского книжного дела в Китае в 1917-1949 гг.: Биогр. словарь (Figures of Russian Book Publishing Affairs in China, 1917-1949: Biographical Dictionary). Khabarovsk: Far-Eastern State Scientific Publishers, 1998; pg. 68. and his wife, Elena Andreevna Kamkina. As a young man Victor Kamkin was a volunteer in the White army headed by Admiral Alexander Kolchak in the Russian Civil War and was forced into emigration to Harbin, China in 1923 with the remnants of Kolchak's defeated forces. In Harbin Kamkin resumed his education, graduating from a Russian law school in 1928. Kamkin moved to Shanghai in 1929 where he entered the book publishing business as a partner in the firm V.P. Kamkin and A.P. Malyk, eventually publishing some 26 titles. In May 1937 Kamkin relocated to the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, where he established a Russian-language bookstore called \\"Znanie\\" (Knowledge). During the years of World War II Kamkin, still in Tianjin, worked as an assistant manager in an Italian- American publishing firm called \\"Chili Press.\\" Kamkin's publishing experience in China led him to work as a translator and technical assistant on the staff of the American military newspaper North China Marine, which was published in Tianjin. He moved with this publication to the eastern Chinese city of Qingdao in 1948 before successfully emigrating to the United States in 1952, settling in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. In America Kamkin returned to the world of book publishing and sales, first opening his bookstore specializing in Russian-language publications in 1953. In a field largely devoid of competition, Kamkin managed to gain a lucrative exclusivity agreement with the Soviet government for the importation of books and periodicals from the USSR.Christina Ling, \\"Russian Books Escape a Tragic Ending,\\" Los Angeles Times, March 17, 2002. The Victor Kamkin Bookstore was thus established as the primary source in the United States for Russian literature and political and economic titles of interest to scholars of Russian history and the contemporary Soviet Union. =Development= Kamkin's operation was expanded to include a second store, located at 149 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.Robert A. Karlowich, A Guide to Scholarly Resources on the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union in the New York Metropolitan Area. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 1990; pp. 78-79. By 1990 this New York City location included an inventory of approximately 1 million books, periodicals, vinyl records, and maps. =Termination= In 2002 flagging sales, increased competition, and escalating costs foreshadowed a forced end to the operation. With some two million unsold volumes remaining in inventory, the store became the object of widespread media coverage, and thousands of customers flooded the store. Some 60,000 volumes were additionally saved from incineration through the prompt action of Congressional Representative Connie Morella and Librarian of Congress James H. Billington. The reprieve proved to be short-lived, however, and although some more marketable titles made their way to the inventories of other retailers of Russian-language books, hundreds of thousands of volumes were ultimately destroyed at the time of the store's forced liquidation in 2006.

In 1983 they released an album by Rock-O-Rama. In 1980 Carlo Kallen, with some high school friends, founded his first band Adolf Streit & die NS-Verbrecher, which then became Psychorotz and then Brutal Verschimmelt. First concerts happened in Allgäu in the vicinity of the band B.Trug which, being the older punks, pulled the younger ones with them. B.Trug had at that time a record contract with the punk label Rock-O-Rama from Brühl and referred also Brutal Verschimmelt to that label. A demo recording was sent to Herbert Egoldt who gave the band a contract. Egoldt invited the band in May 1983 to Köln where they recorded their debut album in 16 hours. Egoldt himself produced the vinyl record. A cover draft showing an anti-war collage was rejected by Egoldt and substituted with a skeleton warrior with a mohawk fighting some kind of monster. The politically left lyrics of the band were not printed on the supplemental sheet, presumably because at that time Egoldt already fancied with the Rock Against Communism market. The band learned about this first after having received their 100 free records. Hereupon they spray- painted these record covers and added a supplemental sheet on which they explained the issue with the record cover. Shortly after release of the debut album the band split, after drummer Franz quit and the band didn't find a substitute. Carlo Kallen played later with the Ewings, Chili Confetti and Die Üblichen. Over the years the record became a sought-after rarity. The album was released for a second time 1990 without telling the band. In January 2013 a new release was published as a double record under the title Und die Zukunft ist doch rot at Höhnie Records. Besides the original album the record contains also the demo tape as well as the a live recording from 25. February 1982. On the occasion of this re-release three of the original members decided to go on a Germany tour as Brutal Verschimmelt with nine concerts in June 2013.

The Lowe sequence describes a set of sedimentary structures in turbidite sandstone beds that are deposited by high-density turbidity currents. It is intended to complement, not replace, the better known Bouma sequence, which applies primarily to turbidites deposited by low-density (i.e., low-sand concentration) turbidity currents. Description The Lowe sequence adds three layers labelled S1 through S3 to Bouma's terminology, with S1 being at the bottom and S3 at the top of a sandy turbidite bed. As with the Bouma sequence, each layer has a specific set of sedimentary structures and lithology. And like the Bouma sequence, the layers become finer grained from bottom to top. The layers are described as follows. * S3 - Massive to graded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstones that overlie the S2 layer represent deposition from a turbulent suspension. Sometimes dish structures and dewatering pipes are present. This layer is essentially the same as the Bouma A layer. * S2 - Inverse (reverse) graded, fine- to coarse-grained sandstone layers that overlie the S1 layer represent deposition as traction carpets, where grain-to-grain collisions are an important process. * S1 - Sandstone to conglomerate that are at the base of the turbidite and display parallel- laminated to cross-laminated beds that indicate traction deposition, wherein the current moves grains, pebbles and large clasts by rolling and sliding them across the surface beneath the flow. As previously mentioned, the Lowe sequence is intended to complement, not replace the Bouma sequence. Fine- grained turbidites resulting from low-density turbidity currents, in which the Bouma A through Bouma E terminology applies, are referred to in the Lowe classification as Ta through Te, in which the T acronym derives from \\"Traction\\". By contrast, because the S1-S3 terminology describes sand-rich turbidites deposited by high-density turbidity currents, the S acronym derives from \\"Sandstone\\". Lastly, R1-R3, which uses the same descriptive criteria as S1-S3, applies to conglomerates, wherein the R acronym derives from \\"Rubble\\". In practice, the S1-S3 terminology is widely used, Ta-Te, is used sometimes, and R1-R3 is seldom used. Processes Initially grains, pebbles and large clasts in a high-density turbidity current (i.e., a high-sand concentration flow), are moved by traction (rolling and sliding) to generate a coarse- grained to conglomeratic, parallel-laminated to cross-laminated S1 layer. However, as grains settle out and move closer together, grain-to-grain collisions begin to generate dispersive pressures that help prevent further settling. This results in smaller grains moving between larger grains and preferentially settling out beneath them. Thus, an inverse graded layer develops that is called a traction carpet, since it is thought to move as a single unit. At some point, the grains move close enough together that collisions no longer generate enough energy to keep the grains in suspension, and the entire layer freezes to create an S2 layer. This process can then repeat to create additional traction carpets. When grains move closer together and settle out, the water between them is displaced so that it can move upward into the flow, helping to keep grains above the traction carpets in suspension. Because the flow is in motion, this upward movement of fluid quickly becomes turbulent. When the energy of the flow drops low enough that it can no longer sustain turbulence, then the entire flow freezes to create the massive to normally graded S3 layer. Subsequent reworking of the top of this new deposit by overlying remnant currents, or by new currents unrelated to the original flow can create laminations that resemble the Bouma B layer. When reworking stops, suspension settling may deposit massive mudstone (Bouma E) directly on top of the laminated layer. Alternatively, if new sediment is introduced during this reworking phase, or if sediment is sufficiently remobilized and transported, then a more complete Bouma sequence may develop on top of the S3 layer.

The majority of Albanians lead a secular life and reject religious considerations to shape or condition their way of life. Irreligion in Albania arose after a period of rising anti-clericalism and secularization in the context of the rising Albanian nationalism in the late Ottoman Empire. While authors in this period had at times used invective against religion, the first public advocate of abandoning religion itself was Ismet Toto in 1934 followed by works by Anastas Plasari in 1935. Beginning in 1946 under communist rule in Albania, religion was first curtailed, and then public religious practice was outlawed in 1967 with the adoption of state atheism by Enver Hoxha although some private practice survived, and remained so until restrictions were first eased in 1985 and then removed in 1990 under his successor Ramiz Alia. Polling by UNDP showed that large majorities of Albanians agree that nationalism, lack of religion and the ban of religion during communist rule have helped build the foundations of religious tolerance. Nowadays, estimations of the size of the irreligious population vary widely. The self declared atheist population has been given figures ranging from 2.5% to 8% to 9% while other estimates of irreligiosity have reported figures of 39% declaring as \\"atheists\\"(9%) or \\"nonreligious\\"(30%), 61% not saying religion was \\"important\\" to their lives, and 72% \\"non-practicing\\". Many Albanians identified as Muslims or Christians have been found to practice only few or none of their faith's observances. Based on studies conducted in 2008, 2009 and 2015, Albania was found out to be the 20th least religious country in the world, with 39% of the population being religious. Religious identity in Albania is typically assigned by attribution, usually by familial history, rather than actual practice. Despite widespread lack of religious practice, , and while there are numerous public figures who openly declare themselves as atheist, there have also been complaints about negative public discourse toward atheists. History Faik Bey Konitza, Albanian national revivalist, who, two years after his conversion from Islam to Catholicism, wrote invective against all religions Enver Hoxha took Pashko Vasa's words literally, banning public religion though some private practice continued In the late Ottoman era, in order to overcome the religious divisions among Albanians between members of the local Sunni Muslim, Orthodox Christian, Bektashi Muslim and Roman Catholic Christian communities. Albanian nationalism, as it emerged, tended to urge Albanians to disregard religious differences, arguing that divisive sectarian religious fanaticism was alien to Albanian culture, and propagated what some historians refer to as a \\"'civic religion' of Albanianism\\".Duijzings, Ger. \\"Religion and the Politics of 'Albanianism'\\".

Page 62: \\"nationalist rhetoric declared it [religion/millet] to be unimportant (and that religious fanaticism to be alien to the Albanian soul)\\", page 61:\\"From the beginning, national ideologists propagated a kind of 'civil religion' of Albanianism, which was epitomized in Vaso Pasha's famous and influential nationalist poem O moj Shqypni (\\"O poor Albania\\"): \\"Awaken, Albanians, wake from your slumber. Let us all be brothers, swear an oath not to mind church or mosque. The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism!'\\" Vaso Pasha's famous poem O moj Shqypni told Albanians to \\"swear an oath not to mind [lit. \\"look to\\"] church or mosque\\" because \\"the faith of the Albanian is Albanianism\\" ( or in ). Albanian national revivalists in the 19th century such as Faik Konitza, Jani Vreto and Zef Jubani were often anti- clerical in rhetoric (Konitza said in 1897: \\"Every faith religion makes me puke\\", or ) but the first advocate of atheism in modern Albania is thought to have been Ismet Toto, a publicist and revolutionary whose 1934 anti-religious polemic, Grindje me Klerin (\\"Quarrel with the clergy \\"), was one of the first known works advocating against the practice of religion itself in the Albanian language. This was followed by Sëmundja Fetare (\\"The Disease of Religion\\"), another important anti-religious polemic by Anastas Plasari in 1935. The poem Blasfemi by Migjeni, who was considered to be an atheist by many, is also noted as being anti-religious. Another important figure before that time was the politician and mayor of Gjirokastër, Hysen Hoxha, the uncle of Enver Hoxha, who was considered to be an \\"Radical Atheist and anti-colonialist\\". His atheistic views influenced those of Enver Hoxha. It noted his reign, Ahmet Zogu embraced the renaissance ideals of unity, areligiosity and European modernity, and turned them into the very ideology of the state. Lasgush Poradeci wrote the atheistic poem \\"Eskursioni teologjik i Sokratit\\" During the communist era, Albania transitioned from a simple secular state to, in 1967, an entity upholding state atheism by which all public practice of religion was banned, although some private practice survived. The beginning of anti- religious policies implemented by the Communist Party of Albania was in August 1946, with the Agrarian Reform Law which nationalized most of the property of religious institutions, restricted the activity of religious institutions, and preceded the persecution of many clergy and believers and the expulsion of all foreign Catholic priests. In 1967 Enver Hoxha took Pashko Vasa's poem literally, turning the struggle against the divisiveness of religious affiliations into a struggle against religion itself in order to replace the divisive allegiances of the different religious communities with a unifying loyalty to the Communist state,Duijzings, Ger. \\"Religion and the Politics of 'Albanianism'\\". In Schwandler-Stevens and Jurgen, Albanian Identities: Myth and History. Page 62-63: \\"Enver Hoxha took Pashko Vasa's motto literally and made Albania the first 'atheist' state in the world... the struggle against religious divisions evolved into a fight against religion per se, which aimed to replace the diverging allegiances to religious communities with one undivided loyalty to the Communist Party. In spite of Enver Hoxha's radical Stalinist outlook, it was nationalism which provided the backbone to his policies: his harsh treatment of religious communities should primarily be seen in this light.\\" and he declared Albania an Atheist State, in which public religious practice was prohibited. By May 1967, all 2,169 religious buildings in Albania were nationalized, with many converted into cultural centers. A major center for anti-religious propaganda was the National Museum of Atheism () in Shkodër, the city viewed by the government as the most religiously conservative. After the death of Enver Hoxha in 1985, his successor, Ramiz Alia, adopted a more tolerant stance toward religious practice, calling it as \\"a personal and family matter.\\" Émigré clergymen were permitted to reenter the country in 1988 and officiate at religious services. Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian, visited Tirana in 1989, where she was received by the foreign minister and by Hoxha's widow. In December 1990, the ban on religious observance was officially lifted, in time to allow thousands of Christians to attend Christmas services, although other sources report that official termination of the ban was in 1991. In 2014, following a visit by Pope Francis to Albania, some intellectuals criticized what they perceived as negative rhetoric aimed at atheists, which increasingly linked atheism to \\"communist crimes\\" and spoke of atheism as \\"deficient\\", leading to complaints that the revival of an anti-atheist \\"taboo\\", among other issues. Demography =Prevalence of irreligion= Percentage of self-identified atheists by district in Albania based on the contested 2011 census Different surveys have produced considerably varying figures for size of the irreligious population of Albania. A simple majority of the population claimed \\"no religious alliance\\" in 1993 while the irreligious population was recorded at 74% in 1994 and more than 72% reported in 2005 as per religious practice (the remainder was 21% forms of Islam, 6% Orthodoxy and 3% Catholicism). In August 2012, Pew Research study found out that only 15 percent of the Muslim population for example, consider religion as a very important factor in their lives, which was the lowest percentage in the world amongst countries with significant Muslim populations. Another survey conducted by Gallup Global Reports 2010 shows that religion plays an important role in the lives of 39 percent of Albanians, and lists Albania as the thirteenth least religious country of the 114 surveyed. When asked if they were \\"religious\\" in 2016 by Badem-WIN and Gallup-International, 56% of Albanians said they were \\"religious\\", 30% said they were \\"not religious\\", 9% said \\"atheist\\", and 5% did not answer, with the same study finding that 80% of Albanians believe in the concept of \\"God\\", 40% believing in life after death, 57% believing in the existence of souls, 40% believing in hell, and 42% believing in heaven. Also in Albania only 36.8% of the males are circumcised, with the rate being 46.5% for those from Muslim background even though for Muslims in general it is an almost universal Islamic custom. WHO page 236https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR230/FR230.pdf WHO page 236 In the 2011 census, preliminary results showed 70% of Albanians refusing to declare belief in any of the listed faiths although the final results may have differed markedly from this in showing the majority of Albanians associated with Islam and Christianity while 16.3% of Albanians either didn't answer or were atheist and another 5.5% were listed as \\"believers without (specific) faith\\". The final results were nevertheless criticized by numerous communities as well as international organizations such as the Council of Europe, and news media noted concerns that there were reports where workers filled out the religion question without actually asking the participants, and that they used pencils which wasn't allowed, possibly leading to incorrect tallies; in the religious dimension, both the Orthodox and the Bektashis claimed they were vastly underrepresented. Regional comparison A 2018 survey based on three WIN/Gallup International polls and published in the UK Telegraph showed Albania was the least religious county in the Balkans, having a \\"Western-style\\" attitude to religion, with only 39% being religious. In contrast with Macedonia (88%), Kosovo (83%) and Romania (77%). In Serbia, Croatia, Greece the figure was from 70% to 72%. In Bosnia the figure was 65% religious, while in Bulgaria it was 52%. =Characteristics of the general population= Younger Albanians have been found to manifest more irreligion than their elders, making the trend in Albania opposite that found in Bosnia and those of Orthodox background have been found to report the lowest importance of \\"God in their lives\\", closely followed by those of Muslim background, while those of Catholic background showed greater \\"importance of God in their lives\\" (for example, 54.5% of those of Catholic background said that God was \\"very important in their lives\\", compared to 26.7% of Orthodox and 35.6% of Muslims). A 2008 medical study in Tirana on the relationship between religious observance and acute coronary syndrome found out that 67% of Muslims and 55% of Christians were completely religiously non-observant. The regular attendance of religious institutions (at least once every 2 weeks) was low in both denominations (6% in Muslims and 9% in Christians), and weekly attendance was very low (2% and 1%, respectively). Frequent praying (at least 2 to 3 times per week) was higher in Christians (29%) than in Muslims (17%). Praying several times daily (as required of devout Muslims) was rare (2% in Muslims and 3% in Christians). Regular fasting during Ramadan or Lent was similarly low in Muslims and Christians (5% and 6%, respectively). Generally Christians in the study were more observant then Muslims (26% vs 17%). A 2015 study on the Albanian youth aged 16–27 found that total of 80 percent of young people in Albania are not religion practitioners and practice their religion only during the main religious holidays and festivities. Specifically 23 percent of the respondents never practised their religion, while 61 percent practised it only in religious holidays. From the rest, 11 percent practiced it 1-2 times a week, while 5 percent practiced it everyday. A 2016 study on homophobia among Albanian students found that a decrease in the level of religious belief was correlated with decreased detection of homophobia, while no difference was observed between those who identified with Catholicism or Islam. A study by the United Nations Development Programme in 2018 showed that 62.7% of Albanians do not practice religion while 37.3% do practice it. =Prevalence of specific beliefs= In the European Values Survey in 2008, Albania had the highest unbelief in the life after death among all other countries, with 74.3% not believing in it. According to the WIN/Gallup International study in 2016 about the beliefs of the Albanians: *80% believed in a god *40% believed in Life after death *57% believed that people have a soul *40% believed in hell *42% believed in heaven Society Ben Blushi, self-identified atheist politician In Albania, religious identity is typically defined by attribution, typically via one's familial religious background, rather than actual adherence,De Rapper, Gilles. \\"Religion in Post-Communist Albania: Muslims, Christians, and the idea of 'culture' in Devoll, Southern Albania\\". Anthropological Notebooks 14, 2(2008) : Pages 31-45. Page 33: \\"Notwithstanding the level of religious practice and feelings (which of course varies from one individual to another), everyone is aware of belonging – at least by family origin – to a particular 'religion' (fe), Muslim or Christian. It thus possible to say that in Devoll, as elsewhere in Albania and the Balkans, one belongs to a religious community by attribution rather than by adherence. Belonging to a religious community, or 'religion', is not only a matter of faith. The social implications of religious attribution are visible at different levels of social life.\\" and regardless of an individual's religiosity or lack thereof, it can still be socially significant, as it is occasionally linked to historical socioeconomic and cultural factors in some contexts. Ismail Kadare, the famous novelist, has declared himself an atheist\\"Born near the Greek border in Gjirokaster in 1936, of two Muslim parents, Kadare claims to be an atheist. However, much of his language, especially when he talks of forgiving the old Stalinist order rather than seeking revenge, is Christian. The paradox, then, is that Kadare is a humanist who claims that the greatest riches of Albanian culture derive from its Christian tradition.\\" John Murray, 'The Orphan's Voice', The Independent (London), 25 January 1998, Page 25.Muslim Identity and the Balkan State, Hugh Poulton, Suha Taji-Farouki, 1997, , google print, p. 133. Some well-known Albanian contemporary atheists include Ismail Kadare, Dritëro Agolli, Ben Blushi, Fatos Lubonja, Mustafa Nano, Saimir Pirgu, Diana Çuli,Elton Deda Fatos Tarifa, , , Gilman Bakalli,Blendi Fevziu, and . Some antipathy toward overt atheists has been detected in surveys—in one edition of the World Values Survey, 19.7% of Catholics, 17% of Muslims, and 9.4% of Orthodox \\"strongly agreed\\" that \\"those who don't believe in God\\" are unfit for office (total agreeing: 47.3% of Catholics, 46.9% of Muslims and 37% of Orthodox). According to a 2011 study by Ipsos, 53.5% of the Albanians found atheists \\"similar\\" to them while 34.1% found them \\"different\\". Some Albanian intellectuals have complained about the revival of a \\"taboo\\" against atheism as seen in the rhetoric surrounding the 2014 visit of the Pope to the country where atheism was linked to \\"communist crimes\\" and seen as \\"deficient\\", and that the new Albanian constitution claims trust in God as a \\"universal\\" value despite the significant number of people who don't believe in God in the country.. Quote: \\"Në diskursin dominant në Shqipëri është bërë krejt e natyrshme që ateizmi të paraqitet si diçka e mangët në krahasim me religjionin. Në anën tjetër religjioni të paraqitet si një pasuri shtesë në jetën e njeriut. Pasuri që ka qenë e ndaluar për popullin shqiptar gjatë periudhës totalitariste. Ky deformim në hartën semantike të diskursit shqiptar u shpërfaq krejt qartë edhe gjatë vizitës së Papës në Shqipëri. Gati në të gjitha fjalimet u përmend me të madhe ajo që u quajt \\"krimet e ateizmit komunist\\". Këtu në fakt e kishin fjalën për krimet ndaj të gjitha ideologjive që ishin bërë gjatë periudhës kur Shqipëria kishte diktaturë. Por me këtë formulimin \\"krimet e ateizmit komunist\\" po dilte thuaja ka qenë ateizmi ai që ka shtyrë liderët e asaj kohe të ndërtojnë një sistem totalitar represiv. \\"; Quote : \\"E dyta është fjalia \\"me besim te Zoti dhe/ose te vlera të tjera universale\\", sikur besimi në zot të jetë në kategori të vlerave universale. Çka nuk është*. Po të ishte besimi në zot vlerë universale, atëhere si do të kategorizoheshin ata që nuk besojnë në zot? Pa vlera universale? Mos të harrojmë që njerëzit që nuk besojnë në zot nuk janë të paktë në numër. \\" There have also been complaints about discourse both in Albania and by foreigners which cites statistics of the traditional population shares of the different Muslim and Christian sects present, which would show the country to be a 100% religious country, thus erasing the presence of the irreligious. Prime Minister Edi Rama (himself of Catholic and Orthodox extraction with a Muslim wife\\"Edi Rama: Jam katolik, fëmijët e parë i kam ortodoks, gruan e kam myslimane\\". Telegrafi. 20 February 2015. Quote: \\"Unë jam katolik se gjyshja ime donte të isha katolik edhe pse burri i saj, gjyshi im ishte ortodoks, dhe kisha nuk e miratonte martesën. Ajo i shkroi Selisë së Shenjtë për të marrë leje për tu martuar me këtë burrë që ajo e përshkroi si ateist, megjithëse ai ishte ortodoks dhe u zotua para kishës se fëmijët e saj do të ishin katolikë. Kështu ndodhi. Babai im dhe fëmijët e tjerë ishin katolike. Kurse gruaja ime është myslimane. Dy fëmijët e mi te pare janë ortodoksë kurse djali i vogël katolik. Kjo është harmonia fetare në Shqipëri\\", ka treguar Rama\\" and having expressed doubt about the existence of God) has asserted that Albania's traditional religious harmony, traditionally defined as being between the four main faiths of Sunni Islam, Orthodox Christianity, Bektashi Islam and Roman Catholic Christianity, should also include the irreligious. However in a 2018 public speech he has used the word pafe (infidel) as a slur against his political opponents.

Advocates of earning to give contend that maximizing the amount one can donate to charity is an important consideration for individuals when deciding what career to pursue. Proponents In the 1996 book Living High and Letting Die, the philosopher Peter Unger wrote that it was morally praiseworthy and perhaps even morally required for people in academia who could earn substantially greater salaries in the business world to leave academia, earn the greater salaries, and donate most of the extra money to charity. Moral philosopher Peter Singer has laid the foundations for effective altruism and earning to give in his 1971 essay \\"Famine, Affluence and Morality\\" and since advocated for donating considerable amounts of one's income to effective charitable organizations. Singer is a public proponent of effective altruism and endorsed earning to give in his 2013 TED talk. Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University William MacAskill promoted earning to give as one possible high impact career in several news articles and in his 2015 book Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference. MacAskill is the co-founder and president of 80,000 Hours, a nonprofit which conducts research on careers with positive social impact and provides career advice. Initially, the organization recommended earning to give as a career path with a high impact potential for effective altruists, though more recently it has deemphasised this approach, in favour of alternative paths like research, advocacy or policy reform. In practice Many of the people who practice earning to give consider themselves to be part of the effective altruism community. Some donate up to 50% of their income, more than the 10% required for the basic Giving What We Can pledge. They may live frugally to donate more money. Jobs in finance, particularly in quantitative trading, are popular for those pursuing earning to give. Debate David Brooks criticized the concept in his New York Times opinion column, arguing that, while altruists may start doing \\"earning to give\\" to realize their deepest commitments, their values may erode over time, becoming progressively less altruistic. Similarly, John Humphrys criticised this idea on the BBC Today programme, saying that people interested in becoming wealthy tend to be selfish and that idealistic young people will become cynical as they age. In addition, Brooks objected to the view on which altruists should turn themselves \\"into a machine for the redistribution of wealth.\\" Peter Singer responded to these criticisms in his book The Most Good You Can Do by giving examples of people who have been earning to give for years without losing their altruistic motivation. William MacAskill also defended the practice against Brooks' criticisms in The Washington Post, arguing that even Friedrich Engels was earning to give to support the work of anti-capitalist Karl Marx financially. Dana Goldstein has also criticized earning to give, prompting a response from Reihan Salam. Another concern was raised in the Oxford Left Review by Pete Mills, who wrote that lucrative careers perpetuate an unjust system. Media coverage Earning to give has been discussed in a number of news and media outlets including BBC News, Quartz, the Washington Post, the New York Times, The Atlantic, The Guardian, and Aeon Magazine.

Dull was instrumental in the peaceful integration of Georgia Tech, and he oversaw many improvements with student life during his tenure at Georgia Tech. Early life and education Dull was born in Connellsville, Pennsylvania, to James and Anna Jean Dull. He attended Slippery Rock State Teacher's College and graduated in 1950 with a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Health/Physical Education. From 1950 to 1952 he served in the US Army, then studied at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he earned a Master of Science degree in Higher Education with certification in Counseling and Guidance. He met Gay Kimbro, who was then teaching in the Miami University Laboratory School, at a square dance club meeting at Miami University in 1954. They were married on June 8, 1955, in Atlanta and then returned to Miami University where Dull continued to work with Student Affairs and residence hall activities. Georgia Tech After serving five years at Miami, Dull accepted a position at Georgia Tech as Assistant Dean of Students after meeting with Dean Griffin, who described the many opportunities for improvements needed at Georgia Tech. Dull and his wife lived in Towers Residence Hall for the next 3 years; during this time their two sons were born. Three years after arriving at Georgia Tech he was made Associate Dean of Students. President Harrison promoted him to Dean of Students in 1964 after Dean Griffin retired. Dull was responsible for all disciplinary processes and policies, and he had administrative responsibility of all Student Personnel Services and programs outside the curriculum. Dull was also involved with many campus organizations during his tenure, such as the Ramblin' Reck Club and the Georgia Tech cheerleaders; he bought the original Ramblin' Wreck, a 1930 Ford Cabriolet. Dull improved freshman orientation and was the adviser for the student government. Dull also started and coached the Wreckettes Dancing and Drill team, and he organized a national championship-winning College Bowl team. In an extracurricular program, Dull taught students beginning ballroom dancing for 30 years. Mrs. Dull was also involved with Georgia Tech. For example, she helped bring sororities to campus. Mr. and Mrs. Dull are both honorary alumni, and they wrote a book, \\"It’s For You, Thirty-One Years of Our Life On the Georgia Tech Campus.\\" Dull served nine presidents during his career at Georgia Tech. =Integration= Dull played an important role in the successful racial integration of Georgia Tech in 1961. After riots occurred during when black students enrolled at the University of Georgia in January 1961, Dull was assigned to develop a plan to accomplish integration at Georgia Tech peacefully. Implementation of Dull's plans began on January 17, when university president Edwin Harrison called a meeting of the student body at which he told students that the institution would not condone riots, demonstrations or disturbances, or that any student who instigated such activity could be faced with \\"immediate dismissal.\\" In May 1961, Harrison announced that three black students had been accepted for fall admission, and Dull started a series of interactions with student leaders and organizations aimed at winning their support and cooperation for integration. After several months of planning by Georgia Tech's president and staff, integration was achieved that fall without any incidents. Georgia Tech became the first university in the Deep South to desegregate peacefully and without a court order, with Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr., and Lawrence Michael Williams becoming Georgia Tech's first three African American students. In later years, Harrison credited Dull with the institution's success in achieving integration without incident. =Buzz= The Ramblin' Wreck with cheerleaders and Buzz at a football game in 2007 Dull realized that Tech needed a mascot so he worked with the Ramblin' Wreck Club to design the costume and personality of \\"Buzz,\\" the Yellow Jacket Mascot. =Ramblin' Wreck= By the time Dull came to campus, the Ramblin' Wreck, initially just a general name for any Georgia Tech-engineered vehicle, had come to mean Dean Field's 1914 Ford Model T. Dull took the initiative to find a designated car to fill the role, and found it in a 1930 Ford Cabriolet. The Athletic Association purchased it and introduced it at the first home football game in 1961. Dull spotted the 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Residence Hall in 1960. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. Johnson had purchased the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, restored the car as a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team was in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers Residence Hall, and went to watch Craig compete. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dean Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson agreed to take $1,000 but would eventually return the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was unveiled September 30, 1961 at Grant Field in front of 43,501 Tech fans as it led the team onto the field against Rice University. The team prevailed 24–0 and the Wreck became an instant success within the Tech family. The Wreck has since led the team onto the field for every home game. Dean James E. Dull DramaTech Theatre =DramaTech= Dull supported the development of DramaTech during his tenure, and he helped search for a permanent location for Georgia Tech's drama program. DramaTech had been housed in several different buildings over the years, such as the old YMCA, two buildings behind The Varsity, and in a church on the corner of Hemphill Street. Finally, the Dean James E. Dull DramaTech Theatre was built in 1992 adjacent to the Robert Ferst Center for the Arts and named in his honor. Dull and his wife Gay established the 'Gay K. Dull Scholarship' which is awarded to two students each year who have participated with DramaTech programs. =Other construction= GT Student Center and Kessler Campanile President Harrison provided support to Dean Dull with his efforts to renovate all buildings in Area I on the Georgia Tech campus. Dull also helped raise funds to build a student center. In addition, Dull was instrumental in the building of the Student Athletic Complex, the Student Services Building, and a student health center. =Fraternity Award= Georgia Tech provides the 'James E. Dull Overall Fraternity Award' as annual recognition for the most accomplished member of the Greek community for the previous year, including involvement around campus in non-Greek activities. The award ranks fraternity chapters on the following seven categories: Scholarship, Leadership, Philanthropy/Community Service, Intramurals, Greek Week, Homecoming, and Educational Programming.

The first episode went to air on 3 July 2013. Hosted by comedian Sammy J, the series featured a mix of live studio performances and pre-recorded sketches. These included topical impersonations, satirical characters, musical comedy and special guests in front of a live studio audience. Executive Producers are Rick Kalowski and Greg Quail who also produced comedy series At Home With Julia.http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/05/sammy-j-to-host-wednesday-night- fever.html The house band was heavy metal outfit Boner Contention, fronted by comedian and musician Dave Eastgate. The show went into pre-production while Julia Gillard was still Prime Minister, and it was originally planned to include a recurring weekly topical parody of Downton Abbey (entitled \\"Downton Abbott\\"), with Tony Abbott as the Duke and Julia Gillard as the Duchess, but Gillard was deposed by Kevin Rudd shortly before the series went to air, necessitating a hasty rewrite of the sketch, and it was phased out after a few episodes. Other notable features included a weekly musical number to close the show, featuring a cast member impersonating a well-known public figure. These included 'Clive Palmer' (played by Heath Franklin) performing a parody version of Wings' \\"Live and Let Die\\" (retitled \\"Live and Let Clive\\"), and 'Gina Rinehart' (Genevieve Morris) performing a parody of Guns N' Roses \\"Sweet Child o' Mine, retitled \\"Sweet Child o'Mines\\".

The stiffness tensor of the body is C0 and that of the inclusion is Ci. When the body and the inclusion have different elastic properties the inclusion is called an inhomogeneity. A transformation strain changes the shape and size of the inclusion. In continuum mechanics, Eshelby's inclusion problem refers to a set of problems involving ellipsoidal elastic inclusions in an infinite elastic body. Analytical solutions to these problems were first devised by John D. Eshelby in 1957.Eshelby (1957).Eshelby (1959). Eshelby started with a thought experiment on the possible stress, strain, and displacement fields in a linear elastic body containing an inclusion. In particular, he considered the situation in which the inclusion has undergone a transformation (such as twinning or localized thermal expansion) but its change in shape and size are restricted because of the surrounding material. In that situation, the inclusion and the surrounding material remains in a stressed state. Also the strain states in the body and the inclusion are potentially inhomogeneous and complicated. Eshelby found that the resulting elastic field can be found using a \\"sequence of imaginary cutting, straining and welding operations.\\" Eshelby's finding that the strain and stress field inside the ellipsoidal inclusion is uniform and has a closed-form solution, regardless of the material properties and initial transformation strain (also called the eigenstrain), has spawned a large amount of work in the mechanics of composites. The results find their applications in the effective medium theory for heterogeneous elastic materials.

He is also a book illustrator; his drawings appeared in Eucalypts of Western Australia's Wheatbelt by French MalcolmFrench, Malcolm. Eucalypts of Western Australia's Wheatbelt: Eucalypts of Western Australia. Padbury: Malcolm French, 2012. and Native Eucalypts of South Australia by Dean Nicolle.Nicolle, Dean. Native Eucalypts of South Australia. 2013. Community involvement A third generation Blyth dweller, Ian Roberts is active in a local farming community in Blyth (pop. 306) located in the Clare Valley region, South Australia, situated north of Adelaide. He was a member of a District Council of Blyth, the Blyth Hospital Board and Country Fire Service, & in 2013 is still a member of the Blyth Development Board, BlythCinema, Blyth Progress Association, & Blyth Town Management. He was also the instigator of Blyth Cinema, a community based movie theater opened in May 2005 in a former Masonic Hall, and continues to be its manager. The Blyth local and regional (community and private) solar photovoltaic power development was another of Roberts' projects, through his chairmanship of Blyth Development Board. This involved the installation of 2.7 kW of solar power on each of 7 community sporting club-rooms and over 60 private installations from 1KW to 3KW systems and took place in 2009. Roberts was the prime mover behind the Brooks Lookout development, which was opened on 21 October 2001. This Lookout has sweeping views to 100 km across the Blyth plains and includes a reserve that protects valuable remnant native vegetation. Roberts was also involved in the establishment of the Padnaindi Reserve in Blyth. The original development took place in 1984; Roberts designed the 16 panels for the laser cut fence surrounding the park which were installed in 2012. Honors and recognitions In 2013, Ian Roberts received a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM). Previously, he was acknowledged in 2007 as a member of the group of Blyth's Cinema volunteers with the inaugural regional Emu Award and in 2008 travelled to Melbourne to accept the national Westpac Community Idol 2008 Award for the Blyth Cinema. The author of Native Eucalypts of South Australia Dr. Dean Nicolle, director and head of research at Currency Creek Arboretum (CCA), which is a world-known eucalypti research facility, acknowledged Robert's help in producing the book, which included 97 watercolor paintings by Ian Roberts. Nicolle wrote that Ian Roberts \\"not only painted and allowed reproduction of all the seedlings illustrated in this book, but also grew most of these seedlings at a community nursery at Blyth\\".

Early life  Melody Prochet was born and raised in Puyricard, France. She had a musical upbringing, learning to play the piano and the viola at a young age, the latter of which she says influenced her \\"orchestral\\" approach to songwriting.  Career  = 2010 - 2011: My Bee's Garden and The Narcoleptic Dancers = In 2010, Prochet released her first album, Hunt the Sleeper, as part of the band My Bee's Garden. Prochet, under the name Melody Van Kappers, formed The Narcoleptic Dancers in 2010 with Dutch musician Anton Louis Jr. They released their only album Never Sleep in 2011. Prochet and Louis claimed to the press that they were half-siblings born to a Dutch professional soccer player named Johnny Van Kappers, and that they discovered a shared passion for music after meeting at their father's funeral in the early 2000s; the validity of these statements is unclear, as there appears to be no record of Johnny Van Kappers' existence or soccer career. = 2012 - present: Melody's Echo Chamber = Prochet released her eponymous debut album as Melody's Echo Chamber in 2012. The album was produced by Australian musician and Tame Impala frontman Kevin Parker. It peaked at number 61 on the US Billboard Heatseekers Album Chart and generally received very positive reviews from critics. Q Magazine rated the album 8/10, calling it an \\"intoxicating listen that's well worth experiencing for yourself.\\" Drowned in Sound's Dom Gourlay awarded the album 9/10 and stated: \\"Whatever happens next, she can rest assured safe in the knowledge that together with her beau they've conjured up one of 2012's--or any other year in recent memory--finest debuts.\\" While the album launched Prochet into mainstream international success, reporters and critics displayed an overwhelming focus on Parker's contributions, particularly the album's similarities to Tame Impala's album Lonerism from the same year, rather than Prochet's work, leaving her \\"frustrated\\" and regretful that \\"as a friend and producer [Parker] never acknowledged it and didn’t do anything to protect me or my work.\\" In the years following the release of her debut album Prochet went on several tours, playing shows around the world. She was scheduled to play at the Levitation festival in Austin, Texas in 2015, but her performance was later cancelled due to visa issues. In 2014 Prochet released the single \\"Shirim\\", which was thought to be a teaser for her next studio album; however, she remained on musical hiatus for nearly three years. On April 3rd, 2017, Prochet's 30th birthday, she announced her second album Bon Voyage and released its second single \\"Cross My Heart.\\" This was followed by \\"Breathe In/Breathe Out\\" one year later in April 2018. Bon Voyage was released on June 15, 2018 to \\"generally favorable reviews\\" from critics. It was recorded in Sweden and produced by Swedish musicians Reine Fiske of Dungen and Fredrik Swahn of The Amazing. Prochet did not tour or play any live shows following the album's release, citing a desire to focus on her family. Prochet told Pitchfork shortly after the release of Bon Voyage that she was taking a break from writing music, stating \\"There is always music inside of me. Maybe I’ll let it [stay] in there for a while.\\" However, in December 2019, she announced via Instagram that she was working on a third studio album, again with Fiske and Swahn. Prochet's musical style has been described as dream pop, space rock, psychedelic rock, and shoegaze. Music critics have compared her work with that of Stereolab, Broadcast, and Cocteau Twins.  Personal life  Prochet dated Kevin Parker from 2012 until 2014. Their breakup famously resulted in Parker's most commercially successful album to date, Currents; this caused a period of extreme anguish for Prochet, as private details of their relationship were heard by millions and some Tame Impala fans harassed her on social media claiming she was responsible for Parker's sadness and guilt. Prochet has stated that she and Parker were working on a second album together before their breakup, but she \\"let it go\\" because of the painful memories it caused her. On June 27, 2017, a statement was released by Prochet's family that she had been in a serious accident and would need to be in the hospital for several months, resulting in the cancellation of her upcoming tour. Her family later provided an update saying she experienced a brain aneurysm and broken vertebrae. No further details about the accident were ever released. This incident pushed back the release date of Bon Voyage, originally slated to be in the spring of 2017, to June 2018. Prochet is married, though the identity of her husband is not publicly known. In August 2018 she welcomed her first child, a daughter named Alma.

The film revolves around a Catholic serial killer played by Yam, who after witnessing his wife's death, believes he is given the duty to kill suicidal people to bring them peace and thereby allow them to enter heaven. Plot One day, a man brings luggage to a police report room. From the luggage, he takes out some files, a plastic wrapped scalpel and a half-filled vial, one by one, and methodically places them in front of the police while confessing that he killed a man and wants to surrender. He has actually been involved in many murder cases during the past few months. The man's name is Lee Leung, who claims he is not a serial killer but an angel of God. This is God's test for him, first to have his wife commit suicide to end the pain of leukemia, and then to have him suffer from the pain of losing his wife; if suffering people want to end their lives themselves, they would have to suffer in hell; life and death is a tragedy, and there is no way out. Lee Leung begins to pay attention to online news stories about suicides and incidentally finds a discussion site about suicide, where people share various methods of committing it, and some would also talk about their reasons for committing it, including some for their family, and others because they have lost the meaning of life. He understands the suffering of people wanting to commit suicide, and believes his mission is to help those people escape from pain. He asked God to give him strength to redeem these suffering people: since they choose to die, he will perform the duty of murder, so the victim can be murdered instead of committing suicide and that they may enter heaven after they die. He meets four suicidal people online and communicates to them one by one and fulfils their wishes. When Lee Leung opines that he is executing for God's will, he finds that his faith and plan of salvation suffers from an impact he is unable to withstand.

With a rights based, participatory, non-institutional approach the organisation endeavours to educate and impart life skills to vulnerable children so that they become self-reliant. Genesis and principles The idea behind Butterflies began in the 1980s, when Rita Panicker Pinto began interacting with children living on the streets and platforms of Mumbai. She noticed that these children were extremely vulnerable. Rita along with Asst. Professor P. Nangia did a Situational Analysis of Study of Street and Working Children in Delhi for UNICEF in 1988. Thus was born Butterflies with the core value and belief that it must be a democratic organisation and children's voices have to be listened to seriously. Children's participation in decision making processes is central to Butterflies’ work ethos. It is non institutional in its approach as Butterflies believes that institutionalising children should be the last resort. The importance of strengthening families and communities to protect and take care of children is strongly advocated as families are the first line of defense for children. Butterflies’ emphasis is on supporting children to continue schooling, impart life skills education so that they can exit the cycle of generational poverty and illiteracy. Since its humble beginnings in 1989, Butterflies has grown into a movement with 140 staff reaching out to almost 3,300 children every year and has touched the lives of almost 71,000 children till date. Even as they grow in numbers, the Butterflies story still centres around protecting and empowering every street and working child in India. Interventions Over the years Butterflies has initiated a number of innovative interventions in the field and partnered with various government and non-government agencies to garner support for children. The main programmes are Education, Children's Development Khazana (life skills programme teaching financial management), Child Health Cooperative (CHC), Children's Media (Butterflies Broadcasting Children), Resilience Centre and Childline (1098, 24-hour helpline for children in crisis), Night Shelters for homeless children, vocational training (Butterflies School of Culinary and Catering and Computer Education), Chakhle Dilli catering service, Advocacy and Research Centre (ARC), Alliance Building, Right to Play and Child Social Protection Committee Programme. In the year 2009, on a request by the Delhi High Court, Butterflies also ran a programme for children in conflict with law in an Observation Home for Boys in New Delhi. Butterflies reaches out directly to over 3,300 street and street connected children in Delhi and Uttarakhand. Butterflies is also a member of Family for Every Child, a global alliance of local civil society organisations working together to improve the lives of vulnerable children around the world. Butterflies flagship programme is the Children's Development Khazana (CDK), a life skills education programme that educates children on democratic values and financial management (educating children on importance of budgeting, saving and prioritizing needs). Founded in 2001, CDK is a cooperative managed and owned by children and as of March 2018, CDK is operational in eight countries across the world and in nine states of India with a total membership of 16,912 children (8,981 boys and 7,923 girls) and savings amounting to $ 82,061. All the money is saved in mainstream banks. Since 1995, Butterflies has also been running the Child Health Co-operative, for street children where they discuss their health problems and chalk out strategies to combat health problems. The cooperative is based on the principle that children can collectively advocate for services. One of the key objectives of CHC is to promote safe and healthy living among children and communities. As of March 2018, CHC is operational in eight countries across the world and in ten states of India with a total membership of 9,354 children (4,984 boys and 4,370 girls). Outreach Butterflies reaches out directly to over 3,300 street and working children in Delhi and Uttarakhand. Through the Children's Cooperatives Programmes (CDK and CHC), Butterflies is also present in eight countries (Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Madagascar and Ghana) and ten states and Union Territories of India (Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Rajasthan, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Maharashtra). The organisation's core belief is children have a right to be heard, to be consulted, to take their views seriously in all decisions that concern them. In keeping with this core value Butterflies facilitated a children's forum in Delhi called Delhi Child Rights Club in 1998 which has children from 13 NGOs as its members. DCRC has commented on various government policies and legislation related to children; the very recent being the draft national policy on children. DCRC has taken up the issue of right to play with the mayors and chief minister of Delhi to get access to pla grounds and open spaces for children to play. In addition, Butterflies has facilitated and is the convenor of National Alliance of Grassroots NGOs for Protection of Child Rights (NAGN), an alliance of 39 grassroots community based organizations from 13 states. Butterflies has also facilitated and is the convenor of South Asian Alliance of Grassroots NGOs (SAAGN) having 136 members from the region. The reason for coming together as an alliance was for the voices of small grassroots organisations to be heard and for Butterflies to lobby for the rights of the most marginalized communities. Best practices are also shared among alliance members who are constantly learning and finding ways to be creative and innovative in their functioning. Butterflies is also a member of Family for Every Child, a global alliance of local civil society organisations working together to improve the lives of vulnerable children around the world. Rita Panicker, executive director of Butterflies is currently the vice-chair of the board.

In the case of enzymes, this approach has been called paleoenzymology (British: palaeoenzymology). The method consists of the synthesis of an ancestral gene and expression of the corresponding ancestral protein. The idea of protein 'resurrection' was suggested in 1963 by Pauling and Zuckerkandl.Pauling, L. & Zuckerkandl, E. Chemical paleogenetics: molecular restoration studies of extinct forms of life. Acta Chem. Scand. supl. 17, S9–S16 (1963) Acta Chemica Scandinavica Online Archive Some early efforts were made in the eighties-nineties, led by the laboratory of Steven A. Benner, showing the potential of this technique – one that only started to be fulfilled in the post-genomic era. Thanks to the improvement of algorithms and of better sequencing and synthesis techniques, the method was developed further in the early 2000s to allow the resurrection of a greater variety of and much more ancient genes. Over the last decade, ancestral protein resurrection has developed as a strategy to reveal the mechanisms and dynamics of protein evolution.Pearson, Helen (March 21, 2012) \\"Prehistoric proteins: raising the dead\\" Nature (London)  Principles  An illustration of a phylogenetic tree and how it plays in conceptualising how ASR is conducted. Algorithm to reconstruct ancestral sequences 1,2, and 3 (referring to figure above). The ancestral sequence of sequence 1 can be reconstructed from B and C, as long as at least one outgroup is available, e.g. D or E. For example, sequences B and C are different in position 4, but since sequences D and E have a C in that position, sequence 1 most likely had a C as well. Sequence 3 cannot be completely reconstructed without an additional outgroup sequence (uncertainty indicated by an \\"X\\"). Unlike conventional evolutionary and biochemical approaches to studying proteins, i.e. the so-called horizontal comparison of related protein homologues from different branch ends of the tree of life; ASR probes the statistically inferred ancestral proteins within the nodes of the tree – in a vertical manner (see diagram, right). This approach gives access to protein properties that may have transiently arisen over evolutionary time and has recently been used as a way to infer the potential selection pressures that resulted in the present day sequences seen today. ASR has been used to probe the causative mutation that resulted in a protein's neofunctionalization after duplication by first determining that said mutation was located between ancestors '5' and '4' on the diagram (illustratively) using functional assays. In the field of protein biophysics, ASR has also been used to study the development of a protein's thermodynamic and kinetic landscapes over evolutionary time as well as protein folding pathways by combining many modern day analytical techniques such as HX/MS. These sort of insights are typically inferred from several ancestors reconstructed along a phylogeny – referring to the previous analogy, by studying nodes higher and higher (further and further back in evolutionary time) within the tree of life. Most ASR studies are conducted in vitro, and have revealed ancestral protein properties that seem to be evolutionarily desirable traits – such as increased thermostability, catalytic activity and catalytic promiscuity. These data have been accredited to artifacts of the ASR algorithms, as well as indicative illustrations of ancient Earth's environment – often, ASR research must be complemented with extensive controls (usually alternate ASR experiments) to mitigate algorithmic error. Not all studied ASR proteins exhibit this so-called 'ancestral superiority'. The nascent field of 'evolutionary biochemistry' has been bolstered by the recent increase in ASR studies using the ancestors as ways to probe organismal fitness within certain cellular contexts – effectively testing ancestral proteins in vivo. Due to inherent limitations in these sorts of studies – primarily being the lack of suitably ancient genomes to fit these ancestors in to, the small repertoire of well categorised laboratory model systems, and the inability to mimic ancient cellular environments; very few ASR studies in vivo have been conducted. Despite the above mentioned obstacles, preliminary insights into this avenue of research from a 2015 paper, have revealed that observed 'ancestral superiority' in vitro were not recapitulated in vivo of a given protein. ASR presents one of a few mechanisms to study biochemistry of the Precambrian era of life (>541Ma) and is hence often used in 'paleogenetics'; indeed Zuckerandl and Pauling originally intended ASR to be the starting point of a field they termed 'Paleobiochemistry'. Methodology Several related homologues of the protein of interest are selected and aligned in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), a 'phylogenetic tree' is constructed with statistically inferred sequences at the nodes of the branches. It is these sequences that are the so- called 'ancestors' – the process of synthesising the corresponding DNA, transforming it into a cell and producing a protein is the so-called 'reconstruction'. Ancestral sequences are typically calculated by maximum likelihood, however Bayesian methods are also implemented. Because the ancestors are inferred from a phylogeny, the topology and composition of the phylogeny plays a major role in the output ASR sequences. Given that there is much discourse and debate over how to construct phylogenies – for example whether or not thermophilic bacteria are basal or derivative in bacterial evolution – many ASR papers construct several phylogenies with differing topologies and hence differing ASR sequences. These sequences are then compared and often several (~10) are expressed and studied per phylogenetic node. ASR does not claim to recreate the actual sequence of the ancient protein/DNA, but rather a sequence that is likely to be similar to the one that was indeed at the node. This is not considered a shortcoming of ASR as it fits into the 'neutral network' model of protein evolution, whereby at evolutionary junctions (nodes) a population of genotypically different but phenotypically similar protein sequences existed in the extant organismal population. Hence, it is possible that ASR would generate one of the sequences of a node's neutral network and while it may not represent the genotype of the last common ancestor of the modern day sequences, it does likely represent the phenotype. This is supported by the modern day observation that many mutations in a protein's non-catalytic/functional site cause minor changes in biophysical properties. Hence, ASR allows one to probe the biophysical properties of past proteins and is indicative of ancient genetics. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods work by generating a sequence where the residue at each position is predicted to be the most likely to occupy said position by the method of inference used – typically this is a scoring matrix (similar to those used in BLASTs or MSAs) calculated from extant sequences. Alternate methods include maximum parsimony (MP) that construct a sequence based on a model of sequence evolution – usually the idea that the minimum number of nucleotidal sequence changes represents the most efficient route for evolution to take and by Occam's razor is the most likely. MP is often considered the least reliable method for reconstruction as it arguably oversimplifies evolution to a degree that is not applicable on the billion year scale. Another method involves the consideration of residue uncertainty – so-called Bayesian methods – this form of ASR is sometimes used to complement ML methods but typically produces more ambiguous sequences. In ASR, the term 'ambiguity' refers to residue positions where no clear substitution can be predicted – often in these cases, several ASR sequences are produced, encompassing most of the ambiguities and compared to one-another. ML ASR often needs complementing experiments to indicate that the derived sequences are more than just consensuses of the input sequences. This is particularly necessary in the observation of 'Ancestral Superiority'. In the trend of increasing thermostability, one explanation is that ML ASR creates a consensus sequence of several different, parallel mechanisms evolved to confer minor protein thermostability throughout the phylogeny – leading to an additive effect resulting in 'superior' ancestral thermostability. The expression of consensus sequences and parallel ASR via non-ML methods are often required to disband this theory per experiment. One other concern raised by ML methods is that the scoring matrices are derived from modern sequences and particular amino acid frequencies seen today may not be the same as in Precambrian biology, resulting in skewed sequence inference. Several studies have attempted to construct ancient scoring matrices via various methodologies and have compared the resultant sequences and their protein's biophysical properties. While these modified sequences result in somewhat different ASR sequences, the observed biophysical properties did not seem to vary outside from experimental error. Because of the 'holistic' nature of ASR and the intense complexity that arises when one considers all the possible sources of experimental error – the experimental community considers the ultimate measurement of ASR reliability to be the comparison of several alternate ASR reconstructions of the same node and the identification of similar biophysical properties. While this method does not offer a robust statistical, mathematical measure of reliability it does build off of the fundamental idea used in ASR that individual amino acid substitutions do not cause significant biophysical property changes in a protein – a tenant that must be held true in order to be able to overcome the effect of inference ambiguity. Candidates used for ASR are often selected based on the particular property of interest being studied – e.g. thermostability. By selecting sequences from either end of a property's range (e.g., psychrophilic proteins and thermophilic proteins) but within a protein family, ASR can be used to probe the specific sequence changes that conferred the observed biophysical effect – such as stabilising interactions. Consider in the diagram, if sequence 'A' encoded a protein that was optimally functional at neutral pHs and 'D' in acidic conditions, sequence changes between '5' and '2' may illustrate the precise biophysical explanation for this difference. As ASR experiments can extract ancestors that are likely billions of years old, there are often tens if not hundreds of sequence changes between ancestors themselves and ancestors and extant sequences – because of this, such sequence-function evolutionary studies can take a lot of work and rational direction.Figure 1 from reference Resurrected proteins There are many examples of ancestral proteins that have been computationally reconstructed, expressed in living cell lines, and – in many cases – purified and biochemically studied. The Thornton lab notably resurrected several ancestral hormone receptors (from about 500Ma)Harms MJ, Eick GN, Goswami D, Colucci JK, Griffin PR, Ortlund EA, Thornton JW. (2013) Biophysical mechanisms for large-effect mutations in the evolution of steroid hormone receptors. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA. published online June 24 and collaborated with the Stevens lab to resurrect ancient V-ATPase subunits from yeast (800Ma). The Marqusee lab has recently published several studies concerning the evolutionary biophysical history of E. coli Ribonuclease H1. Some other examples are ancestral visual pigments in vertebrates, enzymes in yeast that break down sugars (800Ma); enzymes in bacteria that provide resistance to antibiotics (2 – 3Ga); the ribonucleases involved in ruminant digestion; and the alcohol dehydrogenases (Adhs) involved in yeast fermentation(~85Ma). The 'age' of a reconstructed sequence is determined using a molecular clock model, and often several are employed. This dating technique is often calibrated using geological time-points (such as ancient ocean constituents or BIFs) and while these clocks offer the only method of inferring a very ancient protein's age, they have sweeping error margins and are diffuclt to defend against contrary data. To this end, ASR 'age' should really be only used as an indicative feature and is often surpassed altogether for a measurement of the number of substitutions between the ancestral and the modern sequences (the fundiment on which the clock is calculated). That being said, the use of a clock allows one to compare observed biophysical data of an ASR protein to the geological or ecological environment at the time. For example, ASR studies on bacterial EF-Tus (proteins involved in translation, that are likely rarely subject to HGT and typically exhibit Tms ~2C greater than Tenv) indicate a hotter Precambrian Earth which fits very closely with geological data on ancient earth ocean temperatures based on Oxygen-18 isotopic levels. ASR studies of yeast Adhs reveal that the emergence of subfunctionalized Adhs for ethanol metabolism (not just waste excretion) arose at a time similar to the dawn of fleshy fruit in the Cambrian Period and that before this emergence, Adh served to excrete ethanol as a byproduct of excess pyruvate. The use of a clock also perhaps indicates that the origin of life occurred before the earliest molecular fossils indicate (>4.1Ga), but given the debatable reliability of molecular clocks, such observations should be taken with caution. =Thioredoxin= One example is the reconstruction of thioredoxin enzymes from up to 4 billion year old organisms. Whereas the chemical activity of these reconstructed enzymes were remarkably similar to modern enzymes, their physical properties showed significantly elevated thermal and acidic stability. These results were interpreted as suggesting that ancient life may have evolved in oceans that were much hotter and more acidic than today. Significance These experiments address various important questions in evolutionary biology: does evolution proceed in small steps or in large leaps; is evolution reversible; how does complexity evolve? It has been shown that slight mutations in the amino acid sequence of hormone receptors determine an important change in their preferences for hormones. These changes mean huge steps in the evolution of the endocrine system. Thus very small changes at the molecular level may have enormous consequences. The Thornton lab has also been able to show that evolution is irreversible studying the glucocorticoid receptor. This receptor was changed by seven mutations in a cortisol receptor, but reversing these mutations didn't give the original receptor back. Indicating that epistasis plays a major role in protein evolution – an observation that in combination with the observations of several examples of parallel evolution, support the neutral network model mentioned above. Other earlier neutral mutations acted as a ratchet and made the changes to the receptor irreversible. These different experiments on receptors show that, during their evolution, proteins are greatly differentiated and this explains how complexity may evolve. A closer look at the different ancestral hormone receptors and the various hormones shows that at the level of interaction between single amino acid residues and chemical groups of the hormones arise by very small but specific changes. Knowledge about these changes may for example lead to the synthesis of hormonal equivalents capable of mimicking or inhibiting the action of a hormone, which might open possibilities for new therapies. Given that ASR has revealed a tendency towards ancient thermostability and enzymatic promiscuity, ASR poses as a valuable tool for protein engineers who often desire these traits (producing effects sometimes greater than current, rationally lead tools). ASR also promises to 'resurrect' phenotipically similar 'ancient organisms' which in turn would allow evolutionary biochemists to probe the story of life. Proponents of ASR such as Benner state that through these and other experiments, the end of the current century will see a level of understanding in biology analogous to the one that arose in classical chemistry in the last century.

He was educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution, and started work as secretary and accountant for Stonyfell Wines, which had been founded by Henry Septimus Clark (1836–1864) around 1860 and largely managed by his brother-in-law Joseph Crompton. Harry learned much of the art and science of winemaking from Henry Tyler, Crompton's cellar manager, and when, in the economic depression of 1884, the business was taken over by the Bank of Adelaide, leased then sold to quarry operator Henry Dunstan (1841 – 22 May 1915), Harry was taken on as his accountant, and purchased Crompton's house \\"Ilfracombe\\" on Stonyfell Road in 1888. In 1902 Harry took on his younger son Ronald, who had recently graduated from Roseworthy Agricultural College and leased the vineyards and cellars from Dunstan, and in 1934 purchased the property from the Dunstan estate, having in 1926 set up the company H. M. Martin and Son to purchase their business and provide working capital.

These are found in two localities in India. Myristica swamps have adapted to inundation by way of stilt roots and knee roots. Myristica swamps are found in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka State and in the southern parts of Kerala State.  History  Myristica swamps were described as a separate evergreen forest type by Krishnamurthy in 1960.Krishna Moorthy, K. 1960. Myristica swamps in the evergreen forests of Travancore. Indian Forester 86(5):314-315. These received attention in 1988 when Rodgers and Panwar Rodgers, WA. and Panwar, HS. 1988. Planning Wildlife Protected Area Network in India.

Species recovery plan for Semecarpus kathalekanensis: a critically endangered fresh water swamp species of western ghats. Research Report. Kerala Forest Research Institute, Peechi, Kerala, India.  Mapping  The swamps occur on either side of first order streams. The swamp boundary can be seen distinctly in the field due to the stilt roots. Chandran and his colleagues were able to locate 51 swamps in Uttara Kannada. They were able to show them on maps, and describe location, but exact boundary mapping was not attempted. Mapping by Nairpv and colleagues in 2007 was more detailed and they mapped 60 swamps using GPS technology. The swamps ranged in area from about 0.25 to 10 hectares. The swamps are distributed in two river systems spread over two districts. Boundary mapping has revealed that the total area of Myristica swamps in Kerala is about 1.5 km2 which hardly make up 0.004% of the total land area of Kerala (38,864 km2) and 0.014% of the total forest area of Kerala (11,126 km2). The swamps in Karnataka are located at about 300m altitude, the swamps in Kerala are at an altitude of 200m.  Flora  Chandran and his colleagues give detailed description of the flora. They found that 63 of 130 flowering plants identified are endemic to Western Ghats of India. Major species of trees were Gymnocranthera canarica, Myristica fatua, Mastixia arborea, Semecarpus travancorica, Hopea whitiana, Lophopetalum whitiana, Holigarna grahami, Sysygium laetum, etc. Studies by Nair and colleagues in southern Kerala in 2007 documents eighty two trees and ninety four species of herbs/shrubs. Forty nine lianas have also been recorded. Twelve of these plants species have been redlisted and about 28 species of them are endemic to Western Ghats. Out of the 19 sample plots, Gymnacranthera farquhariana was dominant in 10 plots. Myristica fatua was the dominant tree in 6 swamps. In the remaining plots, Vateria indica was the dominant tree. Holigarna arnottiana and Lophopetalum wightianum dominated in another two plots.  Fauna  Myristica Sapphire, (Calocypha laidlawi); a damselfly found only in Myristica swamps. Nair and colleagues in southern Kerala in 2007 focussed on fauna also. Faunal biodiversity of the Myristica swamps consisted of Platyhelminthes- (Bipalium-2, tapeworm-1) 3 species, Nemathelminthes – 1 species, Annelida (Oligochaeta -2and Hirudinea-2) 4 species, Mollusca- 10 species, Unidentified Crustacean-1 species, Insecta- 281 species belonging to 83 identified families, Myriapoda- 6 species and Arachnidae 54 species, Pisces 14 species, Amphibia 56 species, Reptilia 55 species, Aves 129 species and Mammalia 27 species.Joyce Jose, Ramachandran, K.

Quantitative analysis of herpetofauna revealed that the differences in the environmental characteristics inside and outside the swamp play an important role in regulating the species diversity and abundance of both amphibians and reptiles. Amphibians were more susceptible to environmental changes. Patterns of diversity and abundance during day and night, across swamps and among months varied. There was no significant difference in patterns of diversity and abundance recorded during the two years. Many of the animals documented belong to red list and endemic categories.  Conservation  Nair and colleagues in southern Kerala highlight the enormous biodiversity of the Myristica swamp forests. The study also indicates that there are gaps in information which can be filled up only with further studies in this region. A challenge is how further studies can be carried out without disturbing the delicate ecosystem of these swamps. A pertinent question is whether all human entry should be banned into the best and least disturbed patches of swamps, leaving only the disturbed patches for human visits (tourism and academic study). Conservation of these small and scattered swamp patches must also address the contiguous areas. Strategies for management and conservation have been suggested in the above context.

He is most notable for competing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Formula Le Mans Cup and the Le Mans Series. He won the Formula Le Mans class of the Le Mans Series in 2010, whilst driving for :DAMS. Career Chalandon was born in Décines- Charpieu, France on 26 September 1986. He competed in the X30 class of the French Karting Championship in 2005, finishing fifth, before making his car racing debut in the Formul'Academy Euro Series in 2008, where he finished twentieth, with one point. He joined the Formula Le Mans Cup in 2009, driving for Boutsen Energy Racing in their LS3-engined Oreca FLM09. Partnering fellow Frenchman Dimitri Enjalbert, he made his debut in the series in the Algarve round, finishing third in race one, and fifth in race two. He drove alongside Enjalbert again for the Nürburgring round, finishing third in race one (having qualified on pole), and fourth in race two. Enjalbert was replaced by the Austrian Dominik Kraihamer for the next round at Silverstone, with the best finish of the weekend being fifth in race one. He was partnered by another Frenchman, Johan-Boris Scheier, in the season finale at Magny-Cours, with their best result being a third place in race two. He finished seventh overall in the championship, with 89 points from 12 races. In 2010, the Formula Le Mans Cup was incorporated into the Le Mans Series, and Chalandon joined DAMS, partnering Andrea Barlesi and Alessandro Cicognani. In the first round of the season, the 8 Hours of Le Castellet, the trio finished in third place in class, in their first ever Le Mans Series race. The next round, the 1000 km of Spa, was unsuccessful, with the team being forced to retire the car due to steering damage. Following an injury to Team Bruichladdich driver Christian Ebbesvik during the 1000 km of Spa, Chalandon was named as his replacement for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Chalandon, partnering Bruichladdich's regular drivers Tim Greaves and Karim Ojjeh, entered in the LMP2 category, driving a Ginetta- Zytek GZ09S/2. The team finished fifth in the LMP2 category, with Chalandon drawing praise from Tim Greaves, who said \\"Gary did extremely well in his first Le Mans practice and qualifying. He is one of the youngest drivers on the grid and we are very please with all aspects of his driving and attitude.\\" Following the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Chalandon returned to the Le Mans Series, finishing second in class at the next round, the 1000 km of Algarve. This was followed by his first class ever victory in the following round, the 1000 km of Hungaroring. The 1000 km of Silverstone was the final race of the season, and fourth in class was enough to take the Formula Le Mans title by two points, with Hope Polevision Racing's Steve Zacchia finishing second. For 2011, Chalandon rejoined Team Bruichladdich, this time in the LMP2 category of the Le Mans Series. He was partnered by Tom Kimber-Smith and Ojjeh in the new Zytek Z11SN. However, his first race for the team, whom had been renamed to Greaves Motorsport prior to the start of the season, came in the third Sportscars Winter Series event of the season on 6 March 2011, taking a victory, a fourth place, and a sixth-place finish, driving alongside Ojjeh in a Radical. In the Le Mans Series, the team won their class in the first round of the season, the 6 Hours of Castellet, and third overall. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans test session, Chalandon, Ojjeh and Kimber-Smith were partnered by Alex Brundle, with Kimber-Smith setting the third fastest time in the LMP2 class. The second round of the Le Mans Series, which was the 1000 km of Spa, proved to be less successful than the previous two events, with Greaves Motorsport only able to finish eighth in class, after an incident-filled race. This would prove to be the last time Chalandon drove for Greaves Motorsport, as he left the team, and was replaced by Olivier Lombard. His two races were enough for 11th in the LMP2 category, with 20 points. Chalandon switched to the FFSA GT Championship, and entered the Magny-Cours round on 10 July, driving alongside Didier André in a Team WRT-entered Audi R8 LMS. The pair finished fourteenth in the first race, and fifteenth in the second. A week later, André and Chalandon entered the Paul Ricard round of the FIA GT3 European Championship, finishing sixteenth in race one, and twelfth in race two.
