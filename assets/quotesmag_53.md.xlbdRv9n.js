Belgo-Congolese troops, British Commonwealth forces and local resistance fighters besieged the fort at the market town of Sa√Øo in south-western Ethiopia in 1941. The siege lasted for several months, culminating in an Allied attack on the Italian garrison thereby forcing it to surrender. In the first months of 1941, British and Belgian colonial forces attacked Italian East Africa from the colony of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. By the end of March, they had seized the town of Gambela and begun containing retreating Italian forces, which were massing on a plateau in the mountain town of Sa√Øo (presently Dembidolo) under the command of General Carlo De Simone and later General Pietro Gazzera. The British forces withdrew the following month and the Belgians advanced down the road to Sa√Øo. The Italians repelled them and they were forced to hold their positions along a nearby brook. Almost no fighting took place in May as heavy rain bogged down the Belgians and turned their supply line from Sudan into mud, creating a food shortage. In early June, reinforcements arrived via river and the Belgians besieged the Italian supply depot at Mogi. Aggressive patrols, combined with the actions of the Ethiopian resistance and raids from the South African Air Force put increased pressure upon the Italian garrison. At the end of the month General Auguste Gilliaert took charge of the Belgian force. He was instructed by the British to attack when an opportunity presented itself. On 3 July, he assaulted the base of Sa√Øo Mountain and in the afternoon Gazzera sued for peace. On 6 July, the Belgians formally accepted the surrender of Gazzera, eight of his generals and over soldiers.  Background  =Africa Orientale Italiana= On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, proclaimed the colony of Africa Orientale Italiana (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian victory in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, fought 3 October 1935 ‚Äì May 1936) and the existing Italian possessions of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the rearmament plans of the Comando Supremo (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power. Prelude =Regio Esercito= Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, was appointed Viceroy and Governor-General of Italian East Africa in November 1937, with a headquarters in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of the Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and Generale d'Armata Aerea (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about and Italian-born army, naval and air force personnel, available. By 1 August, mobilisation in Italian East Africa had increased that number to On 10 June, the Regio Esercito (Italian Royal Army) was organised in four commands, with the military forces in Ethiopia led by General Pietro Gazzera. Aosta had the 40th Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa and the 65th Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia from Italy, a battalion of Alpini (elite mountain troops), a Bersaglieri battalion of motorised infantry, several (MSVN Camicie Nere [Blackshirt]) battalions and an assortment of smaller units; about 70 percent of the Italian troops were locally recruited Askari. The regular Eritrean battalions and the (RCTC Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops) were among the best Italian units in Italian East Africa and included Eritrean cavalry (Falcon Feathers). =British plans= In August 1939, Wavell ordered a plan covertly to encourage a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, which the Italians had never been able entirely to repress after the end of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel Daniel Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Arbegnoch (Amharic for Patriots). In June 1940, Haile Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy. The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from √©migr√© volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres and ¬£1 million was set aside to finance their operations. Major Orde Wingate was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the headquarters of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the British Royal Air Force (RAF) managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the Arbegnoch north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma‚ÄìGondar road and the Italian garrison at Wolkait was withdrawn in February 1941. =Belgian plans= Force Publique soldiers leaving the Congo for Italian East Africa At the conclusion of the Battle of Belgium in May 1940, the only proper force under Belgian command was the Force Publique (\\"Public Force\\" i.e. the colonial army) of the Belgian Congo in Central Africa. It thus made up the bulk of the Free Belgian Forces. Consisting of 15,000 native ranks and Belgian officers, it was well equipped, well disciplined and dispersed throughout the colony. Through the year, the Force Publique's defence obligations were considered too important for it to be spared for any offensive operations. The Allies were uncertain of German intentions toward Portuguese Angola, the Congo's neighbour to the south, and the extent of Vichy French influence in French Equatorial Africa to the north. Belgian members of the Force Publique grew impatient with the colonial administration's perceived inaction and the garrison of Stanleyville mutinied in protest. Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans was forced to send a senior member of his staff to calm them down and explain the importance of the Congo's economic contribution to the war. left Meanwhile, Ryckmans and Lieutenant General Paul Ermens discussed the possibility of sending an expedition to Italian East Africa with the South African and British military missions in L√©opoldville. There were two problems with such an undertaking: Italian territory was thousands of kilometres away and Belgium was not at war with Italy. The Belgian government in exile was wary of declaring war on a country whose royal family had dynastic links with its own, though this attitude changed after it became known that Italian aircraft based in occupied Belgium were attacking Britain and when an Italian submarine sank a Belgian cargo ship. A declaration of war was eventually delivered on 23 November 1940. Two days later, Ryckmans proclaimed that a state of war existed between Italy and the Congo. Free French Forces consolidated their control over Equatorial Africa at the Battle of Gabon and more German involvement in the Balkan Campaign (begun by Italy in 1939) made the possibility of intervention in Portugal remote. The staff of the Force Publique and the Belgian government then resolved to assemble an expedition to fight in Italian East Africa. Plans were coordinated with the British and in February 1941, after an extended period of preparation, the first group of 8,000 troops and porters set out from the Congo for Ethiopia. Starting in Stanley Pool, they rode a dozen barges and a tugboat up the Congo River to Aketi. The expeditionary force took the Vicicongo line (a narrow-gauge railway) from Aketi to Mungbere and drove by lorry to Juba in Sudan where they took to the White Nile. After five days' travel, the first Belgo-Congolese battalion reached Malakal and marched to the border town of Kurmuk before entering Ethiopia. =East African Campaign= Following the declaration of war against France and Britain by Italy on 10 June 1940, the East African Campaign began as military forces of the British Empire engaged the Italian East African Armed Forces Command (Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale) in Italian East Africa. After a series of actions in 1940, British colonial forces from Anglo-Egyptian Sudan invaded the territory and eventually a salient formed around the Baro River. In March 1941, the Italian forces began to withdraw from the salient under increasing pressure. On 8 March the first battalion of the Belgo-Congolese expeditionary force marched from Kurmuk towards the Italian-held town of Asosa. The expeditionary force attacked three days later in conjunction with troops of the King's African Rifles (KAR), forcing the garrison to retreat to Gidami. Next, the Belgians and Congolese began attacking the town of Gambela directly from the west while two companies of the 2/6 KAR under Captain J. W. E. Mackenzie were sent to outflank it and cut off its link with the Italian headquarters at Sa√Øo under the command of General Carlo De Simone. The Belgians were concerned that the Italians might attempt an offensive over the weakly defended Sudanese border; by taking Gambela they could force Gazzera's forces in western Ethiopia into a defensive position. On 22 March, the KAR companies attacked but withdrew to the south when a planned Belgian assault failed to materialise. The Italians were nevertheless surprised by the flanking manoeuvre and retreated to Sa√Øo.  Siege  On 25 March, the Belgo- Congolese battalion and the two companies of the 2/6 KAR occupied Gambela. Exhausted by their journey from the Congo and suffering from dysentery and a lack of artillery, the 1,000 Belgians and Congolese could undertake no further offensive action. Instead they made moves to contain the Italian forces around Sa√Øo from the west, while British troops under General Alan Cunningham conducted operations in Somalia and eastern Ethiopia. The Arbegnoch also threatened the Italian positions. In April, Italian forces burned the elephant grass along the Sa√Øo Plateau to ensure an unobstructed field of fire. That same month the troops of the 2/6th KAR were withdrawn to the Dabus River to link up with the rest of their unit to contain the Italian garrison in Mendi. = Actions at Bortai Brook = The Italians mined the -long Sa√Øo‚ÄìGambela road that led to the Sa√Øo Plateau above the surrounding area. The Belgians began slowly advancing but encountered Italians at the Bortai Brook, which ran perpendicular to the road. The Belgians were strengthened by the arrival of a Stokes mortar company and another battalion. Numbering at 1,600 soldiers and 600 non-combatant porters, they lacked the strength to seize the plateau. With the Italians receiving reinforcements of troops retreating from the east, the Belgians decided to keep the initiative to disguise their small numbers. Three days of cold weather and rain preceded the offensive. On 15 April, Lieutenant Colonel Edmond van der Meersch led an attack on the brook. A Belgian lieutenant scouting in no man's land was ambushed and killed. A Belgian sergeant caught three Italian officers at gunpoint but lowered his revolver when they claimed to be English, thinking the KAR might have dispatched a liaison party to the area. He was then shot by snipers concealed in the bush. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were killed. Three Italians and an estimated 40 Eritrean Ascari were killed, with approximately 70 Ascari wounded. During the ensuring stalemate, the Belgians studied the Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and artillery spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue up to an hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized. = Belgian supply difficulties = By May, Belgian numbers had risen to 2,500 men, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Leopold Dronkers-Martens. The rainy season had begun, turning the main road from Sudan into mud, cutting off their communications and supplies. The Baro and Sobat rivers were still too low to permit the passage of supply barges from the White Nile and the nearby Gambela airfield was too small for transport aircraft to land. The only means of supply was by airdrop, forcing the Belgians and Congolese to halve their rations. Several porters attempted to bring food in by foot from Sudan, but died of fatigue and undernourishment. Some of the officers resorted to stripping the camouflage netting from their trucks and seining the Baro River for fish amid frequent outbreaks of Beriberi. The Italians, encamped on fertile soil and well supplied, faced no such problems. The Belgians were also subject to regular air attack. = Renewed Belgian offensives = The Belgo-Congolese situation remained difficult until early June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to reach them. They then decided to try to sever the Italian supply line between Sa√Øo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack. It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Sa√Øo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered by the arrival of a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that the town could only be taken at a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Sa√Øo was being supplied. At the regular front, Lieutenant Colonel Dronkers-Martens ordered his troops to increase their patrol activities upon the Sa√Øo Plateau, to make the Italians believe that they were facing superior forces. They used shoot- and-scoot tactics, avoiding counter-battery fire and leaving the Italians with the impression that they were facing multiple consistent points of fire. Gazzera tripled the size of the Mogi garrison and the Italians began to reduce their activity as the Belgians became bolder. Eventually the South African Air Force (SAAF) committed three Hawker Hart biplanes to regularly bomb the Sa√Øo fortress and strafe the surrounding roads. In the east, British forces pressed on, forcing Gazzera to abandon his own headquarters in Jimma in mid June and withdraw to Sa√Øo. The 2/6th KAR secured Gidami and headed southeast to cut the Sa√Øo‚ÄìYubdo road. By the end of the month, the British had driven the Italians from the western bank of the Didessa River. The Italian 23rd and 26th Colonial divisions were ordered to retreat through Yubdo, to make their final stand at Sa√Øo. Heavy rain, actions of the Arbegnoch and the raids from the SAAF added to their problems. = Final assault and Italian surrender = Major General Auguste Gilliaert arrived from the Congo before the end of the month. On 27 June General William Platt, advancing with British forces from Sudan, ordered the Belgians to attack the Italian positions if an opportunity presented itself and Gilliaert immediately undertook preparations for an offensive. The plans for taking Mogi were abandoned and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Sa√Øo, so all but 50 of the soldiers besieging Mogi were redeployed. Believing the British pursuit to be closer than it actually was, Gazzera ordered the bridge over the Indina River east of Sa√Øo to be blown, thereby trapping his forces. Though still outnumbered, the Belgians decided to carry on with their offensive. On 2 July, they forced their way over Bortai Brook. At dawn the next day, the Belgian advance posts opened fire on Sa√Øo and half an hour later, the Belgian artillery went into action. The Italians responded with heavy counter-battery fire. A Belgian battalion advanced upon Italian machine gun nests on the two hills that had been occupied since April. The reserve battalion covered their left flank and Gilliaert dispatched the third battalion under Van der Meersch to the right flank down a goat path that had been mapped by patrols over a fortnight. Two artillery batteries gave them covering fire. The Belgians captured the hills and the Italians, being flanked on their left side by Van der Meersch's troops, were unable to make it back to their fortifications atop Sa√Øo mountain. With the Sa√Øo-Gambela road under artillery fire, they retired to the plains to their right. Meanwhile, the 2/6th KAR launched an attack on the Sa√Øo-Yubdo road, continuing throughout the next day with success. The Italians were under the impression that they were facing three Belgian divisions with South African reinforcements. They also only had about two months' provisions left. Gazzera radioed to the Allies in Addis Abeba his intentions to negotiate a surrender with the Belgians. The Belgians were preparing for another assault when at 13:40 two staff cars bearing white flags drove down the mountain. In them were eight Italian generals, a Catholic priest and Gazzera's chief of staff. Gilliaert met with them a short distance away from Bortai Brook near Gambela. They requested that all hostilities south of the Blue Nile cease and that their army be granted the honours of war. Gilliaert accepted and on 6 July he drove into Sa√Øo to receive the formal surrender of the Italian forces.  Aftermath  =Analysis= With Gazzera's surrender, Gondar became the last area in Ethiopia under Italian control. The market in Sa√Øo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Sa√Øo-Gambela road. At Gazzera's request, Gilliaert guaranteed the Eritrean Askari safe passage to British prisoner of war camps in the east and sent Congolese guards to protect them from Ethiopian retaliation. The Belgian force quickly returned to the Congo with their spoils of war. The siege was the first big victory for the Free Belgian Forces and greatly improved their morale. George Weller of the Chicago Daily News travelled to the front and interviewed participants in the Belgo-Congolese expedition. He then wrote several articles about the campaign and wired them back to the United States from L√©opoldville. The Belgian government reproduced his reporting in a pamphlet that was subsequently distributed, but it received little attention. =Casualties= The Belgo-Congolese force lost 462 men during the conflict, 80 percent of them to disease and it was estimated that the Italians lost about three times as many. A total of 6,454 Italian troops were taken prisoner, including Gazzera, eight other generals and 3,500 Askari, along with 20 artillery pieces, 200 machine guns, 250 trucks and 500 mules. Though only numbering about 3,000 soldiers and 2,000 porters, the Belgo-Congolese force had to manage 15,000 prisoners in the former Galla-Sidamo Governorate after the campaign. = Commemoration = In 1943, a three-sided pyramid was erected in Faradje, Belgian Congo to commemorate the actions of the Congolese in Ethiopia. Each face of the pyramid was inscribed with the name of each place where an engagement took place, including Sa√Øo. Many locations throughout the country‚Äîpresently the Democratic Republic of the Congo‚Äîare named after the battle.

Built about 1912 as a livery stable, it was adapted into a residential duplex in 1927. It is a good local example of vernacular Colonial Revival architecture, built as worker housing in the growing city. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history Sherman Street is a short two-block street located on the west side of Burlington's Old North End neighborhood, a densely built residential area near the city's waterfront. 73-75 Sherman Street is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building on the south side of Sherman Street. Unlike most of the street's buildings, it is set well back from the street, and shares a driveway with its neighbor to the left. The building is basically rectangular in shape, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The right three bays of the front facade are covered by a two-story porch with a shallow-pitch hip roof. The porch's ground floor has an open front, and is supported by square posts, full-length at the center, and mounted on half- walls to the sides. The second-floor porch roof is supported by round columns with Tuscan capitals, mounted on a half wall. Lucius Bostwick was best known in the city as the owner of a drug store, which was located at Sherman and North Champlain Streets, a short way east of this location. About 1912 he constructed this building to serve as a livery stable. Due to rising demand for housing the neighborhood in the 1920s, he converted it into a two-unit apartment house. A later owner, Joseph Veglia, used the property as an income- producing rental for a number of years, living in nearby housing on Sherman Street. In his later years he occupied one of the units.

Most of the natural vegetation is v√°rzea forest, but the APA contains significant remnants of submontane and montane Atlantic Forest. It connects the mangroves to the alpine meadows and high montane forests, forms a corridor between the five conservation units that are partly located in the municipality of Guapimirim, and helps to control occupation and land use of the area. Potential threats are uncontrolled urban and industrial expansion due to low agricultural use, deforestation, trafficking in wildlife and hunting. On the positive side, the low agricultural use may provide the opportunity for reforestation. History The Guapi-Guapia√ß√∫ Environmental Protection Area was created by municipal decree 620 of 22 December 2004. It is administered by the municipal department of the environment.

Source, family and homology Kalicludine (uniprot ID: Q9TWG0) is also known as KappaPI- actitoxin-Avd3b or as Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor kalicludine-1. Thus, kalicludines are part of the Kunitz-type inhibitor superfamily. The Kunitz-type scaffold is found both in inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes and in toxins. Other members of this superfamily are the pancreatic trypsin inhibitors (BPTI), which are potent Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, and dendrotoxins. Kalicludine has 40% homology with BPTIs. The most represented sequences of this group corresponds with kalicludine-3 and kalicludine-4, a recently found polypeptide. A. sulcata kalicludines include AsKC1, AsKC2, and AsKC3., which are related to Bunodosoma granulifera toxin k (BgK) and Stichodactyla helianthus toxin k (ShK). A different, less abundant, protein is AsKC1a, which has a supplementary residue at the C-terminus when compared with kalicludine-1. Furthermore, a level of amino acid sequence identity and similarity of ‚â•43% and ‚â•50% was found between both A. sulcata Kunitz-type protease inhibitors SA5 II, SA5 III and AsKC1 ‚Äì AsKC15. Kalicludine has 48% identity with the amyloid A4 homologue, which is implicated in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Structure The kalicludine isotoxins have similar molecular size and a similar biological function. They contain three amino acid residues that are important for trypsin binding: Lys-15, Ala-16, and Ile-19 in BPTI. AsKCs have a replacement at position 19 (Ile ‚Üí Pro), which results in less inhibitory action than BPTI. Mode of action Kalicludine is stored in nematocysts or located in extracellular regions. It is known to be a dual- function toxin, able to inhibit both the serine protease trypsin (Kd=30 nM) and the voltage-gated potassium channels Kv1.2/KCNA2 (IC50=2800 nM). Kalicludines and dendrotoxins compete for binding to these Kv channels. The kalicludine sequence is homologous to the sequence of dendrotoxins, in particular DTX 1 (dendrotoxin 1), potent blockers of Kv channels. Kalicludines have from 38 to 42% homologies with DTX. Both kalicludines and dendrotoxins increase the release of acetylcholine and enhance the duration of action potentials (AP). Toxicity and symptoms Kv channel blocking dendrotoxins, and thus possibly also kalicludines, often lead to overstimulation of the cholinergic system, and subsequently to neuromuscular block and cardiovascular depression.

History The first Sarpino's pizza delivery store was opened by Gerry Koutougos in 2001 in Victoria, British Columbia. The name has its origins in a vacation that founder Gerry Koutougos took to Italy in 1999, where he visited a restaurant that was operated by a woman named Sarpina. Sarpino's expanded to Singapore in 2002 and to the United States in January 2003 with the opening of a Phoenix, Arizona location. Within a year after opening the first U.S. location, the chain had close to 20 American stores. During that first year, David Chatkin served as the original franchisee for two stores in the Chicago area and partnered with Dmitry Shapiro, a software consultant that previously served as a business analyst with Sears and Kraft Foods. Shapiro found that Chatkin's operations were not profitable due to lack of marketing, standardized operations, cost controls, and training. As a result, Shapiro purchased the U.S. operations from Koutougos in 2005 and renamed it Sarpino's USA. He then went on to develop the areas that were lacking to provide the needed support to franchisees. By 2013, Sarpino's USA grew to 47 stores throughout six states. By the end of 2014 it had grown to 65 U.S. locations with a goal of 350 stores open within five years.

In 1966 she was the first Mexican American librarian to serve in the state of California. Martinez has served as a library administrator, professor, Executive Director of the American Library Association, and other roles throughout her career.  Education  Martinez began her studies at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles where she obtained a B.A. in Latin American studies in 1965. While there, she took a children's literature course for the English requirement, but finding a lack of representation for indigenous people and cultures from around the world in the course she began contemplating how literature from non-European nations can be better disseminated to the masses. In 1966 Martinez received her Master of Arts in Library Science degree from the University of California. She later continued her education by receiving a certificate of management from USC in 1978 and an executive management program certificate from the University of California, Irvine in 1986.  Career  Upon graduating with her Library Science degree in 1966, Martinez became the California's first Mexican American Librarian when she took a position in the Los Angeles Public Library. She worked in various library administrative roles. In 1971 Martinez co- founded REFORMA, The National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking, which is an affiliate organization of the American Library Association (ALA). Along with Binnie Tate Wilkin, she co-chaired the first ALA policy on diversity ‚ÄúEquity at Issue‚Äù in 1986. She was County Librarian of Orange County in 1979-1990 during which time she oversaw the construction of 8 new community libraries among other achievements. In the 1970's at County of Los Angeles Public Library, Martinez developed the Asian, Pacific Islander, Black, Chicano, and Native American resource centers. Martinez served as the Executive Director of the ALA from 1994 - 1997. During her tenure at the ALA, she developed the Spectrum Scholarship program and the Office for Information Technology Policy was established. She also proposed a program to Bill Gates that resulted in a $200 million grant dedicated to bridging the information gap by connecting more than 4,000 public libraries in poor communities across the US to the Internet. Martinez has been credited with reviving the Salinas Public Library system while she served as the Library Director there due to the remodeling of the Cesar Chavez Library and implementation of new programming and multicultural initiatives. She was adjunct faculty at her Alma mater of UCLA until 2003. She is currently a lecturer at San Jose State University. Some of the courses she has taught at SJSU include: Library Services for Racially and Ethnically Diverse Communities, Seminar on Contemporary Issues, and Professional Experience Internships. Martinez has served on various committees and boards throughout her career and is currently a member of the New Mexico State Library Commission. In 2013, REFORMA established the Elizabeth Martinez Lifetime Achievement Award to recognize librarians who have served over 20 years and whose leadership has made significant and lasting contributions to Spanish speaking communities.

His business activities also span across the hospitality (Laskaridis and his family controls numerous hotels in European countries like the landmark hotels Grande Bretagne and King George of Athens, Hyatt Regency Belgrade, Lucknam Park in the UK etc.), real estate, and airline industries (as a minority shareholder in Aegean Airlines), and other enterprises. = Charity and donations = In 1993, the Laskaridis brothers founded Aikaterini Laskaridis Foundation in memory of their mother. The foundation actively supports cultural and educational projects in Greece. Laskaridis and his brother have donated to numerous causes such as the Hellenic Coast Guard, the Greek navy, the Union of Greek Shipowners' charitable trust, fresh water supply projects for refugees in northern Greece and a number of Greek charitable organisations engaged with the wellbeing of children in need. Laskaridis has also donated to the London School of Economics in support of the Hellenic Observatory, where he sits on the Advisory Board. In 2014, he financed with ‚Ç¨1.5 million the restoration of Syntagma Square, the central square of Athens that had been damaged during riots and vandalism in previous years. The mayor of Athens, Giorgos Kaminis, unveiled a plaque in his honour in September 2018, for Laskaridis' contribution to the square. Thanasis Laskaridis is also the founder of The People's Trust in Greece, a charitable trust dedicated to small grants for startup companies and general charity. For his donations to the Greek Navy and coast guard, Laskaridis has been awarded by the Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy and the Hellenic Coast Guard. He is also an honorary member of the latter organisation. In 2016, Thanasis Laskaridis founded the A.C. Laskaridis Charitable Foundation (ACLCF), a non-profit organisation which aims to build partnerships and implement programmes that focus on the environment and education in Greece. As part of these efforts, in 2019 the MV Typhoon, a former platform supply vessel that was converted into a special purpose ship, began operations in the Greek seas with the aim of contributing to the large scale clean-up of the coastline, as well as to research of coastal and in- water marine pollution, in cooperation with universities and research institutions.

Initially 6,000 spoons were donated from across the globe including one that used to belong to Winston Churchill. When the project was complete the final tally was 40,000 spoons from as far afield as China, India, Kenya, Armenia and Tahiti . Whilst Geller commissioned the piece, it was funded by the Ironworks Centre. The gorilla sculpture was created by sculptor Alfie Bradley over 5 months and was unveiled by Prince Michael of Kent in 2014. The sculpture was taken to Uri Geller's house in the same year, but is now on display back at the centre. Knife Angel In 2014, Alfie Bradley and the British Ironworks Centre launched a new incentive called the 'Save a Life, Surrender Your Knife' campaign. This project ultimately resulted in a 27 foot-tall sculpture, Knife Angel. The artist and the Centre encouraged a knife amnesty in conjunction with local police forces across the United Kingdom, to enable them to build/sculpt an angel statue. Initially only 37 police forces responded and sent in knives. Clive Knowles, chairman of the British Ironworks Centre, criticised six police forces across England and Wales from not getting involved with the project. By the projects completion, all 43 police forces contributed to the total 100,000 knives, blades, swords and other weapons used in violent crime. In addition to these blades, one consignment containing explosives that were packaged incorrectly. This necessitated Ministry of Defence bomb disposal personnel being called out and performing a controlled explosion. The centre and the sculptor were been criticized by some relatives of the victims of knife crime, but have also been praised by others. At least 80 families engraved left personal messages engraved into the blades. The artist was a victim of knife crime himself. The sculpture was complete in 2018. In the year following its completion, the work was transported on a nationwide tour in order to highlight an anti-violence message. The sculpture is one of hundreds that have been nominated in 2018 for listed status.

Loosely based on the epic poem Padmavat by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, it stars Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen known for her beauty, wife of Maharawal Ratan Singh, played by Shahid Kapoor. Sultan Alauddin Khilji, played by Ranveer Singh, hears of her beauty and attacks her kingdom to claim her. Aditi Rao Hydari, Jim Sarbh, Raza Murad, and Anupriya Goenka featured in supporting roles. With a production budget of , Padmaavat is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made. Initially scheduled for release on 1 December 2017, Padmaavat faced numerous controversies. Amid violent protests, its release was indefinitely delayed. In December, the Central Board of Film Certification approved the film with few changes, which includes the addition of multiple disclaimers and a change from its original title Padmavati. Padmaavat was rescheduled for release on 25 January 2018 in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D formats, making it the first Indian film to be released in IMAX 3D. Padmaavat received mixed reviews. Critics praised the visuals, the cinematography and Singh's portrayal of Khilji, but criticised its storyline, execution, length and adherence to regressive patriarchal mores. Critics also disliked the portrayal of Khilji as a stereotypical evil Muslim king and Ratan Singh as the righteous Hindu king. Despite not being released in some states of India, it grossed over at the box office, becoming a commercial success and the 10th highest-grossing Indian film of all time. At 64th Filmfare Awards, Padmaavat received a leading 18 nominations, and won four awards, including Best Actor (Critics) for Singh. It also won three National Film Awards, including Best Music Direction for Bhansali.  Plot  In 13th-century Afghanistan, Jalal-ud-din Khalji of the Khalji dynasty plans to take over the throne of Delhi. His nephew Alauddin KhaljiPadmaavat movie review: Sanjay Leela Bhansali's film does what Karni Sena wanted to do Quote: \\"Alauddin is asked to bring ostrich's hair, instead he brings a chain-cuffed ostrich.\\" asks for Jalaluddin's daughter Mehrunisa's hand in marriage. Their wedding is organised, but on the night of the event, Alauddin engages in adultery with another woman. A courtier witnesses the act and is killed by Alauddin. Mehrunisa is informed of this during the wedding, leaving her horrified. Sinhala (modern-day Sri Lanka) princess Padmavati accidentally wounds Rajput ruler Maharawal Ratan Singh while hunting in a forest. As she treats him, he reveals that he has traveled to Sinhala to acquire rare pearls for his first wife Nagmati. Eventually, the two bond and fall in love. Ratan Singh asks for Padmavati's hand in marriage, she agrees and with permission from her father, they are married. Jalaluddin takes over the throne of Delhi and sends Alauddin to repel a Mongol invasion. Alauddin is successful in doing so, but undertakes an unsanctioned raid on Devagiri. He captures the princess there, assassinates her husband, and makes her his concubine. Jalaluddin's wife and nephew warn him against Alauddin's ambition to take over the throne; he journeys to Kara to meet Alauddin and gifts him the slave Malik Kafur. Over time, Alauddin and Kafur become close (and possible intimate), and Kafur rises to become a general in Alauddin's army. Alauddin has Jalaluddin and his ministers assassinated and declares himself the new Sultan. Padmavati journeys to Mewar with Ratan Singh and is blessed by his royal priest, Raghav Chetan. After Chetan is banished for witnessing an intimate moment between Ratan and Padmavati, he travels to Delhi and informs Alauddin of Padmavati's beauty. Alauddin, who is fixated with having anything that is exceptional, invites the Rajputs to Delhi but his invitation is rejected. Enraged, he lays siege to Ratan Singh's capital Chittor. After six months of an unsuccessful siege, Alauddin feigns peace on account of Holi and is allowed to enter Chittor where he meets Ratan Singh. He asks to see Padmavati; Ratan Singh grants this request, but only momentarily while preventing Alauddin from seeing her face. Eventually, Alauddin's siege succeeds and Ratan is taken prisoner. Upon Queen Nagmati's insistence, Padmavati agrees to see Alauddin under some conditions: she will meet Ratan first; and Chetan will be executed for his earlier treachery. Alauddin agrees; Padmavati then travels to Delhi to meet him. Meanwhile, Alauddin survives an assassination plot by his nephew, though he is wounded. He tracks down his nephew and kills him. The Rajputs, disguised in women‚Äôs dress, plan to ambush the Khilji soldiers in the morning, at the time for morning namƒÅz. Padmavati, along with Chittor's generals, Gora and Badal, free Ratan Singh, and escape with Mehrunisa's help. Ratan confronts Alauddin, who urges Ratan to take this opportunity to kill him in his weakened state. However, Ratan refuses as this is against the Rajput credo of not attacking the wounded. The Rajput ambush goes ahead as planned, but the Khilji soldiers are alert to it and repulse the attack, killing the attacking Rajputs. Alauddin imprisons Mehrunisa for helping the Rajputs and marches to Chittor. He and Ratan Singh engage in a single duel; Alauddin drops his sword but Ratan doesn't kill him as he is unarmed; Kafur takes the opportunity to mortally wound Ratan while his back is turned. While dying, he berates the Khilji forces for fighting dishonorably. The Khilji army defeats the Rajputs and captures Chittor, but are unable to capture the Rajput women who perform jauhar (mass suicide) along with Padmavati.

Nagmati and her husband's second wife, Padmavati, performed jauhar together after Alauddin Khilji attacked Chittor. * Ujjwal Chopra as Gora Singh  Production  = Development = An adaptation of Malik Muhammad Jayasi's epic Padmavat (1540), Sanjay Leela Bhansali had been planning a film adaptation for a decade. He first worked on a television adaptation as an assistant editor for Shyam Benegal's television series Bharat Ek Khoj (1988), based on Jawaharlal Nehru's The Discovery of India (1946), featuring an episode about Padmavat starring Om Puri as Alauddin Khilji. In 2008, Bhansali produced an opera version in Paris, inspiring him to begin work on a film version. Padmaavat also took inspiration from other earlier adaptations of the epic, including Bengali literary adaptations from Kshirode Prasad Vidyavinode in 1906 and Abanindranath Tagore in 1909, the Tamil film Chittoor Rani Padmini (1963), and the Hindi film Maharani Padmini (1964). Pre- production on the film began in July 2016. That same month, playback singer Shreya Ghoshal tweeted about performing a song composed by Bhansali for the film. Many media outlets speculated that Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone, who played the leads in Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013) and Bajirao Mastani (2015), were finalised to play Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmavati in the film. In October 2016, it was announced that Bhansali would team up with Viacom 18 Motion Pictures to produce the film with Singh and Padukone along with Shahid Kapoor as Rawal Ratan Singh, playing the lead roles. = Casting = Padmaavat is the third collaboration between Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone with Sanjay Leela Bhansali. The trio had worked before in Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela (2013) and Bajirao Mastani (2015), while it is Kapoor's first film with the three. Their co-star from the previous films, Priyanka Chopra was also in consideration to play the title role.Priyanka Chopra offered another Sanjay Leela Bhansali film? . Deccan Chronicle. Retrieved 29 May 2017. Shahrukh Khan was offered the part but felt it was not \\"meaty\\" enough and declined; failure to agree on his fee may have been a factor. Shahid Kapoor was finally cast to play Ratan Singh with an assurance of a good enough part and a hefty fee. For his role, Kapoor undertook rigorous training under trainer Samir Jaura and followed a strict diet for 40 days. He also learnt sword fighting and the basics of Mardani khel, a weapon-based martial art, and admitted that it had been one of the most physically and emotionally challenging roles of his career. Ranveer Singh portrays the antagonist of the film, Alauddin Khilji, the first negative role of his career. Director Bhansali had given him books to read delving into the psyche of dark rulers of history such as Adolf Hitler, asserting that he had to completely forget who he was before he could play Khilji. Singh trained under Mustafa Ahmed to get into proper shape for the role. The actor worked out twice a day for six days a week. Playing Khilji so affected Singh's personality and behaviour that he had to see a psychiatrist to return to normal. Jaya Bachchan recommended Aditi Rao Hydari's name to Bhansali for the role of Khilji's first wife, Mehrunisa. Bhansali cast Hydari over four other choices. She is the only member of the star cast who actually belongs to a royal lineage. Veteran actor Raza Murad portrays Alauddin's paternal uncle and Khilji dynasty founder, Sultan Jalaluddin Khilji. Murad has earlier collaborated with Bhansali in Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela and Bajirao Mastani. Jim Sarbh portrays Malik Kafur, a prominent eunuch slave-general of Alauddin Khilji. Sarbh learned horse-riding for the role. On 25 October 2017, a video of the first song from the film, titled Ghoomar, was released, in which a woman dressed like a queen appeared briefly. It was later revealed in a Twitter fanpage of Sanjay Leela Bhansali Productions, that the woman is Maharawal Ratan Singh's first wife, Rani Nagmati, who is portrayed by Anupriya Goenka. = Budget = Due to the costs mounted on the film by delay in the release, Box Office India declared the film's budget to be , which makes it the most expensive Hindi film and one of the most expensive Indian films ever made. = Costumes = Delhi-based Rimple and Harpreet Narula designed Rani Padmavati's costume using traditional Gota embroidery work of Rajasthan. The border derives from the architectural details of Rajasthani palace windows and jharokhas and the odhnis have been styled in conventional ways which are still prevalent in the Mewar belt of Rajasthan. The designer duo elaborated that the costume worn by Padukone in the final scene of the film features the tree-of- life motif and twisted gota embroidery and has a Kota dupatta with block printing. Padukone's dresses were made with Sinhalese influences, as the character of Padmavati hailed from Sri Lanka. The costumes for Shahid Kapoor were made from mulmul and cotton, with special attention given to the turbans, one of which, featuring a 28-dye lehariya, was inspired by a turban to be found at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The clothes for Ranveer Singh were based on travellers' accounts of the Turko-Persian influence on Indian clothing (Khilji was of Turko-Afghan heritage). The costumes for Aditi Rao Hydari, who plays Khilji's first wife Mehrunisa, incorporated Turkish, Afghan, Mongol and Ottoman elements to showcase Mehrunisa's Turkic origins. For both Ranveer Singh and Hydari's costumes, extensive research was done on the clothing and textiles of the Turkish belt, from Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Kazakhstan and to the Central Asian belt around Turkey. Padukone's look for the \\"Ghoomar\\" song features intricate jewellery weighing up to 3 kg designed by Tanishq featuring a triple Borla, Mathapatti and Bajuband which are traditional ornaments worn by the Rajasthani women. Vipul Amar and Harsheen Arora of Delhi-based design house 'The V Renaissance' designed costumes for Rawal Ratan Singh and Alauddin Khilji, employing historical techniques to create the armour such as cuirboilli, sculpting, chiselling, and inlaying. The armour took a team of forty workers eight months to prepare.  Soundtrack  The film score is composed by Sanchit Balhara while the songs are composed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. A. M. Turaz and Siddharth-Garima wrote the lyrics to the songs. The first song \\"Ghoomar\\", to which Padukone performs the traditional Rajasthani folk dance on a set that replicates the interior of Chittorgarh Fort, was released on 26 October 2017. The second song from the film \\"Ek Dil, Ek Jaan\\", a love ballad featuring Padukone and Shahid Kapoor, was released on 19 November 2017. The complete soundtrack was released by the record label T-Series on 6 January 2018 in Hindi, and 12 January 2018 in Tamil and Telugu.  Controversy  Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali The film became controversial during production. Several Rajput caste organisations including Shri Rajput Karni Sena and its members had protested and later vandalised the film sets claiming that the film portrays the Padmavati, a Rajput queen, in bad light. They had also assaulted Bhansali on a film set. The Sena had made further threats of violence. While filming a scene in Masai Plateau, Kolhapur at night in October 2017, some people attacked and set the set ablaze, injuring animals and destroying several costumes. Several Muslim leaders protested against the alleged misrepresentation of Ala-ud-din Khilji and called for a ban. In the days leading up to the film's release, there were violent protests and riots in several parts of India. In Haryana, the protestors had attacked several vehicles including a school bus. Bhansali and Deepika Padukone had received threats of violence. The film makers received support from the film community and industry associations including the Indian Film & Television Directors‚Äô Association, Cine & TV Artists Association, Western India Cinematographers' Association, Association of Cine & Television Art Directors & Costume Designers. The major political parties across India took conflicting stands. Several members and leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called for a ban on the film. The Rajasthan State unit of the Indian National Congress (INC) had also called for ban. The controversies surrounding the film re- opened the question of film censorship in India and the country's freedom of expression. The Supreme Court dismissed a petition calling to stop the film's release citing the freedom of speech and expression. The movie is banned in Malaysia by the Home Ministry due to its negative portrayal of a Muslim ruler.Padmavati banned in Malaysia for 'touching on the sensitivities of Islam', The Indian Express  Release  The digital streaming rights of Padmaavat were sold to Amazon Prime Video for 200‚Äì250 million in August 2017. Theatrical distribution rights in overseas territories were acquired by Paramount Pictures from Viacom 18 in October. Prime Focus Limited rendered the film in 3D. The film was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 1 December 2017 in India, but was delayed due to protests. Padmavati was initially slated for release in the United Arab Emirates on 30 November 2017 and in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2017 but the makers stated that the film would not be released in foreign territories before receiving a certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). In the end of December, CBFC approved the film for theatrical exhibition and suggested 5 modifications to the film, which includes the addition of multiple disclaimers and amending its title to Padmaavat. The change in the title was intended to be a disclaimer that the film is not a historical drama, but a cinematic adaptation of Malik Muhammad Jayasi's epic poem Padmavat. The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) passed the film with a (12A) rating and zero cuts. Post the CBFC approval with U/A certification, the film got banned by the Chief Ministers of four states Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana in order to maintain 'law and order' and avert protests in their states. The Supreme Court of India over-ruled the ban, stating that freedom of speech is to be maintained and that the states have to ensure the screening of the film without any issues. On 30 January 2018, Malaysia banned the film. Padmaavat premiered on television on 30 September 2018 on Hindi general entertainment channels (GEC) Colors, Colors HD, Hindi movie channel Rishtey Cineplex.  Reception  = Critical reception =  India  Padmaavat opened to mixed critical reviews upon release. Critics praised the visuals, and the performance of Singh, but criticised its storyline, execution, running time and the \\"unwanted\\" 3D conversion. Following its controversies, the makers held a pre-screening of Padmaavat in November 2017 for some journalists, including Arnab Goswami and Rajat Sharma, who praised the film and described it as \\"the greatest tribute to Rajput pride.\\" Rajat Sharma particularly praised Singh's performance as Khilji. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 stars and said, \\"On the whole, Padmaavat is a remarkable motion picture experience that's backed by proficient direction, spellbinding screenwriting and superlative acting. For Bhansali, it's the best title on an impressive filmography.\\" Neil Soans of The Times of India gave 4 stars and said, \\"The director's expertise in heightening opulence and grandeur is well-known, further distinguishable in 3D. Cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee compliments him by beautifully capturing some jaw-dropping scenery.\\" Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave 3.5 stars and said, \\"the real wonder of Padmaavat comes from its production and presentation. This film has phenomenal production design, costumes and camera work. The technical finesse on display is just mind boggling.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave 3.5 stars, praising Singh's performance. Kunal Guha of Mumbai Mirror gave 3.5 stars but criticised Padukone's and Kapoor 's performances. Giving 3.5 stars, Sushant Mehta of India Today panned Padukone's and Kapoor's performances calling them \\"mediocre\\" while terming Singh's \\"unconvincing\\". Anupama Chopra of Film Companion gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and said, \\"I clinically admired each frame. I applauded the work of cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee, costume designers Harpreet-Rimple, Maxima Basu, Chandrakant & Ajay, and production designers Subrata Chakraborty and Amit Ray. But I wasn't seduced by the story telling.\\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave 2.5 stars and said, \\"Padmaavat is spectacular [to look]: no one can do spectacle like Bhansali. You can easily delight in it while the going is good. But nearly three hours of it, and looping rhetoric around what constitutes Rajput valour can and does become tiresome.\\" Mayur Sanap of Deccan Chronicle criticised the execution and the length and gave 2.5 stars. Suparna Sharma, also of Deccan Chronicle gave 2.5 stars and said, \\"Padmaavat is offensively chauvinistic, blatantly right- wing, and quite unabashedly anti-Muslim\\". Raja Sen of NDTV India gave 1.5 stars and said, \\"Bhansali takes an unbearable length of time to spark the flame. Things go on and on and on, with characters it is impossible to care about. They may appear attractive from time to time, certainly, but these protagonists are inconsistent, infuriating and test the patience.\\" Rediff.com also gave 1.5 stars calling it \\"superficial\\" and wrote \\"Deepika Padukone gets an absolute raw deal as the Queen; her performance is submissively overwrought, blandly weighted, and her speeches combined with the leisureliness of the narrative's pacing, can put you in a stupor. Worst of all, you will be driven by the suspicion if Padukone even does enough to deserve the movie's title. Namrata Joshi of The Hindu gave a negative review noting the film is \\"a yawn fest\\" and \\"an interminable expanse of unadulterated dullness.\\" She also criticised the 3D conversion writing \\"The opulence doesn't seem as awe-inspiring, the special effects, especially in some of the battle scenes, are plain tacky and the actors seem like cardboard dolls of themselves in the long shots, acquiring a human visage only in extreme\\". Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost criticised the film giving 1 star out of 5 writing \\"Padmaavat is a perfect example of a Hindi film couching its extreme prejudices in grandiloquence and tacky clich√©s, with those clich√©s embedded in resplendent frames.\\"  Overseas  Mike McCahill of The Guardian gave 4 stars and said, \\"It's not just the extravagance that catches the eye, but the precision with which it's applied. Every twirl of every sari and every arrow in every battle appears to have been guided by the hands of angels. Such excess could have proved deadening, but dynamic deployment of old-school star power keeps almost all its scenes alive with internal tensions.\\" Shilpa Jamkhandikar published a mixed review in Reuters, who noted, \\"But unlike Bhansali's earlier films, where he was able to find emotional depth even in opulent historical romances, this one falls short\\". But she praised Ranveer Singh's performance as Khilji.Movie Review: Padmaavat. Reuters. Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News opined that the quality of the work was lower than that in other Bhansali films. Sadaf Haider of DAWN Images said that the film is \\"a flawed history lesson\\", however, she praised the film visual, music and most of the act. Rahul Aijaz of The Express Tribune rated 4.5 out of 5 stars; he too praised the film and said that it \\"doesn't set up false expectations and then disappoint\\" due to \\"perfect storytelling\\", and \\"memorable performances\\". A Pakistani critic, Haroon Khalid, had disliked the portrayal of Khilji as a stereotypical evil Muslim king and Ratan Singh as the righteous Hindu king. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 58% based on 26 reviews, with a rating average of 6.4/10. = Box office = Due to the numerous controversies associated with Padmaavat before its release which resulted in banning the film in certain states, the film's commercial performance was highly unpredictable. The film was released in only 70% of places in India. However, despite limited screenings, the film earned an estimated in Wednesday paid previews. The following day, the film opened nationwide across 4,800 screens of which over 500 screens were shown in Tamil and Telugu. It earned an estimated nett on its opening day in India, excluding previews, which was considered impressive despite its ban in numerous big states and marked a career best opening for Ranveer Singh, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Shahid Kapoor and fourth biggest for Padukone (behind Happy New Year, Chennai Express and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani). On Friday, the film added another , owing to national holiday on Republic Day. This was followed by a gradual fall on Saturday taking in another . Through Sunday, the film delivered an opening weekend of and became the fourteenth film to enter the 100 crore club in just under 4 days. Furthermore, it broke the record for the biggest IMAX opening in India with US$461,000 from 12 screens. However, due to its limited screenings, the film nevertheless lost over in box office receipts during its opening weekend. Outside India, the film broke all-time opening day records in Australia (A$367,984), surpassing the likes of Dangal and the dubbed-Hindi version of Baahubali: The Conclusion. One of the reason behind the film's successful run in the country was because Paramount (the overseas distributing company) was able to secure release in all three major theatre chains (Hoyts, Event Cinemas and Village Cinemas) unlike other Bollywood films which have to choose between the two latter. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $1.13 million on its opening day. This was followed by the biggest ever single-day for a Hindi film with $1.8 million on Saturday, breaking the previous record held by PK ($1.41 million). Although Baahubali: The Conclusion still holds the record for all Indian films, that is inclusive of three different languages. It went on to set a new opening weekend record for a Hindi film with $4.2 million, and witnessed the second best per-theatre- average inside the top 10 with $13,188 from 324 theatres. As of 6 February 2018, the film has crossed worldwide, making it one of the top 10 highest- grossing Bollywood films of all time. Its domestic net income was in the fourth weekend of its run. The film has grossed worldwide.  Historical inaccuracies  In the film, the Delhi Sultanate's flag is shown in green colour with a white crescent moon. The Sultanate actually had a green flag with a black band running vertically on the left. = Portrayal of Jalaluddin and Alauddin Khilji = Before their ascension to the throne, Jalaluddin and Alauddin Khilji were known as Malik Feroze and Ali Gurshasp, respectively. Jalaluddin Khilji is portrayed as an arrogant, cunning and cruel man, though he was actually popular for being a mild-mannered, humble, and pious ruler. Jalaluddin ascended the throne of Delhi in 1290 only to end the chaos that ensued after the death of Sultan Ghiyas ud din Balban. He was not ambitious by nature and did not lead an attack on the Delhi Sultanate from Ghazni, Afghanistan. The portrayal of Alauddin Khilji in the film has been criticised by historians and critics for its historical and geographical inaccuracies and not staying faithful to the epic Padmavat. The film shows an unsuccessful assassination plot by Alauddin's nephew, one which seriously injures the Sultan, but none of this actually happened. Historian Rana Safvi wrote that Khilji was sophisticated, not barbarian as portrayed in the film. Historian Mohammed Safiullah also criticised Khilji's portrayal and the implicit depiction of a homosexual relationship between Khilji and his slave-general Malik Kafur. Historian Archana Ojha of Delhi University criticised Alauddin Khilji's look and clothing in the film.

The Old Norwegian Sheep (Norwegian: Gammelnorsk sau) is likely the breed that most closely resembles the original Northern European short-tailed sheep in Norway. Although the breed almost went extinct at several points in the last century, conservation efforts have succeeded in growing the population to around 30,000 animals and the breed is no longer considered threatened. The breed is particularly suited for being kept outside all year, a practice that stems back to the Viking Age.  History and origins  The breed likely descends from bronze-age sheep from Western Norway. This was the most common breed in Norway until the end of the 19th century, when it was overtaken by breeds that had been imported from England since the early 1700s. In the beginning 20th century, only small and scattered populations of Norwegian short-tailed sheep remained. Today, all Old Norwegian Sheep descend from Austevoll. = Split from Sp√¶lsau = In 1912, two breeding programmes was started to conserve what remained of this original Norwegian sheep stock. One of these breeding stations housed coastal sheep, which eventually gave rise to the Old Norwegian Sheep, whereas the other breeding station housed inland sheep, which eventually gave rise to the closely related Sp√¶lsau.  Characteristics  Old Norwegian Sheep is small and easy at foot. The colour scheme varies greatly. Unlike Sp√¶lsau, it is not desirable for the wool to be long, as this can cause issues during winter. The breed naturally sheds its wool, and so there should be little or no need to shear. Rams should have horns and ewes may have horns. = Herd behaviour = Ewes and lambs form herds of 20-40 animals, whilst rams form herds of their own. The breed is particularly alert, and there is alway one animal on guard. When escaping predators, the herd will flee in a distinctive pattern that draws the predator towards the stronger animals thereby protecting weaker individuals. Because of the breed's speed, losses to predators are very rarely registered. = Grazing = The grazing habits of the Old Norwegian Sheep is adapted to the heather moorlands of Coastal Norway. In addition to common heather, Old Norwegian Sheep graze on leaves, herbs, kelp and other seaweeds. The breed can dig through the snow to reach heather even during the winter. This, combined with the relatively mild winters in Coastal Norway, means that the breed is capable of being kept outside the entire year. = Meat = The Old Norwegian Sheep does not produce a lot of meat. The meat is renowned for being tender and marbled. If reared traditionally, the taste is described as approaching gamey and is considered sweeter than normal mutton when cured.  Protected brand name  Norsk Villsau (literally Norwegian Wild Sheep) is a trade mark for Old Norwegian Sheep that is reared in the traditional fashion by being kept outside all year in Norwegian heather moorland. Since 2010 Villsau fra Norskekysten (Wild Sheep from Coastal Norway) has also been a protected geographical indication in Norway. The owner of both the trademark and the protected geographical indication is the common-interest association Norsk Villsaulag. The creation of the brand name appears to correlate with a subsequent increased interest in keeping the breed.

Proofs The inductive and algebraic proofs both make use of Pascal's identity: :{n \\\\choose k}={n-1\\\\choose k-1}+{n-1\\\\choose k}. =Inductive proof= This identity can be proven by mathematical induction on n. _Base case_ Let n=r; :\\\\sum^n_{i=r} {i\\\\choose r} = \\\\sum^r_{i=r}{i\\\\choose r}={r\\\\choose r} = 1 = {r+1\\\\choose r+1} = {n+1\\\\choose r+1}. _Inductive step_ Suppose, for some k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}, k \\\\geqslant r, :\\\\sum^k_{i=r}{i\\\\choose r}={k+1\\\\choose r+1} Then :\\\\sum^{k+1}_{i=r} {i\\\\choose r} = \\\\left(\\\\sum^k_{i=r} {i\\\\choose r} \\\\right) + {k+1\\\\choose r}={k+1\\\\choose r+1}+{k+1\\\\choose r}={k+2\\\\choose r+1}. =Algebraic proof= We use a telescoping argument to simplify the computation of the sum: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum_{t=\\\\color{blue}0}^n \\\\binom{t}{k} =\\\\sum_{t=\\\\color{blue}k}^n\\\\binom tk &= \\\\sum_{t=k}^n\\\\left[ \\\\binom {t+1}{k+1}-\\\\binom {t}{k+1}\\\\right] &=\\\\sum_{t=\\\\color{green}k}^{\\\\color{green}n}\\\\binom {\\\\color{green}{t+1}}{k+1} - \\\\sum_{t=k}^n \\\\binom t{k+1} &=\\\\sum_{t=\\\\color{green}{k+1}}^{\\\\color{green}{n+1}}\\\\binom {\\\\color{green}{t}}{k+1} - \\\\sum_{t=k}^n \\\\binom t{k+1} &=\\\\binom{n+1}{k+1}-\\\\underbrace{\\\\binom k{k+1}}_0&&\\\\text{by telescoping} &=\\\\binom{n+1}{k+1}. \\\\end{align} =A combinatorial proof= Imagine that we are distributing n indistinguishable candies to k distinguishable children. By a direct application of the stars and bars method, there are :\\\\binom{n+k-1}{ k-1} ways to do this. Alternatively, we can first give 0\\\\leqslant i\\\\leqslant n candies to the oldest child so that we are essentially giving n-i candies to k-1 kids and again, with stars and bars and double counting, we have :\\\\binom{n+k-1}{ k-1}=\\\\sum_{i=0}^n\\\\binom{n+k-2-i}{k-2}, which simplifies to the desired result by taking n' = n+k-2 and r=k-2, and noticing that n'-n = k-2=r: :\\\\binom{n'+1}{ r+1}=\\\\sum_{i=0}^n \\\\binom {n'-i}r = \\\\sum_{i=r}^{n'} \\\\binom {i}r . =Another combinatorial proof= We can form a committee of size k+1 from a group of n+1 people in : \\\\binom{n+1}{k+1} ways. Now we hand out the numbers 1,2,3,\\\\dots,n-k+1 to n-k+1 of the n+1 people. We can divide this into n-k+1 disjoint cases. In general, in case x, 1\\\\leqslant x\\\\leqslant n-k+1, person x is on the committee and persons 1,2,3,\\\\dots, x-1 are not on the committee. This can be done in :\\\\binom{n-x+1}{k} ways. Now we can sum the values of these n-k+1 disjoint cases, getting : \\\\binom{n+1}{k+1} = \\\\binom n k + \\\\binom {n-1} k + \\\\binom{n-2} k + \\\\cdots + \\\\binom{k+1} k+ \\\\binom k k.

Adjoining it there is the Orfanotrofio Femminile di San Pietro.  History  This church is one of the oldest ones in Alcamo, as it is proved by a document dating back to 1367. Annexed to a female Orphanage in 1631, it was rebuilt during the years 1645‚Äì1649 at the expense of Francesco Graffeo, a priest, and was widened in 1742 after the design of the architect Giovanni Biagio Amico and with an elegant series of stuccoes.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi- Castellammare Golfo p.82, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982. The roof, fallen down owing to the 1968 Belice earthquake, was reconstructed about 20 years ago; thanks to the financing of 300 millions liras and the zeal of its president Mario Adamo, the Office of Works (Genio civile) put out on contract for the works of restoration and consolidation. Then they repaired the roofing to avoid any further damage due to bad weather. Unfortunately the surviving decorations have been damaged by the years of exposure to atmospheric agents. The interior is not integral altogether, but now it is important that it has been safeguarded.  Benedectine Nuns  According to the assertion by the Benedictine Father Pietro Antonio Tornamira, in one of his works dating back to 1664, a group of Oblate Benedictine Nuns of the Third Order administrated \\"the House of the Young Girls of Saint Peter. Since 1631, very probably these Nuns, besides charitable actions, devoted themselves to the education of the girls sheltered in the Orphanage, and also made some handicrafts (weaving, sewing, mending and embroidery) earning their livings from the proceeds. .Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.227, Alcamo, Campo, 2001 Even after 1866, when the institution passed to the local municipality, they continues these activities Today these premises are run by IPAB (Public Institution of Assistance and Charity: Opere Pie Pastore and San Pietro) and the activities connexed with hospitality and education of poor children are carried on.  Description and works  The 1649 main portal is remarkable for its artistic beauty. In the Church, which was with one nave, there were these five altars: *Saint Peter, a 17th century valuable painting, on the high altar On the side altars there were placed the following paintings: * saint Rosalia * Our Lady with Saint Benedict. * Our Lady of Sorrows * Jesus‚Äô birth, a painting The group of works that today are hosted at the Sacred Art Museum inside the Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption; among these there is also a painting which represents Saint Peter and another one with Saint Rosalia, probable works of one of Pietro Novelli‚Äô pupils.

It is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types. UBE2Z is an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and participates in the second step of protein ubiquitination during proteolysis. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed the UBE2Z gene to be associated with chronic kidney disease. The UBE2Z gene also contains one of 27 SNPs associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease.  Structure  = Gene = The UBE2Z gene resides on chromosome 17 at the band 17q21.32 and contains 7 exons. This gene produces 2 isoforms through alternative splicing. The UBE2Z cDNA spans a length of 3,054 base pairs. = Protein = This protein belongs to the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme family and is one of the E2 enzymes. UBE2Z spans 246 amino acids, 150 of which encode a conserved 16‚Äì18 kDa ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 domain (UBC domain) that is located at the enzyme‚Äôs N-terminal and responsible for the enzyme‚Äôs catalytic function. This UBC domain has a relatively inflexible Œ≤-sheet structure with flanking helices and contains a highly conserved cysteine residue, Cys80, which functions as an active site for the thiol ester formation with ubiquitin. UBE2Z also contains a C-terminal extension, suggested to participate in substrate binding, which is characteristic of a class II E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme.  Function  The UBE2Z gene is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, and its expression is relatively high in placenta, pancreas, spleen and testis. Notably, its expression in cancer tissues is much higher than in relevant normal tissues, especially in kidney, lymph node, colon and ovary cancer. As an E2 member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, UBE2Z mainly participates in the second step of protein ubiquitination, which is a major component of protein degradation machinery. Specifically, UBE2Z receives ubiquitin (Ub) from ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), mediates the transfer of Ub from E2 to substrate, directly or indirectly with the help of ligase enzyme (E3), which interacts with the substrate and E2-Ub complex. UBE2Z could only be charged by Ub or FAT10 from UBA6 instead of UBA1, distinguishing it from other E2s.  Clinical significance  A study in genetic variants that regulate lipid metabolism and determine the susceptibility to dyslipidemia in Japanese individuals revealed that UBE2Z, together with ZPR1 and Interleukin-6R, may be important loci for hypertriglyceridemia. Moreover, in a GWAS among 2247 Japanese individuals, 29 polymorphisms that were previously identified as susceptible loci for coronary artery disease were investigated to identify a correlation of these loci to chronic kidney disease. This GWAS meta-analysis revealed through a chi-square test that rs46522 on the UBE2Z gene was significantly related to chronic kidney disease. = Clinical marker = A multi-locus genetic risk score study based on a combination of 27 loci, including the UBE2Z gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary artery disease events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).

Early life  Born in Gandellino, near Bergamo, Italy, Tonoli started his music career at the age of 15. Refusing to learn music from teachers and conservatory, he continued to play for many years as a self taught musician.  Career  Listening to Yiruma, Yann Tiersen and Ludovico Einaudi led Tonoli to compose a few songs, which in 2012 were released as his first album, Human. In 2013, he lost his father due to a serious disease and that led him to stay out of the music world for a while. After some months of loneliness, he wrote and recorded his 2nd album, Human B-Side. He started a netlabel the same year. His work was played at several concerts while he was working on his third album. In 2014, he played some pieces of classical music and published them as his first side-album, under the title of \\"IrideScent Past\\". He went to London in April that year to play at \\"Ont'Sofa\\" at the Gibson HQ. Tonoli released his first music video on December 19, 2014 for the song \\"Aurora\\". This song was the first track from his fourth album, Met by the Moonlight, which was released the same month. From the beginning of 2015, he started touring Italy with Met by the Moonlight, and in February he released his first official collection Ace of Hearts. In February 2015, he earned his first nomination for an international award, the Hollywood Music in Media Awards 2015 as the best New Age Artist of the Year with the song \\"Aurora\\". Tonoli stayed in Hollywood for the entire month of November, composing his new album and attending the awards. On December 21, 2015, he released a Special Edition of Met by the Moonlight. In 2016 he started a \\"comeback\\" tour in Italy, starting from Gandellino. From 2014 to 2016, he was a member of the Post-Rock Italian band L.E.D. In 2017 he released his new album AnarchAngel Vol.1 which he took on tour for the entire year in Europe.

The term has also been used to describe political criteria used openly or implicitly by some governments to assess the adequacy of income levels. MIS is the basis for the calculation of the UK living wage.  Origins  MIS was originally funded, in 2006, under the title of a Minimum Income Standard for Britain, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, and carried out in partnership by the Centre for Research in Social Policy (CRSP) at Loughborough University and the Family Budget Unit at the University of York. The research is now fully carried out by CRSP. MIS represents a budget standard in its specification of the level of disposable income households need in order to achieve an adequate standard of living. MIS may also be referred to as a reference budget, as it provides a costed list of items that households need to buy. Unlike some other kinds of reference budget that draw heavily on expert input, MIS is informed by budget lists drawn up by members of the public, checked by experts, and approved by final ‚Äòcheck-back‚Äô groups of members of the public. The use of consensual focus groups was developed at CRSP in the 1990s,Robert Walker (1987). Consensual Approaches to the Definition of Poverty: Towards an Alternative Methodology. Journal of Social Policy, 16, pp 213¬¨226 doi:10.1017/S0047279400020389 while the FBU focused on expert-based standards. MIS brought these two approaches together. Detailed research with members of the public takes forward Peter Townsend (sociologist) work on relative poverty and low income, which argued that living conditions must be seen in the context of widely held expectations of the resources that members of a society should have. The first MIS orientation groups were tasked with setting a definition of MIS, which continues to be used to define the Minimum Income Standard for the United Kingdom: ‚Äòa minimum standard of living in Britain today includes, but is more than just, food, clothes and shelter. It is about having what you need in order to have the opportunities and choices necessary to participate in society‚Äô. The original research was carried out in Britain in 2007 and the findings presented in 2008 were costed using April 2008 prices. Every July, new MIS figures are published, updated to April of the same year. The updates take on board inflation and changes in minimum needs. The most recent Minimum Income Standard Report in 2017, funded by Trust for London, found that 39% of Londoners have an income below the Minimum Income Standard. This is higher than the rate of 30% in the UK as a whole.  Method  MIS researchers facilitate a sequence of deliberative Focus groups, all of which have detailed negotiations to come to a consensus about the things a household would have to be able to afford in order to achieve an acceptable living standard. Three waves of groups identify and check which items are to be included, with each successive group either corroborating or amending the decisions of previous groups. Groups are made up of people from a mixture of socio-economic backgrounds but all participants within each group are from the type of household under discussion. For example, pensioner groups decide the minimum for pensioners. The MIS method develops negotiated consensus through projection, whereby group members are asked not to think of their own needs and tastes but of the needs of hypothetical individuals or case studies. Participants are asked to imagine they are in the home of the individuals under discussion and to explain what items they would need in their everyday life to reach the living standard set out in the definition of MIS. Where groups fall short of consensus, subsequent groups help to resolve differences. Experts check that these specifications adequately fulfil needs relating to nutrition and fuel consumption and, in some cases, feed information back to subsequent research groups that check and amend the budgets.  UK Variations  In identifying things that everyone should be able to afford, MIS does not attempt to specify extra requirements for particular individuals and groups: for example, those resulting from living in a remote location or having a disability. So, not everybody who has more than the minimum income can be guaranteed to achieve an acceptable living standard. However, someone falling below the minimum is unlikely to achieve such a standard. MIS was originally calculated as a minimum for Britain; subsequent research in Northern Ireland in 2009 showed that the required budgets there are all close to those in the rest of the United Kingdom, so the national budget standard now applies to the whole of the UK. This standard was calculated based on the needs of people in urban areas. Further projects have looked at how requirements differ in rural areas and in London, respectively. CRSP has also carried out research to further understanding of additional costs of living for households with additional needs. Research that produced minimum budgets for people who are Visual impairment and people who are Hearing loss was conducted in 2015 and 2016. This was funded by Thomas Pocklington Trust.  UK Applications  The calculation for the Living Wage is based on MIS and is used by the Living Wage Foundation to accredit Living Wage Employers. The uprating of the Living Wage figure each year takes account of rises in living costs and any changes in what people define as a ‚Äòminimum‚Äô. The present system, using MIS to calculate living costs separately for London and the rest of the UK, was designed in 2016 under the supervision of the Living Wage Commission, to replace the previous systems in which the London and out of London rates had been set using different methods. The Commission distinguished the independent, accredited Living Wage from the so-called \\"National Living Wage\\" (a higher statutory minimum for over-25s introduced by the UK Government in 2016), as follows: The defining feature that differentiates the independent Living Wage rates from the statutory wage floors is that they are based on analysis of the specific goods and services that employees and their families need to meet a minimum acceptable standard of living. It is important that this basket of goods is regularly updated, based on the views and experiences of ordinary people across all four nations of the UK about what is required to fully participate in society, and how social norms and needs change over time. The Living Wage Commission currently views the Minimum Income Standard research carried out by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University as the best available source for this basket of goods.http://www.livingwage.org.uk/sites/default/files/The%20Living%20Wage%20Commission%20Sept%202016%20report..pdf MIS has been used in evidence in a landmark High Court ruling on asylum seekers‚Äô benefits and in evidence put to the Welfare Reform and Work Public Bill Committee about reforming child poverty targets. The Scottish Government has used evidence from CRSP to encourage all Scottish employers to pay the Living Wage, and the Scottish Government itself has committed to paying the Living Wage as part of its public sector pay policy. The Minimum Income Calculator is an online tool that can be used by members of the public to calculate the minimum budget for their own household.  Development in Other Countries  Outside the United Kingdom, the CRSP team has applied the method in Guernsey and supported studies in other countries. Projects adopting the MIS method have been undertaken in the Republic of Ireland, France,ONPES (Observatoire National de la Pauvret√© et de l‚ÄôExclusion Social) (2015) Les Budgets de R√©f√©rence: Une M√©thode d‚ÄôEvaluation des Besoins Pour Une Participation Effective √† la Vie Sociale. Paris: ONPES Japan, Portugal and Austria. Exploratory projects in Mexico and South Africa have been supported by CRSP.  MIS and Poverty  MIS is relevant to the discussion of poverty, but does not claim to be a poverty threshold. This is because participants in the research were not specifically asked to talk about what defines poverty. However, it is relevant to the poverty debate in that almost all households officially defined as being in income poverty (having below 60 percent of median income) are also below MIS. Thus households classified as in relative income poverty are generally unable to reach an acceptable standard of living as defined by members of the public.

Unlike much Old Welsh, which is attested in manuscripts from later periods and in partially updated form, the Welsh material in the Juvencus Manuscript was written in the Old Welsh period itself; the manuscript provides the first attestation of many Welsh words.John T.

Provenance The manuscript was originally produced somewhere in Wales as a text of the Latin poem Evangeliorum Libri by Juvencus. This text was produced by more than ten different scribes, working around 900. One had the Old Irish name Nuadu. Another included his name as a cryptogram in Greek letters: the Welsh name Cemelliauc (modern Welsh Cyfeilliog), who could have been the same person as the Bishop Cameleac whom the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes as being captured by Vikings in the see in Ergyng in 914. To this text the scribes added a large body of glosses in Latin and Old Welsh, along with a few in Old Irish, showing that the manuscript was produced in a milieu influenced by both Welsh and Irish scholarship.John T.

The aquifer shares a name with the local river, the Willamette River, originating from a Clackamas Chinook word. The \\"mette\\" of Willamette was used by the Clackamas to mean water or river. The Willamette valley is home to 70% of Oregon's population, with the aquifer supplying water for agricultural, domestic, and industrial purposes. Reported in 2005, the total water use from the aquifer was 1.6 hm3 (420 million gallons) per day, with 58% going to irrigation, 24% to public supply, and 18% to industrial use. In general, the aquifer withdraw is sufficiently compensated in the long term by recharge through precipitation, however regions of the aquifer have shown long term declines, including that regions underlain by the Columbia River basalt unit. However, during the dry season from June-September, withdrawals from the aquifer result is significant seasonal variations in the ground water table height, changing by more than 60 ft. In the state of Oregon, all water is publicly owned and maintenance and protection of water is done by the Oregon Water Resources Department and the Oregon Water Resources Commission. However, local governments can provide land use permits for aquifer use, notably, use for new rural residences.  Hydrogeology  The Willamette Lowland basin-fill aquifer is composed of many geologic units that are broadly separated into six hydrogeological categories. These categories are listed from lowest to highest. The lowest unit is the basement confining unit, composed of tertiary marine sedimentary rocks and Eocene volcanic rocks near the Oregon Coast Range, and volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks near the Cascade Range. This unit has low permeability and low porosity, but still can provide water at a low rate. Generally, above basement unit is the Columbia River basalt unit, consisting of flood-basalt lavas. In this unit, water is stored in the region between two lava flows, where weather has created porosity in the rock unit. Because of this, water is able to flow horizontally through the unit, but generally has very low vertical permeability. Above the Columbia River Basalt is the lower sedimentary unit, which also sometimes directly overlays the basement unit. This unit constitutes the bulk of the basin-fill of the Willamette Lowland basin-fill aquifer. The basin-fill sediments are due to erosion from rock formations located above that have filled in the basin below. Local sand and gravel beds can have moderate to high productivity for water. This Map of the Hydrogeological Units of the Willamette Lowland Aquifer The middle sedimentary unit overlies the lower sedimentary unit. This unit is generally thinner than the lower sedimentary unit. It consists of mainly sands and gravels from the Pleistocene. This unit along with the lower sedimentary unit have high porosity and high permeability, resulting in high water yields. Agriculture typically uses these units for irrigation. The uppermost unit is the Willamette silt unit. This unit is composed of fine grained silts. The silt unit covers the lowland, but in some areas it has been washed away by erosion. The high porosity of this unit makes it suitable for storing water, but the low permeability makes it difficult to extract large quantities. Thus, this unit is typically used for domestic water supplies. It was an important source of water for early settlers in the Willamette valley. The Willamette silt act as an impermeable layer to the underlying water storing layers, resulting in the aquifer behaving as a confined aquifer in these regions where it exists.  Recharge  The high precipitation in this region results in large volumes of recharge for the aquifer. In the low land areas, rainfall can exceed 1400mm (55 in) /yr. In the mountainous regions, rainfall can exceed 2500 mm (100 in) /yr. Where the middle, lower sedimentary, and Columbia River basalt units are exposed to the surface, water can seep into the aquifer from above. The Willamette silt unit limits recharge to underlying layers due to its low vertical hydraulic conductivity. Models show recharge in the mountainous regions to exceed 40 in/yr; most of this likely discharges into streams, making it unavailable for groundwater inflow into lowland areas. Due to the Columbia River basalt unit's low vertical permeability, recharge of this unit, especially deep areas is limited. Pumping from the deep Columbia River unit has impacted areas six miles or more away from the pumping site. This results in long-term declines in this unit that are not typically observed elsewhere in the aquifer system.

On 25 April in the year 1736 he reached his fatherland again. The following year was united in holy matrimony with Antje Harken, and they had five children, one son and four daughters. All survived the death of their father on 13 October in the year 1754, after 46 years and 13 weeks of life. Various types of ships are depicted. Gravestone of miller Erk Knudten The inscription continues on the reverse side: :\\"May God grant him a joyful resurrection on the earliest day.\\" From the grave I speak the following lines of remembrance: Unfortunately, in my young years I had to yield myself to the Algerians and undergo almost 12 years of slavery. But God with his mighty hand set me free. Therefore I say once again, I know my God that I must die. But do not consider my faults. Protect thou the widow's home and, oh God, because I cannot care for them, take the wife and children under your care. The largest gravestones formerly stood on the graves of Amrumers who took part in the lucrative whaling expeditions to Greenland. Other artistically carved stones marked the graves of members of the upper class and other prosperous families. Each engraved letter cost about 3 gold marks, while an average man earned only about 10 gold marks a year. However, in a good season a whaling ship's captain could bring home around 900 marks.Beatrice H√§rig: Die sprechenden Steine von Amrum. Seelen unter Segel. In Monumente- Online, June 2015. The graves of poor people usually were marked by only a red sandstone slab with dates of birth and death or with a simple wooden cross. Many gravestones are decorated with depictions of ships. Typical vessels represented include fishing smacks, galiots, , koffs, brigs, barques, whalers and armed cargo ships (Handelsfregatten). However, these ship carvings did not necessarily mean the deceased was a sailor; rather, they symbolized the voyage of life or, when anchored in a harbor, the end of life's journey. Other designs include a Dutch windmill on the gravestone of the seafarer and later miller Erk Knudten (1733‚Äì1801), and a man in a Sunday suit on the marker of the church sacristan Hark Knudten. Flowers on gravestones are thought to represent a full life, although broken stalks denote relatives of the deceased that had died earlier. History The first of Amrum's gravestones were finished in the last decades of the 17th century. During this period, the standard of living on Amrum began to increase rapidly due to the proceeds of whaling. But economic conditions began to decline in the early 19th century, so there are fewer \\"talking gravestones\\" from then on. After the Second Schleswig War in 1864 Amrum was briefly ruled cooperatively by Prussia and Austria, but after the former's victory over Austria in 1866 it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Then, in 1871, Prussia was subsumed into the newly united German Empire, in which Amrum was part of the Province of Schleswig- Holstein. The new Wilhelmine rulers disliked the \\"disorderly\\" old cemetery in Nebel and substituted die-straight walks, placing some 'talking' gravestones in the cemetery walls. In that location some weathered quickly and became illegible. The Way of the Stones In 2009, a group of local residents began a drive to restore the gravestones, though some could no longer be rescued. The project ultimately cost 330,000 euros.Simone Viere, Kirche auf Amrum rettet ‚Äûsprechende‚Äú Grabsteine. Evangelischer Pressedienst, 12 October 2012. For the new arrangement, the St. Clemens congregation placed the 152 gravestones in thematically related sections along a \\"Way of the Stones\\" (Allee der Steine).

Two arches of a Roman bridge were found in the basement of the mosque-tomb complex during a renovation project. Geography Tarsus is an old city and is known as the birthplace of Paul the Apostle. The Mausoleum of Danyal, the mosque and the arches of the Roman bridge, are located in a neighborhood of the city which is full of historical buildings such as the Grand Mosque of Tarsus, the Tarsus Old Mosque and Saint Paul's Church. It is at . The mosque is to the north and the tomb as well as the arches of the bridge are situated to the south of the complex. Its distance to Mersin is . Legend of Daniel Although Danyal in Islam is not included in the list of the 25 Islamic Prophets, he is considered to be a holy figure. According to legend, during a famine period Danyal was invited to Tarsus and brought prosperity to the city. When he died he was buried in Tarsus. In 1857, a small mosque was built next to the place where his body was thought to lie, even before his tomb was unearthed. Subsequently, the mosque was named after him.Mersin City quide According to a source which refers to an 11th-century Arabic language source, Tarsus was captured by the Rashidun caliph Umar. A subordinate of Umar found a large coffin and a ring on the finger of the deceased. There was a figure of two lions and a boy on the ring and Umar predicted that the deceased was Danyal. In order to protect the coffin, Umar buried the coffin under the river.Academic Abd√ºlbari Yƒ±ldƒ±z in Yumuktepe page History of the bridge The arches are part of a large Roman bridge constructed in the 1st century AD.Ministry of Culture: M√ºze √áalƒ±≈ümalarƒ±, Kurtarma √áalƒ±≈ümalarƒ± Sempozyumu (\\"The Symposium of Museums and rescue excavations\\") pp.32‚Äì46 Before the 6th century, the course of the Berdan River lay within the city, and the city suffered from the irregular flow rate and the seasonal floods. The Byzantine Emperor Justinianus I (reigned 527‚Äì565) had an alternative course to the east of the city constructed to reduce the risk of floods.Researcher ≈ûakin √ñzkan in Yumuktepe page The Roman bridge had spanned the river's former course and had lost its function after the river was diverted. When the city was captured by the Arabs (ca. 7th‚Äì9th centuries) they found the useless bridge, and it seems they used a part of the bridge as a tomb. However, because of the floods in the following centuries, the ground level of Tarsus was slowly rising and the former bridge was buried under the ground. The long-forgotten bridge might have been unearthed in 1946 during a city sewage project when a part of the arch was found. But unconscious of its historical value, the constructor partially damaged it while laying water pipes. It was only recently that the two arches were rediscovered. In 2002, during the renewal of Danyal's Mosque to add a abdestlik (\\"wudu place\\"), the constructor unearthed a part of a big arch several meters underground. After a rescue excavation by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in 2006, the arch of a drop-vault bridge and an accompanying small building, which houses an Islamic tomb, were unearthed. Although there was no inscription on the tomb, it was popularly taken to be the tomb of Danyal in accordance with the popular belief.Mersin Governorship: Mersin √ñren Yerleri Kaleleri M√ºzeleri (\\"Mersin Ruins, castles and museums\\"), pp.84‚Äì85 Archaeology Judging from the size of the arch, there must be more arches of the former bridge. The other arches are still buried under the urban fabric, including other valuable historical buildings, and presently they have not been excavated. The size of the main underground compartment of the two arches is and the dimension of the adjacent compartment of the tomb to the northeast is . The depth of the foundation of the arch is and the depth of the highest point is with respect to ground level. For structural performance, the voussoirs were jointed with lead-coated iron fittings. On the wall adjacent to the tomb, a hectogram had been carved. There are some small finds, which are thought to belong to a yet unearthed bath, and four coins of the Rashidun Caliphate.

It is set to a Russian folk melody. It is a love song that starts with conventional lyrics about a quiet night and sky full of stars, but quickly turns to the realities of war. The song is addressed to a beautiful woman who succeeded in ambushing a Nazi convoy. The song celebrates Vitka Kempner, a Jewish partisan, and her successful attack, an act of sabotage, on a German train in the Vilnius sector. It was the first attack by the Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (FPO), organization of Jewish partisans from the Vilna Ghetto. Kempner and Itzik Matskevich threw a hand grenade at the convoy damaging it. The snow and frost mentioned in the lyrics are poetic liberties as the attack occurred in summer 1942. The song is noted for its celebration of a woman partisan ‚Äì active fighting and resistance were not traditional roles for a woman, even during the war. Ruth Rubin also noted the use of three words ‚Äì shpayer (a local word from Vilnius), nagan (a Russian term referring to Nagant M1895), and pistoyl (a German term) ‚Äì to denote an automatic pistol.

Life Bernhard Ludwig Dreifus was born into a protestant family in Z√ºrich. His father, Bernhard Dreifus (1844‚Äì1929), was a Z√ºrich businessman, originally from Aargau. His mother, Emilie Louise Diebold (1848‚Äì1932), came from a well established Z√ºrich family. His parents divorced in 1900 following which, in 1902, he registered a name change from Bernhard Dreifus to Bernhard Diebold. Between 1904 and 1906 he studied Law at Z√ºrich, cutting short his studies and moving to Vienna in 1906, possibly inspired by Josef Kainz. He volunteered at the city's Court Theatre (\\"Burgtheater\\"), taking small stage parts and studying at its theatre school between 1906 and 1908. He went on to study Drama and Germanistics in Vienna and Berlin. His teachers at Berlin included Max Herrmann and Erich Schmidt. It was Herrmann who supervised his doctorate, which he received at Bern in 1912 for a piece of work on \\"The role of comportment in eighteenth century theatre\\" (\\"Das Rollenfach im deutschen Theaterbetrieb des 18. Jahrhunderts\\"), which was published the next year as a small book. Diebold lived in Munich from 1913, working as a Dramaturge at the Schauspielhaus (as the \\"Kammerspiele\\" theatre was known at that time). At the same time he wrote his first theatre critiques and reviews. In 1917 he relocated again, to Frankfurt where he worked as an editor on the Feuilleton section of the city's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). Since 1916 he had also been contributing arts related pieces to other newspapers, notably the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, but the principal focus of his newspaper career nevertheless remained on the FAZ for the rest of his career in Germany, which lasted till 1935. In addition to theatrical critiques he became known for his essays, travel reports and light-hearted opinion pieces (\\"scherzhafte Feuilletons\\"). Diebold's book \\"Anarchy in Drama\\" appeared in 1921. It became a standard work, reaching its fourth edition in 1928. It has been described as his most significant work, still relevant as a dramaturgy of expressionism, not simply a random set of theatre reviews, but a fundamental unmasking and critique of the spirit of the age (...\\"die nochheute g√ºltige Dramaturgie des Expressionismus, nicht etwa eine Sammlung von Theaterreferaten, sondern eine grundlegende Kl√§rung und Kritik des Zeitgeistes.\\"). It was also in 1928 that he relocated to Berlin, where alongside Alfred Kerr and Herbert Ihering he established himself as one of the most respected critics of the Weimar years, not merely in respect of theatre, but also covering the newly emerging world of cinema. Further books followed, such as \\"The Wagner question revisited\\" (\\"Der Fall Wagner. Eine Revision\\" 1928), based on a planned report on the Bayreuth Festival and \\"The Book of Good Works 1914-1918\\" (\\"Das Buch der guten Werke 1914-1918\\" 1932) which turned out to be the last book he published during his time in Germany. Following the successful Nazi power-grab at the start of 1933 he wrote in support of the restrictive cultural policies implemented by Joseph Goebbels on behalf of the new regime.Karl Kraus: Die dritte Walpurgisnacht. M√ºnchen: K√∂sel, 1952, pp. 31-84. , Online-Version He stayed in Berlin initially. However, at the start of 1934 he was served with a work ban because of his Jewish religion, and in 1935 he was excluded from the National Writers' Club (\\"Reichsschrifttumskammer\\"). He returned to Z√ºrich. In 1936 he was still contributing to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as a correspondent, but in that year he was served with a writing ban. Journalistic contributions continued, now appearing in Swiss papers such as the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, Die Tat and Basler Nationalzeitung, but the volume of his journalism diminished as he set about professional diversification. With Julius Marx, between 1935 and 1939 he built up a film distribution business, \\"THEMA\\", but the business was unable to attract funding and collapsed. He also applied himself as a prose writer, publishing in 1938 an 840 page novel, \\"Das Reich ohne Mitte\\", which dealt with the failure of the political centre in Germany. His efforts as a prose writer beyond the journalistic milieu brought him no success, however. Meanwhile, he continued to contribute to Swiss newspapers, notably Die Tat, for the rest of his life. On 9 August 1945 Bernhard Diebold died in Z√ºrich after a short illness.

Grindstone Entertainment Group acquired the US rights to the film, and it was distributed by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. Eastwood stars as an American drifter hired in Mexico to fight drug cartels. Plot Mitch Davis, unhappy with his life and seeing no prospects for work, leaves with a friend for a trip to Mexico. After getting a prostitute a bar, Mitch's friend leaves without paying. When Mitch refuses to pay his friend's debt to the pimp, he is beaten and robbed. Another American, Jesse, buys him a meal. As they talk, Jesse offers him a job working for a man known as the Captain, an American veteran who runs a paramilitary vigilante group that targets the Mexican cartels. Mitch answers noncommittally and listens to the Captain's recruitment speech. The Captain, recognizing his ordinary speech that emphasizes glory and power will not appeal to Mitch, flatly offers him $5000. Mitch at first declines but reconsiders after the Captain points out that anyone who comes to Mexico on a lark must be leaving behind an even worse situation than what he offers. At the Captain's compound, Mitch meets Camarillo, the Captain's second in command; Alyssa, the Captain's girlfriend; Paul, a surly skinhead; Benito, a young Mexican thief; and several other young recruits, including the Captain's teenage son, Jack. The Captain's first job has them build a ditch. When Benito is bitten by a scorpion, Mitch protests when Camarillo forces him back to work. Camarillo orders Paul to beat Mitch. When Mitch turns out to be a competent fighter, Camarillo knocks him out with a Taser. Mitch wakes in a thick wooden box, where he is given limited rations. After being stuck there for a day, Mitch escapes by knocking loose a hinged slot and using it to dig a tunnel. Impressed with his ingenuity, the Captain allows him to rejoin the others as they eat. Mitch also impresses Alyssa, who flirts with him when the Captain is not around. The two later have sex. Speaking privately with Mitch, the Captain says Mitch has become his favorite recruit, as Mitch reminds the Captain of himself. The Captain explains his philosophy: lawlessness allows common men to become great, though they must then combat the lawlessness to retain their power. The Captain point blank asks Mitch if he is having sex with Alyssa, which Mitch denies, satisfying the Captain. Their first mission is to rob a drug runner named Brad. After kidnapping him, they find no drugs on Brad. When Brad goes for Paul's gun, Paul accidentally shoots Brad in the struggle. Mitch insists they take Brad with them, but Camarillo orders them to leave him for dead. Before they leave, Benito steals Brad's expensive shirt. When they get back to the compound, Benito, being illiterate, has Mitch read a letter he found in the shirt. In it, Brad's parents tell him they love him and support any decision he makes about staying in Mexico. With the money stolen from Brad's credit cards, they purchase more guns. Dressed as FBI agents, they stop a cartel car and attempt to restrain them. When the cartel men become suspicious, a gunfight ensues, causing Jesse's death. The next hit turns out to be federal police officers. Mitch tries to abort the mission, but the others continue. Paul is killed in the resulting fight, but Mitch recovers a suitcase full of cash from the federales' car. Shortly after they return to the compound, the police raid it. Mitch, the Captain, and Camarillo escape in Mitch's car together. When Camarillo later reads them a Mexican newspaper, the Captain learns Jack died during the fight, and he deduces Benito was a police informer. They pick up Benito, drive to a secluded area, and the Captain drags Benito out of the car. Mitch at first does nothing, but then strangles Camarillo when he decides that he has to do something to prevent what is about to happen. After helplessly watching the Captain kill Benito, Mitch flees with the money. The two men wound each other, and after a long chase, the Captain finally catches up to Mitch, who has crossed most of the desert on foot trying to get back to the States. Further elucidating on his philosophy, the Captain says war is like love and allows men to express themselves. As he prepares to kill Mitch, Mitch surprises him with a small, single-shot pistol favored by Benito. After killing the Captain, Mitch returns to the city, buys new clothes to replace his bloody and torn rags, and visits Brad's parents. He secretly leaves them the money stolen from the federales.

Maxine Baca Zinn and Bonnie Thornton Dill wrote ‚ÄúTheorizing Difference from Multiracial Feminism‚Äù in 1996, a piece emphasising intersectionality and the application of intersectional analysis in feminist discourse.Dill, Bonnie Thornton, and Maxine Baca Zinn. ‚ÄúTheorizing Difference from Multiracial Feminism.‚ÄùFeminist Studies, vol. 22, no. 2, 1996, pp. 321, Women of color have challenged the use of the second-wave movement as it places women's oppression at the root of sexism, without any regards to other forms of domination. Generally speaking, women of color acknowledge that race acted as a foundation power structure that heavily effected their lives. The activist work of WOC has been erased from the second wave movement. The term, \\"multiracial\\" was used to illustrate the importance of race interacting with other forms of oppression to understand gender relations. With a focus on race, multiracial feminism acknowledges, \\"the social construction of differently situated social groups and their varying degrees of advantages and power\\". One definition of multiracial feminism is, \\"an attempt to go beyond a mere recognition of diversity and difference among women to examine structures of domination, specifically the importance of race in understanding the social construction of gender.\\" The central point of this perspective is to focus in on the significance of race, institutionalized racism, and struggles against racial oppression to understand how various forms of domination influence women's experiences.  Overview  Multiracial feminist theory influenced the recreation of Second Wave feminism. Second Wave feminism was ideally racist, classist and only focused on white middle-class women in the United States with a goal to be equal to men. Second wave feminism ignored the struggles of women of color, as it didn't value intersectionality. There are multiple groups of feminist organizations that focus on their differing identities, for example Hijas de Cuauhtemoc which is a Chicana-based group, another group is the Asian Sisters and they focused on the drug abuse that was happening in Los Angeles, California around the 1970s.  History  Having first gained steam in the 1970s, multiracial feminism grew as a movement to challenge racist, classist, and sexist barriers not as separate, singular matters but as interlocking identities that make up both privilege and oppression.McCann, Carole R., and Seung-kyung Kim. Feminist Theory Reader: Local and Global Perspectives. 4th ed., Routledge, 2016. Multiracial feminism is described as a ‚Äúliberation movement spearheaded by women of color‚Äù and focused primarily on intersectional analysis and both an international and a multiracial approach to oppression.Doetsch-Kidder, Sharon. ‚ÄúLoving Criticism: A Spiritual Philosophy of Social Change.‚Äù Feminist Studies, vol. 38, no. 2, 2012, pp. 444-473, Although not acknowledged by the second wave movement, women of color and white women took a stand to combat racism and colonialism. Black feminists believed that, \\"cross-racial struggle made clear the work that white women needed to do in order for cross-racial sisterhood to really be powerful.\\" White women also recognized that sexism was not the root of women's oppression. They collaborated to put forth an anti-racist movement that incorporated interlocking forms of oppression.  Notable proponents  * Maxine Baca Zinn ‚Äì born in Santa Fe, New Mexico on June 11, 1942, Maxine Baca Zinn is a sociologist known as being one of the ‚Äúforemothers of multiracial feminism.‚Äù\\"Baca Zinn, Maxine: 1942 ‚Äì: Sociologist.‚Äù Encyclopedia.com, http://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/baca- zinn-maxine-1942-sociologist. Accessed on 8 October 2016. Working alongside other feminist theorists like Bonnie Thornton Dill, Patricia Hill Collins and Lynn Weber, Baca Zinn's hypotheses suggest a need for intersectional analysis regarding identities such as race and gender in contemporary feminism. * Bonnie Thornton Dill- is a dean of College of Arts and a professor at the University of Maryland. She has won numerous awards for mentoring. * Becky Thompson- is a human rights activist as well as an activist in feminism surrounding multiple issues or anitracism and gender and class issues. She has a Phd and has written around 100 or more articles. * Patricia Hill Collins- born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1948, she is greatly known for her article \\"Learning from the Outsider within which was published in 1986. She is a professor at the University of Maryland, she is working with students and graduate students in race studies but as well as feminist studies. *  Application  It is widely agreed by many if not most multiracial feminists that multiracial feminist theory is needed in order to broaden feminist discourse and bring much-needed intersectionality to contemporary feminist movements. In spite of this, however, multiracial feminism struggles to gain momentum as an intersectional approach to combating oppression and is fairly new concept in the world of quantitative research. New though it may be, Catherine Harnios in her book, Feminist Measure in Survey Research, writes that multiracial feminism may be more beneficial to feminist discourse than once thought.Harnios, Catherine E. Feminist Measures in Survey Research. SAGE, 2013. Family study, formation and power relations have been extensively examined using a multiracial feminist approach, the results of which reveal a hidden power dynamic between ‚Äúadvantaged families and disadvantaged families.‚ÄùTownsend-Bell, Erica E. ‚ÄúWriting the Way to Feminism.‚Äù Signs, vol. 38, no. 1, 2012, pp.127-152, Advantaged families have been shown to rely upon the labor and disadvantage of poorer families, women, women of color, minorities and immigrants. Women of color provide an \\"outsider within\\" perspective as they are active participants in domination while also continue to be oppressed by it. In understanding multiracial feminism, it is important to note how interlocking forms of oppression persist to marginalize groups of people. Although people continue to be oppressed, others are privileged at the sacrifice of those who don't obtain benefits of the system. Patricia Hill Collins defines the term, Matrix of Domination, to refer to how various forms of oppression work different depending on what social location one obtains. In reference to this term, people will have varying experiences with gender, class, race, & sexuality, depending on what social position one has in relation to structural powers. In terms of interlocking oppressions, this results in different social groups experiencing varying subordination and privilege.  Activism  Though women of color are rarely credited as being prevalent in the 2nd Wave feminist movement, it has become evident that multiracial feminism was very much present in the 1980s through the 1990s and even today. In the 1970s, women of color worked alongside hegemonic, white feminist groups but found it to be mostly centered on the white, middle-class feminist issues of the time. With the help of white, anti-racist women, women of color gave rise to multiracial feminist theory and led to the development of organizations created by and for women of color.Thompson, Becky. ‚ÄúMultiracial Feminism: Recasting the Chronology of Second Wave Feminism.‚Äù Feminist Studies, vol. 28, no. 2, 2002, pp. 337 Multiracial feminists of the 1980s challenged white feminism by speaking out of the individual experiences of women of color, immigrants, and ‚Äúthird-world women‚Äù who had been largely swept under the rug.Zinn, Maxine Baca. ‚ÄúFeminism and Family Studies for a New Century.‚Äù The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 571, 2000, pp. 42-56, This was mostly done through multiracial feminist writings which have been revealed to date as far back as the 1960s. = Online activism = There has been a notable increase of multiracial feminists, journalists and bloggers using online media to write about and theorize on intersectionality and multiracial experience as it relates to class, gender and race cooperatively in contemporary society. Journalist for msmagazine.com, Janell Hobson, wrote a critique of white feminist activism pointing out the fact that women of color are still being left out of the conversation in current feminist discourse. She claims that it is time feminists ‚Äúreclaim solidarity‚Äù by recognizing race and gender as being intertwined, rather than separate matters to be deal with individually.Hobson, Janell. ‚ÄúBlack Women, White Women and the Solidarity Question.‚Äù MS. Magazine Blog, 27 Nov. 2013, Accessed on 8 October 2016. Similarly, Lara Witt who writes for Rewire.news, calls upon both her privilege and oppression to understand her role as a multiracial feminist with the ability to speak out against racism towards Black, Hispanic, and Indian people.Witt, Lara. ‚ÄúAs a Multiracial Woman, This is Why I Need Intersectional Feminism.‚Äù Rewire, 2 Sept. 2016, Accessed on 8 October 2016.  Organizations  In April 1996, there was a rally in Middletown, Connecticut led by a multiracial coalition.Blee, Kathleen M., and France W. Twine. Feminism and Antiracism: International Struggles for Justice. New York University Press, 2001. Taking place at Wesleyan University, the rally was organized in defense of journalist and author Mumia Abu-Jamal who had been placed on death row in Pennsylvania. The Combahee River Collective- a black feminist group that started in 1974 and are a group that influenced multiracial feminism to be included in Second Wave feminism. They wrote A Black Feminist Statement to voice the changes and their politics that they are wanting. Women of All Red Nations (WARN)- this is a feminist group created by Native American women and was formed in 1974 to fight the promotion of sterilization and the act of sterilization in Native communities.  Criticism  Some criticisms have been raised challenging whether or not multiracial feminist theory can actually produce measurable results due to a lack of ‚Äúexisting survey tools‚Äù by which to quantify or examine those experiences.Ifatunji, Mosi, and Harnios, Catherine E. ‚ÄúGendered Measures, Gendered Models: Toward an Intersectional Analysis of Interpersonal Racial Discrimination.‚Äù Ethnic & Racial Studies, vol.34, no. 6, 2011, pp.1006-1028 It is unclear as to whether or not these criticisms will be the undoing of multiracial feminist theory or if such drawbacks can be overcome with more time and research.

It is a Latin-rite parish of the Archdiocese of Moscow. History At the turn of the twentieth century, there were already a thousand Catholics in Tula and its surroundings, and the former chapel there became insufficient. The community received permission to build a church on May 28, 1893. The new brick church, built in the neo-Gothic style by the architect Skawronski, was consecrated in 1896. After the revolution of 1917 and the end of World War I in the West, many Poles migrated to the new Poland, and the parish was weakened. The church property was nationalized in 1918 and closed in 1932. A newspaper occupied the building. The Catholic parish was restored in 1993 and temporarily settled in 1995 in an old garage. In 2015 it received permission to recover the church, which required restoration. It re- opened on December 23, 2007 and Archbishop Paolo Pezzi blessed it on July 6, 2008.

It was heavily influenced by the implicit-association test, and is one of several tasks referred to as indirect measures of implicit attitudes. The IRAP is one of relatively few indirect measures that can includes relational or propositional rather than associative information. The IRAP was conceptualised by Dermot Barnes-Holmes, and originally published in 2006. A meta analysis of clinically-relevant criterion effects suggest that the IRAP has good validity. However, a second meta analysis suggests that it has poor reliability, like many reaction time based measures. Research using the IRAP is often linked to relational frame theory, a functional-analytic theory of language.  Application and use  = Procedure = A computer- based measure, the IRAP requires individuals to accurately and quickly respond to the relation between two stimuli presented on screen (e.g., to \\"dog\\" and \\"woof\\") using one of two response options (e.g., \\"similar\\" and \\"different\\"). Across pairs of blocks, individuals must respond using two contrasting response patterns, for example \\"dog-woof-similar\\" versus \\"dog-woof-different\\". Reaction times are then compared between these blocks. Any difference in response time between the two block types is defined as an IRAP effect. According to the creators, ‚Äúthe basic hypothesis is that average response latencies should be shorter across blocks of consistent relative to inconsistent trials. In other words, participants should respond more rapidly to relational tasks that reflect their current beliefs than to tasks that do not‚Äù. = Implementations = The IRAP was first implemented in Visual Basic 6, and distributed for free for academic use but under a closed source by Dermot Barnes-Holmes.

Biography =Youth and studies= Henry Parks Wright was born in Winchester, New Hampshire. His father died when he was a few weeks old, and his mother when he was 3. He was then raised in Oakham, Massachusetts by his grandmother, Mrs Hannah Wooley, and became a schoolteacher at 17. Although he had earned enough to attend Phillips Academy in Andover, he decided to stop studying and to join the Union army in 1862.H. B. Wright and E. D. Harvey, The settlement and story of Oakham, Massachusetts, published 1947 in New Haven (?), 1205 pages, p. 1204Article by Judith Ann Schiff, Henry Parks Wright, Yale‚Äôs First College Dean, in Yale Alumni Magazine, November 2011 He was nearly 25 when he entered Yale in 1864, graduated as valedictorian of the Class of 1868. After teaching for one year in the Chickering Institute in Cincinnati, he was appointed Tutor in Yale College, starting a 40-year career in the Yale faculty. He became an assistant professor of Latin in Yale in 1871, pursued graduate study and received a doctorate in 1876. =Family= On 7 July 1874, he married Martha Elizabeth Burt. Their four children were: *Alice Lincoln, born in 1875,who received a PhD from Yale in 1901 and became a teacher of English in the Sate Normal School in New Haven; *Henry Burt, born in 1877, who became a famous theology professor at Yale University; *Alfred Parks, born in 1880, who died in 1901 while in senior class in Yale; *Ellsworth, born in 1884. =Career as dean of Yale College= In 1884, he was appointed Dean of Yale College and served in that capacity for the next 25 years. Until 1884, Yale had functioned without a dean, but with enrollment approaching 1,100, President Noah Porter asked Wright to help him by taking over the records of the junior and senior classes. For the first two years Wright kept all of the records without help, while teaching a full schedule as Dunham Professor of Latin Language and Literature. Undergraduate life changed dramatically during Wright‚Äôs deanship. From 1884 to 1894, the college enrollment had doubled to 1,150, forcing the freshmen to room off campus. This had led to the opening of privately owned residence halls around the campus, some of which were very luxurious. Over time, the students became widely separated by income and social standing. Wright felt that if the spirit of true democracy at Yale were to be perpetuated, it was essential that freshmen should be better integrated to the College and the University. The alumni committee of ‚ÄúWright‚Äôs boys‚Äù responded by raising funds for a dormitory that for the first time would be a cooperative gift, rather than one person or family. There were many rich and poor contributors. A part of the funds raised was earmarked to provide a life pension for Wright. An elegant Gothic hall designed by architect William Adams Delano, Class of 1895, was built in the place of Alumni Hall in 1911-1912. Accommodating 150, it was the largest dormitory on the Old Campus. The hall was also a memorial to others; two entries, five classrooms and twenty-five rooms were donated and named after deceased alumni. One suite was named for Wright‚Äôs son Alfred Parks Wright, Class of 1901, who died in May of his senior year. This building completed the new quadrangle begun with Farnam Hall in 1869. On November 23, 1912, a few hours before the Yale-Harvard game, a group of alumni gathered to dedicate Wright Memorial Hall on the Old Campus in honor of Henry Parks Wright, in a significant break from tradition since the new residence and lecture hall (which was renamed Lanman-Wright Hall in 1993) became the first building at Yale to be named in honor of a living person. But 25 classes had cherished Wright‚Äôs counsel and friendship, and upon his retirement in 1909, they came together to fund an edifice that would fulfill Wright‚Äôs dream of unifying undergraduate life. =End of life= He retired in 1909 and died in New Haven, Connecticut on 17 March 1918. Recognition and distinctions Henry P. Wright was a trustee of the Connecticut College for Women at New London and of the Hopkins Grammar School at New Haven. He was a member of the Committee on the Civil War Memorial erected at Yale. At Wright‚Äôs retirement, a Yale professor said that Henry P. Wright had introduced ‚Äúa new era‚Äù in student-faculty relations. ‚Äú To arbitrate between a large body of impulsive young men and a College Faculty, is no light matter. We all know how volcanic is the one, and how full of horned cattle is the other.‚Äù During the construction of Wright Hall in 1911, a poignant testimonial by a former student was published in The Heir of Slaves, by William Pickens, Class of 1904: ‚ÄúDean Henry P. Wright of Yale, after reading the recommendations of my former teachers, had written that I could enter the junior class. This great scholar and good man has been a constant friend since that first acquaintance.‚Äù References External links * Category:1839 births Category:Yale University alumni Category:1918 deaths Category:People from Winchester, New Hampshire Category:People from Worcester County, Massachusetts Category:American university and college faculty deans ","title":"Henry Parks Wright"},{"id":"51940204","text":"Whitney Allison (n√©e Schultz; born March 1, 1988) is an American professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Team .

The 271st episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 12, 2016. The episode lampooned modern social protest movements and campaigns (like Free the Nipple and Black Lives Matter) and commented on Internet anonymity, while also progressing the plot and themes of the season's previous episodes. Plot A Danish narrator explains the Danish history of dealing with trolls and that now they are on a quest to take out the newest variety, the Internet troll. Gerald Broflovski feels the pressure of being found out for his trolling as Skankhunt42, and he tries as much as he can to cover it up. Meanwhile, Kyle feels guilt over the rift between the boys and the girls. When he tries to bring them together, it only strains their relationships further, and Butters takes on a leadership role after the elementary school girls convince his long-distance girlfriend Charlotte to dump him online. He takes down his pants, exposing his penis, in protest of feeling neutered, at a girls' volleyball game. Most of the boys immediately follow suit, disgusting the girls even more. Gerald struggles with his trolling withdrawal, eventually meeting with a fellow troll known as Dildo Schwaggins under a bridge, who warns Gerald of an upcoming attack from the Danes. Gerald eventually succumbs to the pressure and Sheila catches him in the bathroom while trolling on an iPad that Sheila bought for him. Still reluctant to reveal his inner troll self, Gerald lies to Sheila, saying that he was watching \\"piss porn\\", and he agrees to be urinated on to cover up his secret. He even attends an addiction meeting, but it turns out to be for member berry addicts instead. When talking with Cartman and Heidi Turner, who are now boyfriend and girlfriend, Kyle realizes that he will not be able to stop Butters, who is now leading protest marches without pants, from worsening the rift on his own, so he attempts to get Cartman on his side. Cartman refuses since he feels that he is happier with Heidi, away from the divisiveness of groups and social media. Schwaggins shows Gerald a video by the BBC News that explains a Danish website known as Troll Trace designed to track down the real-life identity of Internet trolls is coming online. The founder of the site threatens to expose trolls everywhere, although he is aware that his methods will have the greater effect of stripping anonymity from anyone posting on the Internet. Schwaggins and Gerald retreat to a group of other trolls. Kyle meets up with the boys and girls at the school cafeteria, where he announces that he now agrees to Butters' protest. As he pulls out his penis in front of them, most of the girls leave in disgust, and the boys cheer and carry him out on their shoulders. Reception Jesse Schedeen from IGN rated the episode an 8.4 out of 10, and commented that he loved the \\"more focused episode this week as the series continues to lampoon social media.\\" Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania gave it a 7.5 out of 10, summarizing his review with the comment \\"There's no denying the brilliance of South Park when they are focused on a story.\\" Dan Caffrey from The A.V. Club rated the episode an A- and found the scene with Sheila urinating on Gerald while Ike and Kyle watch from the doorway \\"the kind of nasty sight gag that's become a staple of the South Park universe.\\" Chris Longo with Den of Geek rated it 3.5 out of 5 stars, still continuing his theory that this season \\"is still Eric Cartman's South Park, one we've been building up to for decades.\\" References External links *Press release from South Park Studios * * Category:Television episodes set in Denmark Category:Internet trolling Category:South Park (season 20) episodes Category:Television episodes about cyberbullying ","title":"Wieners Out"},{"id":"51940334","text":"Erica Zaveta (born September 6, 1989) is an American professional racing cyclist who rides for Cylance Pro Cycling.

He believes students and universities can set themselves apart in a fast-changing world and ever-shifting economy through teaching and research that address societal problems from an array of different fields and areas of knowledge. In his first year at Tulane, Michael Fitts launched task forces to lead the university in deepening its unique strengths for interdisciplinary collaboration. He has capitalized on Tulane University's manageable size, its wide selection of professional schools, the unified undergraduate college and multiple cross-disciplinary efforts already in place. He aims to create the most engaged undergraduate experience in the country through this rethinking of academic options, residential living, extracurricular activities and more. In graduate education and research, his goal is to foster intellectual cross-pollination that can produce solutions to some of the world's most fundamental problems. President Fitts received his highest approval rating in May 2018 at 97.3%. Fitts' audacious campaign has been considered to be the most successful philanthropic endeavors in the state of Louisiana. Fitts has initiated a campus master planning process with a 21st century vision of spaces redesigned to promote connections. That includes drawing people together from different parts of campus and linking different functions of the university, such as residence halls with dining hubs and academic venues. Another avenue for making connections is public service, an area where Tulane University is a leader in higher education. Fitts lauds the pursuit of community service for its power to show students how theory connects with practice and gives them real-world experience in the concepts they study in class. His vision for the university includes enhancing the ties between public service and academics.

She and her sister Elmina were the first American women to practice civil engineering after obtaining a four-year degree. She worked as a freelance architect in Illinois, Iowa and Missouri before moving to New York and working there for over a decade. She was the first woman supervisor of the women's drafting department of the Iowa Highway Commission. In her later career, she curtailed her architectural works, becoming the secretary, housemate and traveling companion of Carrie Chapman Catt. Early life Alda Heaton Wilson was born on 20 September 1873 in Harper, Keokuk County, Iowa to Olive (n√©e Eaton) and John C. Wilson. She was the youngest daughter in a family of five other siblings, Warren, Fanny, Olive, Anna, and Elmina. In 1894, Alda graduated with a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Iowa State University (ISU), simultaneously with Elmina's graduation with a master's degree in the same field. Both sisters were members of Pi Beta Phi women's fraternity and staunch supporters of both women's education and suffrage. Career Between 1895 and 1897, Alda worked for several architectural firms in Chicago. She then pursued graduate studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology between 1897 and 1898, returning thereafter to work in Chicago, with various design firms and later in Kansas City and Ames, Iowa until 1903. One of the firms Alda worked at was Patton & Miller, known for building Carnegie libraries throughout the U.S. That year, she and her sister Elmina took a sabbatical to study engineering and architectural designs in Europe. Upon their return to the states in 1904, Alma worked as a freelance architect for several prominent firms in New York City. Then in 1908, the sisters returned to Europe, spending six months studying architecture in Spain and France. In 1913, they planned another trip, to study for eight months in Germany, Italy and Sicily. In 1915, the sisters jointly worked on architectural and engineering drawings for the Teachers Cottage, also known as Helmich House, in Gatlinburg, Tennessee at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts. They were also involved with the Manhattan Woman's Suffrage Club, for which Elmina served as president, coming in contact with national leaders like Susan B. Anthony, Carrie Chapman Catt and Eleanor Roosevelt. Due to their Iowa ties and suffrage involvement, the Wilson sisters became personal friends with Catt. In 1918, Elmira died and Alda returned to Iowa, where she began working as head of the women's drafting department of the Iowa Highway Commission in 1919. The department was created because the Highway Department had trouble finding qualified men after World War I, and devised a unit of women drafters to fill the void. During this time, she also continued with freelancing designs. Alda left the Commission in 1921 and increasingly spent more time traveling with Catt, curtailing her own architectural work. In 1928, after Catt's companion, Mary \\"Molly\\" Garrett Hay died, Wilson moved in with Catt to help her, and eventually became a permanent housemate as well as Catt's secretary. After Catt's death, Wilson, who served as Catt's executor donated six albums that as Catt's secretary she had compiled of photographs and materials on international suffrage to Bryn Mawr College and another set of her archives to the Library of Congress. Wilson died 25 July 1960 in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois. Projects In 1909, Alda and Elmina worked together on the design of a residence for W.J. Freed and his daughter Kittie. The house was a six-room cottage located on Story Street in Ames, Iowa. W. J. was a pioneer farmer in Story County and Kittie was the librarian at the Ames Public Library and a fellow ISU alumnus. Helmich House, Arrowmont School Helmich House was designed in 1915 and was the first known architect-designed dwelling in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. It was part of the campus of Arrowmont School, a project promoted by Phi Beta Phi as a settlement house-type program based on the model of the agricultural schools in vogue in the Progressive Era. The 10-room residence was a -story frame bungalow on a concrete foundation. Built in 1916, the residence, which was constructed to provide living quarters for the teachers being recruited to work in the school, had modern amenities including the first furnace in Gatlinburg and running water. The exterior was clad with weatherboard siding featuring shed dormers on the north and rear fa√ßades, covered by a side-gabled, asphalt-shingled roof. In 2007, the teacher's residence was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Settlement School Community Outreach Historic District of Sevier County, Tennessee.

Both adults and larvae feed on red clover and other plants in the family Fabaceae. Description The lesser clover leaf weevil grows to a length of about . The rostrum or beak is three times as long as it is broad, and is notched at its base. The eyes are large, transverse and non-protuberant. The frons is narrower than the rostrum while the pronotum is broad. The proximal ends of the elytra have parallel sides and bear prominent humeral humps. The general colour of the insect is black, with a reddish tinge to the legs and antennae. The pronotum has a greenish-gold sheen and the elytra have a greenish metallic appearance, both being the result of the presence of dissected scales. Hosts The lesser clover leaf weevil is an oligophage, limited to certain plants in the legume family. Its main hosts are red clover (Trifolium pratense), white clover (T. repens) and alsike clover (T. hybridum), but it can also feed on pea, alfalfa and vetch. Adults chew holes in leaves and create hollows in stems, while the larvae target the buds and flowers, each larva damaging some three or four inflorescences. Life cycle In northeastern Saskatchewan, adults overwinter in fields of red clover. The insects become active in late April and eggs are laid between early May and mid-July inside the clover shoots, leaves and stipules. The developing larvae pass through four instars and feed on the stipules, buds and inflorescences of the clover. Pupation occurs between late June and August, on the plants or on the ground beneath. When the new generation of adults begin to emerge in late July, the density of the weevil population increases sharply. In Canada, this species is often parasitised by other insects and by an entomopathogenic fungus, which help to keep numbers under control.

The estate has an area of 960 hectares. It is known for its award-winning goat and sheep milk cheeses. Knuthenlund also produces a range of other food products which are sold through Irma stores as well as to Michelin-starred restaurants in Denmark and abroad. History Knuthenlund was established in 1729 by Count Adam Christopher Knuth who had already inherited Knuthenborg from his father in 1714. The new estate was created by merging the land that had previously belonged to the five tenant farms in the village of Brekorpes as well as Ugleholt Forest and various other properties in the area. In 1738, Knuthenlund was merged into Knuthenborg. It happened at the initiative of Knuth's widow, Ida Margrethe Reventlow, who had obtained royal permission to rearrange the Knuth family's holdings on behalf of their sons. As a farm under Knuthenborgt, Knuthenlund was then managed by a tenant, usually for a ten-year period at a time. From the 1870s, Knuthenlund focused on dairy products as a result of growing demand from the English and American markets. The buildings were replaced from 1877 to 1886. In 1913, Knuthenlund and nearby B√∏llesminde were sold to dairy owner Jens Peter Herman Hansen, who later that same year sold off B√∏llesminde. Today The current owner, Susanne Hovmand-Simonsen, fourth generation at Knuthenlund, took over Knuthenlund after her father in 2006 and also owns the adjacent estate √òrbyg√•rd. She has turned the estate into one of Denmark's largest organic farm. The estate has an area of 960 hectares. Food products Knuthenlund is especially known for its goat and sheep milk cheeses. Its dairy opened in 2009 and has received multiple awards at the World Cheese Awards, Nordic Cheese Competition and Premio Roma. It received an honorary diploma from the Danish Gastronomic Academy in 2009 and became a member of the Guilde de Fromager in 2011. The dairy also produces milk and yogurt. Knuthenlund also keeps traditional Danish breeds such as Danish Red cattle and Black and White Danish Landrace pigs. The estate produces organic meat from free-ranging animals (beef, lamb and pork), saussures and charcuterie. A new flour mill opened on the estate in 2016. It produces flour from spelt and √ñland wheat. A range of food products are as of 2016 sold through Irma stores. Customers also include Michelin-starred restaurants in Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands.

For most of the twentieth century, historians of colonial Spanish America read and were familiar with a large canon of work. With the expansion of the field in the late twentieth century, there has been the establishment of new subfields, the founding of new journals, and the proliferation of monographs, anthologies, and articles for increasingly specialized practitioners and readerships.

Early historiography From the early sixteenth century onward, Spaniards wrote accounts of Spain's overseas explorations, conquests, religious evangelization, the overseas empire. The authors range from conquerors, crown officials, and religious personnel.J.

Cover of Bartolom√© de las Casas, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (1552), which provided grist for the Black Legend Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, early Spanish historian of Spain's overseas empire European rivals of Spain wrote a number of polemics, characterizing the Spanish as cruel, bigoted, and exploitative. The so-called Black Legend drew on Bartolom√© de Las Casas's contemporary critique, A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies (1552) and became an entrenched view of the Spanish colonial era.William S.

Scottish scholar William Robertson (1721‚Äì1793), who established his scholarly reputation by writing a biography of Spain's Charles V, wrote the first major history in English of Spanish America, The History of America (1777). The work paraphrases much of Spanish historian Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas's D√©cadas, it also contained new sources. It reached a wide readership when Britain was rising as a global empire. Robertson drew on Las Casas's A Short Account, of Spanish cruelty, he noted Las Casas likely exaggerated.Brading, The First America, pp. 432‚Äì441. Spanish historians debated whether to translate Robertson's history to Spanish, which proponents supported because of Robertson's generally even- handed approach to Spanish history, but the project ultimately shelved when powerful politician Jos√© de G√°lvez disapproved.Jorge Ca√±izares-Esguerra, How to Write the History of the New World pp. 171‚Äì182.

Portrait of Alexander von Humboldt painted shortly after his return from Spanish America by Friedrich Georg Weitsch, 1806 A major figure in Spanish American history and historiography is Prussian scientist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt.D.A. Brading, \\"Scientific Traveller\\", chapter 23 in The First America, pp. 514‚Äì534 His five-year scientific sojourn in Spanish America with the approval of the Spanish crown, contributed new knowledge about the wealth and diversity of the Spanish empire. Humboldt's self-funded expedition from 1799‚Äì1840 was the foundation of his subsequent publications that made him the dominant intellectual figure of the nineteenth century.

Lucas Alam√°n, conservative politician and the author of a 5 volume history of Mexico In the early post-independence era, history writing in the nations of Spanish America was accomplished by those from a particular country or region. Often these writings are part of the creation of a national identity from a particular political viewpoint. Politically conservative historians looked to the colonial era with nostalgia, while politically liberal historians considered the colonial era with disdain. An important example is Mexico's conservative politician and intellectual Lucas Alam√°n. His five-volume Historia de Mejico is the country's first history, covering the colonial era up to and including the struggle for independence. Alam√°n viewed crown rule during the colonial era as ideal, and political independence that after the brief monarchy of Agust√≠n de Iturbide, the Mexican republic was characterized by liberal demagoguery and factionalism.Lucas Alam√°n, Historia de Mejico. 5 vols. 1849‚Äì52 Writing in the mid-nineteenth century, Mexican liberal Vicente Riva Palacio, grandson of insurgent hero Vicente Guerrero, wrote a five-volume history of the colonial era from a liberal viewpoint,\\"Vicente Riva Palacio\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico.

During the era of Porfirio D√≠az (1876‚Äì1911), writing a new history of Mexico became a priority and Justo Sierra, minister of education, wrote an important work, The Political Evolution of the Mexican People (1900‚Äì02), whose first two major sections deal with \\"aboriginal civilizations and the conquest\\" and the colonial era and independence .Justo Sierra, The Political Evolution of the Mexican People. Austin: University of Texas Press 1969. In the United States, the work of William Hickling Prescott (1796‚Äì1859) on the conquests of Mexico and Peru became best sellers in the mid-nineteenth century, but were firmly based on printed texts and archival sources.Robin A. Humphreys, \\"William Hickling Prescott: The Man and the Historian\\". Hispanic American Historical Review 39:1-19 (Feb. 1959) Prescott's work on the conquest of Mexico was almost immediately translated to Spanish for a Mexican readership, even though it had an underlying anti-Catholic bias. For conservative Mexicans, Prescott's description of the Aztecs as \\"barbarians\\" and \\"savages\\" fit their notion of the indigenous and the need for the Spanish conquest.Brading, The First America, pp. 633‚Äì34. The United States victory in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì48), when it gained significant territory in western North America, incorporated territory previously held by Spain and then independent Mexico and in the United States the history of these now-called Spanish borderlands became a subject for historians.Howard F. Cline, \\"Imperial Perspectives on the Borderlands\\", in Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching, 1898‚Äì1965, vol. 1, pp. 224‚Äì227. Austin: University of Texas Press 1967.

Cline, \\"Hubert Howe Bancroft, 1832-1918\\" in Handbook of Middle American Indians vol. 13, pp. 326‚Äì347. His multivolume histories of various regions of northern Spanish America were foundational works in the field, although sometimes dismissed by later historians, \\"at their peril.\\"Howard F.

Austin: University of Texas Press 1967, p.7. He accumulated a vast research library, which he donated to University of California, Berkeley. The Bancroft Library was a key component to the emergence of the Berkeley campus as a center for the study Latin American history. A major practitioner of the field was Berkeley professor Herbert E. Bolton, who became director of the Bancroft Library. As President of the American Historical Association laid out his vision of an integrated history of the Americas in \\"The Epic of Greater America\\".H.E. Bolton, \\"The Epic of Greater America\\". The American Historical Review, 38:448‚Äì474 (April 1933). Starting around the turn of the twentieth century, university-level courses on Latin American history were created and the number of historians trained in the use of \\"scientific history,\\" using primary sources and even-handed approach to the writing of history increased. Early leaders in the field founded the Hispanic American Historical Review in 1918, and then as the number of practitioners drew, they founded the professional organization of Latin American historians, the Conference on Latin American History in 1926. The development of Latin American history was first examined in a two-volume collection of essays and primary sources, prepared for the Conference on Latin American History,Howard F. Cline, ed. Latin American History: Essays on Its Study and Teaching, 1898‚Äì1965. 2 vols.

Historiography of the conquest Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara's account of the conquest of Mexico (1555). Conqueror Bernal D√≠az del Castillo sought to set the record straight with his True History of the Conquest of Mexico Codex Azcatitlan showing Cort√©s, Malinche, and a black slave The history of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and of Peru has long fascinated scholars and the general public. With the quincentenary of the first Columbus voyage in 1492, there has been a renewed interest in the very early encounter between Europeans and New World indigenous peoples.Steve J. Stern, \\"Paradigms of Conquest: History, Historiography, and Politics,\\" Journal of Latin American Studies 24, Quincentenary Supplement (1992):1-34. Sources for the histories of the conquest of Mexico are particularly rich, and the historiographical debates about events and interpretations from multiple viewpoints inform the discussions.Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, \\"Narratives of Conquest\\" in The Early History of Greater Mexico. Prentice Hall 2003, pp. 97-114. Spanish conqueror Hern√°n Cort√©s wrote to Charles V during the events of the conquest, attempting to his explain his actions and demonstrate the importance of the conquest. Bernal D√≠az del Castillo wrote important accounts of the conquest, and other, less prominent Spanish conquerors petitioned the crown to garner rewards from the crown. In addition to these accounts by the European winners, are those by their indigenous allies, particularly the Tlaxcalans and Texcocans, but also the defeated rulers of Mexico-Tenochtitlan. A \\"vision of the vanquished\\" was recorded by sixteenth-century Franciscan, Bernardino de Sahag√∫n as the last volume of his General History of the Things of New Spain, often known as the Florentine Codex. Revisionist history of the conquest was being written as early as the sixteenth century. Accounts by Spanish participants and later authors have long been available, starting with the publication of Hern√°n Cort√©s's letters to the king, Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara's biography of Cort√©s commissioned by Cort√©s's son and heir Don Mart√≠n.

A scholarly debate in the twentieth century concerned the so- called Black Legend, which characterized the Spanish conquest and its colonial empire as being uniquely cruel and Spaniards as fanatical and bigoted. It engaged historians in Spain, Argentina, and in the English-speaking scholarly world. In the United States, Lewis Hanke's studies of Dominican Bartolom√© de Las Casas opened the debate, arguing that Spain struggled for justice in its treatment of the indigenous.Hanke, Lewis, The Spanish Struggle for Justice in the Conquest of America (1949) Benjamin Keen took the position that the assessment of Spanish mistreatment was largely true.Benjamin Keen, \\"The Black Legend Revisited: Assumptions and Realities\\", Hispanic American Historical Review 49, no. 4 (1969) 703-719 Charles Gibson edited a volume of writings on the Spanish Black Legend.Gibson, Charles, ed. The Black Legend: Anti-Spanish Attitudes in the Old World and the New (1971) Sverker Arnoldson (1960) and William B. Maltby (1971) showed that anti-Spanish attitudes in Europe antedated Las Casas's writings and had multiple origins.Arnoldson, Sverker, La Conquista espa√±ola seg√∫n el juicia de la posteridad: Vestigios de la leyenda negra 1960Maltby, William B. The Black Legend in England: The Development of Anti-Spanish Sentiment, 1558-1660. 1971. Generally the Spanish Black Legend is no longer a source of scholarly debate; however, anti-Spanish attitudes and stereotypes continue to affect modern debates about immigration in the United States and other issues, although the explicit label Black Legend is generally not invoked.Immigration and the curse of the Black Legend accessed 2 February 2018. Demography Nahua depiction of smallpox, in Book 12 of the Florentine Codex The catastrophic fall in the indigenous populations of Spanish America was evident from the first contacts in the Caribbean, something that alarmed Bartolom√© de las Casas. The impacts of the demographic collapse has continued to garner attention following the early studies by Sherburne F. Cook and Woodrow Borah, who examined censuses and other materials to make empirical assessments.Sherburne F. Cook and Woodrow Borah, Essays in Population History 3 vols. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1971-1979. The question of sources and numbers continues to be an issue in the field, with David P. Henige's Numbers from Nowhere, a useful contribution.David P. Henige, Numbers from Nowhere: the American Indian Contact Population Debate, Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1998. Noble David Cook's Born to DieNoble David Cook, Born to Die: Disease and New World Conquest, 1492-1650. New York: Cambridge University Press 1998. as well as Alfred Crosby's The Columbian Exchange are valuable and readable accounts of epidemic disease in the early colonial period. Regional studies of population decline have appeared for a number of areas including Mexico, Peru, Honduras, and Ecuador. The moral and religious implications of the collapse for Spanish Catholics is explored in an anthology with case studies from various parts of colonial Spanish America, The Secret Judgments of God.Noble David Cook and W. George Lovell, eds. The Secret Judgments of God: Old World Disease in Colonial Spanish America. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1992.

Institutional history Don Antonio de Mendoza, first viceroy of New Spain, who set many lasting policies during his term Jos√© de G√°lvez (1720‚Äì1787), Visitador gener√°l in New Spain and later member of the Council of the Indies, who implemented the Bourbon reforms The institutional history of Spain's and Portugal's overseas empires was an early focus of historiography. Laying out the structures of crown rule (civil and ecclesiastical) created the framework to understand how the two overseas empires functioned. An early study in English of Spanish America was Edward Gaylord Bourne's four-volume Spain in America (1904), a historian who \\"viewe[ed] the Spanish colonial process dispassionately and thereby escape[d] the conventional Anglo-Protestant attitudes of outraged or tolerant disparagement.\\"Charles Gibson and Benjamin Keen, \\"Trends of United States Studies in Latin American History,\\" The American Historical Review, LXII (July 1957), 857 In 1918 Harvard professor of history Clarence Haring published a monograph examining the legal structure of trade in the Habsburg era, followed by his major work on the Spanish empire (1947).Clarence Haring, Trade and Navigation between Spain and the Indies in the Time of the Habsburgs. Cambridge MA: Harvard Economic Studies 1918.Clarence Haring, The Spanish Empire in America New York: Oxford University Press 1947. A relatively early, specialized study of the Caracas Company (1728‚Äì1784) is in this vein of institutional history.Roland Dennis Hussey, The Caracas Company, 1728‚Äì1784: A Study in the History of Monopolistic Trade, Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1934. One of the few women publishing scholarly works in the early twentieth century was Lillian Estelle Fisher, whose studies of the viceregal administration and the intendant system were important contributions to institutional.Lillian Estelle Fisher, Viceregal Administration in the Spanish American Colonies. Berkeley: University of California Press 1926Lillian Estelle Fisher, The Intendant System in Spanish America, Berkeley: University of California Press 1919. Other important works dealing with institutions are Arthur Aiton's biography of the first viceroy, Don Antonio de Mendoza, who set many patterns for future administrators in Spanish America.Arthur S. Aiton, Antonio de Mendoza, First Viceroy of New Spain. Durham: Duke University Press 1927. and J.H. Parry on the high court of New Galicia and the sale of public office in the Spanish empire.J.H. Parry, The Audiencia of New Galicia in the Sixteenth Century. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1948.J.H. Parry, The Sale of Public Office in the Spanish Indies under the Habsburgs. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1953. Further research has been published more recently.Kenneth J. Andrien, \\"The Sale of Fiscal Offices and the Decline of Royal Authority in the Viceroyalty of Peru, 1633‚Äì1700,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 62, no. 1 (1982) 49-71. An important institutional study by Mark A. Burkholder and Douglas S. Chandler examines collectively the high courts.Mark A. Burkholder and Douglas S. Chandler, From Impotence to Authority: The Spanish Crown and the American Audiencieas, 1687‚Äì1808. Columbia MS: University of Missouri Press 1977. Scholars have examined how flexible the Spanish bureaucracy was in practice, with John Leddy Phelan publishing a study of the bureaucracy of seventeenth-century Quito, and an important general article.John Leddy Phelan, The Kingdom of Quito in the Seventeenth Century: Bureaucratic Politics in the Spanish Empire, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1967.John Leddy Phelan, \\"Authority and Flexibility in the Spanish Imperial Bureaucracy,\\" Administrative Science Quarterly 5:1 (1960): 47‚Äì65. A study of the bureaucracy of Mexico City from the late colonial era to the early Mexican republic is worth noting.Linda Arnold, Bureaucracy and Bureaucrats in Mexico City, 1742‚Äì1835. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 1988. Kenneth J. Andrien has examined the viceroyalty of Peru in the seventeenth century.Kenneth J. Andrien, Crisis and Decline: The Viceroyalty of Peru in the Seventeenth Century. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1985. Jonathan I. Israel's work on seventeenth-century Mexico is especially important, showing how creole elites shaped state power by mobilizing the urban plebe to resist actions counter to their interests.Jonathan I. Israel, Race, Class, and Politics in Colonial Mexico, 1610‚Äì1670. London 1975. The early Caribbean has been the focus of a few important works, but compared to the central areas, is much less studied. Worth noting are a study of sixteenth-century crown efforts at defensePaul E. Hoffman, The Spanish Crown and the Defense of the Caribbean, 1535‚Äì1585: Patrimonialism and Royal Parsimony. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press 1980. and works on colonial Florida.Amy Turner Bushnell, The King's Coffer: Proprietors of the Spanish Florida Treasury, 1565‚Äì1702. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1981.Amy Turner Bushnell, Situado and Sabana: Spain's Support System for the Presidio and Mission Provinces of Florida. Athens: University of Georgia Press 1981. The limits of royal power have also been examined.John H. Coatsworth, \\"The Limits of Colonial Absolutism: The State in Eighteenth-Century Mexico,\\" in Essays in the Political, Economic, and Social History of Colonial Spanish America, Karen Spalding, ed. Newark 1982. Woodrow Borah's Justice By Insurance (1983) shows how the Spanish crown's establishment of tax-funded legal assistance to Indians in Mexico provided the means for indigenous communities to litigate in the Spanish courts.Woodrow Borah, Justice by Insurance: The General Indian Court of Colonial Mexico and the Legal Aides of the Half-real. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1983 A useful general examination in the twenty-first century is Susan Elizabeth Ram√≠rez, \\"Institutions of the Spanish American Empire in the Habsburg Era\\".in A Companion to Latin American History, Thomas H. Holloway, ed. Malden MA: Wiley- Blackwell 2011, pp.106‚Äì123. A recent development in the history of institutions focuses on cultural aspects of state power.Alejandro Ca√±eque, The King's Living Image: The Culture and Politics of Viceregal Power in Colonial Mexico. New York: Routledge, 2004. Church-state relations and religion in Spanish America have also been a focus of research, but in the early twentieth century, it did not receive as much attention as the subject merits. What has been called the \\"spiritual conquest,\\" the early period of evangelization in Mexico, has received considerable treatment by scholars.Robert Ricard, The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico: An Essay in the Apostolate and the Evangelizing Methods of the Mendicant Orders in New Spain, 1523‚Äì1572, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1966. Originally published in French 1933. Another classic publication on the period is John Leddy Phelan's work on the early Franciscans in Mexico.John Leddy Phelan, The Millennial Kingdom of the Franciscans in the New World: A Study in the Writings of Ger√≥nimo de Mendieta. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1956. The economic foundations of the Catholic Church have been examined for the early colonial era.John Frederick Schwaller, Origins of Church Wealth in Mexico. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1985. The Holy Office of the Inquisition in Spanish America has been a subject of inquiry since Henry Charles Lea's works at the turn of the twentieth century.Henry Charles Lea, The Inquisition in the Spanish Dependencies. New York: MacMillan 1908. In the twentieth century, Richard E. Greenleaf examined the Inquisition as an institution in sixteenth-century Mexico.Richard E. Greenleaf, The Inquisition in Sixteenth-Century Mexico. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1963. Later work on the Inquisition has used it voluminous records for writing social history in Mexico and Peru. The Bourbon Reforms of the late eighteenth century have been more broadly studied, examining the changes in administrative arrangements with the Spanish crown that resulted in the intendancy system.Jacques A. Barbier, Reform and Politics in Bourbon Chile, 1755‚Äì1796. Ottawa 1980J.R. Fisher, Government and Society in Colonial Peru: The Intendant System, 1784‚Äì1814. London: Athlone 1970.John Fisher, \\"Imperial Rivalries and Reforms\\" in A Companion to Latin American History, Thomas H. Holloway, ed. Malden MA: Wiley-Blackwell 2011, pp. 178‚Äì194. An important shift in church-state relations during the Bourbon Reforms, was the crown's attempt to rein in the privileges of the clergy as it strengthened the prerogatives of the crown in a position known as regalism.N.M. Farriss, Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759‚Äì1821. London: Athlone 1968. Pamela Voekel has studied cultural aspects of the Bourbon reforms on religion and popular piety.Pamela Voekel, Alone Before God: The Religious Origins of Modernity in Mexico. Durham: Duke University Press 2002. Trade and commerce in the Bourbon era have been examined, particularly the institution of comercio libre, the loosening of trade strictures within the Spanish Empire.John R. Fisher, \\"Imperial ‚ÄòFree Trade‚Äô and the Hispanic Economy, 1778‚Äì1796,\\" Journal of Latin American Studies 13 (1981): 21‚Äì56.John R. Fisher, Commercial Relations between Spain and Spanish America in the Era of Free Trade, 1778‚Äì1796. Liverpool: University of Liverpool, Centre for Latin American Studies 1985. The administrative reorganization opened up new ways for administrators and merchants to exploit the indigenous in Mexico via forced sale of goods in exchange for red dye production, cochineal, which was an extremely valuable commodity.Brian R. Hamnett, Politics and Trade in Southern Mexico, 1750‚Äì1821.

Stanford: Stanford University Press 2000. In the late eighteenth century Spain was forcibly made aware in the Seven Years' War by the capture of Havana and Manila by the British, that it needed to establish a military to defend its empire. The crown established a standing military and filled its ranks with locals.Lyle N. McAlister, The \\"Fuero Militar\\" in New Spain, 1764‚Äì1800.

Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1978.Ben Vinson III, Bearing Arms for His Majesty: The Free Colored Militia in Colonial Mexico. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2001. Social history Scholars of Latin America have focused on characteristics of the region's populations, with particular interest in social differentiation and stratification, race and ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and family history, and the dynamics of colonial rule and accommodation or resistance to it. Social history as a field expanded its scope and depth beginning in the 1960s, although it was already developed as a field previous to that. An important 1972 essay by James Lockhart lays out a useful definition, \\"Social history deals with the informal, the unarticulated, the daily and ordinary manifestations of human existence, as a vital plasma in which all more formal and visible expressions are generated.\\"James Lockhart, \\"The Social History of Colonial Spanish America: Evolution and Potential\\". Latin American Research Review vol. 7, No. 1 (Spring 1972), p. 6, revised, 1999 in Of Things of the Indies: Essays Old and New in Early Latin American History, Stanford: Stanford University Press, pp. 27-80. Archival research utilizing untapped sources or those only partially utilized previously, such as notarial records, indigenous language materials, have allowed new insights into the functioning of colonial societies, particularly the role of non- elites. As one historian put it in 1986, \\"for the social historian, the long colonial siesta has long given way to sleepless frenzy.\\"Fred Bronner, \\"Urban Society in Colonial Spanish America: Research Trends,\\" Latin American Research Review vol. 21, No. 1 (1986), p. 50. =Conquest era= Hern√°n Cort√©s and La Malinche meet Moctezuma II in Tenochtitlan, November 8, 1519, shown in the pictorial history of the conquest, Lienzo de Tlaxcala(Facsimile c. 1890). The social history of the conquest era shift in the way the period is treated, focusing less on events of the conquest and more on its participants. James Lockhart's path-breaking Spanish Peru (1968) concerns the immediate post- conquest era of Peru, deliberately ignoring the political events of the internecine conflicts between Spanish factions. Instead it shows how even during that era, Spanish patterns took hold and a multiracial colonial society took shape.James Lockhart, Spanish Peru. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1968, revised 1994). His companion volume, The Men of Cajamarca examines the life patterns of the Spanish conquerors who captured the Inca emperor Atahualpa at Cajamarca who paid a huge ransom in gold for his freedom, and then murdered. The prosopographical study of these conquerors records as much extant information on each man in existing sources, with a general essay laying out the patterns that emerge from the data.James Lockhart, The Men of Cajamarca Austin: University of Texas Press 1972. A comparable work for the early history of Mexico is Robert Himmerich y Valencia's work on encomenderos.Robert Himmerich y Valenica, The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521-1555. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991. New research on encomenderos in Spanish South America has appeared in recent years.Ana Mar√≠a Presta, Encomienda, familia y negocios en Charcas Colonial: Los encomenderos de La Plata. Lima: Instituto de Estudios Peruanos 2000.Jos√© de la Puente Brunke, Encomienda y encomenderos en el Per√∫. Seville: Deputaci√≥n de Sevilla 1992.Jos√© Ignacio Avellaneda, The Conquerors of the New Kingdom of Granada. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1996. Gender as a factor in the conquest era has also shifted the focus in the field. New work on Do√±a Marina/Malinche, Hern√°n Cort√©s's consort and cultural translator sought to contextualize her as a historical figure with a narrow range of choices. The work has aided the rehabilitation of her reputation from being a traitor to \\"her\\" people.Frances Karttunen, \\"Rethinking Malinche,\\" in Indian Women of Early Mexico. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1997.Camilla Townsend, Malintzin's Choices: An Indian Woman in the Conquest of Mexico. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2006. The role of women more generally in the conquest has been explored for the Andean region.Karen Powers, Women in the Crucible of the Conquest. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2005 The role of blacks in the conquest is now being explored,Matthew Restall, \\"Black Conquistadors: Armed Africans in Early Spanish America,\\" The Americas 57:2(2000)171-205. as well as Indians outside the main conquests of central Mexico and Peru.Matthew Restall, Maya Conquistador. Boston: Beacon Press 1998. =Elites= Pedro Romero de Terreros, the first count of Regla, a mining magnate of Mexico Miguel Cabrera, Brooklyn Museum Among elites are crown officials, high churchmen, mining entrepreneurs, and transatlantic merchants, enmeshed in various relationships wielding or benefiting from power as well as the women of this strata, who married well or took the veil. Many are immortalized in contemporary portraits and the subject later, individual biographies or collective biographies. The history of elites and the role of economic stratification remain important in the field, although there is now a concerted effort to expand research to non-elites.Magnus Morner, \\"Economic Factors and Stratification in Colonial Spanish America with Special Regard to Elites,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 63, no. 2 1983: 335-69John Kicza, \\"Elites in New Spain,\\" Latin American Research Review vol.21(2) 1986, pp. 189-196.Fred Bronner, \\"Urban Society in Colonial Spanish America: Research Trends,\\" Latin American Research Review vol. 21, no. 1 1986, 7-72. Elites lived in cities, the headquarters and nexus of civil and religious hierarchies and their large bureaucracies, the hubs of economic activity, and the residence of merchant elites and the nobility. A large number of studies of elites focus on particular cities: vicregal capital and secondary cities, which had a high court (audiencia) and the seat of a bishopric, or were ports from overseas trade. The intersection of silver entrepreneurs and elites in Mexico has been examined in D.A. Brading's classic Miners and Merchants in Bourbon Mexico, 1763-1810, focusing on Guanajuato and in Peter Bakewell's study of Zacatecas.David Brading, Miners and Merchants in Bourbon Mexico, 1763-1810. New York: Cambridge University Press 1971.Peter J. Bakewell, Silver and Society in Zacatecas, New York: Cambridge University Press 1971. Merchants in Mexico City have been studied as a segment of elites for Mexico City in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.Louisa Schell Hoberman, \\"Merchants in Seventeenth-Century Mexico City: A Preliminary Portrait,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 57 (1977): 479-503.Louisa Schell Hoberman, Mexico's Merchant Elite: 1590-1660: Silver, State, and Society.

Booker, Veracruz Merchants, 1770-1829: A Mercantile Elite in Late Bourbon and Early Independent Mexico. Boulder: Westview Press 1993. Merchants in other areas have been studies as well.Susan Migden Socolow, The Merchants of Buenos Aires, 1778-1810.Ann Twinam, Miners, Merchants, and Farmers in Colonial Colombia . Austin: University of Texas Press 1982. Some extraordinarily successful economic elites, such as miners and merchants, were ennobled by the Spanish crown in the eighteenth century.Doris Ladd, The Mexican Nobility at Independence, 1780-1826.

New York: Library Publishers 1955 A few nuns and uncloistered religious women (beatas) wrote spiritual biographies. Advocates for the formal church recognition of holy persons, such as Rosa of Lima, St. Mariana de Jes√∫s de Paredes (\\"the Lily of Quito\\"), and St. Felipe de Jes√∫s, wrote hagiographies, mustering evidence for their cases for beatification and canonization. Modern scholars have returned to colonial- era texts to place these women in a larger context.Ronald J. Morgan, Spanish American Saints and the Rhetoric of Identity, 1600-1810.

Studies of ecclesiastics as a social grouping include one on the Franciscans in sixteenth-century Mexico.Francisco Morales, Ethnic and Social Background of the Franciscan Friars in Seventeenth-Century Mexico. Washington DC: Academy of American Franciscan History 1973. For eighteenth-century Mexico William B. Taylor's Magistrates of the Sacred on the secular clergy is a major contribution.William B.

An important study on the secular clergy in eighteenth-century Lima has yet to be published as a monograph.Paul Ganster, \\"A social history of the secular clergy of Lima during the middle decades of the eighteenth century,\\" Ph.D. dissertation, UCLA 1989. In recent years, studies of elite women who became nuns and the role of convents in colonial society have appeared. Elite indigenous women in Mexico had the possibility of becoming nuns, although not without controversy about their ability to follow a religious vocation.Asunci√≥n Lavrin, \\"Indian Brides of Christ: Creating New Spaces for Indigenous Women in New Spain,\\" Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos 15, no. 2 (1999), 225-60.Ann Miriam Gallagher, \\"The Indian Nuns of Mexico City's Monasterio de Corpus Christi, 1724-1821,\\" in Latin American Women, Historical Perspectives, ed.

Two volumes, each with two parts, cover the prehispanic and post-Contact history of indigenous peoples of MesoamericaThe Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas, Vol. II Mesoamerica. New York: Cambridge University Press 2000 and South America Cambridge History of Native Peoples of the Americas Vol. I South America. Cambridge University Press 2000. In the twentieth century, historians and anthropologists of studying colonial Mexico worked to create a compendium of sources of Mesoamerican ethnohistory, resulting in four volumes of the Handbook of Middle American Indians being devoted to Mesoamerican ethnohistorical sources.Howard F. Cline, ed. Handbook of Middle American Indians, Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources, Vols. 12-15. Austin: University of Texas Press 1972-1975. Two major monographs by historian Charles Gibson, the first on the post-conquest history of Tlaxcala, the indigenous polity that allied with Cort√©s against the Mexica, and the second, his monumental history of the Aztecs of central Mexico during the colonial era, were published by high-profile academic presses and remain classics in Spanish American historiography. Gibson was elected president of the American Historical Association in 1977, indicating how mainstream Mesoamerican ethnohistory had become.Charles Gibson, Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century. New Haven: Yale University Press 1952.Charles Gibson, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964. Litigation by Mexican Indians in Spanish courts in Mexico generated a huge archive of information in Spanish about how the indigenous adapted to colonial rule, which Gibson and other historians have drawn on.Woodrow W.Borah, ‚Äò‚ÄôJustice by Insurance‚Äô‚Äô.Gibson, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule. Scholars utilizing texts in indigenous languages have expanded the understanding the social, political, and religious history of indigenous peoples, particularly in Mexico.James Lockhart, The Nahuas After the Conquest.

Stanford: Stanford University Press 1996. The topic of indigenous rebellion against Spanish rule has been explored in central and southern Mexico and the Andes. One of the first major rebellions in Mexico is the 1541 Mixt√≥n War, in which indigenous in central Mexico's west rose up and a full-scale military force led by New Spain's first viceroy.Ida Altman, The War for Mexico's West: Indians and Spaniards in New Galicia, 1524-1550. Albuquerque: New Mexico, 2010. Work on rebellion in central Mexican villages showed that they were local and generally short- lived.William B.

Seventeenth-century rebellions in northern Mexico have also garnered attention.Charlotte M. Gradie, The Tepehuan Revolt of 1616: Militarism, Evangelism and Colonialism in Seventeenth-Century Nueva Vizcaya. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 2000. Andean resistance and rebellion have increasingly been studied as a phenomenon. The indigenous writer Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala (1535-ca. 1626) who authored El primer nueva cor√≥nica y buen gobierno has garnered significant attention. The nearly 1,200-page, richly illustrated manuscript by an elite Andean is a critique of Spanish rule in the Andes that can be considered a lengthy petition to the Spanish monarch to ameliorate abuses of colonial rule.Rolena Adorno, Guaman Poma: Writing and Resistance in Colonial Peru.

The decisions steered crown and ecclesiastical policy and practices. With the importation of Africans as slaves during the early days of European settlement in the Caribbean and the emergence of race mixture, social hierarchies and racial categories became complex. The legal division between the Rep√∫blica de indios, that put the indigenous population in a separate legal category from the Rep√∫blica de espa√±oles that included Europeans, Africans, and mixed-race castas was the crown's policy to rule its vassals with racial status as one criterion. An elite woman with her black slave, Quito Much scholarly work has been published in recent years on social structure and race, with an emphasis on how Africans were situated in the legal structure, their socioeconomic status, place within the Catholic Church, and cultural expressions. Modern studies of race in Spanish America date to the 1940s with the publication of Gonzalo Aguirre Beltr√°n's monograph on Africans in Mexico.Gonzalo Aguirre Beltr√°n, La poblaci√≥n negra de M√©xico, 1519-1810: Estudio etnohist√≥rico. Mexico City: Fuente Cultural 1946.1946 In the United States, the 1947 publication of Frank Tannenbaum's Slave and Citizen: The Negro in the Americas cast Latin American slavery as more benevolent compared to that in the United States. In Tannenbaum's work, he argued that although slaves in Latin America were in forced servitude, they incorporated into society as Catholics, could sue for better treatment in Spanish courts, had legal routes to freedom, and in most places abolition was without armed conflict, such as the Civil War in the United States.Frank Tannenbaum, Slave and Citizen: The Negro in the Americas. New York: Vintage Books 1947. The work is still a center of contention, with a number of scholars dismissing it as being wrong or outdated, while others consider the basic comparison still holding and simply no longer label it as the \\"Tannenbaum thesis.\\"Alejandro de la Fuente, ‚ÄúSlave, Law, and Claims-Making in Cuba: The Tannenbaum Debate Revisited,‚Äù ‚Äò‚ÄôLaw and History Review‚Äò‚Äô 22, no. 2 (July 2004), 383-87. The 1960s marked the beginning of an upsurge in studies of race and race mixture. Swedish historian Magnus M√∂rner's 1967 Race Mixture in the History of Latin America, published by a trade press and suitable for college courses, remained important for defining the issues surrounding race.Magnus M√∂rner, Race Mixture in the History of Latin America. Boston: Little Brown 1967. The historiography on Africans and slavery in Latin America was examined in Frederick Bowser's 1972 article in Latin American Research Review, summarizing research to date and prospects for further investigation. His major monograph, The African Slave in Colonial Peru, African Slave in Colonial Peru, 1524-1650, marked a significant advance in the field, utilizing rich archival sources and broadening the research area to Peru.Frederick Bowser, The African Slave in Colonial Peru, 1524-1650.

Depiction of the casta system in 18th c. Mexico The debates about race, class, and \\"caste\\" took off in the 1970s with works by a number of scholars.John K. Chance and William B.

These paintings from the elite viewpoint show racial stereotypes with father of one race, mother of another, and their offspring labeled in yet another category.Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n Garc√≠a S√°iz, Las castas mexicanas: Un g√©nero pict√≥rico americano. Milan: Olivetti 1989.Ilona Katzew, Casta Painting: Images of Race in Eighteenth-Century Mexico.

Elites' concern about racial purity or \\"limpieza de sangre\\" (purity of blood), which in Spain largely revolved around whether one was of pure Christian heritage, in Spanish America encompassed the \\"taint\\" of non-white admixture. A key work is Mar√≠a Elena Mart√≠nez's Genealogical Fictions, showing the extent to which elite families sought erase blemishes from genealogies.Mar√≠a Elena Mart√≠nez, Genealogical Fictions: Limpieza de Sangre, Religion, and Gender in Colonial Mexico. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2008 Another essential work to understand the workings of race in Spanish America is Ann Twinam's work on petitions to the crown by mulattos and pardos for dispensation from their non-white status, to pursue education or a profession, and later as a blanket request not tied to professional rules prohibiting non-whites to practice. In the decades following Tannenbaum's work, there were few of these documents, known c√©dulas de gracias al sacar, with just four cases identified, but the possibility of upward social mobility played an important role in framing scholarly analysis of dynamics of race in Spanish America.Ann Twinam, Purchasing Whiteness: Pardos, Mulattos, and the Quest for Social Mobility in the Spanish Indies. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2015. Considerable work on social mobility preceded that work, with R. Douglas Cope's The Limits of Racial Domination remaining important.R. Douglas Cope, The Limits of Racial Domination: Plebeian Society in Colonial Mexico, 1660-1720. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1994. The incorporation of blacks and indigenous into Spanish American Catholicism meant that they were part of the spiritual community. Recent work indicates that blacks in Castile were classified as \\"Old Christians\\" and obtained licenses to migrate to the Spanish Indies, where many became artisans and a few became wealthy and prominent.Chloe Ireton, \\"'They are Alacks of the Caste of Black Christians': Old Christian Black Blood in the Sixteenth- and Early Seventeenth-Century Iberian Atlantic\\". Hispanic American Historical Review 97:4 (Nov. 2017) 579-612. The Church did not condemn slavery as such. The Church generally remained exclusionary in the priesthood and kept separate parish registers for different racial categories. Black and indigenous confraternities (cofrad√≠as) provided a religious structure for reinforcement of ties among their members.Susan Schroeder, \\"Jesuits, Nahuas, and the Good Death Society in Mexico City, 1710-1767,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 80, no. 1 (2000), 43-76.Nicole von Germeten, Black Blood Brothers: Confraternities and Social Mobility for Afro-Mexcians.

Records of the Holy Office of the Inquisition have been a fruitful archival source on women in Mexico and Peru, which include women of color.

Lives of the bigamists: marriage, family, and community in colonial Mexico, Albuquerque : University of New Mexico Press, 1995. sexual transgressions, blasphemy, and priests soliciting in the confessional. Mocking religious sacraments could bring one before religious authorities, such as the case of the \\"marriage\\" of two dogs in late colonial Mexico.Zeb Tortorici, \\"In the Name of the Father and the Mother of All Dogs: Canine Baptisms, Weddings, and Funerals in Bourbon Mexico\\" in Centering Animals in Latin American History, pp. 93-199. In the eighteenth century, the crown sought to curtail public manifestations of piety (\\"baroque display\\") by bringing in new regulations. Pamela Voekel's Alone Before God: Religious Origins of Modernity in Mexico shows how the crown targeted elaborate funerary rites and mourning as an expression of excessive public piety. Mandating that burials be outside the consecrated ground of churches and church yards but rather in suburban cemeteries, elites pushed back. They had used such public displays as a way of demonstrating their wealth and position among the living and guaranteeing their eternal rest in the best situated places in churches.Pamela Voekel, Alone Before God: Religious Origins of Modernity in Mexico. Durham: Duke University Press 2002. Another crown target was Carnaval celebrations in Mexico City, which plebeians joined with enthusiasm since Carnaval generally overturned or mocked traditional order, including religious authorities. Also to better ensure public order of plebeians, the crown sought to regulate taverns as well as public drinking, particularly during festivals. Since elites consumed alcohol in their private residences, the regulations were aimed at controlling commoners.Juan Pedro Viqueira Alb√°n, Propriety and Permissiveness in Bourbon Mexico, trans.

History of science Cleric Jos√© Celestino Mutis, head of the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada (1783-1816), whose work deeply impressed Alexander von Humboldt. At the same time that the crown was attempting to suppress baroque religious culture, it was promoting scientific work, to which eighteenth-century clerics contributed.Karl, Schmitt. \\"The Clergy and the Enlightenment in Latin America: An Analysis.\\" The Americas, April 1959 (vol. 15), no. 4.Alfred Owen Aldridge, The Ibero-American Enlightenment.

Seventeenth-century Mexican polymath secular priest Don Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora made astronomical observations as did his Jesuit contemporary Eusebio Kino. In the earlier period, Franciscan Bernardino de Sahag√∫n's collection of information on Aztec classification \\"earthly\\" things in Book XI, such as the flora, fauna, soil types, land forms, and the like in the Florentine Codex was not clearly related to the project's religious aims.Bernardino de Sahag√∫n, The Florentine Codex, Book XI, The Earthly Things. Arthur J.O. Anderson and Charles Dibble, eds. and trans. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press 1963. The Spanish American Enlightenment produced a huge body of information on Spain's overseas empire via scientific expeditions. The most famous scientific traveler in Spanish America was Alexander von Humboldt, whose travel writings and scientific observations remain important sources for the history of Spanish America, most especially his Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain (1811),;English translation: Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain containing researches relative to the geography of Mexico, (1811) biodiversitylibrary.org but other works as well. Humboldt's expedition was authorized by the crown, but was self-funded from his personal fortune. Prior to Humboldt's famous expedition, the crown funded a number of important scientific expeditions to Peru and Chile (1777‚Äì78), New Granada (1783-1816),Enrique P√©rez Arbel√°ez, Jos√© Mutis y la Real Expedici√≥n bot√°nica al Virreinato del Per√∫.

Economic history Spanish galleon, the mainstay of transatlantic and transpacific shipping, engraving by Albert Durer Trade and commerce, commodity production, and labor systems have been extensively studied in colonial Spanish America. An important collection of articles is found in The Cambridge Economic History of Latin America: Volume 1: The Colonial Era and the Short Nineteenth Century,Victor Bulmer-Thomas, John H. Coatsworth, and Roberto Cort√©s Conde, eds. New York: Cambridge University Press 2006. as well as in the first two volumes of The Cambridge History of Latin America.Leslie Bethell, ed. New York: Cambridge University Press 1986. As with other aspects of colonial history, economic history does not fit neatly into a single category, since it is bound up with crown policy, the existence of exploitable resources, such as silver, credit, capital and entrepreneurs. In the development of the agricultural sector, the availability of fertile soil and adequate water, expanses of land for grazing of cattle and sheep, as well as the availability of labor, either coerced or free were factors. The export economy relying on silver production and to a lesser extent dye for European textile production stimulated the growth of regional development. Profitable production of foodstuffs and other commodities, such as wool, for local consumption marked the development of a colonial economy. General works on economic history continue to contribute to the understanding colonial Spanish America.J.R. Fisher, Commercial Relations between Spain and Spanish America in the Era of Free Trade, 1778-1796. Liverpool: Centre for Latin American Studies 1985. =Early labor systems= Following on precedents in Spain following the Catholic reconquest of Muslim Spain, conquerors expected material rewards for their participation, which in that period was the encomienda. In Spanish America, the encomienda was a grant of indigenous labor and tribute from a particular community to private individuals, assumed to be in perpetuity for their heirs. Where the encomienda initially functioned best was in regions where indigenous populations were hierarchically organized and were already used to rendering tribute and labor. Central Mexico and the Andes presented that pattern. The encomienda has an institution has been well studied concerning its impacts on indigenous communities and how Spanish encomenderos profited from the system.Silvio Zavala, La encomienda Indiana. Mexico: Editorial Porr√∫a 1935, 1973. James Lockhart examined the shift from encomienda labor awarded to just a few Spaniards, to the attempt by the crown to expand access to labor via the repartimiento to later arriving Spaniards who had been excluded from the original awards. This also had the effect of undermining the growing power of the encomendero group and the shift to free labor and the rise of the landed estate.James Lockhart, ‚ÄúEncomienda and Hacienda: the Evolution of the Great Estate in the Spanish Indies‚Äù. Hispanic American Historical Review 49 (1969): 411-29. Revised in Of Things of the Indies: Essays Old and New in Early Latin American History, Stanford: Stanford University Press 1999, pp. 1-26. In Central America, forced labor continued as a system well into the nineteenth century.William Sherman, Forced Native Labor in Sixteenth Century Central America. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1979. Regional variations on the encomienda have been studied in Paraguay, an area peripheral to Spanish economic interests. The encomienda there was less labor coercion than mobilizing networks of indigenous kin that Spaniards joined.Elman R. Service, \\"The Encomienda in Paraguay\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 31(2) 230-52.Shawn Michael Austin, \\"Guaran√≠ kinship and the encomienda community in colonial Paraguay, sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries,\\" Colonial Latin American Review 24:4(2015) 545-571. Slave labor was utilized in various parts of Spanish America. African slave labor was introduced in the early Caribbean during the demographic collapse of the indigenous populations. The slave trade was in the hands of the Portuguese, who had an early monopoly on the coastal routes in Africa. Africans learned skilled trades and functioned as artisans in cities and labor bosses over indigenous in the countryside. Studies of the African slave trade and the economic role of blacks in Spanish America have increased, particularly with the development of Atlantic history. Asian slaves in Spanish America have been less well studied, but monograph on Mexico indicates the promise of this topic.Tatiana Seijas, Asian Slaves in Colonial Mexico: From Chinos to Indians. New York: Cambridge University Press 2014. One of the few women to achieve fame in colonial Mexico was Catarina de San Juan, a slave in seventeenth- century Puebla. The mobilization of indigenous labor in the Andes via the mita for the extraction of silver has been studied.Peter J. Bakewell, Miners of the Red Mountain: Indian Labor in Potos√≠, 1545-1650. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1984.Jeffrey A. Cole, The Potos√≠ Mita, 1573-1700: Compulsory Labor in the Andes, Stanford: Stanford University Press 1985.Enrique Tandeter, Coercion and Market: Silver Mining in Colonial Potos√≠, 1692-1826. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1993. Encomienda or repartimiento labor was not an option in Mexico's north; the workforce was of free laborers, who initially migrated from elsewhere to the mining zone. =Silver= Potosi, the \\"cerro rico\\" that produced massive amounts of silver from a single site. The first image published in Europe. Pedro Cieza de Le√≥n, 1553. The major motor of the Spanish colonial economy was silver mining, which produced in upper Peru (now Bolivia) at the single site of production, Potos√≠. There were multiple sites in Mexico, mainly in the north outside the zone of dense indigenous population, which initially necessitated pacification of the indigenous populations to secure the mining sites and the north-south transportation routes.Philip Wayne Powell, Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: The Northward Advance of New Spain, 1550-1600. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1952. Silver and silver mining have occupied an important place in the history of Spanish America and the Spanish Empire, since the two major sources of silver were found in the viceroyalties of New Spain (Mexico) and Peru, where there were significant numbers of indigenous and Spanish colonists. With changes in eighteenth-century crown policies, silver production was revived after a slump in the seventeenth century.David Brading and Harry Cross, ‚ÄúColonial Silver Mining: Mexico and Peru.‚Äù Hispanic America Historical Review 52 (1972): 545-579.Richard Garner and Spiro E. Stefanu, Economic Growth and Change in Bourbon Mexico. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1993. The impact of silver on the world economy was profound in both Europe and Asia.Carlos Marichal, ‚ÄúThe Spanish American Silver Peso: Export Commodity of the Ancien Regime, 1550-1800‚Äù, From Silver to Cocaine, pp. 25-52.William Schell, Jr. \\"Silver Symbiosis: ReOrienting Mexican Economic History,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 81(1) Feb. 2001: 89-133.

Essays on the Price History of Eighteenth-Century Latin America. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1990. Mercury was a key component to the process of extracting silver from ore. Mercury for Mexican mining production was shipped from the Almad√©n mine in Spain, while mercury production in Peru was from the mine at Huancavelica.Arthur P.

Moya, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2011, pp. 309-341. More recently, scholars have focused on commodity chains and their contribution to globalization, rather than focusing solely on production sites.Steven Topik, Carlos Marichal, and Zephyr Frank, From Silver to Cocaine: Latin American Commodity Chains and the Building of the World economy, 1500-2000. Durham: Duke University Press 2006. Sugar as a commodity was cultivated from the earliest colonization in the CaribbeanCarl O. Sauer, The Early Spanish Main and brought to Mexico by Hern√°n Cort√©s, which supplied domestic demand.Ward Barrett, The Sugar Hacienda of the Marqueses del Valle. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1970. There is a vast literature about sugar plantations in various regions of Spanish America and Brazil.Manuel Moreno Fraginals, The Sugar Mill: The Socio-Economic Complex of Sugar in Cuba, 1760-1860. Trans. Cedric Belfrage. New York: Monthly Review Press 1976.Stuart B. Schwartz, Tropical Babylons: Sugar and the Making of the Atlantic World, 1450-1680. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 2004. Another tropical export product was cacao, which was grown in Mesoamerica. Once Europeans developed a taste for chocolate, with the addition of sugar, cacao production expanded.Murdo J. MacLeod, Spanish Central America: A Socioeconomic History, 1520-1720. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1973, especially chapters 5, 12, 18.Eugenio Pi√±ero. The Town of San Felipe and Colonial Cacao Economies. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society 1994. The production of mind-altering commodities was an important source of profit for entrepreneurs and the Spanish administration. Tobacco as a commodity was especially important in the late eighteenth century when the crown created a monopoly on its production and processing.Susan Deans-Smith, Bureaucrats, Planters, and Works: the Making of the Tobacco Monopoly in Bourbon Mexico, 1740-1810. Austin: University of Texas Press 1992.Jerry W.

Cosner, The Golden Leaf: How Tobacco Shaped Cuba and the Atlantic World. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press 2015. Demand by the urban poor for local production of pulque, the fermented alcohol from agave cacti, made it profitable, so that large-scale cultivation, including by Jesuit landed estates, met demand; the crown regulated taverns where it was consumed.Herman Konrad, A Jesuit Hacienda in Colonial Mexico: Santa Luc√≠a, 1576-1767. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1980. Coca, the Andean plant now processed into cocaine, was grown and the unprocessed leaves consumed by indigenous particularly in mining areas. Production and distribution of coca became big business, with non-indigenous owners of production sites, speculators, and merchants, but consumers consisting of indigenous male miners and local indigenous women sellers. The church benefited from coca production since it was by far the most valuable agricultural product and contributor to the tithe.Paulina Numhauser, Mujeres indias y se√±ores de la coca: Potos√≠ y Cuzco en el siglo XVI. Madrid: Ediciones C√°tedra 2005. Most high quality textiles were imported from Europe via the transatlantic trade controlled by Iberian merchants, but Mexico briefly produced silk.Woodrow Borah, Silk Raising in Colonial Mexico. As demand for cheap textiles grew, production for a growing local mass market took place in small-scale textile workshops (obrajes), which had low capital inputs, since the expansion of sheep ranching provided a local supply of wool, and low labor costs, with obrajes functioning in some cases as jails.Richard Salvucci, Textiles and Capitalism in Mexico: An economic history of obrajes, 1539-1840. Princeton: Princeton University Press 1987. Spanish America is most noted for producing dyes for European textile production, in particular the red dye cochineal, made from the crushed bodies of insects that grew on nopal cactuses, and indigo. Cochineal was for Mexico its second most important export after silver, and the mechanisms to engage indigenous in Oaxaca involved crown officials and urban merchants.Carlos Marichal, ‚ÄúMexican Cochineal and the European Demand for American Dyes,‚Äù From Silver to Cocaine, pp. 76-92.Brian Hamnett, Politics and Trade in Southern Mexico, 1750-1821. New York: Cambridge University Press 1971. The blue dye indigo was another important export, particularly from Central America.Murdo J. MacLeod, Spanish Central America: A Socioeconomic History, 1520-1720, especially chapter 10.David McCreery, ‚ÄúIndigo Commodity Chains in the Spanish and British Empires, 1560-1860‚Äù in From Silver to Cocaine, pp. 53-75. =Trade and transportation= 16th c. Seville, Spanish port for the transatlantic trade Acapulco in 1628, Mexican terminus of the Manila galleon Arrieros in Mexico. Mules were the main way cargo was moved overland, engraving by Carl Nebel Crown policy attempted to control overseas trade, setting up the Casa de Contrataci√≥n in 1503 to register cargoes including immigration to the overseas empire. From Spain, sailings to the major ports in Spanish America left from Seville. It was a distance up from the mouth of the Guadalquivir river, and its channel did not allow the largest transoceanic ships to dock there when fully loaded. The Carrera de Indias was the main route of Spain's Atlantic trade, originating in Seville and sailing to a few Spanish American ports in the Caribbean, particularly Santo Domingo, Veracruz, on the Atlantic coast of Panama, Nombre de Dios later Porto Bello. Since trade and commerce were so integral to the rise of Spain's power, historians undertook studies of the policies and patterns.Clarence Haring, Trade and Navigation between Spain and the Indies in the Time of the Habsburgs.

Parry's classic The Spanish Seaborne Empire remains important for its clear explication of transatlantic trade, including ports, ships and ship building,J.H. Parry, The Spanish Seaborne Empire. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1990, 1966. and there is new work on Spanish politics and trade with information on the fleets.Geoffrey Walker, Spanish Politics and Imperial Trade, 1700-1789. Bloomington Indiana University Press 1979. Transatlantic trading companies based in Spain and with partners, usually other family members, established businesses to ship a variety of goods, sourced in Spain and elsewhere in Europe and shipped to the major ports of the overseas empire. The most important export from the New World was silver, which became essential for financing the Spanish crown and as other European powers became emboldened, the ships were targeted for their cargo. The system of convoys or fleets (Spanish: flota) was established early on, with ships from Veracruz and from South America meeting in the Caribbean for a combined sailing to Spain. Transpacific trade with the Spanish archipelago of the Philippines was established, with Asian goods shipped from Manila to the port of Acapulco. The Manila galleon brought silks, porcelains, and slaves to Mexico while Spanish silver was sent to Asia. The transpacific trade has been long neglected in comparison to the transatlantic trade and the rise of Atlantic history.William Schurz, The Manila Galleon. New York 1939.Manuel Carrera Stampa, ‚ÄúLa Nao de la China,‚Äù Historia Mexicana 9, no. 33 (1959), 97-118.

Central Milton Keynes: Author House 2011. Although the crown attempted to maintain a closed trading system within the Spanish Empire, the British traded with Spanish Americans, accelerating in the eighteenth century.Adrian Pearce. British Trade with Spanish America, 1763-1808. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press 2008. Overland transportation of goods in Spanish America was generally by pack animals, especially mules, and in the Andean area llamas as well. But the Spanish did not build many roads allowing cart or carriage transport.Bruce A. Castleman, Building the King's Highway: Labor, Society, and Family on Mexico's Caminos Reales 1757‚Äì1804. Tucson, AZ: University of Arizona Press 2005 Transit over oceans or coastal sailing was relatively efficient compared to land transportation, and in most places in Spanish America there were few navigable rivers and no possibility of canal construction. Transportation costs and inefficiency were drags on economic development; the problem was not overcome until railroads were constructed in the late nineteenth century. For bulky, low value foodstuffs, local supply was a necessity, which stimulated regional development of landed estates, particularly near mines.John H. Coatsworth, ‚ÄúObstacles of Economic Growth in Nineteenth-Century Mexico,‚Äù American Historical Review, vol. 83, no. 1, (Feb. 1978) pp. 80-100. Despite the inefficiencies overland trade, hubs of trade had main routes develop between them, with smaller communities linked by secondary or tertiary roads. The ability to move silver from remote mining regions to ports was a priority, and the supplies to mines of mercury was essential.James Lockhart, ‚ÄúTrunk Lines and Feeder Lines: The Spanish Reaction to American Resources‚Äù in Of the Things of the Indies. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1999, pp. 120‚Äì157. =Environmental impacts= The environmental impact of economic activity has coalesced as a field in the late twentieth century, in particular Alfred Crosby's work on the Columbian Exchange and \\"ecological imperialism.\\"Alfred Crosby, The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492.

Robins, Mercury Mining and Empire: The Human and Ecological Cost of Colonial Silver Mining in the Andes. Bloomington: Indiana University Press 2011. End of the colonial era Independence in Spanish America occupies an ambiguous place in historiography, since it marks both the end of crown rule and the emergence of sovereign nations. The historiography of Spanish American independence has not had a unifying narrative, and has been generally linked to nation-centric accounts.Jeremy Adelman, ‚ÄúIndependence in Latin America‚Äù in The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, Jos√© C. Moya, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2011, 153-54. The publication 2017 of Brian Hamnett's The End of Iberian Rule and the American Continent, 1770-1830Brian Hamnett, The End of Iberian Rule and the American Continent, 1770-1830. Princeton University Press 2017 aims to show how independence came about in both Spanish America and Brazil, focusing on the contingency of that outcome. He is one of many historians who have argued that political independence was by no means inevitable. \\"There was little interest in outright independence.\\"David Bushnell, \\"Wars of Independence: South America\\" in The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 5, p. 446. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Since independence did come about, explanations of why that occurred have been sought in the colonial era. The French capture of the Bourbon monarch Charles IV and his forced abdication in 1808 opened an era of political instability in Spain and Spanish America. Timothy Anna and Michael Costeloe have argued that the Bourbon monarchy collapsed, bringing into being new, sovereign nations, when American-born elites mainly sought autonomy within the existing system.Timothy Anna, The Fall of Royal Government in Mexico City. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1978; The Fall of Royal Government in Peru. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1979; Spain and the Loss of America. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1983.Michael Costeloe, Response to Revolution: Imperial Spain and Spanish American Revolutions, 1810-1840. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1986. Political scientist Jorge I. Dom√≠nguez writes in the same vein about the \\"breakdown of the Spanish American empire,\\" arguing that independence was caused by international rivalries and not a splintering of colonial elites, whose conflicts he says could be managed within the existing framework.Jorge I. Dom√≠nguez, Insurrection or Loyalty: The Breakdown of the Spanish American Empire. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1980. Hamnett's fifty-year frame of reference allows him to show the Spanish crown's attempts reform, but with the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, the Liberal constitution of 1812, and the repudiation of reform with Ferdinand VII's restoration in 1814 pushed Spanish American elites to outright declarations of independence. The inflexibility of both the Spanish liberals and the absolutist Ferdinand VII lost Spain its continental Spanish American empire. Spain itself entered a new era at the same time that Spanish American sovereign states were working out their new political reality. There are a number of standard works on independence, some of which have been revised in subsequent editions. Richard Graham's Independence in Latin America remains a succinct examination. A classic work on the era is John Lynch's The Spanish American Revolutions, 1808-1826, followed by many others on leaders (\\"liberators\\") as well as the era generally.John Lynch, The Spanish American Revolutions, 1808-1826, 2nd edition. New York: Norton 1986. A number of histories of colonial Spanish America take the 1808 Napoleonic invasion of Iberia and ouster of the Bourbon monarchy as their end date. General histories of colonial Latin America end with one or more chapters on independence.e.g., Lockhart and Schwartz, ‚Äò‚ÄòEarly Latin America‚Äô‚Äô, Chapter 11, ‚ÄúEpilogue: the coming of independence.‚ÄùBurkholder and Johnson, ‚Äò‚ÄòColonial Latin America‚Äô‚Äô, Chapter 10, ‚ÄúCrisis and Political Revolution‚Äù and Chapter 11, ‚ÄúFrom Empire to Independence‚Äù The Cambridge History of Latin America has its first two volumes devoted to the colonial period generally, while volume 3 is devoted to the transition from independence to individual sovereign nations and the subsequent political chaos, and economic instability in Spanish America. Brazil largely escaped these problems with the decamping of the Portuguese monarchy to Brazil during the Napoleonic wars and the establishment of an independent Brazilian monarchy by a member of the Braganza dynasty in 1822.Leslie Bethell, ed.

Although he had a long career encompassing painting, printmaking and the production of sculptures, murals, and ceramics, he is now perhaps best known for the works he created during the Second World War and in particular the paintings he produced when he was among the British troops that liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Biography Taylor was born in London, went to school in Hampstead and studied art at the Royal College of Art. In 1935 he was awarded a prize at the International Print Exhibition in Chicago. Taylor worked as a visiting lecturer at both the Camberwell School of Art and at the Willesden School of Art from 1936 until the start of the Second World War. Liberated from Belsen Concentration Camp, 1945 (1945) (Art.IWM ART LD 5586) In 1939 Taylor enlisted in the British Army and eventually served as a sergeant in the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. He took part in the Allied invasion of Europe and the subsequent advance across France, the Netherlands and then into Germany. During the Allied advance, although not an official war artist, Taylor sketched when his military duties allowed. He depicted groups of refugees, members of the Dutch resistance and the aftermath of the Battle of the Falaise Gap. At Neum√ºnster he was allowed to sketch the Nazi leader Alfred Rosenberg in his prison cell shortly after his capture. In April 1945, Taylor's unit was among the first troops to enter the Bergen- Belsen concentration camp. Taylor painted a number of watercolours at the camp. Initially, his compositions showed massed piles of bodies but increasingly he turned to depicting individual survivors. The War Artists' Advisory Committee purchased several of his wartime pictures and they are now held by the Imperial War Museum. In 1997, Taylor presented 26 examples of his World War Two paintings to the library at Leeds University. After the war, Taylor resumed teaching at the Willesden School of Art and also worked at the Central School of Art. In 1949, he left both posts and moved to Leeds to become head of the design school at the Leeds College of Art. In 1956 he was promoted to principal of the college, and when parts of that college became part of Leeds Polytechnic in 1969, he became a deputy director of that institution. He held that post until his retirement in 1971. In 1965 Taylor completed a large mosaic mural for an outside wall of the Merrion Shopping Centre in Leeds. In 2015 these murals were renovated and relocated to a position at the Leeds College of Art. Taylor exhibited at the Royal Academy, the New English Art Club and the London Group and had a number of solo shows, mostly in the north of England.

The church was closed by the communist authorities in 1937 and became a residential building. After the fall of communism in 1990, the parish was registered again in 1992.

It was started in 2011 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and is headquartered in the Silicon Slopes region of Utah. The company has mentioned Profile Defenders charges $10,000 to remove a web page from Voice Media Group. In 2014 Ruddie said that Google was making things more difficult for reputation management companies, stressing the value of good content and high-quality backlinks. Fraudulent takedowns By 2016 Profile Defenders had found an effective tactic using takedowns: filing removal requests and trumped up lawsuits, according to Vice's Motherboard. Eugene Volokh detailed 25 court cases in the Washington Post, at least 15 who had false addresses for the defendant. The court cases had similar language and the defendant agreed to the injunction by the plaintiff, which allowed the reputation management company to issue takedown notices to Google, Yelp, Leagle, Ripoff Report, various news sites, and other websites. Two of the court cases were linked to Profile Defenders, and two others to Ruddie, using the company names \\"RIR 1984 LLC\\" and \\"SEO Profile Defense Network LLC\\", and one directly in Ruddie's name. About half of the cases were filed in Baltimore, near where Ruddie was born. =Rescue One= Steve Rhode operates Myvesta Foundation and its \\"get out of debt guy\\" site, getoutofdebt.org, providing financial literacy articles and help to identify fraudulent actors in the finance industry. Bradley Smith is a founder/co-CEO of Rescue One Financial, Financial Rescue, and Success Link Processing. Deborah Garcia allegedly posted negative comments about Smith's companies on the getoutofdebt.org site. Other founders and key people with Rescue One are Branden Millstone, Mark Photoglou, and Brian Voytovich, occasionally named in the case below. A case, 2017's \\"Smith v. Garcia\\" in Rhode Island, began with a filing showing that Smith, pro se, received an injunction against Deborah Garcia in April 2016 after a complaint was submitted by Smith in February 2015. This injunction, signed by both parties, said that Garcia would remove defamatory statements about Rescue One made on getoutofdebt.org (\\"Myvesta Foundation\\"), or Smith could have the pages deindexed by search engines such as Google and Bing. \\"Brad Smith\\" was listed as having an Irvine, California address, which is also where Rescue One is located. Paul Allan Levy and Public Citizen intervened in August 2016, representing Myvesta pro bono, and Eugene Volokh filed an amicus brief. Ruddie was being investigated by the Rhode Island Attorney General's office. While the Garcia statement said she had made the negative comments about Rescue One in the initial filing, Rhode noted the terms of service of his site did not allow her to remove a comment, and presented evidence that made it unlikely Garcia had written them, even under pseudonym. Levy even argued that Garcia may not even exist, showing mail was undeliverable. Rhode also argued that the comments did not count as defamation, and indicated that Rhode had not even heard of the case until Levy intervened in August. Ruddie acknowledged Profile Defenders was behind takedown notices of negative comments from Myvesta about Bradley Smith's Rescue One Financial LLC. The fraudulent signing of the original petition (consent) led judge William E. Smith to state it appears \\"potentially multiple crimes\\" had been committed, and he was \\"embarrassed that this [consent order] was signed\\" by the court. Immediately prior to this hearing, Smith's representation, Robby Birnbaum at Florida's Greenspoon Marder, said Smith didn't know about the case until Levy contacted them and that Smith wouldn't appear at the hearing for \\"a case he did not file\\". Further, lawyers for both parties acknowledged Countrywide Process LLC, in Valley Village, California was used to pay the filing fees and serve the papers in the Rhode Island case. Levy connected Countrywide Process to Ruddie: the filing was in the name of Gerald Feinstein of Annuity Sold, and the filing fee payment came from Ruddie's RIR 1984 LLC. Levy also subponead Bennett Wills of the Patel v. Chan case to prove a link in recovering fees by the anti-SLAPP ruling. In April 2017, the court found Richart Ruddie responsible for causing the lawsuit and the fraudulent consent order, and similar orders in Maryland and Florida: Smith v. Levin (Baltimore24-C-15-004789 Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City), Financial Rescue LLC v. Smith (Pinellas County, FloridaNo. 15-006119-CI Florida Circuit Court for Pinellas County), and Rescue 1 Financial LLC v. John Doe (Broward County, FloridaNo. CACE-14-024286 Florida Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit for Broward County). Ruddie agreed to a $71,000 settlement and obligation to have court orders made in his customers' names vacated. =Patel v. Chan= Another Profile Defenders case was in Baltimore, Patel v. Chan. Smith and Patel both stated their signatures had been forged and they didn't file their cases. Patel had also hired Profile Defenders, and Levy stated it was \\"filed by a young lawyer who I think probably got in over his head.\\" The Matthew Chan of Baltimore appeared to be fictitious. In fact, it was the discovery of this case by bloggers that led to the Rescue One/Rhode case, which wasn't known by Rhode et al at the time. In February 2017, Kurt Nachtman of Baltimore's Eldridge & Nachtman wrote on behalf of Bennett Wills, the \\"young lawyer\\" involved in the Patel v. Chan case, whom Levy subpoenad, stating \\"not a single request has anything to do with the Rhode Island case\\" and demanding Levy withdraw the subpoena. Natchtman further stated \\"Mr. Wills simply wishes to be left alone\\" regarding this case, indicated he'd be willing to enter a confidential settlement, and that he knew Wills and vouched for him. The parties continued their dispute, with Meridian Law filing a suit in Tennessee on Wills' behalf and Bradley Arant Boult Cummings responding in Tennessee on Levy's behalf. Ultimately the two settled out of court. =Annuity Sold= Annuity Sold and ten other companies were connected together and linked to a structured settlement fraud in 2018. Maryland's Attorney General, Brian Frosh, connected these companies, as well as false entities Marshall-McEwen Nationwide Esquire Law Firm, Brian Miller, Judge Larry C. David, Frank L. Land of GenLife Metro, Genlife Insurance Company. Ruddie had identified himself as being connected to Annuity Sold, as others pointed out, and Rhode discovered it shared a server with Richart Ruddie's personal site, Profile Defenders' site, and others. Billy Walters Ruddie was involved with infamous sports gambler Billy Walters who was sentenced to 5 years in Federal Prison for insider trading with Phil Mickelson and Carl Icahn where he profited $32 million dollars over 6 years. Walters appealed the conviction in 2019 but was denied.

His main research topics are analytical philosophy, phenomenal consciousness, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and freedom of the will. He obtained his PhD under supervision of Karl-Otto Apel in Frankfurt.  Academic career  Leilich studied philosophy, linguistics and catholic theology at the Goethe University Frankfurt where, in 1982, he was awarded his doctoral degree in philosophy for his thesis Ludwig Wittgenstein entitled \\"The Autonomy of Language\\" (), a study about the late philosophy of Wittgenstein. Since 1979 he was affiliated with the University of Antwerp, where he became a professor of philosophy, chairman of the department of philosophy, as well as chairman of the working group of philosophical psychology. He was also a founding member of the \\"Institute of Jewish Studies (IJS)\\" () at the mentioned university. He also became a member of the board of directors of the same IJS. Amongst the courses which Leilich taught at the University of Antwerp are \\"Contemporary Analytical Philosophy\\", \\"Philosophy of Language\\", \\"Logic\\" and \\"Epistemology and Philosophy of Science\\". Leilich was noted for his unusual method of stepwise grading during exams. In 2014, Leilich became an emeritus professor at the University of Antwerp. On 22 May 2014, he held his emeritus lecture about the Jewish roots of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.  Philosophy  By September 2004 he had published around thirty articles; primarily about language (analytical) philosophy, in particular in relation to Wittgenstein, and about philosophy of mind. Many of his publications focus on the problem of the free will. Leilich has dealt with the question of the rationality of pragmatic explanatory frameworks for the use of words. As such, he discovered that this ability for humans to justify the use of language, with regards to its normative aspect, is a fundamental expression of human reasonableness. Leilich has argued that nature is neither evil nor good, since moral proclamations require the involvement of mind to be appropriate. He has also been noted for making practical assertions as to what philosophy can mean to society, drawing upon the ideas of Peter Bieri, and has reflected upon the arising of new branches of science during popularizing lecture series. Further more he has investigated the mental processing of sensory stimuli.  Bibliography  = Articles = * Joachim Leilich, \\"Hoe irrationeel zijn libertari√´rs?

The church is part of Diocese of Novosibirsk. It is a protected historical monument of Gothic architecture. The church also offers public organ concerts.  History  As with many Catholic communities in Siberia, the original nucleus of the parish consisted of Poles and Lithuanians exiled to Siberia after the insurrectionary events of November 1830 in Poland. The governor gave permission to the community of Catholics to build a church in 1843. The first wooden chapel was built in 1848, and the community was established as a parish in 1868. In 1891, the church's priest asked permission to build a larger church, and permission was granted six years later. The church was closed for a campaign of atheism during Communism in 1923, and its bell tower was destroyed. During the period of its closure, the church served various other uses. Russia's relationship with religion was normalized after the fall of the communist regime, and the church was returned to the parish in 1993. Restoration of the church lasted until 2000; the church was reconsecrated on August 13, 2000, by Bishop Joseph Werth.

The only casualty on Phoenix was a man who suffered a broken leg from the recoil of a carronade. Captain William Moffat of Phoenix reported that Malartic had lost two surgeons, the boatswain, and several crew members killed in the action with Rebecca; Moffat did not report any casualties on Malartic from her encounter with Phoenix. The British took Dutertre prisoner; he was eventually released under the Treaty of Amiens in 1803. Moffat, master of Phoenix, took General Malartic with him to Bengal.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ4146. He put a prize crew aboard Malartic and took her crew on board Phoenix where passengers and the officers of the 88th Regiment of Foot traveling on her stood watch over them. The Court of Directors of the British East India company awarded Moffat 500 guineas and the officers and crew of Phoenix ¬£2000 to be divided among them for \\"their gallant conduct in engaging and capturing the ship General Malartic.\\"Edinburgh Magazine: Or Literary Miscellany, Volume 20, p.235.

The episode was written by Scott M. Gimple and directed by Greg Nicotero. This episode features the final regular appearances of characters Abraham Ford (Michael Cudlitz) and Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun), who are both brutally killed by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Glenn's death is reminiscent of his death in the comic book series, where he is killed in virtually the same manner. However, Abraham's death in the comic books differs from his death in the TV series; he is killed by Dwight (Austin Amelio) in the comics, whereas Dwight kills Denise in the TV series. The episode's title is a callback to Dr. Edwin Jenner's warning to Rick (Andrew Lincoln) from the first season finale (\\"TS-19\\"): Rick says that he's grateful for getting a shot at surviving the apocalypse, to which Edwin replies that \\"the day will come when you won't be.\\" Plot Cornered by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and his men, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his group continue to be forced on their knees in front of Negan to pledge servitude to him. To further coerce them, Negan selects one of them to bash in their head with \\"Lucille\\", a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. His selected victim is Abraham (Michael Cudlitz), who remains defiant after the first strike. Negan proceeds to pulverize Abraham's head to a pulp, as the others recoil in horror. When Negan presents the blood- soaked bat to a horrified Rosita (Christian Serratos), Daryl (Norman Reedus) leaps up and punches Negan, but is quickly subdued by Dwight (Austin Amelio) and two other Saviors. Negan states he will not tolerate such behavior and punishes the group again, this time by bashing Glenn's (Steven Yeun) head, much to Maggie's (Lauren Cohan) anguish. As the group watches in terror, Negan continues to smash Glenn in the same manner as Abraham. After witnessing Negan kill two members of his own party, Rick quietly vows to the Saviors' leader that he will kill him someday. Unfazed, Negan drags Rick to the group's RV, viciously announcing that he will be back and if Rick isn't with him, his men have permission to kill the rest of Rick's gang. After taunting Rick, Negan drives off and brings the RV to a stop near one of the Saviors' roadblocks by an overpass, amid a horde of walkers in thick morning fog. Negan then tosses Rick's hatchet onto the RV's roof and orders Rick to retrieve it before pushing him out of the RV. Amidst the heavy fog and smoke, Rick scrambles for safety on the RV's roof and sees a walker body dangling from the overpass. He begins to have flashbacks to the deaths of Abraham and Glenn, but Negan becomes impatient for Rick to return and starts firing up through the roof. Immediately, Rick jumps to the hanging corpse, but slips and falls, dropping the hatchet. As the walkers swarm around his rival, Negan fires onto them, giving Rick the chance to collect the hatchet and return to the RV; Negan drives off. As Rick sits in silence, Negan drives back to the clearing and hauls Rick from the RV. Reunited with both groups, Negan explains to Rick that he hoped that the trip changed Rick's mind about him. Since Rick still refuses to submit to him, Negan forces Rick to his knees and has his son, Carl (Chandler Riggs), lie prone next to him. Negan then warns Rick that he will order his men to kill every member of Rick's group and those back at \\"home\\"‚ÄîAlexandria‚Äîif he chooses not to cut off his son's arm. However, Rick begs Negan to let him take Carl's place instead, but Negan refuses. Aggressively sobbing, an anguished Rick picks up the hatchet and braces himself to cut Carl when Negan calmly stops him at the very last second, satisfied that Rick has finally submitted. Negan then goes on to announce that he and his men will show up at Alexandria in one week to take one half of Rick and company's supplies. After seizing Daryl as a hostage, Negan and the Saviors leave the group in despair. After the group reels in with shock and grief, Rick tells a heartbroken Maggie, still suffering from pregnancy complications, that they need to get her to the Hilltop Colony's doctor. However, Maggie urges that they all head back to Alexandria and prepare to fight. Rick counters, saying that they will all die if they go after Negan and his army. The group insists on continuing to the Hilltop, but Maggie demands that they do not follow her. Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) volunteers to escort Maggie to the Hilltop to recover, along with the bodies of Glenn and Abraham. As a walker slowly approaches, Rick picks up his hatchet and joins the others in the RV. Saddened, Rick has a vision of his entire group, including Abraham and Glenn as well as Maggie's yet-born child, enjoying a peaceful outdoor meal together in Alexandria, before coming back to reality. Through the right hand side view-mirror, Rick sees the lone walker eating the leftover blood remains of Abraham as he drives away. Development \\"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\\" covers events of \\"Volume 17\\", \\"Issue #100\\" of Robert Kirkman's original comic book series: Negan's introduction and his killing of Glenn. Kirkman worked with the show's producers to \\"transfer\\" comic-character deaths to other characters in the TV series; Dwight and other Saviors kill Abraham in the comics, but Dwight kills Denise in the episode \\"Twice as Far\\". Kirkman and the showrunners wondered if Glenn's death was necessary, since Abraham had already been chosen for Negan's fatal beating. Glenn was the first character cast for the series whose fate was uncertain in the comics; Kirkman wrote \\"Issue #100\\" knowing that Steven Yeun was playing Glenn in the series, which made writing that issue difficult. Kirkman and the showrunners discussed options which would have spared Glenn's life, but \\"pulling the thread on this sweater just pulls too many things apart\\"; Glenn's death in the comics drives several characters' plotlines (Maggie in particular) and they considered it \\"essential\\" to the episode. Reception =Critical reception= \\"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 66% with an average rating of 7.03 out of 10, based on 50 reviews. The site's consensus reads: The flashback-laden \\"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\\" is slow to deliver the payoff from last season's finale - but ultimately delivers with sadistic acts of gut-wrenching violence that will push Walking Dead fans to their limit. Matt Fowler of IGN rated it 6 out of 10 in his review: \\"It crossed a line, but not one of gore. Or death, even. Not necessarily. It basically broke the final shred of trust in the show to service characters over gimmickry.\\" Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C-, the lowest grade given by the website to the show thus far: \\"The show is so stupid that it thinks we're stupid, prays we're stupid; cross its fingers and hopes like hell that its legion of loyal, obsessive followers will rend their garments at the horrible death of a fan favorite, but still be back next week.\\" According to Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian, \\"This was, to put it mildly, uncomfortable viewing: 45-plus minutes of torture porn mingled with something even more unpalatable ... this wasn't so much entertainment as psychic evisceration for us.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, \\"I've had a lot of issues with The Walking Dead of late ‚Äî especially with that genuinely terrible season six finale ‚Äî but I probably still would have called myself, in general, a ‚Äúfan‚Äù of the show until tonight\\". Brian Lowry from CNN also criticized the episode: \\"Nevertheless, its most admirable qualities have increasingly been overshadowed by its more distasteful ones - not merely in demonstrating just how brutal humanity can be, but by toying with its audience.\\" Jeff Stone of IndieWire wrote in his review, \\"It was miserable, and tedious, and made me feel bad. Not in an emotionally compelling way, just in a 'I could be watching something of value' way\\", and he graded the episode D-. Kristi Turnquist of The Oregonian was also critical: \\"The most shocking reveal was just how low executive producer and showrunner Scott M. Gimple and \\"Walking Dead\\" comics creator Robert Kirkman are willing to go for the sake of sensationalism and torture porn.\\" Other critics reviewed the episode positively. John Saavedra of Den of Geek! gave it four out of five stars: \\"Anyone hoping for an incredibly bloody hour of murder and mutilation the likes of which we'd never seen before on The Walking Dead should be pretty pleased with the season 7 premiere\\". Steve Wright of SciFiNow gave the episode a five-out-of-five rating in his review: \\"Sometimes, shows need a game- changing moment to jolt the formula and stop things from getting samey. If any show was in such dire need of one, it was The Walking Dead, and it has definitely got that. Welcome back.\\" Mick van Hesteren of IGN Benelux rated it 10 out of 10 and called it a \\"masterpiece\\". In reaction to the criticism about the amount of violence in the episode, executive producer Gale Anne Hurd said that in light of the negative feedback, they tamed some of the more gruesome scenes that were in episodes being filmed for the second half of the season. Hurd said that \\"this is not a show that‚Äôs torture porn‚Ä¶.Let‚Äôs make sure we don‚Äôt cross that line\\". Executive producers Scott M. Gimple and Greg Nicotero countered this, stating that the violence in this episode was purposely over- the-top for the narrative, as that the \\"awfulness of what happened to the characters was very specific to that episode and the beginning of this whole new story\\", but that it did not reflect a baseline of violence they wanted for the series. =Ratings= The episode received an 8.4 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic range, with 17.03 million total viewers. It was the most-watched series of the night, with its second-best ratings.

These shallow aquifers are not connected as a whole, body of water, but narrow glacial deposits unified by a common geologic history. Geological significance The basins are filled with unconsolidated to poorly consolidated Tertiary and Quaternary deposits as much as 16,000 feet thick and are separated by Archean to Quaternary bedrock. Unconsolidated and semi- consolidated sand and gravel aquifers have a high conductivity and are largely shallow, small and unmapped. There are four types of these unconsolidated aquifers, \\"valley-fill aquifers\\"; blanket sand and gravel aquifers; glacial- deposit aquifers; and stream-valley aquifers. There are 70 intermontane watersheds in this area of 80,000 square miles. The alluvial and glacial deposits found in this region are generally known for being productive, shallow aquifers. Human significance These aquifers are close to the surface, and have a high hydraulic conductivity, so they are at a high risk for pollution. Known pollutants in this area are arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc due to mining activities coupled with elevated levels of phosphorus and nitrogen due to agriculture activities. Water withdrawals from the aquifer region are derived 80% from surface water, 20% groundwater; however 60% of domestic, commercial and municipal water supply comes from groundwater.

It sought to move the role of supporting the impoverished away from government and religious organizations and into the hands of Charity Organization Societies (COS). These Societies claimed the altruistic goals of lifting the poor out of poverty through the means of education and employment, and did make some strides to help young children involved in immoral underaged labor practices. However when it came to the COS's treatment of the \\"defective class\\" as they were labeled (insane, feeble- minded, blind, crippled, maimed, deaf and dumb, epileptic, criminal types, prostitutes, drug addicts, and alcoholics), the Scientific Charity Movement's other goals based in the popular post civil war social scientific theories of eugenics and social Darwinism came to light. Many of these \\"defective classes\\" were moved from the streets and into insane asylums where they were often experimented on by scientists of the time.  Overview  = Founders = The Scientific Charity Movement was born after the Panic of 1873, which was a collapse of the postwar economic boom from the American Civil War as well as the Franco-Prussian War that concluded in 1871. This led to the failure of American banks and financial panic that ultimately began an economic depression. The response from the white economic elites at the time, as agitation grew within the poor and working classes, resulted in a new social reform that attacked welfare and promoted rigorous, data-driven systems to acknowledge the ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù poor from the ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù. Two of the biggest advocates for moving Charity Organization Societies to the United States were Josephine Lowell and S. Humphreys Gurteen. Lowell had been raised by a radical abolitionist family and firmly believed that idleness was one of the largest causes of poverty. She believed that before someone should be allowed to receive aid they should first be required to complete a labor test of some basic task like cutting wood. She was opposed to local governments giving relief as well as almsgiving and stated that the best way to help the poor was to \\"help them help themselves\\". Gurteen, an English-born son of an Anglican preacher, is often attributed to bringing Charity Organization Societies to the United States. He was in support of consolidating already-existing groups who were providing aid and inspections in which COS agents would investigate those seeking aid to determine if they were faking or if they actually needed the aid. = The movement's role in ending poorhouses = Poorhouses and workhouses were tax-supported residential institutions where those who could not support themselves were sent to work as an alternative to welfare systems then known as \\"outdoor relief.\\" Poorhouses arose before the Scientific Charity Movement arrived in the US. While some members of the movement were in favor of the poorhouses, the Scientific Charity Movement had an instrumental role in the ending of the poorhouses. They were also responsible for the banning of children being allowed in the poorhouses. As time went on the safety net provided by progressive era reforms (many of which were supported by the Charity organization societies), helped to keep more people out of the poorhouses and eventually they were phased out or converted into nursing homes for the elderly or disabled. Many of the poorhouses laid the groundwork for orphanages general hospitals, and mental hospitals later on and while many of those in the poorhouses were able to reenter society, however those deemed unfit were moved to the asylums. The Invention of Casework The idea and procedure of impoverished family ‚Äúcases‚Äù and ‚Äúcasework‚Äù was established under the Scientific Charity Movement. Using the ideas of eugenics and the new technique of in-depth investigation and interviews as a means of social control, caseworkers were tasked with sorting through and categorizing impoverished people into two separate classes. This idea of the ‚Äúdeserving‚Äù versus the ‚Äúundeserving‚Äù was treated as a hereditary division and often was racially biased, treating African American poverty as a separate issue from white poverty and proving to be more willing to offer resources to white impoverished people than to African American impoverished people. = Asylums = The asylums created by the Charity Organization Societies are the source of much of the criticism of the Scientific Charity Movement. Their purpose was to remove the \\"defective classes\\" from society. Members of society who were classified as the \\"defective class\\" were placed in asylums most of which were made of the remnants of the poorhouses. These asylums had been founded as a means to remove the defective classes, based on the idea of social Darwinism, from the genepool. Some of these asylums allowed their residents to be experimented on by scientists of the time. Many of these asylums would continue on long after the Scientific Charity Movement was over and into the late 1960s.  Reception  The Scientific Charity Movement is often seen as a dark spot in the history of American welfare reform due to their creation of asylums, classification of defectives, and social Darwinist views. On the other hand, the Scientific Charity Movement improved on many of the previous welfare systems in place, including their work against the poorhouses which were eventually abolished in 1935, and their involvement in rights of workers and removing young children from the workforce. They also are responsible for laying the groundwork for many of the reforms which came about during the Great Depression. In July 2016, Jeff Kaufman wrote a blog post comparing elements of the Scientific Charity Movement to those of effective altruism, a more recent movement that also applies a scientific mindset to charity.

It has rough, tessellated brown bark on the trunk and branches, a crown of juvenile, heart-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white flowers and urn-shaped to shortened spherical fruit. Description Corymbia setosa is a tree that typically grows to a height of , rarely as a thick-trunked mallee, and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, deeply tessellated brownish bark on the trunk and branches and a sparse canopy. Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile, heart-shaped leaves that are long and wide arranged in opposite pairs and with a rough surface. The crown of the tree has sessile, juvenile mostly heart- shaped, stem-clasping leaves that are the same shade of dull light green to greyish green on both sides, long and wide and arranged in opposite pairs. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, long and wide with a beaked operculum. Flowering has been observed in June, September and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming This eucalypt was first formally described in 1843 by Johannes Conrad Schauer in Walpers' book Repertorium Botanices Systematicae and given the name Eucalyptus setosa from specimens collected by Ferdinand Bauer. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia setosa. The specific epithet (setosa) is from the Latin word setosus meaning \\"bristly\\". In the same journal, Hill and Johnson described two subspecies, pedicellaris and subspecies setosa but the names are not accepted by the Australian Plant Census. Distribution and habitat Corymbia setosa grows on rocky hills and red sandy plains, but not extending to wet tropical areas. It is found from Tennant Creek, Northern Territory, Daly Waters and the Barkly Tableland in the Northern Territory and east into the Gulf of Carpentaria hinterland and islands, to the Musgrave area of Cape York Peninsula and as far south as Barcaldine in Queensland. In a woodland setting, associated species include Erythrophleum chlorostachys, Eucalyptus foelscheana, Xanthostemon paradoxus, Eucalyptus confertiflora and Eucalyptus latifolia in the overstorey and Grevillea decurrens, Gardenia megasperma and Calytrix exstipulata in the sparsely vegetated understorey.

The act \\"facilitated removing California Indians from their traditional lands, separating at least a generation of children and adults from their families, languages, and cultures (1850 to 1865). This California law provided for \\"apprenticing\\" or indenturing Indian children and adults to Whites, and also punished \\"vagrant\\" Indians by \\"hiring\\" them out to the highest bidder at a public auction if the Indian could not provide sufficient bond or bail.\\" It was amended in 1860. Although the California legislature repealed parts of the statute after the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished involuntary servitude, it was not repealed in its entirety until 1937. The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians is in line with other laws passed in the state of California during this time, such as the Greaser Act in 1855 and the Foreign Miners' Tax Act of 1850 (repealed in 1851 and reinstated in 1852). One point to note is the act created legal slavery of native Americans in California even though California was admitted to the union as a free state in 1850. Free as in no black slavery allowed. However, this did not stop governor Peter Hardeman Burnett from signing the law and instituting it fully knowing it would state-sanction genocide. He explained in his Governor's speech from January 6th, 1851 \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected,‚Äù.

The soundtrack was released on October 7, 2016, digitally and with a vinyl release by Mondo. Younge and Muhammad were asked to join the series by showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker, and strove to write a score inspired by hip hop. They were given a full orchestra to record the score with. In addition to their music, the soundtrack includes songs from various artists that gave onscreen performances during the season, including the original song \\"Bulletproof Love\\" featuring Method Man, which was also released before the album as a single. Background In April 2016, Luke Cage showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker revealed that Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad were composing the series' score, describing it as \\"a '90s hip-hop vibe\\" with \\"a lot of different musical appearances\\". Younge and Muhammad spotted each episode together with the episode's director, then went off and worked on certain cues each, though the two did work on some cues together. Marvel Television, Netflix, and ABC were extremely supportive of Younge and Muhammad's artistic process after hearing their first work for the series (the duo started by composing the bookending music of the second episode), asking them to \\"push\\" the sound of the score as far as they could, and allowing them the use of a full, 30-piece orchestra for recording. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and recorded and mixed at Raphael Saadiq's studio. Marvel did criticize the initial theme music that Younge and Muhammad wrote for the series, which was inspired by the \\"British library music\\" of Alan Tew. Coker wanted to use the music, but the studio felt that it was too slow to play over the opening credits. They eventually agreed to use the music for the closing credits of each episode, and wrote a piece closer to \\"classic\\" theme music for the opening. They still made this \\"more funky, and kind of crazy\\" compared to traditional themes, and Marvel praised it. For Younge, it was important that the music for the series be recorded using analog technologies, comparing it to the music of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder where \\"you don‚Äôt like it just because it‚Äôs composed well. You don‚Äôt like it just because they have great voices. You like it because of the way it makes you feel, sonically ... the deep, organic, soulful sound waves in it.\\" He felt that music produced digitally could not replicate this quality and would be \\"cutting corners\\". The series features onscreen performances by various artists, which Coker wanted to use to help capture the vibe of the neighborhood. Several of these songs are included on the soundtrack album, including the single \\"Bulletproof Love\\", featuring Method Man, an original rap song featured in the episode \\"Soliloquy of Chaos\\". The track was arranged by Younge and Muhammad, and includes much of the socio-political commentary that showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker wished to convey throughout the series. The track \\"Requiem for Phife\\", which is used in one of the biggest scenes of the series, was written by Muhammad as a tribute to his fellow A Tribe Called Quest member Malik \\"Phife Dawg\\" Taylor, who died while Muhammad was working on the score. Track listing All music by Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, except where noted. Release In July 2016, Coker revealed plans for a vinyl soundtrack album for the series, to be produced by Younge and Muhammad. On September 30, \\"Bulletproof Love\\" was released digitally as a single alongside the release of the television series on Netflix. On October 6, Younge and Muhammad held a concert at the Theatre at Ace Hotel, Los Angeles, with a 40-piece orchestra conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson performing their score for the series. Hosted by Russell Peters and Wayne Brady, the event also featured an opening DJ set by No I.D. Younge and Muhammad had wanted to perform the score live since they first began working on the project, and the producers agreed after hearing the completed music. The full soundtrack album was released on October 7, digitally and on vinyl. The vinyl release from Mondo was pressed on \\"Power Man Yellow\\" colored vinyl, with collectible artwork by Matthew Woodson. On October 8, Mondo announced that its entire initial pressing of the release had already been sold out, to be shipped at the end of the month. Further orders would begin shipping in late November. Additionally, Mondo will release posters of Woodson's art on November 10, screen prints \\"featuring a layer of spot varnish to bring different elements of the illustration to life.\\" References External links *Luke Cage Soundtrack - Amazon Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe soundtracks Category:Hollywood Records soundtracks Category:Marvel Music soundtracks Category:Television soundtracks Category:2016 soundtrack albums Soundtrack ","title":"Luke Cage (soundtrack)"},{"id":"51942014","text":"Boaz Tsaban (born February 1973) is an Israeli mathematician on the faculty of Bar-Ilan University.

Little Square) is a cobbled public square located in the Indre By neighborhood in Aarhus, Denmark. It is situated between the squares of Store Torv and Immervad in the historic Latin Quarter neighborhood and it is one of the oldest public squares in Aarhus. The streets of Vestergade, Guldsmedgade, Immervad and Badstuegade radiates from Lille Torv. It is today a venue for public events and gatherings in the city. The square is home to some notable buildings such as the storied Meulengracht's House and the listed Business- and Agricultural Bank of Jutland.  History  Little Square was originally a swampy area outside the city walls of the medieval town. In c. 1200, the area was drained and in 1250 Little Square was established where major thoroughfares met. When Little Square had been established the street of Immervad was created, crossing the Aarhus River. The square today has roughly the same dimensions and proportions as when it was initially created in 1250. The name \\"Lille Torv\\" was applied to the square in the 1700s whereas it had previously been known as Gammeltorv (Old Square) or simply \\"Torvet\\" (The Square). Since the 1200s, Little Square, along with Great Square, has been one of the primary market squares in Aarhus. Weekly markets were held here up until the 1800s when farmers and traders from the catchment areas around the town would gather here and trade. In 1896, the city council closed the St. Oluf's Market and in the years after the rest of the markets in the city closed as traffic gradually increased and took over the public spaces. In 1904, electrical trams started operating in Aarhus and Little Square became a hub where tram lines would intersect and trams would stop for breaks. Buses and trams had to negotiate Lille Torv to get through the narrow, curved streets of Guldsmedgade and Klostergade, eventually confining pedestrians to sidewalks. In the late 1990s, the Aarhus River was reopened, removing the former street of √Öboulevarden that covered it in the process. In connection with this project it no longer made sense to have motorized traffic at Little Square and it again became the domain of pedestrians.  Notable buildings  \\"Det Hvide Pal√¶\\" (The White Mansion), showpiece of the Meulengracht Complex. The central location of the square and the markets formerly held here meant it was a desirable location for merchants to establish themselves. Little Square is therefore home to several notable and storied merchant mansions. Meulengracht's House with address on Lille Torv 2 was built by the merchant Harboe Meulengracht in the late 1700s and was for a time the social focal point for the high society and even royalty. Today Meulengracht's House is home to stores. The Business- and Agricultural Bank of Jutland (Danish: Jysk Handels- og Landbrugsbank) is a listed building by the architect Sophus Frederik K√ºhnel featuring architecture relatively unique to Aarhus. Previously the square was also home to the Mayor's House (Borgmesterg√•rden) which was moved to Tangkrogen during the Danish National Exhibition of 1909 and afterwards to the Botanical Gardens where it became the first building in the Old Town Museum.

Proposition 55 will raise tax revenue by between $4 billion and $9 billion a year. Half of funds will go to schools and community colleges, up to $2 billion a year would go to Medi-Cal, and up to $1.5 billion will be saved and applied to debt. History California voters passed temporary sales and income tax increases with Proposition 30 in 2012. During the temporary tax, California's top 1% of earners paid half of the state's income-taxes and contributed one third of its budget. Since the 2012 tax increase, California's tax revenues have grown by nearly 30%, with roughly two thirds of the money going to schools. Proposition 55 allowed the sales tax increase to expire as planned, while maintaining the increased income tax rates and extended them through 2030. Governor Jerry Brown, who was the primary proponent of the tax increase in 2012, remained neutral on Proposition 55. Campaigning Proponents spent $58.6 million fighting for the measure, with the top donor being $25 million from a hospital trade association. An additional $20 million was donated by the California Teachers Association, with other top donors including the Service Employees International Union, and the California School Employees Association. The measure was supported by the editorial boards of The Sacramento Bee and The Mercury News. Opponents spent $3,000 fighting against the measure. The California Chamber of Commerce, who were neutral on the 2012 tax increase, opposed Proposition 55. The measure was opposed by the editorial boards of the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and The Wall Street Journal. Results A September 2016 poll by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that 54% of likely voters supported Proposition 55, 38% opposed it, and 8% did not know how they would vote. Proposition 55 was approved by voters in the November general election, with 63% voting yes.

While recorded by Duncan in the same bedroom studio as his previous album, Architect (2015), as well as having the same baroque pop sound, The Midnight Sun has a more polished sound due to Duncan upgrading his studio, contains more electronic music elements, is more consistent stylistically, and has a darker tone and atmosphere inspired by Rod Serling's television The Twilight Zone. Released in October 2016 by FatCat Records, it landed at number 28 on the Scottish Albums Chart, was well-received by critics and was a shortlist nominee for the Scottish Album of the Year Award. Production Duncan said that shortly after the release of his first album Architect (2015), he wanted to finish a second album quickly simply to keep busy with tours: \\"I thought I might as well just get the ideas down for the second album when they came, instead of wasting time for the sake of it.\\"Matthews, Nammie (2 January 2017). \\"BN1 Chats with‚Ä¶ C Duncan\\". BN!. Retrieved 17 June 2018. Like Architect, The Midnight Sun was written and produced by Duncan in his Glasgow bedroom studio. Due to his experience learning recording equipment with Architect, which took more than a year to finish, Duncan was able to complete The Midnight Sun in only three months. Duncan initially planned for his second record to be a Burt Bacharach- esque easy listening album, where he used a more professional studio and hired a string quartet. However, in the end, he decided to record in the same studio as the one used for Architect at the same low budget: \\"I got so used to having really limited access to things. So I wanted to do that for the second album, but without it sounding [the same].\\" The Midnight Sun has a more polished sound due to Duncan upgrading the equipment he used after completing Architect. He upgraded his Macbook, the audio interface he used, where he went from a TASCAM US-122 he used for ten years to Focusrite's Clarett 2Pre interface, and the monitor he mixed on, going from RHA headphones to KRK VXT4 monitors.Robertson, Derek (16 November 2016). \\"Planet Gear: C Duncan / In Depth\\".

Duncan claimed he put hidden compositional references to other songs on The Midnight Sun: the pitch of \\"The Last to Leave\\"'s melody follows the direction of \\"Edelweiss,\\" a show tune from The Sound of Music, and Duncan used elements of the melodies in William Walton's piece Belshazzar's Feast for the songs \\"Who Lost\\" and \\"Jupiter.\\" Juan Edgardo Rodriguez of PopMatters called the album more pop-oriented than Architect, which he compared to Kevin Parker's direction into pop on his Tame Impala album Currents (2015), and noted that Duncan plays around with elements of pop on the album. The Midnight Sun was inspired by the atmosphere and format of Rod Serling's television The Twilight Zone, which is why the album is titled after the tenth episode of the show's third season.\\"The Midnight Sun\\". FatCat Records Official Website. Retrieved 29 April 2018. The Twilight Zone inspired Duncan to make an \\"anthology series styled album\\" where, despite each song being different conceptually, the atmospheres and styles of each songs connect together, creating a cohesive listen. This departed from his previous album Architect (2015), which mixed together elements from a bunch of genres and, to Duncan, felt like a \\"collection of songs\\" rather than an actual LP. In terms of tone, The Midnight Sun is also more ominous than Architect. The place Duncan was living in while he made the album was Glasgow, where during the summer, nighttime lasts for only three to four hours. This had a \\"claustrophobic, mysterious and unnerving\\" effect on his mental state that he related to the tone of The Twilight Zone, so he incorporated that into The Midnight Sun. Lyrics The Midnight Sun's dark character is further enforced by its lyrics, which deal with relationship issues, depression, and other situations Duncan went through. \\"Like You Do\\" is a song about a depression that one of Duncan's friends was suffering from while he recorded the album.Day, Laurence (6 October 2016). \\"Track By Track: C Duncan on The Midnight Sun\\".

The themes of \\"Other Side\\" were influenced by his desire to be outside of his hometown as a result of enjoying his experience touring other nations. \\"Who Lost\\" is a song about other people in someone's life making his rivalry between him and a sibling pointless. It is based on Duncan's childhood experiences with his brother. \\"Last to Leave\\" is, according to Duncan, a map of a failed relationship he had with a former partner. Duncan said \\"Do I Hear\\" is about getting into someone else's lifestyle while \\"being yourself and coping with and embracing your quirks, sexuality, and character.\\" \\"Jupiter,\\" in Duncan's word, is a \\"romanticised\\" version of a \\"strange\\" experience he had in a gay boat party he went to after performing in Hamburg in 2015; he called it \\"a euphoric song, yet slimy and unnerving.\\" The LP closes with \\"Window,\\" a realization that someone feels better once he's figured out his problems. Artwork Duncan painted the cover art for The Midnight Sun in between making each track. The artwork is a painting of a stairwell in his flat, and he spent \\"fifteen times a day\\" viewing the stairwell he was painting.

Established in 2004 by the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation through gaming revenues, it is located on the Sycuan Indian Reservation near El Cajon.  History  In the 1971, D-Q University was founded by American Indian Ph.D. Jack Forbes (Lenape), and other educational leaders such as David Risling (Hoopa). D-Q University was a partnership between American Indian and Chicano educators and activists during the tumultuous protest years of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Once established, D-Q University was the only American Indian college in California, and one of the first six American Indian colleges in the United States. Starting in the 1990s, thanks to the visionary commitment to higher education by Kumeyaay Elder Hank Murphy and his wife Shirley Apple Murphy (Oglala Lakota) a D-Q University satellite campus was established on the Sycuan Reservation, which was the home of the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation. A number of excellent courses were offered at that time, including Yuman philosophy, Kumeyaay Bird Songs, English as a Second Language, Math, Fire Sciences for the Sycuan Fire Department, and of course the Kumeyaay language. As a result of a Bureau of Indian Affairs, technicality involving an American Indian-to-Chicano student ratio, and financial issues, the Bureau of Indian Affairs pulled the funding base away from D-Q University and by 2005 it had shut down. However, there is a new D-Q University Board of Trustees, and there are efforts to reestablish D-Q University as a viable institution. When D-Q University fell into disarray for a lack of funding, plans were underway at Sycuan to start a Kumeyaay College. The possibility of a Kumeyaay College was envisioned for decades by Florence Shipek, Ph.D., whom is an ethnohistorian who worked closely with the Kumeyaay and Luiseno nations for many decades. She foresaw the possibility of bequeathing her life's work to the Kumeyaay Nation and she sent letters to all the Kumeyaay tribal chairmen expressing the need for a Kumeyaay college that would promote the revitalization of Kumeyaay language, culture, and philosophy. Given that Sycuan was the only place in the Kumeyaay territory that had been offering college classes, it was understood that the Shipek Collection would end up at Sycuan. However, in order to fulfill the wishes of Dr. Shipek, a Kumeyaay College had to be established as a condition of the Kumeyaay Nation receiving the Shipek Archives Collection. A Sycuan Tribal Council Resolution for Kumeyaay Community College was passed in 2004, which led to the founding of the Kumeyaay Community College and the establishment of the Kumeyaay Community College Board of Trustees that same year. The transfer of the Shipek Collection occurred in 2005, and today it forms the basis of the Kumeyaay Community College Library and Archives. Kumeyaay Community College has Board Members from eight Reservations of the Kumeyaay Nation. In 2006 Kumeyaay Community College added additional courses and with a partnership with Cuyamaca Community College had established a Kumeyaay Studies Certificate. Recently a new Kumeyaay Studies Degree is being offered through the partnership with Cuyamaca College.  Bio  Kumeyaay Community College promotes a quality education for the Kumeyaay Nation, Diegue√±o Nation, California Native American Indians, and other individuals interested in a unique and supportive educational experience.

She wrote a large number of guide books to major cities and several cookbooks but her major works are translations of Russian novels. In particular, she is remembered for her translation into Swedish of Fyodor Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov. Biography Born on 27 February 1885 in Norrk√∂ping, Rydelius was the daughter of Per Axel Rydelius, a merchant, and Anna Vilhelmina Str√∂m. After matriculating from Stockholm's Lyceum f√∂r flickor (girls high school) in 1903, she graduated in English and Romance languages at Uppsala University. Thereafter she spent half a year in Russia studying the language, returning home when her father died. She went on to earn her living as a journalist, working for the two main national daily newspapers, Svenska Dagbladet and Dagens Nyheter before turning freelance. In 1910, she began a highly successful career as a translator, creating Swedish versions of the works of Russian novelists including Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekhov. She also translated from English, French and Italian, including works by Arnold Bennett, Grazia Deledda and John Galsworthy. She married Sven Harald W√§gner, also a journalist, in 1911 but his death in 1925 only reinforced her desire to work. The couple had been separated since 1922. She began to write an extensive series of travel guides in a personalized style, creating Swedish classics such as Rom p√• 8 dagar (Rome in 8 Days, 1927), Paris p√• 8 dagar (1928) and Berlin p√• 8 dagar (1929). Other cities she wrote travel guides about include Prague, Budapest and Vienna.http://www.vagabond.se/artiklar/artiklar/20161122/kvinnliga-historiska- resenarer/ Her daughter Ria W√§gner travelled together with her. In the 1940s, when travel was no longer possible, she turned to cookbooks, building on the gastronomic summaries in her guides. They included Billiga dagar i franskt k√∂k (Cheap Days in French Cooking, 1940) and Billiga dagar i italienskt k√∂k (Cheap Days in Italian Cooking, 1941). Finally, she wrote historical works about Russia, books about Swedish women, and two autobiographical works.

It is 40.0 km in diameter and was named after Auki, a town in the Solomon Islands, in 2015 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN). Auki Crater has a central peak. Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Strong evidence for hydrothermalism was reported by a team of researchers studying Auki. This crater contains ridges that may have been produced after fractures formed with an impact. Using instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter they found the minerals smectite, silica, zeolite, serpentine, carbonate, and chlorite that are common in impact-induced hydrothermal systems on Earth.Carrozzo, F. et al. 2017.

This heat can result in new minerals from hydrothermal circulation. On Earth impact craters have resulted in useful minerals. Some of the ores produced from impact related effects on Earth include ores of iron, uranium, gold, copper, and nickel. It is estimated that the value of materials mined from impact structures is 5 billion dollars/year just for North America.Grieve, R., V. Masaitis. 1994. The Economic Potential of Terrestrial Impact Craters. International Geology Review: 36, 105-151. While nothing may be found on Mars that would justify the high cost of transport to Earth, the more necessary ores future colonists can obtain from Mars, the easier it would be to build colonies on the Red Planet.

It is a ministry-independent department-level government agency, reporting directly to the prime minister. The National Office of Buddhism is responsible for state administration of the religion, including the development of Phuttamonthon as a religious center. Religious affairs are handled by a Sangha Supreme Council of monks. NOB, together with the Sangha, sponsors Thailand's overseas Buddhist missionary policy and activities.  History  Traditionally, the government of Thailand administered matters of religion and public education together under the Ministry of Public Institution, whose name was changed to the Ministry of Education in a 1943 reform, which also established the Department of Religious Affairs within the ministry. Another reform in 2002 moved the Department of Religious Affairs to the Ministry of Culture and split part of its responsibilities to create the independent National Office of Buddhism. Corruption The head of the National Office of Buddhism, Pongporn Pramsaneh, a former policeman who joined the organization in February 2017, vowed to reform Thailand's 37,075 temples by forcing them to open their financial accounts to the public. The temples receive an estimated US$3.5 billion a year in donations. The government provides a further 4.67 billion baht (US$137 million) to support temples and their more than 300,000 monks. In August 2017 Pongporn was dismissed from his position after Buddhist groups called on the government to sack him over his plans to clean up monasteries. In September 2017 Pongporn was reinstated. His reinstatement followed a police decision to bring charges against four senior monks in connection with temple funds embezzlement. The alleged wrongdoings have since broadened to include officials of the National Office of Buddhism who are alleged to have worked with senior monks in charge of at least 45 temples in Bangkok and other provinces to embezzle more than 270 million baht in state funding. at least one Thai Buddhist organization is again calling for Pongporn's ouster, claiming that, \\"...laymen did not have the power to rule over monks.\\" There are signs, however, of growing opposition to clerical independence. As an editorial in the Bangkok Post put it, \\"...temple donations must be transparent and open to independent auditing. The government must also make temples stand on their own feet. No more financial support; no more privileges.\\" A former head of the NOB, Panom Sornsilp, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on 27 December 2019 after being found guilty by the Criminal Court of corruption in connection with temple funds. In May 2020, his sentence was increased to 94 years. Sentenced with him, on similar charges, was Wasawat Kittithirasith, the former director of the Office of Temple Renovation and Development and Religious Welfare. Two others, who served as brokers, approached temples and offered to help them secure funding from the Office of Buddhism for temple renovation in return for a 75% under-the-table commission. They were sentenced to six years and eight months and one year and eight months. The temple fund scam dates from 2017, when the abbot of Wat Takaela in Phetchaburi Province filed a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Police Command seeking an investigation. His temple was allocated 10 million baht by the NOB for renovation, but he was told to return the bulk of the money to the officials who helped to secure the funding. The scam worked by having unofficial brokers, with connections to NOB officials, tell the abbots that they could arrange funding for renovations, but only on the condition that they return three-quarters of the money to the officials and use what remained for renovation. Several temple abbots joined in the scam and pocketed temple funds, spending none on temple renovation. Thailand's National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) in January 2020 requested that the Office of the Attorney- General file charges against Nopparat Benjawattananan and seven other persons with the Criminal Court for Corruption and Misconduct. Nopparat, former head of the NOB, amassed assets worth about 575 million baht during his four-year tenure, a sum the NACC says is not proportionate to his income. In May 2020, five former NOB officials were convicted of embezzling 21 million baht from the NOB in 2015. Four were sentenced to 13 years in prison, one for four years, and all must repay the stolen funds.

It is a ground orchid with a single narrow, hairy leaf and a thin wiry stem usually bearing one short-lived mauve to pink flower. Description Caladenia bartlettii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb, sometimes solitary or in groups of up to ten individuals. It has an underground tuber and a single hairy, narrow linear leaf up to long, wide and dark purplish or reddish-green. One, sometimes two flowers up to in diameter are borne on a thin, sparsely hairy, wiry spike, high. The sepals and petals are a dark magenta colour shading to white in the lower parts. The dorsal sepal is erect and the lateral sepals are elliptic in shape with a rounded end and are slightly larger than the petals. The labellum has three lobes with red stripes, the mid-lobe triangular in shape, curled under and dark yellow with a wavy edge. There are two rows of bright yellow-tipped calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from October to December but the flowers are self-pollinating and only last for a few days. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1949 by Edwin Hatch as a variety of Caladenia carnea and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand. The name was changed to Caladenia bartlettii in 1997. The specific epithet (bartlettii) honours Francis (Frank) William Bartlett (1896-1979) of Silverdale, \\"whose knowledge of the gumlands flora has made his home the mecca of Auckland enthusiasts for many years\\". Distribution and habitat This caladenia grows in shady places in poor soil, always in forests dominated by kauri trees. It is found on both the North and South Island of New Zealand.

The Proposition allows parole consideration for nonviolent felons, changes policies on juvenile prosecution, and authorizes sentence credits for rehabilitation, good behavior, and education.  The proposition  Due to the approval of the proposition, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation will begin to implement these new parole and sentencing provisions. The passage and implementation of the proposition may allow the state to save tens of millions of dollars each year. Proposition 57 allows the parole board to release nonviolent prisoners once they have served the full sentence for their primary criminal offense. Previously, prisoners were often required to serve extra time by a sentence enhancement, such as those for repeated offenders. In addition, Proposition 57 requires the Department of Corrections to develop uniform parole credits, which reward prisoners' good behavior with reduced sentences. This proposition allows juvenile court judges to determine whether or not juveniles aged fourteen and older should be prosecuted and sentenced as an adult, repealing California Proposition 21, which was passed in March 2000. Proposition 21 gave prosecutors the sole authority to decide whether to try a young offender as a juvenile or adult. Proposition 57‚Äôs proponents sought to restore juvenile court judges‚Äô authority over juvenile offenders. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has been under federal court supervision since the Supreme Court of the United States found that California‚Äôs prison overcrowding constitutes cruel and unusual punishment (Brown v. Plata, 2011). Governor Brown added to Proposition 57, amending the Constitution of California to reduce this overcrowding.  Proponents  Proponents of the measure spent $11.75 million. The top contribution was $4.14 million raised by Governor Brown. Other proponents responsible for significant contributions included the California Democratic Party, Tom Steyer, Reed Hastings, and the Open Philanthropy Project. The measure was also supported by the editorial boards of the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and The Sacramento Bee.  Opponents  Opponents of the Proposition argued that it would release potentially dangerous criminals due to improper classification of crimes as non-violent. Opponents of the Proposition spent $641,326 fighting against the measure. Opponents that made high contributions included Los Angeles County police unions and a prosecutor lobbying group.

Proposition 58 repealed bilingual education restrictions enacted by Proposition 227 in 1998. Proposition 58 passed by a wide margin. It preserves the requirement that public schools ensure students obtain an English language proficiency, require school districts to solicit parent/community input in developing language acquisition programs, require instruction to ensure English acquisition as rapidly and effectively as possible, and authorize school districts to establish dual‚Äìlanguage immersion programs for both native and non‚Äìnative English speakers. After the passage of Proposition 227 in 1998, students were required to be taught in an English- only environment, where the student was taught English by a teacher who only speaks English. Proposition 227 also required limited English proficient students who were in separate classes to be put into regular classes, ended bilingual programs, and required students to be taught in an English-only environment. Under Proposition 58, the public school systems will have the right to choose the way they see as appropriate for their students to learn English more swiftly. Students will now have the option to be taught in an English-only environment, or a bilingual environment, where a person of the student's native language teaches them English. This also allows English speaking students to learn in another language. A California Department of Education spokesperson anticipated a shortage of bilingual teachers under Proposition 58. The number of bilingual credentials had fallen after Proposition 227's passage.

The proposition failed to pass. Proposition 60 would have allowed any California resident to sue a pornographer and obtain their personal information. Frivolous lawsuits and actor safety were a major concern, as well as millions of taxpayer dollars it would cost to enforce. Enforcement of Proposition 60 was predicted to cost more than $1 million annually. State and local governments were predicted to lose tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue per year if the industry left the state. If the state decided not to defend Proposition 60's constitutionality in court, the measure would have empowered its sole sponsor, Michael Weinstein of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, to defend the measure himself. Weinstein's legal expenses would have been paid by the state and he could only be removed by a majority vote of both houses of the California State Legislature. These provisions were included in response to the United States Supreme Court ruling in Hollingsworth v. Perry that only state employees have standing to defend state ballot propositions in federal court. Proposition 60 was similar to Measure B, passed by Los Angeles voters in 2012, which resulted in a large drop in permit filings for pornography shoots. Proposition 60 would have required adult film performers to use condoms during filming of sexual intercourse, and required producers to pay for performer vaccinations, testing, and medical examinations, and to post the condom requirement at film sites. Additionally, producers would have been required to renew their adult film licenses every two years as well as contact Cal/OSHA if and when a film was being made. The statewide California pornography industry employs 2,000 people. Pornography in California is estimated to be a $9 billion industry. California law already requires all workers to use protection against infectious bodily fluids, and the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration has already interpreted the statute to require porn actors to wear condoms. In early 2016 rulemaking, Cal/OSHA drafted detailed regulation requiring condom use but it was withdrawn after widespread industry criticism.

This book is one of the Five Megillot, a collection of short books, together with Book of Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther, within the Ketuvim, the third and the last part of the Hebrew Bible.

Text A handwritten Hebrew scroll of the Song of Songs by the scribe Elihu Shannon of Kibbutz Saad, Israel (circa 2005). The original text is written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 17 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, assigned as 6Q6 (6QCant; 50 CE; extant verses 1-7).Dead sea scrolls - Song of Songs. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), and Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century).

The speaker is a woman as definitely established in verse 5 from the adjectival form shehora (\\"black\\"). Verses 2‚Äì4 contains a 'romantic soliloquy' of a woman about her lover, with two distinctive word-patterns: \\"your_love (or 'lovemaking') more_than_wine\\" (verses 2, 4; Hebrew: , m√Æ-Hebrew Text Analysis: Song of Solomon 1:4. Biblehub) and \\"they love you\\" (verses 3, 4; Hebrew: , '). The first appearance of the first word-pattern is a part of a chiastic structure (verses 2b‚Äì3a): :A. good ::B. your lovemaking ::: C. wine ::: C'. scent ::B'. ointments :A'. good The second chiastic structure of the same word-pattern could be found in verse 4(c‚Äìd). The word for the noun \\"love\\" (') is plural, indicating more that one romantic act, so here \\"lovemaking\\" is a better rendering than a simple word \\"love\\". One Hebrew word (ahebuka) becomes the second word-pattern \\"[they] love you\\" which is used 'twice as the last word of a tricolon' in verses 3 and 4. The root verb \\"love\\" (') is used seven times in the whole book (verses 1:3, 4, 7; 3:1, 2, 3, 4) and always translated in Greek using the same verb 'agapa≈ç' in Septuagint (LXX) (also only seven times in these seven verses of the book). =Verse 3= [The Shulamite] :Because of the fragrance of your good ointments, :Your name is ointment poured forth; :Therefore the virgins love you.

One of the defendants in her 1975 case was represented by Hillary Clinton (then Rodham), which caused controversy when Clinton stood as the Democratic Party candidate in the 2016 US presidential election. Early life Shelton was raised by a single mother in Springdale, Arkansas. 1975 attack and trial In 1975, at age 12, Shelton alleged she was raped by two men in Arkansas. One of the men accused of raping Shelton was 41-year-old defendant Thomas Alfred Taylor whose court-appointed criminal defense lawyer was 27-year-old Hillary Rodham in her first-time appearance as courtroom litigator. In her autobiography, Clinton said she was reluctant to take the case and asked to be let off the case; her account was later confirmed by the prosecutor in the case. At the time, she was working at the legal aid clinic at the University of Arkansas and represented the defendant for free. Taylor pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a minor under the age of 14. Based on court documents obtained by CNN and Clinton's account in her 2003 memoir Living History, Clinton won a plea deal for Taylor, securing a significantly reduced charge and sentence, based on the prosecution's loss of critical pieces of evidence. =Audio recordings= Mid-1980s taped interviews with Clinton by Roy Reed, a reporter for Esquire, were released in 2014 after being found in the archives of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. Reed said \\"She was laughing at the vagaries of the legal system that play out every day across America in one way or another.\\" At one point, she laughed in the interview while recounting that Taylor passed a polygraph test, which she said \\"forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.\\" Reception After Shelton became aware that Clinton had been the criminal defense lawyer of the defendant in her case decades earlier, Shelton stated in 2007 that she herself bore no ill will toward Clinton for having had to act as her assailant's court-appointed criminal defence lawyer in the rape case, saying \\"I have to understand that she was representing Taylor ... Hillary was just doing her job.\\" Later in 2016, Shelton claimed that she had been misquoted in the 2007 interview. She told the Daily Beast in 2014, \\"Hillary Clinton took me through hell.\\" Shelton said, \\"I started seeing where I had really been stomped in the ground. I didn't really know what to do about it. I just figured life would have to go on and I would have to live with it\\". She also said it was after hearing Clinton discussing the case in previously unpublished tapes that she decided to speak out publicly.Seema Mehta, \\"What you need to know about the four women Donald Trump appeared with at a surprise pre-debate event\\", Los Angeles Times, October 9, 2016 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Shelton was interviewed by The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, and set up a GoFundMe page to raise $10,000. On the page, she stated that Clinton had forced her to \\"undergo multiple polygraph tests\\" and \\"was sent for a psychiatric examination\\". However, according to The Washington Post fact-checker, there is no evidence that Clinton played a role in Shelton taking a polygraph test. Shelton did not undergo psychiatric examination: \\"one day after Clinton filed a request for psychiatric exam, it was denied by the judge.\\" After The Washington Post published its fact-check of Shelton's claims, the GoFundMe site removed the text about polygraph tests and psychiatric examinations. During the campaign, Shelton spoke out against Clinton in a surprise press conference held by Donald Trump before the second presidential debate between him and Hillary Clinton. Also attending the conference were Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey.

It would have applied retroactively to existing death sentences and increased the portion of life inmates' wages that may be applied to victim restitution. A September 2016 poll from USC Dornsife / Los Angeles Times showed 51% percent of registered voters in favor of Proposition 62, 40% opposed, and 9% unknown. Proposition 62 was rejected by voters in the November general election, with 46.9% voting to end executions. Proposition 66 was approved by voters in the same election, with 51.1% voting to speed up executions. If voters had passed both Proposition 62 and Proposition 66, then the measure with the most \\"Yes\\" votes would have taken effect. Proposition 62 was estimated to have reduced state spending by $150 million a year. Proponents spent $8.9 million fighting for Proposition 62, with the top contribution being $1.5 million from Stanford University professor Nick McKeown. Other top contributing proponents include Tom Steyer, Reed Hastings, John Doerr, and Paul Graham. The measure was supported by the editorial boards of the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and The Sacramento Bee. Opponents spent $4.4 million fighting against Proposition 62, with the top contribution being $498,303 from the California prison guards‚Äô union. Other top contributing opponents include the California Highway Patrolmen‚Äôs union, and the LAPD police union.  History  After the Supreme Court of California abolished the death penalty in People v. Anderson (1972), California voters restored capital punishment in California with California Proposition 17 (1972). However, since 1978, California has executed only 13 prisoners, while the population on death row has increased to 750. No prisoner has been executed since 2006, when a federal judge put a hold on the lethal injection procedure the state was using. Abolition of the death penalty through California Proposition 34, 2012 was rejected by 52% of voters. The path to the ballot started when Mike Farrell, an American actor and activist, wrote a title and ballot summary on September 15, 2015. A title and summary was then issued by California attorney general's office on November 19, 2015. For a ballot to be qualified, 365,880 valid signatures are needed. On May 2, 2016, petitioners submitted the signatures to county officials. The deadline to submit the required signatures was May 17, 2016. Sponsors of the measure hired PCI Consultants, Inc. to collect signatures for the petition to qualify this measure for the ballot. A total of $3,192,775.30 was spent to collect the 365,880 valid signatures required to put this measure before voters, resulting in a total cost per required signature (CPRS) of $8.73.

Paul Slavens is an American composer and musician based in Denton, Texas. He plays piano and keyboards along with many other instruments, primarily in the Dallas/Fort Worth/Denton area but has toured nationally with several bands including Ten Hands, Baptist Generals, The Travoltas and others. In addition to regularly composing and playing live music, Paul produces a weekly radio show on KXT in Dallas.  Biography J.Paul Slavens was born May 20, 1962 to J. Phil and Marion F. Slavens in Dakota City, Nebraska and graduated from South Sioux City High School. He then attended Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa receiving a BM in Piano Performance. He then moved to Denton, Texas to pursue a Graduate Degree in Computer Aided Music Theory from NTSU (UNT). Musical career =Early years= He began taking piano lessons at age 9 and began composing music almost immediately. His siblings also took lessons and he wrote his first songs with his older sister Karen while still in Jr. High School. Always active in band, choir and theater he won awards for acting in High School and was offered a Theater Scholarship to Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. He decided to pursue music instead and received a BM in Piano Performance in 1984. While at college he performed in a \\"progressive\\" rock band called Onyx for which he composed most of the music. The band played mostly in the Sioux City area opening for bands such as Steppenwolf, Vixen and John Cougar Mellencamp. The group disbanded when Slavens moved to Denton, Texas to study Music Theory and NTSU (UNT). Upon moving to Texas he continued to compose and play in bands. It was in one of these groups named The Gonemen that he met future Ten Hands guitarist Steve Brand. When that group dissolved Brand and Slavens teamed up with Gary Muller, Matt Chamberlain and Mike Dillon to form Ten Hands. =Ten Hands= In 1987, Paul was one of the founding members of Ten Hands, a Denton, Texas-based rock band. Although he completed his course work, activities with Ten Hands kept him from completing his thesis. He played with Ten Hands for nearly a decade, playing frequently throughout the Southwest and releasing several albums for which he was keyboardist, lead vocalist and primary songwriter. Ten Hands and Slavens have released 5 albums and won numerous Dallas Observer Music Awards in various categories. =Solo artist= In 1997 Slavens released an album of piano solo compositions called Absolutes. The Absolutes are piano solo works, often born of improvisations captured initially on computer sequencer and edited later. He created a large body of recorded work throughout the years, although these home recordings were mostly unreleased, until 2016 when he began releasing them on Bandcamp under the title Juvenilia. At present there are 10 albums in this archival series with several more to be released. The music composed and recorded during these years c.1984-94 run the gamut from classical fugues to electronic soundscapes and humorous pieces as well as a large number of songs in various styles. Slavens was also inspired by the jazz music he was exposed to in Denton, NTSU (UNT) being the home of the first University level Jazz Music program in America. He composed a collection of \\"heads\\" called the Texclectic Songbook, and many of the pieces in the collection Alphabet Girls also fall in the jazz category. In the mid 90s Slavens began creating improvisational songs based on audience suggestions, and has created an estimated 2000 songs over the last 2 decades, many recordings exist, although few have been released. Often these songs are humorous in nature and can be quite ribald. In 2014 Slavens teamed up with Danielle Georgiou Dance Group (DGDG) to create the work NICE. It had a sold out run at the Wylie Theater in Dallas Texas. The piece was part of the AT&T; Performing Arts Center‚Äôs Elevator Project, a series highlighting smaller theater and dance companies. It was also performed at the Out of the Loop Festival at the Watertower Theater in Addison TX. An Album of the music is planned for release in 2017. Slavens has also performed his score for the silent movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame at several venues, notably The Dallas Museum of Art, The Greenzone Theater in Dallas, Club Dada in Dallas, The Grapevine Palace Theater in Grapevine Tx and The Cinnabar Theater in Petaluma, CA. The score for the Lon Chaney classic film utilized leit motif, parody and is largely improvisational, it has been performed by groups from 4 to 12 members. Slavens also participated in presentation of a special screening of D. W. Griffith‚Äôs classic silent film WAY DOWN EAST, sponsored by The Lone Star Film Society (LSFS), in partnership with the Kimbell Art Museum, in March 2014. The piece was largely improvisational and was co-created by Buffi Jacobs and Bach Norwood, both members of the music group The Polyphonic Spree. =Green Romance Orchestra= After several of the original members of Ten Hands left the band Slavens and Ten Hands stick player Gary Muller suspended Ten Hands and joined The Green Romance Orchestra, a group put together by former Pearl Jam drummer Dave Abbruzzese. The group put out one full-length release on Emperor Norton Records. =Camera, Voice Talent, Theater and Radio= During this time Slavens was taken on by Kim Dawson Talent Agency in Dallas Texas as an on camera actor and voice talent. Slavens also studied improvisational comedy with former Groundlings member Randy Bennet and became the Musical Director for the Fort Worth improv group Four Day Weekend, with whom he performed for several years before leaving to pursue his own musical improv show. While with Four Day Weekend he produced a live music and improv theater production called The Texclectic Radio Hour and a Half. The show was occasionally sponsored by Dallas NPR affiliate KERA and in 2004 Slavens was taken on as a host for the long-running 90.1 @ Night show on Sunday evenings. Slavens retooled the format to great success. When KERA purchased another station KKXT in 2008 and designated it as a music station, Slavens moved over to that station and the show became The Paul Slavens Show. He still does the show Sunday evenings and has won multiple awards for it. Slavens has performed with many bands and musicians in North Texas including The Baptist Generals (SubPop) and Robert Gomez (Bella Union). He is currently playing with Ten Hands, Baptist Generals and The Travoltas with Dallas musician/producer Salim Nourallah. He is also well known for his unique style of live improvisational song creation which he performs regularly. Discography * Ten Hands: Kung Fu..

It is number W191 in the catalogue of works compiled by David . History Villa-Lobos began work on the Nonet in Rio de Janeiro in 1923, shortly before his first visit to Europe, and completed the score in Paris in September of the same year . It was premiered on 30 May 1924 at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris by an ensemble conducted by the composer. The score is dedicated to Ol√≠via Guedes Penteado . The work marks a fundamental turning point in Villa-Lobos's style to the strongly Brazilian-nationalistic character that dominated his compositions throughout the rest of the 1920s, and in particular those to which he gave the title Ch√¥ros (; ). Instrumentation The nonet is scored for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe, clarinet, alto saxophone (doubling baritone saxophone), bassoon, harp, celesta, piano, and a large percussion battery (requiring at least two players): timpani, tam-tam, bass drum, large bass drum, field drum, side drum, cymbal, bronze and crockery plates, chocalhos (wood and metal), triangle, reco-reco (small and large), pu√≠ta, tambourines (small and large), caxambu, and xylophone. In addition to this instrumental nonet, the score calls for a SAATBarB mixed choir, sometimes divided further into as many a twelve separate parts. Analysis The Nonet is in a single movement and relies for its effect on colouristic and rhythmic devices more than on structural or harmonic elements . The score is multi- sectional and constructed like a mosaic, presenting short melodic and rhythmic fragments superimposed and in rapid succession . There are eight large sections encompassing approximately twenty-five short episodes, though because of the lack of traditional harmony and thematic structure such numbers are rather arbitrary . The result is a rhapsodic, improvisational atmosphere, which is also reflected in the treatment of the voices. Despite its intense nationalism, the harmonic language of the Nonet takes full advantage of the \\"advanced\\" chromatic and quartal dissonant formations of the 1920s, while at the same time showing the strong influence of Debussy . Despite the composer's vehement denial of influences from other composers, the impact of the Rite of Spring is also evident from the opening bars of the Nonet, which suggests that a substantial amount of work on the piece was completed after Villa-Lobos first heard Stravinsky's work in Paris .

Legacy While Henry Burt Wright is quoted as having had a strong influence on thousands of students in Yale University, his influence was made wider by the publication of his book The Will of God and A Man's Lifework (New York: Association Press, 1924). It was copyrighted in 1909. Its studies were originally prepared by laymen to meet the needs of students in the Association Bible Classes for Seniors of the Academic and Scientific Departments of Yale University.

He was a member of the Chaulukya (also called Chalukya or Solanki) dynasty.  Early life  Chamundaraja was the son of the Chaulukya king Mularaja. Inscriptions recording grants made by him as a prince are dated as early as 976 CE, although he ascended the throne much later, sometime during 996-997 CE.  Military career  The Vastupala-Tejapala prashasti includes conventional praise for Chamundaraja, boasting that he decorated the earth with the heads of his enemies, but does not name any specific enemies. According to the 12th century Jain author Hemachandra, Chamundaraja defeated the Lata Chalukya chief Barapa, although other chroniclers attribute this victory to his father Mularaja. Therefore, it appears that Chamundaraja participated in the war against Barappa as a prince. According to the 12th century Vadnagar prashasti inscription, a king named Sindhuraja fled with his elephant forces when he saw Chamundaraja's army at a distance, thus losing his well-established fame. This king can be identified with Sindhuraja, the Paramara king of Gujarat's neighbour Malwa. According to Sindhuraja's court poet Padmagupta, the Paramara king defeated the rulers of Vagada and Lata, which bordered Chamundaraja's kingdom. It is possible that the ruler of Lata was a vassal of Chamundaraja at this time. Accordingly, Chamundaraja came to the rescue of his vassal, forcing Sindhuraja to retreat. The 14th century Jain chronicler Jayasimha Suri claims that Chamundaraja killed Sindhuraja in a battle. However, this claim doesn't appear in the earlier sources, and therefore, cannot be taken literally. The Chalukyas of Kalyani captured the Lata region during Chamundaraja's reign. The 1007 CE Lakkundi inscription mentions that the Kalyani Chalukya ruler Satyashraya had returned from a successful campaign in the Gurjara country. The Kalyani Chalukya poet Ranna also states that Satyashraya defeated the Gurjaras with an elephant force. One theory is that the \\"Gurjara\\" ruler defeated by Satyashraya in this particular campaign was Chamundaraja. However, there is no direct evidence to support this identification. It is possible that the ruler defeated by Satyashraya was the Lata Chalukya ruler Barapa or an obscure descendant of the Gurjaras of Nandipuri.  Personal life  Hemachandra states that Chamundaraja had three sons: Durlabha-raja, Naga-raja, and Vallabha-raja. Abhayatilaka Gani, who wrote a commentary on Hemachandra's work in the 13th century, states that Chamundaraja became licentious, because of which his sister Vachinidevi placed his son Vallabha on the throne. It is not clear how Vachinidevi became powerful enough to replace a ruling king with another. According to Hemachandra, Chamundaraja left for a pilgrimage to Varanasi after his retirement. During this journey, his royal umbrella was confiscated (presumably, by the ruler of a kingdom lying on the way; identified as Malwa by some later chroniclers). As a result, he returned to Gujarat, and asked Vallabha to avenge this insult. However, Vallabha died of smallpox during a march, and Durlabha became the new Chaulukya king. Chamundaraja then retired to Shuklatirtha (modern Shuklatirth) on the banks of Narmada, where he died.  Temples  Chamundaraja built Chandanatha and Vachineshwra temples in Anahilapataka (now Patan). The Vachineshwara temple was probably built for merit of his sister Vachinidevi. Other extant temples attributed to the first quarter of 11th century include original Bhadreshwar Jain Temple (now completely rebuilt following 2001 Gujarat earthquake); Vishnu Temple at Sander village in Patan district; Akhada Mahadeva temple at Vasai and Vishnu Temple at Khandosan, both in Vijapur Taluka of Mehsana district in Gujarat. Two pieces of parshwadevatas, of Uma-Maheshwara and Ganesha, from old Brahminical temple at Jhinjhuwada is recovered dated circa 1000 CE.

He was a member of the Chaulukya (also called Chalukya or Solanki) dynasty. He ruled for less than a year, and died of smallpox while marching against an enemy.  Early life  Vallabha was a son of his predecessor, Chamundaraja. According to the 13th Jain scholar Abhayatilaka Gani, when Chamundaraja became incapable of governing the kingdom, his sister Vachinidevi appointed Vallabha as the new king. The 14th century writer Merutunga, on the other hand, claims that Vallabha ascended the throne after his father's death, and ruled for six months. Some of the Chaulukya inscriptions omit his name in the genealogical lists, probably because of his short reign. However, most inscriptions (including the Vadnagar prashasti) mention him as the successor of Chamundaraja. The 12th century Jain scholar Hemachandra composed a benedectory verse devoted to him. Such verses were composed only for the Chaulukya kings, which indicates that Vallabha indeeded ruled a king, although for a very brief period.  Death  According to the later Jain chronicles, Durlabharaja marched against a kingdom, because its ruler had insulted his father Chamundaraja. However, he died of smallpox during this march. Some of these chronicles identify the enemy kingdom as Malwa, which was ruled by the Paramaras. The 12th century writer Hemachandra states that Chamundaraja left for a pilgrimage to Varanasi after his retirement. On the way, his royal umbrella was confiscated (presumably, by the ruler of a kingdom located on the way). He returned to Gujarat, and asked Vallabha to avenge this insult. The 14th century writer Merutunga mentions the same incident, but replaces Chamunda with Durlabha, and Vallabha with Bhima I. Merutunga's version is known to have historical inaccuracies. The 12th century Vadnagar prashasti inscription states that the kings of Malwa were shaken when they heard about Vallabha's marches. It does not state that he actually reached Malwa. The 13th century writer Abhayatilaka Gani, who wrote a commentary on Hemachandra's work, states that Malwa was the kingdom against which Vallabha marched to avenge the insult against Chamundaraja. However, his conclusion was based on a particular verse in which Hemachandra states that Vallabha passed by the confluence of the Para and the Sindhu rivers. According to the 12th century text Sarasvati-Kanthabharana, the country where these two rivers met was ruled by the Naga kings. Historian A. K. Majumdar speculates that Vallabha died not during a march against Malwa, but during a march to a northern kingdom, where he intended to secure allies for his upcoming campaign against Malwa. The 14th century writer Merutunga embellishes the earlier accounts by claiming that Vallabha not only reached Malwa, but also besieged the Paramara capital Dhara. The later writer Jayasimha Suri states that king against whom Vallabha marchced was Munja. These accounts by the later writers are not historically accurate. For example, it is known that Munja died in the 990s, around a decade before the said march, which took place around 1008 CE. Hemachandra's Dvyashraya makes it clear the Vallabha died before achieving any tangible success in the campaign. Some other works written under Chaulukya patronage, such as Sukrita Sankirtana by Arisimha and Sukrita-Kirti-Kallolini by Udayaprabha, claim that Vallabha defeated the king of Malwa. These claims are not supported by any historical evidence either. Only the fact that Vallabha marched against Malwa appears to be historically true. Vallabha suffered from a severe disease during the march, and asked his army to return to the Chaulukya capital. Hemachandra does not name this disease, but describes the symptoms of the disease from which Vallabha died. Based on these, Abhayatilaka Gani correctly identified the disease as smallpox. After Vallabha's death, his brother Durlabharaja ascended the throne.

He was a member of the Chaulukya (also called Chalukya or Solanki) dynasty.  Early life  Durlabha was a son of the Chaulukya king Chamundaraja. He ascended the throne after his brother Vallabharaja unexpectedly died of smallpox.  Military career  A 1010 CE copper-plate inscription from the reign of Durlabharaja Durlabha's biggest achievement was his successful invasion of the Lata region. He probably defeated the Lata Chalukya ruler Kirtiraja (or Kirtipala), who was a vassal of the Kalyani Chalukyas. The Kalyani Chalukya king Jayasimha was preoccupied in wars against the Chola dynasty, taking advantage of which Durlabha may have invaded Lata. Shortly after, Kirtiraja appears to have regained independence (or regained the Kalyani Chalukya vassalship). However, in 1018 CE, the Paramara king Bhoja also invaded Lata and defeated Kirtiraja. A legendary account by the 12th century writer Hemachandra mentions that Durlabha defeated a confederacy of several kings. According to this account, Durlabha was invited to the svayamvara (husband- selection) ceremony of Durlabha-devi, the sister of king Mahendra of Naddula. His rivals at the ceremony included the kings of Andhra, Anga, Avanti, Chedi, Gurjara, Huna, Kashi, Kuru, Mathura, and Vindhya. Among all these kings, Durlabha-devi chose Durlabha. Mahendra also gave his younger sister Lakshmi in marriage to Durlabha's younger brother Nagaraja. The rejected suitors jointly attacked Durlabha's party during his return journey to Gujarat. Durlabha repulsed the attack and marched home with his new bride. This legend does not seem to be historically accurate. The chief of Naddula was a relatively insignificant ruler, and it is hard to believe that so many major rulers left their kingdoms to attend his ceremony at a time when northern India was under attacks from Mahmud of Ghazni. The defeat of all these powerful kings by Durlabha also seems implausible. The 14th century writer Merutunga claims that after his retirement, Durlabha passed through Malwa on his way to Kashi. There, he was insulted by the Paramara king Munja. He returned to Gujarat, and asked his successor Bhima I to punish Munja. This account is an adaption of earlier legends, which name the insulted king as Chamundaraja. It is historically inaccurate, because Munja died nearly a decade before Durlabha's ascension. According to Hemachandra, Durlabha died childless, and was succeeded by his nephew Bhima I.  Cultural activities  According to the 14th century writer Merutunga, Durlabha built a 7-storey palace in his capital Anahilapataka, along with an elephant stable and a clock tower. He also commissioned the Madanashankara Shiva temple in memory of his brother Vallabha. In addition he also commissioned the Durlabha Sarovar (water tank). The Durlabhmeru temple is probably built by him too. The Upakeshagaccha- pattavali mentions the Mahavira temple built by Shreshthi Kapardi in 1016 CE which was consecrated by Siddhasuri. Other extant temples attributed to the first quarter of 11th century include original Bhadreshwar Jain Temple (now completely rebuilt following 2001 Gujarat earthquake); Vishnu Temple at Sander village in Patan district; Akhada Mahadeva temple at Vasai and Vishnu Temple at Khandosan, both in Vijapur Taluka of Mehsana district in Gujarat. According to the Jain writer Jnanavimala, the Kharatara gachchha (sect) of Jain monks was established during Durlabha's reign. The group's founder Vardhamana Suri and his disciple Jineshvara visited Durlabha's court. There, Jineshvara defeated the Chaityavasins (another sect) in a philosophical debate. Durlabha conferred the title kharatara (very keen) on Jineshvara. When Jineshvara succeeded Vardhamana Suri as the head monk, his sect came to be known as the Kharatara gachchha.

He grew up in the South of England, attending The Skinners' School in Tunbridge Wells. Although his primary instrument is drums, he also plays guitar, bass, mandolin and keyboards, and is a sound engineer/producer. He is also a programmer, working with GForce. In the 1990s Duncan's music career started with school and university bands. After having been drumming for a number of years, in 1993 he received some tuition from Bill Bruford. His early recorded work was with Marc Catley, with whom he recorded three full albums, and a number of contributions to other albums between 1993 and 1996. Two of the albums (Hot Air For Jesus and No Tomorrow) were Christian satirical music, later combined into the release Char; the other (as Paley's Watch) was the progressive rock album November, released in 1994, featuring singer Marianne Velvart. Later in the 1990s Duncan worked with various artists, including film-maker Philip Clemo, Marianne Velvart's band, and folk singer Judith Silver. Solo work From the late 1990s through to the early 2010s, Duncan largely withdrew from public involvement with music, until the release of Abandoned Buildings in 2012, a collection of 18 tracks described as \\"a song cycle with an emotional arc telling of grace against a backdrop of falling in love and failing in love.\\" This was followed by another, more progressive album C:Ore in 2014. Whilst Duncan plays the majority of the instruments on these albums, they also have featured guest appearances from John Hackett, Steve Hackett, Gary Boyle, Raul D'Oliveira, Ton Scherpenzeel, and Daughters Of Davis. Alongside these larger scale releases, Parsons has also released two pseudo ambient albums under the banner Music for Stairlifts, Vol.1 and Vol.2: (Adapting Silent Films) For The Radio. When performing live, Duncan normally sings accompanying himself on a nylon strung guitar (carrying on in the tradition of Marc Catley's Classical Acoustic Rock). He performs arrangements of his own works from solo albums, as well as songs by Supertramp, King Crimson, Family, Chaka Khan, Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues, and others. Video In support of Abandoned Buildings, Parsons drew an animated film to accompany the album. Ten of the eighteen album tracks were used in full (along with an instrumental excerpt from the track Answerphone) to create a 45-minute animated cartoon, following the same emotional arc as the album. A DVD was released, The Abandoned Buildings Cinema Show, shortly after the CD. This included a bonus feature of an additional animation for the instrumental track Tumbl√© d'Amour. Further animation and video has followed for Music for Stairlifts and C:Ore of varying quality. Examples of his work are available on YouTube. Production work In 1995, Duncan produced a three song demo for Marianne Velvart. This generated interest from Rick Wakeman, leading to Marianne being signed to Wakeman's Hope label. The label folded before Marianne recorded a note. As well as helping local Sheffield musicians with demos and album projects, in 2011 Duncan started collaborating with John Hackett, aiding him with production on four albums released through his HackTrax label; two duet albums with classical guitarist Nick Fletcher, Overnight Snow and Hills Of Andalucia, and two of Nick's solo albums, A Moment Of Stars and Blue Horizon. John Hackett Band Following the release of John Hackett's Another Life, a trio was formed with John (guitars, keys, vocals), Nick Fletcher (lead guitar) and Duncan (percussion, vocals), which was soon expanded to a full band with the addition of Jeremy Richardson (bass, guitars, vocals) and Duncan moving to full drum kit. The band started public performances as the John Hackett Band in 2016, their debut album We Are Not Alone was released in 2017 through Esoteric Antenna Records as a double CD set of a studio album and a live album recorded in 2016.

As with many other divisions in the 320-330 series it was flung into the fighting west of Moscow in the 10th Army to defend the capital and then to take part in the winter counteroffensive. After a year on a quiet sector the division rejoined the fighting in the late winter of 1943, eventually distinguishing itself sufficiently to be redesignated as the 90th Guards Rifle Division. After disappearing from the Soviet order of battle for more than a year a new division was formed in the spring of 1944, based on a cadre of two distinguished rifle brigades, and gave very creditable service for the duration, completing its combat path in East Prussia.  1st Formation  The division first formed on September 8, 1941 at Morshansk in the Oryol Military District.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2006, p. 78 Col. Nikolai Boleslavovich Ibianskii was appointed to command on the same day and he would lead the division through its entire 1st formation, being promoted to Major General on July 21, 1942. Its basic order of battle was as follows: * 1092nd Rifle Regiment * 1094th Rifle Regiment * 1096th Rifle Regiment * 893rd Artillery RegimentCharles C. Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From June to December 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. IX, Nafziger, 1996, p. 76 The division formed in the eastern part of the Oryol District. It was still short of all sorts of basic equipment when it was assigned to 10th (Reserve) Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in October. Short or not, it went into battle with 10th Army in early December on the southern flank of Western Front. At this time it was still noted as having insufficient weaponry, including antitank guns, mortars and machine guns, and also lacked communications equipment and transport.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of Moscow, ed. & trans. R.W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 2 =Battle of Moscow= By December 5, just prior to the start of the Soviet counteroffensive, the 325th was at Spassk-Ryazansky when it received a directive from STAVKA, along with the rest of 10th Army to attack the next day in the direction of Mikhailov and Stalinogorsk.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part III, ch. 2 By December 7 the division was fighting along a line from Pecherniki to Berezovo; the Army as a whole was facing the main forces of 29th and 10th Motorized Divisions, with units of 18th Panzer Division and 112th Infantry Division farther south. As the advance unfolded the Army's left-flank divisions, including the 325th, tended to lag, forcing Western Front headquarters to demand that the pace be increased. On the morning of December 14 the division had concentrated in the area of Yepifan. The advance continued that day, and by December 26 the division was moving tho the line Kurakovo - Temryan behind the 322nd Rifle Division which was beginning the fight for Belyov, one of the Army's key objectives.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part IV, ch. 4 On December 28 the 325th and 326th were in 10th Army's second echelon in the Boloto - Gorodnya - Kalinovka area. The following day the division was ordered to begin advancing to reach the Kozelsk area and concentrated there by the 30th.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 5 As the advance continued the new objective became Mosalsk. 1st Guards Cavalry Corps was directed there on January 8, 1942, and overnight liberated the town with the help of the 325th, which was then subordinated to that Corps. The intention was to then continue to advance on Vyasma after regrouping. By the end of January 11 the division had reached Aleksino - Rodnya, 4 km north of Mosalsk. On January 14 the cavalry cut the Minsk - Warsaw highway in the Lyudkovo - Solovevka area, while the 325th covered the Corps operations by defending the line Aleksino - Vysokoe - Khotibino - Pyshkino, but by now German Army Group Center was receiving reinforcements from the west and its air support was growing stronger. The fighting for the highway went on until January 29, and although the cavalry continued to advance, the 325th did not, and Vyasma remained in enemy hands.Battle of Moscow, Kindle ed., part V, ch. 8 =Operations in Central Front= In February 1942, the division was transferred to 50th Army, still in Western Front, just to the north. It remained on this relatively quiet sector until February 1943. Meanwhile, Col.-Gen. K. K. Rokossovsky's Don Front, having crushed the German 6th Army at Stalingrad in Operation Koltso, was moving north. On February 15 these forces, with additions, were re-designated as Central Front. One of the additions was the 325th, which was transferred to 21st Army within that Front. This redeployment ran into many difficulties, mostly with regard to transportation in mid-winter, and it wasn't until mid- March that this Army was in a position to begin to advance.David M. Glantz, After Stalingrad, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2009, pp. 258-59, 265 The intention of the STAVKA was that 21st Army would take part in an offensive to destroy the German forces in the salient around Oryol, liberate Bryansk, and advance into the rear of Army Group Center. In the event this operation failed to reach these ambitious objectives, but the 325th scored some successful tactical actions in its course, so when the 21st Army became the 6th Guards Army in April, the 325th was re-designated as the 90th Guards Rifle Division on April 18.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 76-77  2nd Formation  After an absence of over a year from the Red Army order of battle, a new 325th Rifle Division was formed on May 7, 1944, in the 22nd Army of 2nd Baltic Front, based on cadres from the 23rd Rifle Brigade and the 54th Rifle Brigade.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, p. 123 =23rd Rifle Brigade= This brigade, based on training and reserve units in the Kharkov Military District, began forming in October 1941.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 86 Uniquely among Red Army rifle brigades the rifle battalions kept their pre-war reserve battalion numbers. In November the brigade was evacuated to the Stalingrad area ahead of the German advance. After completing its training and equipment it was railed far to the north, where it was assigned to the 2nd Shock Army in Volkhov Front in December. The 23rd took part in the Lyuban Offensive Operation in January 1942. As of January 27 it was part of Operational Group Zhiltsov with two other rifle brigades with orders \\"to liquidate the enemy in the Zemtitsy and Liubtsy region and, later, sever the Leningrad - Novgorod rail line...\\"Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad 1941 - 1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, p. 166 By March it was trapped in the Volkhov Pocket, and took various (mostly depleted) units under its command, so that in early April its order of battle consisted of: *48th, 50th and 95th Rifle Battalions *One antitank battalion (12 57mm guns) *One artillery battalion (4 76mm M1927 howitzers, 8 76mm M1939 cannons) *Two mortar battalions (24 50mm and 12 82mm in one, 8 120mm in the other) *One submachine gun company *One sapper company *One reconnaissance company *One antitank rifle platoon *Motorized supply and medical companies *Brigade signal detachment *One NKVD rifle platoon and the brigade NKVD security platoon Later that month most of the brigade managed to slip out of the pocket and joined 52nd Army in trying to hold an escape route open until May, when it was reassigned to the cadre headquarters of 2nd Shock which was reforming outside the pocket. On June 1 the brigade had a strength of 367 officers, 376 NCOs, and 1,280 enlisted men, which was better than could be expected after the previous five months of fighting.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XI, Nafziger, 1996, p. 18 During the Third Siniavino Offensive operation in August the 23rd was part of 4th Guards Rifle Corps, still in 2nd Shock Army. When the offensive began the 8th Army initially penetrated the German front in another attempt to break the siege of Leningrad. However, German reserves soon contained the advance, and by August 30 the Volkhov Front commander, Army General K. A. Meretskov, began throwing in his reserves, including 4th Guards, in a futile attempt to sustain his offensive. By early October the Soviet forces had been thrown back to their start line with heavy casualties, although they had frustrated German plans to use their 11th Army to seize Leningrad.Glantz, Leningrad, pp. 220-27 From October to December the brigade was in the 3rd Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding near Kalinin. In January 1943, it was assigned to the 3rd Shock Army in Kalinin Front where it took part in the late stages of the Battle for Velikiye Luki. In October, the 23rd was reassigned to 22nd Army in 2nd Baltic Front, where it remained for the rest of its existence. It was briefly in 97th Rifle Corps in the spring of 1944, but otherwise served as a separate unit in 22nd Army until it was disbanded to help form the new 325th Rifle Division on May 7.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", p. 18 =54th Rifle Brigade= This brigade began forming in October 1941, based on students in the military training units in the Volga Military District.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 86 In December it was shipped north and became one of the first units assigned to the new 3rd Shock Army as it arrived at the front. Beginning on January 9, 1942, 3rd and 4th Shock Armies mounted an offensive that, over two weeks, created the Toropets salient and brought 3rd Shock to Kholm and the outskirts of Velikiye Luki before running out of steam. The 54th would remain in the Kholm area under command of 3rd Shock in Kalinin Front until January 1943, when it was assigned to 6th Guards Rifle Corps in the Front reserves. In April it was reassigned to 22nd Army in Northwestern Front, and it remained in 22nd Army from that time on. It spent late 1943 and early 1944 advancing towards the Baltic states, under command of either 44th or 97th Rifle Corps until March, when it became a separate unit under Army command. On May 7 it was disbanded to help create the 2nd formation of the 325th Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", p. 33 Baltic Campaign The division's order of battle remained the same as that of the first formation.According to Sharp; Russian Wikipedia lists the rifle regiments as the 85th, 110th and 114th. At this stage of the war it was common to re-allocate the numbers of regiments that had been raised to Guards status. Col. Nikita Zakharovich Sukhorebrov, who had commanded 54th Rifle Brigade since October 1943, was given command of the division, which he would hold for the duration of the war, being promoted to Major General on July 29.http://www.generals.dk gives his surname as \\"Sukhorebov\\", but this is contradicted by two Russian-language sources. It was assigned to 44th Rifle Corps and would remain in this corps until nearly the end of the year. On July 8, as its Front entered the general offensive, the 325th was facing the German Panther Line defenses from across the Alolya River, about 25 km northeast of Idritsa.The Gamers, Inc., Baltic Gap, Multi- Man Publishing, Inc., Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 10 In August, 44th Corps was transferred to 3rd Shock Army in the same Front, and in September to 2nd Guards Army in 1st Baltic Front.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 123 By mid-September the division had advanced well into Latvia, approaching Gulbene.Baltic Gap, p. 29 As the advance continued the 325th gave a good account of itself in the liberation of Dvinsk and received the city's name as an honorific: In November the division and its corps were once again reassigned, now to the 43rd Army in the same Front. In a final move the division went to 103rd Rifle Corps in December, and it would continue under command of those two headquarters for the duration. In January 1945, 43rd Army was transferred to 3rd Belorussian Front, where it would remain until April, when it was finally assigned to 2nd Belorussian Front.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 123 Into Germany With the rest of 3rd Belorussian Front, the 325th participated in the Vistula-Oder Offensive. 43rd Army was on the Front's right wing, and by January 22 had made a fighting advance of 23 km, pursuing the defeated German IX Army Corps on a broad front as its remnants attempted to retreat behind the Alle and Deime Rivers. By the end of the day the division, with the rest of the 103rd Corps, reached a line from Agilla to the Nemonin River; the Army's immediate goal was the town of Labiau. Fighting continued throughout the night. The fortified town was defended by units of the German 551st and 548th Volksgrenadier Divisions and put up a stubborn defense, making it impossible for the 103rd Corps to cross the Deime and attack the town from the east. However, the river was forced to the north and south by other units of 43rd Army; the defenders, facing encirclement, sought to escape, but were destroyed by arriving Soviet mobile units. By the end of the 23rd, Labiau had been occupied.Soviet General Staff, Prelude to Berlin, ed. and trans. Richard W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2016, pp. 224-26 Postwar When the shooting stopped, the division had not had much time or occasion to distinguish itself, and was officially the 325th Rifle, Dvinsk Division (Russian: 325-—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –î–≤–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –¥–∏–≤–∏–∑–∏—è).

They established fish rescue program along the Mississippi River in 1903 and a research station at Fairport in 1910. The development of the lock and dam system in the 1930s brought the fish rescue operations to an end because they eliminated of the backwaters that trapped them. The fish hatchery was developed at that time. Property for the facility was donated by the City of Guttenberg and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of the hatchery and aquarium building, the superintendent's residence, and a garage were begun in 1938 and completed in 1939 by the Public Works Administration. The pump house was completed a year later. The fish rearing ponds on Twelve Mile Island were built by the Works Progress Administration from 1939 to 1941. The fish reared in the ponds were distributed to lakes, rivers, and ponds in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Nebraska, and South Dakota. They also supplied specimen fish to the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago; the National Aquarium in Washington, D.C.; aquariums in Dallas, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia; the Fish Control Laboratory in La Crosse, Wisconsin; as well as several university research laboratories.

A Roman army led by the consuls Agrippa Menenius Lanatus and Publius Postumius Tubertus was eventually successful in forcing the Pometians to surrender.  Background  In 503 BC, two Latin towns, Pometia and Cora, said by Livy to be colonies of Rome, revolted against Rome. They had the assistance of the southern Aurunci tribe. Battle Livy says that a Roman army led by the consuls Agrippa Menenius Lanatus and Publius Postumius Tubertus met the enemy on the frontiers and was victorious, after which Livy says the war was confined to Pometia. Livy says many enemy prisoners were slaughtered by each side.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.16 Livy also says that the consuls celebrated a triumph, however the Fasti Triumphales record that an ovation was celebrated by Postumius and a triumph by Menenius, both over the Sabines. Aftermath In the following year the consuls were Opiter Virginius and Spurius Cassius. Livy says that they attempted to take Pometia by storm, but then resorted to siege engines. However the Aurunci launched a successful sally, destroying the siege engines, wounding many, and nearly killing one of the consuls. The Romans retreated to Rome, recruited additional troops, and returned to Pometia. They rebuilt the siege engines and when they were about to take the town, the Pometians surrendered. The Aurunci leaders were beheaded, the Pometians sold into slavery, the town razed and the land sold. Livy says the consuls celebrated a triumph as a result of the victory.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.17 The Fasti Triumphales record only one triumph, by Cassius (possibly over the Sabines although the inscription is unclear).

Galina Andreevna Balashova (, born 1931) is a Russian architect and designer who was associated with the Soviet space program. Life Balashova was born in Kolomna and was educated at the Moscow Architectural Institute. Balashova began her career in 1955 at the GiproAviaProm design institute in Kuibyshev. Her work at this time involved removing decorative elements, considered \\"decadent\\", from residential buildings. In 1957, she became senior architect at OKB-1, which was responsible for design during the early days of the Soviet space program. She began by designing residences for employees but later contributed to the interior design of the Soyuz spacecraft and the Salyut and Mir space stations. Balashova also worked as a consultant for the Buran programme. She retired in 1991 upon the collapse of the Soviet Union, making her work no longer a State secret and available to the public.  Work  Her work with the space program included the design of interior spaces, furniture, control panels, decorative logos and murals for interior walls. Balashova designed for a zero gravity environment, using contrasting colors for floor and ceiling so that astronauts would not become disoriented. Her color schemes come from her experience doing watercolors as a child, where she began her artistic education. Balashova also used the color green in her designs so the televisions at the time would produce the color truthfully. In 2018 in the United States for the first time Galina Balashova's remarkable life and professional accomplishments have been uncovered and emphasized in talks presented at international conferences organized by two leading American universities. Her design for lapel pins used at the A√©rosalons exhibition in France in 1973 later became official emblem for the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project. Balashova was denied approval to attach her name to her own drawing under the \\"pretext of safety,\\" losing the opportunity to spread her name among 100,000 distributed pins at the exhibition. Press coverage increased in the Soviet Union and the United States but Balashova still failed to receive any credit for her designs. When the lapel pins began production in a factory in Mytishchi, certificates for Balashova's design were created by the factory's artistic committee without approval of the government. Balashova's superiors became enraged that she held not only the copyright, but also she was officially registered as the creator; her superiors considered themselves to be the creators of the emblem, and that the workers were only following their direction. Bobkov, one of her superiors, threatened to place Balashova in jail for 8 years \\"for the betrayal of State secrets.\\" Balashova was only able to save herself by claiming it was not her, but the factory who submitted the certificate, and that she was forced to sign a declaration of renunciation and restrict any future royalty payments for the emblem. For comparison, a male in the department found the emblem and reproduced it with a hexagonal profile and reportedly received tens of thousands of dollars for his design, which was simply a replica of Balashova's design. Galina Balashova's pioneering achievements are illuminated in major planned volumes on women's contribution to architecture, but her contributions to zero gravity designs are rarely recognized today beyond a few minor exhibitions and these volumes.

Controversies  66th Speaker of the California State Assembly and father of one of the perpetrators = Fabian N√∫√±ez's Influence = One of the men convicted in his death was Esteban N√∫√±ez, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. N√∫√±ez‚Äôs father, then California Assembly Speaker of the House, Fabian N√∫√±ez, was a close friend and staunch political ally of then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. When Esteban N√∫√±ez was first arrested, his father's political influence was evident as many letters pleading for a reduction in his son's $2-million bail were sent to the San Diego County Superior Court. One letter, on official stationery, came from N√∫√±ez's longtime friend, then Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; one letter came on official stationery from Maria Elena Durazo, head of the L.A. County Federation of Labor; one came from California Assembly Republican Leader Michael Villines, and was sent by California State Assemblyman Kevin de Le√≥n. Ultimately, his bail was reduced to $1 million. = Commutation by Schwarzenegger = As a personal favor to ‚Äúa friend‚Äù, just hours before he left office, and as one of his last official acts, Schwarzenegger commuted N√∫√±ez‚Äôs sentence by more than half, to seven years. Against protocol, Schwarzenegger did not inform Santos‚Äô family or the San Diego County prosecutors about the commutation. They learned about it in a call from a reporter. The Santos family, along with the San Diego district attorney, sued to stop the commutation, claiming that it violated Marsy's Law. In September 2012, Sacramento County superior court judge Lloyd Connelly stated, \\"Based on the evidentiary records before this court involving this case, there was an abuse of discretion...This was a distasteful commutation. It was repugnant to the bulk of the citizenry of this state.\\" However, Connelly ruled that Schwarzenegger remained within his executive powers as governor. In April 2016, Esteban N√∫√±ez was released from Mule Creek State Prison, serving less than six years of his original 16-year sentence.  Legacy  In October 2012, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill that requires that the offender's victims and their families receive at least 10 days notice for any commutations.

It is located on the plains on the eastern side of the Mount Lofty Ranges. The current boundaries for the locality were created in 2003 for the long-established name of the area. History The Sandleton area was first known as part of a pastoral run named Sandalwood. This was broken up for closer settlement in the 1870s. A congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod formed in 1880, with the St Paul's church and school built in 1881. The post office also opened in 1881. After upheaval in the Lutheran Church, the Pilgrim congregation separated from St Paul's and established its own church, school and cemetery in 1895. A government school also opened in 1909, which operated intermittently until 1941. A new Pilgrim Church building was erected in 1914, and operated until 1960, with the last wedding held in 1947. Transport The main route through the locality is Halfway House Road which runs from the Sturt Highway through Annadale and Sandleton to Sedan.

I was a tiny little thing as a child and my grandmother made sure that I would return to the city well fed. I loved to stay with my grandparents. It was so quiet and I could run around rhubarb gardens and steal an occasional rutabaga\\". The first time she went to a theatre was when she was about nine years old. It was an Icelandic adoption of the Norwegian children's play In the Forest of Huckybucky (Norwegian: Dyrene i Hakkebakkeskogen) by Thorbj√∏rn Egner.

While the Romans did eventually adopt them, and used them occasionally after the Punic wars, especially during the conquest of Greece, they fell out of use by the time of Claudius, after which they were generally used for the purpose of demoralizing enemies instead of being used for tactical purposes. The Romans occasionally used them for transport. History =History of elephants and Rome= Although the use of war elephants in the Mediterranean is most famously associated with the wars between Carthage and Rome, the introduction of war elephants was primarily the result of the Greek kingdom of Epirus. King Pyrrhus of Epirus brought twenty elephants to attack the Romans at the battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, leaving some fifty additional animals, on loan from Pharaoh Ptolemy II, on the mainland. The Romans were unprepared for fighting elephants, and the Epirot forces routed the Romans. The next year, the Epirots again deployed a similar force of elephants, attacking the Romans at the battle of Asculum. This time the Romans came prepared with flammable weapons and anti-elephant devices: these were ox-drawn wagons, equipped with long spikes to wound the elephants, pots of fire to scare them, and accompanying screening troops who would hurl javelins at the elephants to drive them away. A final charge of Epirot elephants won the day again, but this time Pyrrhus had suffered very heavy casualties‚Äîa Pyrrhic victory. Battle of Zama by Henri-Paul Motte, 1890 Perhaps inspired by these victories, Carthage developed its own use of war elephants and deployed them extensively during the First and Second Punic Wars. The performance of the Carthaginian elephant corps was rather mixed, illustrating the need of proper tactics to take advantage of the elephant's strength and cover its weaknesses. At Adyss in 255 BC, the Carthaginian elephants were ineffective due to the terrain, while at the battle of Panormus in 251 BC the Romans' velites were able to terrify the Carthaginian elephants being used unsupported, which fled from the field. At the battle of Tunis however the charge of the Carthaginian elephants helped to disorder the legions, allowing the Carthaginian phalanx to stand fast and defeat the Romans. During the Second Punic War, Hannibal famously led an army of war elephants across the Alps‚Äîalthough unfortunately many of them perished in the harsh conditions. The surviving elephants were successfully used in the battle of Trebia, where they panicked the Roman cavalry and Gallic allies. The Romans eventually developed effective anti-elephant tactics, leading to Hannibal's defeat at his final battle of Zama in 202 BC; his elephant charge, unlike the one at the battle of Tunis, was ineffective because the disciplined Roman maniples simply made way for them to pass. =History of Roman use= Elephants captured in 275 BC, after the end of the Pyrrhic war, were displayed in a triumph. Later, Rome brought back many elephants at the end of the Punic Wars, and used them in its campaigns for many years afterwards. The conquest of Greece saw many battles in which the Romans deployed war elephants, including the invasion of Macedonia in 199 BC, the battle of Cynoscephalae 197 BC, the battle of Thermopylae,The Syrian Wars, IV,16-20. English translation from: Horace White ed., 1899. and the battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, during which Antiochus III's fifty-four elephants took on the Roman force of sixteen. In later years the Romans deployed twenty-two elephants at Pydna in 168 BC.Davis, p. 51. The role of the elephant force at Cynoscephalae was particularly decisive, as their quick charge shattered the unformed Macedonian left wing, allowing the Romans to encircle and destroy the victorious Macedonian right. A similar event also transpired at Pydna. The Romans' successful use of war elephants against the Macedonians might be considered ironic, given that it was Pyrrhus who first taught them the military potential of these beasts. They also featured throughout the Roman campaign against the Celtiberians in Hispania. During the Second Celtiberian War, Quintus Fulvius Nobilior was helped by ten elephants sent by king Masinissa of Numidia. He deployed them against the Celtiberian forces of Numantia, but a falling stone hit one of the elephants, which panicked and frightened the rest, turning them against the Roman forces. After the subsequent Celtiberian counterattack, the Romans were forced to withdraw.Appian, Roman History, The foreign Wars, Book 6, The Spanish wars, 46-7 Later, Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus marched against Viriathus with other ten elephants sent by king Micipsa. However, the Lusitanian style of ambushes in narrow terrains ensured his elephants did not play an important factor in the conflict, and Servilianus was eventually defeated by Viriathus in the city of Erisana.Appian, Roman History, Book 6, The wars in Spain, 67 Famously, the Romans used a war elephant in the invasion of Britain, one ancient writer recording that \\"Caesar had one large elephant, which was equipped with armor and carried archers and slingers in its tower. When this unknown creature entered the river, the Britons and their horses fled and the Roman army crossed over,\\"Polyaenus, (VIII, 23.5). \\\\- although he may have confused this incident with the use of a similar war elephant in Claudius' final conquest of Britain. At least one elephantine skeleton with flint weapons that has been found in England was initially misidentified as these elephants, but later dating proved it to be a mammoth skeleton from the Stone Age.Mammoths: Giants of the Ice Age, by Adrian Lister, Paul G. Bahn, p. 116 Reconstructed signum of Legio V Alaudae. By the time of Claudius however, such animals were being used by the Romans in single numbers only‚Äîthe last significant use of war elephants in the Mediterranean was against the Romans at the battle of Thapsus in 46 BC, in which 60 of them were used, where Julius Caesar armed his fifth legion (Alaudae) with axes and commanded his legionaries to strike at the elephant's legs. The legion withstood the charge, and the elephant became its symbol. Thapsus was the last significant use of elephants in the West.Gowers, African Affairs. The remainder of the elephants seemed to have been thrown into panic by Caesar's archers and slingers.

History  This institution Addalaichenai Central College, situated in Addalaichenai in Ampara district has produced many intellectuals, social leaders, sportsmen and artists in this region. The institution was founded on January 7, 1912 as the first Government school on the east coast of our island under the scheme of establishing Government school throughout the island in 1909. In the beginning, this school functioned in a 20√ó40 hut thatched with acadians with only a headmaster, C.G. Vairamuththu, and an assistant teacher As this was the first Government school in the island student from various religions such as Muslim, Hindus and Christians studied here. After this, its name was changed as \\"Sathana school\\" in 1942 and then as \\"Mahavidyalaya\\" as a result of late Pottuvil electorate MP Dr. M.A.M.Jalaldeen's effort.

They said that they were being asked to do more to crack down on armed groups, yet, whenever law-enforcement agencies took action, \\"the security establishment ... worked behind the scenes to set the arrested free\\". He reported that the civilians warned that Pakistan risked international isolation if the security establishment didn't crack down on terrorist groups operating from Pakistan. Following the news article published, both the offices of Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif and the Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif denied the version of events printed in the article and called it as fabricated story. Sharif ordered authorities to take action against those responsible for publishing what he termed as a \\"fabricated\\" story about the military and ISI after the Pakistan's chief of army staff Raheel Sharif called on him to discuss national and regional security issues. Dawn said that the Cyril Almeida report was \\"verified, cross-checked and fact- checked\\" and it stood by the story.

The film is directed by Dzhanik Fayziev and stars newcomer Ilya Malakov, as well as Polina Chernyshova, Aleksei Serebryakov, Aleksandr Ilyin Jr. and Yulia Khlynina in supporting roles. The film is based on the period when Kievan Rus' was under control of the Golden Horde. Ryazan knight Evpaty Kolovrat is the leader of the squad, which decides to fight back khan Batu, who has divided Kievan Rus'. The plot is based on The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan, a medieval military tale about the capture of the city of Ryazan by the Mongols in 1237 and is one of the best sources of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' (then set in now Russia). Furious, was premiered in Russia by Central Partnership on November 30, 2017. Plot Golden Horde times and the warrior, Ryazan knight Evpaty Kolovrat, combat khan Batu, who shattered Ancient Russia. This military tale (The Tale of the Destruction of Riazan) survived in several sixteenth and the seventeenth century redactions and is thought to be a part of a miscellany that was composed and revised by the clergy of the Church of St. Nikholas of Zaraisk. According to the legend, the church is located on the spot where the princess Eupraxy killed herself. Given a form of a military tale, the later version of The Tale of Batu's Capture of Ryazan is a fictionalized account with some historical inaccuracies suggesting that the Tale was composed sometimes after the described events and was subsequently further edited. Tracing its provenance, textual analysis, and dating of various redactions have been conclusively resolved by Soviet scholars. The Tale of the Destruction of Riazan is one of the most interesting and best written accounts of the invasion of Russia by the Mongols : Within twelve years after bringing the miraculous icon of St.Nicholas from Kherson, Batu Khan invaded the Russian land with a great multitude of his Tatar warriors and set up camp on the river Voronezh in the vicinity of the principality of Riazan and he sent his envoys to the city of Riazan, to Great Prince Yury Ingvarevich, demanding tithes from everyone - from the princes and from all ranks of people. And the Great Prince decided to send his son, Fedor Yurevich, to Batu with many gifts and supplications that he not invade the land of Riazan. Prince Fedor came to the Emperor Batu. Batu entertained the Riazan Princes, and asked that they send their sisters and daughters to be his concubines. One envious Riazan courtier told Batu that the wife of Prince Fedor belonged to the Byzantine imperial family and that she had a most beautiful body. Emperor Batu, who was false and merciless, became excited, and told Prince Fedor: \\"Prince, give me your wife so that I may enjoy her beauty.\\" And Prince Fedor said - \\"It is not our Christian custom to bring to you, the godless emperor our wives so that your lust may be satisfied. If you conquer us then you will be the ruler of our wives.\\" The godless Batu was offended, became angry, and ordered the immediate death of Prince Fedor; his body be thrown in a field where it would be devoured by beasts and birds. The retinue and the warriors of Prince Fedor were also put to death. One of the servants of Prince Fedor, by name Aponitsa, managed to escape, and wept bitterly, seeing the body of his master. Having noticed that no one guarded the corpse, he secretly took his beloved master's body and buried it. Then he hurried to Princess Eupraxia of Ryazan and told her that Emperor Batu had killed her husband. At that moment the princess happened to be on the upper floor of the palace with her infant son, Prince Ivan. When she heard that her husband had been slain, she was seized with grief, and threw herself from the window with the child in her arms. And so both died. Evpaty and his soldiers return to Riazan, only to find that the Mongols had burned the city and massacred many of its inhabitants, including the defending soldiers, his wife Nastya and their children. He and his men ring the town bell, summoning the survivors. They hide as a band of Mongols return, and Evpaty kills them all with his two swords. Evpaty leads his men against a blizzard into a forest, and stumble upon a bear and a hermit. The hermit, Nestor, invites them into a cave where they rest for the night and receive herbs. Evpaty and his soldiers use trickery to frighten and distract the Mongols and allow one of his soldiers to help Lada take several children to safety. He sends three soldiers on horseback to three princes in their cities, but only one accepted their request for help in fighting Batu Khan. He also ensures that the surviving people of his city hide in Nestor's cave. At the same time, his soldiers and Lada struggle to help him remember his current situation to stop him from attacking them. Evpaty and his soldiers fight Batu Khan's soldiers on a hill, but the Mongols prevail, leaving Evpaty as the last member of his army. The Mongol officer asks Evpaty on his demands. Evpaty goes down from the hill, he shows them a seal that Batu Khan had given to him earlier, causing the Mongols to avoid killing him. Evpaty taunts Batu Khan that now the latter is the one who kneels, and dies from his wounds from being hit by stones thrown by trebuchets. Because he has his warriors to keep fighting the Mongols to the end, Batu Khan orders his soldiers to build a mound to bury Evpaty's body, one that became taller than the hill where he fought the Mongols. Many years later, that hill was used by another Russian prince, who leads a larger army to face an invasion of Teutonic Knights.

In the neighboring pavilions there was a training room, a riding arena and a stable. This project is the first feature film directed by Ivan Shurhovetskiy. = Post-production = The visual effects of the film studio created in the Main Road Post, which created special effects for films \\"The Duelist\\", \\"Prizrak\\", \\"Stalingrad\\". According to Pavel Stepanov, director of the Central Partnership film manufacturing company, the visual effects were deliberately fabulous to emphasize that the events of the film are a legend. Soundtrack The author of the film soundtrack is world-famous American composer and musician is Serj Tankian, leader of the cult band System of a Down. This is his first experience in Russian cinema. As part of the soundtrack recording, Serj Tankian collaborated with folk instrument performers (balalaika, zhaleika, treshchotka, domra, etc.), throat singing masters from Tuva, a symphony orchestra and choir.

The music was written by Serj, and the film's screenwriters Yevgeny and Dmitry Raevsky, as well as Ekaterina IOWA, worked with him to create the words.

He developed a series of organic reactions that make these materials more biocompatible, less or even non toxic, amenable to further functionalization, and easier to manipulate. He is Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Trieste and Research Professor at CIC BiomaGUNE in San Sebasti√°n, Spain.  Education and career  Prato received his degree from the University of Padua, Italy. He became assistant professor at the same University and then moved to the University of Trieste, Italy, as associate professor in 1992. He became full professor in Organic Chemistry in 2000. He has been visiting scientist at Yale (Prof. Danishefsky,1986-87) and in California at Santa Barbara (Prof. Wudl, 1991-92). He has been visiting Professor at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Paris (2001) and at the University of Namur, Belgium (2010). From 2015 prof. Prato is also Ikerbasque professor and AXA Foundation Nanobiotechnology Chair at CIC Biomagune of San Sebastian-Donostia, Spain.  Scientific Research  Maurizio Prato is an organic chemist, equally fluent in materials science and nanomedicine. From the beginning of his career, Maurizio Prato used his physical organic and synthetic chemistry backgrounds to expand the horizons of the chemical reactivity of fullerenes. In 1993, together with M. Maggini and G. Scorrano, he published the first paper on the azomethine ylide cycloaddition to C60, which resulted to be a very useful reaction of functionalization of fullerenes.Maggini, M.; Scorrano, G.; Prato, M. ‚ÄúThe Addition of Azomethine Ylides to C60: Synthesis, Characterization and Functionalization of Fullerene- Pyrrolidines‚Äù J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 9798-9799. In 2002, he extended the same reaction to carbon nanotubes.Georgakilas, V.; Kordatos, K.; Prato, M.; Guldi, D. M.; Holzinger, M.; Hirsch, A. ‚ÄúOrganic Functionalization of Carbon Nanotubes‚Äù J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 760-761. The reaction is very versatile, consisting in the condensation of an alpha-amino acid and an aldehyde to generate a reactive 1,3-dipole that then adds to a double bond of C60 or CNT, giving a pyrrolidine ring fused to the carbon skeleton. Many alpha-amino acids and aldehydes can be used very efficiently, for a total control of the functionalization process.Prato, M.; Maggini, M.: Fulleropyrrolidines ‚ÄúA Family of Full-Fledged Fullerene Derivatives‚Äù Acc. Chem. Res. 1998, 31, 519-526. This addition, later called Prato reaction, was adapted from a very old reaction scheme, originally reported by Huisgen and then developed by many others.Tsuge, O; Kanemasa, S. ‚ÄúRecent Advances in Azomethine Ylide Chemistry‚Äù Adv. Heterocycl. Chem., 1989, 45, 231-349 Prato and his colleagues were the first to apply it to fullerenes. Because of its versatility and applicability, this approach paved the way to the use of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes in important applications in fields as different as photovoltaics and drug delivery. In particular, Maurizio Prato, in a longstanding collaboration, initially with Alberto Bianco and later with Kostas Kostarelos, demonstrated the utility of carbon nanotubes to serve as efficient scaffolds for the delivery of vaccines and drugs. Carbon nanotubes are very well suited to act as drug carriers, because of their extraordinary capability to cross cell membranes.Pantarotto, D.; Briand, J.-P.; Prato, M.; Bianco, A. ‚ÄúTranslocation of bioactive peptides across cell membranes by carbon nanotubes‚Äù Chem. Commun. 2004, 16-17. This result has thrown open a very active area of research, which explores the applications of CNT in biology and medicine.Kostarelos, K.; Bianco, A.; Prato, M.: ‚ÄúPromises, Facts and Challenges of Carbon Nanotubes in Imaging & Therapeutics‚Äù Nat. Nanotech. 2009, 4, 627-633. In another interesting technological development of functionalized carbon nanotubes, Prato, in collaboration with neurophysiologist Laura Ballerini at the University of Trieste, has used carbon nanotubes as substrates for neuronal growth.Lovat, V.; Pantarotto, D.; Lagostena, L.; Cacciari, B.; Grandolfo, M.; Righi, M.; Spalluto, G.; Prato, M.; Ballerini, L.: Carbon nanotube substrates boost neuronal electrical signaling. Nano Letters 2005, 5, 1107-1110. Carbon nanotubes integrate in an incredible way with nerve cells, leading to a boost in the spontaneous activity of the neurons. These researchers also found that two isolated slices of spinal cord can restart communicating through a bridge of carbon nanotubes.Usmani, S.; Aurand, E. R.; Medelin, M.; Fabbro, A.; Scaini, D.; Laishram, J.; Rosselli, F. B.; Ansuini, A.; Zoccolan, D.; Scarselli, M.; De Crescenzi, M.; Bosi, S.; Prato, M.; Ballerini, L. ‚Äú3D meshes of carbon nanotubes guide functional reconnection of segregated spinal explants‚Äù Science Advances 2016, 2, 10. The implications of this work is that in a (hopefully) not too distant future, carbon nanotubes might be used to repair or replace the function of damaged, altered and severed neurons and neuronal tissue. Another topic recently developed by prof. Prato focuses on the synthesis and the study of carbon nanodots, quasi-spherical, water-soluble and fluorescent nanoparticles with a diameter < 10 nm. These nanoparticles with a carbonaceous core are very rich in primary aliphatic amine groups on their surface that can be exploited not only for coupling reactions with molecules and/or other nanomaterials but also for catalysis and, interestingly, emission can be tailored through a rational choice of organic precursors.

It is tributary to the largest freshwater wetland in Santa Clara County, Laguna Seca, a seasonal lake important to groundwater recharge. From Laguna Seca, Fisher Creek was connected to Coyote Creek by an artificial channel. History Fisher Creek is named for Captain William James Fisher, one of the earliest American settlers in Santa Clara County, who was born July 25, 1810 in Boston, Massachusetts, and went to sea at age 13. He lived for some years in Lower California before buying Rancho Laguna Seca in 1845. In 1834, he married Se√±orita Liberata Cese√±a, a native of Lower California and had four children. Fisher died April 5, 1850. In February 1846, Captain John Fr√©mont on his third expedition, established camp at Fisher's Rancho Laguna Seca. From there Fr√©mont went on to briefly hoist the American flag on then Gavilan Peak, now Fremont Peak. Fisher Creek's historical terminus, Laguna Seca, was also known as Laguna de San Benvenuto. The Rancho Laguna Seca Mexican land grant was given in 1834 by Governor Jos√© Figueroa to Juan Alvires.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco \\"Laguna Seca\\" means \\"Dry Lake\\" in Spanish, and refers to the seasonal lake, Laguna Seca. In October 2020 the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Agency acquired a portion of the Tilton Ranch, which extends northwards from Willow Springs Creek, the likely primary headwaters of Fisher Creek. The ranch was initially acquired by Howard Tilton in 1917. In about one year the property will be transferred to the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority. Watershed Fisher Creek flows northwesterly along the western edge of Coyote Valley. It receives ephemeral flows from several creeks flowing easterly out of the eastern edge of the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The first of these is Willow Springs Creek (also known as Tilton Creek locally for the historic Tilton Ranch) which begins at elevation and flows northwest along Willow Springs Road until it joins Fisher Creek just past its intersection with Hale Avenue. The next tributary to Fisher Creek (heading downstream) San Bruno Canyon Creek along Hale Avenue. San Bruno Canyon hosts greenstone deposits which could be mined and crushed for road construction. From Laguna Avenue to north of Bailey Avenue seasonal wetlands capture the creek's flows, terminating historically in Laguna Seca just west of Tulare Hill and Santa Teresa Boulevard. An artificial channel extends Fisher Creek from Laguna Seca to Coyote Creek near Metcalfe Road. Habitat and conservation A report on the area's importance as a critical wildlife corridor recommended a riparian restoration project along Fisher Creek to reestablish stands of California sycamores (Platanus racemosa), Fremont cottonwoods (Populus fremontii) and willows (Salix sp.) and a reestablishment of valley oaks (Quercus lobata) throughout the valley. Fisher Creek is tributary to the largest freshwater wetland in Santa Clara County, Laguna Seca. ‚ÄúIn Coyote Valley, Laguna Seca offers a rare opportunity to restore natural wetland functions and a diverse wetland habitat mosaic. Laguna Seca restoration would link to existing buffers and have regional significance as a large, natural, valley floor wetland.‚Äù These seasonal wetlands provide critical habitat to many species of wildlife year round and are important to migratory birds. Laguna Seca's vernal pools provide habitat for endangered species such as the California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and the California red-legged frog (Rana draytonii).

Set in May 1940, it stars Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill and is an account of his early days as prime minister during the Second World War and the May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis, while Nazi Germany's Wehrmacht swept across Western Europe and threatened to defeat the United Kingdom. The German advance leads to friction at the highest levels of government between those who would make a peace treaty with Adolf Hitler, and Churchill, who refused. The film also stars Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James, Ben Mendelsohn, Stephen Dillane, and Ronald Pickup. The film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on 1 September 2017, and it was also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. It began a limited release in the United States on 22 November 2017, followed by general release on 22 December, and was released on 12 January 2018 in the United Kingdom. The film grossed $150 million worldwide and received mainly positive reviews from critics, especially with regard to Oldman's physical transformation and acting, with many considering it to be one of the best performances of his career. The film earned Oldman the Academy Award for Best Actor, as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role. At the 90th Academy Awards the film earned six nominations, including Best Picture, and won for Best Actor and Best Makeup and Hairstyling. At the 71st British Academy Film Awards it received nine nominations including Best Film and Outstanding British Film. Plot In May 1940, the opposition Labour Party in Parliament demands the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for being too weak in the face of the Nazi onslaught. Chamberlain tells Conservative Party colleagues that he wants Lord Halifax as his successor, but Halifax does not feel the time is right. Chamberlain is forced to choose the only man whom the opposition parties will accept: Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, who had correctly predicted the danger from Adolf Hitler before the war. Churchill tries to dismiss his new secretary Elizabeth Layton for mishearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife Clementine. King George VI, who strongly distrusts Churchill due to his support for his brother Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis, reluctantly invites him to form a government. Churchill includes Chamberlain (as Lord President of the Council) and Halifax (as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). That day, Germany invades Belgium and the Netherlands. Churchill has a poor reputation in Parliament because of his record in the Admiralty, his role in the Gallipoli Campaign in the First World War, his views on India, Russian civil war and his past defection to the Liberal Party. Parliament reacts coolly to Churchill's first speech promising \\"Blood, toil, tears and sweat\\". Chamberlain and Halifax are appalled by Churchill's refusal to negotiate for peace, and begin to plan to resign from the government to force a vote of no confidence, creating a situation in which Halifax would become the Prime Minister. Churchill visits French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, who thinks Churchill delusional for not admitting that the Allies are losing the Battle of France, while Churchill becomes furious that the French do not have a plan to counterattack. Although U.S. President Roosevelt is sympathetic to Churchill's plight, his actions are limited by an isolationist Congress and the Neutrality Acts. Churchill draws ire from his cabinet and advisers for delivering a radio address in which he falsely implies the Allies to be advancing in France - as a refugee column is heavily bombed - earning him a rebuke from the King. Halifax and Chamberlain continue to push to use Italian Ambassador Giuseppe Bastianini as an intermediary with Germany. The British Expeditionary Force is trapped at Dunkirk and Calais. Against the advice of the War Cabinet, Churchill orders Brigadier Nicholson in Calais to lead the 30th Infantry Brigade in a rearguard action to distract the enemy and buy time for the soldiers at Dunkirk to evacuate. Layton's brother is killed during the retreat. The debacle in France causes the War Cabinet to support negotiating with Germany. Under heavy pressure, Churchill agrees to consider a negotiated peace, but is unable to bring himself to dictate a letter requesting talks. George VI unexpectedly visits Churchill; the King explains that he has come to like Churchill, and encourages him to continue the war. Still uncertain, Churchill impulsively rides the London Underground (for the first time in his life) and asks startled passengers their opinion: the civilians all want to continue to fight. Churchill meets with the Outer CabinetTo ensure that military decisions could be taken quickly without lengthy discussion, only a few chosen ministers sat in the small inner War Cabinet and other Members of Parliament, and receives their support. The evacuation of troops from Dunkirk, Operation Dynamo, is successful. As Churchill prepares to address Parliament, Halifax asks Chamberlain to continue with their plan to resign, but Chamberlain decides first to listen to the address. Towards the end of his speech, Churchill proclaims that \\"we shall fight on the beaches\\" should the Germans invade, to resounding support from the Opposition. Chamberlain mops his brow with his handkerchief, a prearranged signal that the Tories should support the PM. Churchill exits the chamber to cheers and waving of order papers.

Production Filming took place at the John Rylands Library in Manchester, England as well as the Town Hall. On 5 February 2015, it was announced that Working Title Films had acquired Darkest Hour, a speculative screenplay by The Theory of Everything screenwriter Anthony McCarten, about Winston Churchill in the early days of the Second World War. On 29 March 2016, it was reported that Joe Wright was in talks to direct the film. In April 2016, Gary Oldman was reported to be in talks to play Churchill. On 6 September 2016, it was announced that Focus Features would release the film in the United States on 24 November 2017, while Ben Mendelsohn was set to play King George VI and Kristin Scott Thomas was cast as Clementine Churchill. On 8 November 2016, Stephen Dillane joined the cast. By November 2016, Darkest Hour had begun principal photography, and it was reported that Dario Marianelli would score the film. For his role as Churchill, Oldman spent over 200 hours having make-up applied, and smoked over 400 cigars (worth about $20,000) during filming. Filming took place in Manchester, England at both the Town Hall and John Rylands Library, both doubling for the Houses of Parliament and feature heavily in the film. John Hurt was initially cast as British prime minister Neville Chamberlain. Ronald Pickup assumed the role of Chamberlain instead. Hurt died from cancer in January 2017. For locations, the exterior of Chartwell House in Sevenoaks, Kent was used for the telegram sequence that sees Churchill's secretary Elizabeth Layton receive a telegram from Buckingham Palace. Fort Amherst in Kent featured as the location for both General Ramsay's Operations HQ and the Calais Garrison. For the interior of Buckingham Palace, Wentworth Woodhouse in Wentworth, South Yorkshire, was used. Reception =Box office= Darkest Hour grossed $56.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $93.8 million in other countries (including $33.4 million in the UK), for a worldwide total of $150.2 million. In the United States and Canada, the film began a limited release on 22 November 2017. In its first five days, it grossed $246,761 from four theatres (an average of $61,690), finishing 21st at the box office over the weekend. The film had its wide release on 22 December 2017, alongside the openings of Downsizing, Pitch Perfect 3 and Father Figures, and the wide release of The Shape of Water, and grossed $3.9 million from 804 theatres over that weekend, and $5.5 million over the four-day Christmas frame. 85% of its audience was over the age of 25, with 30% being 50 or older. The following weekend the film made $5.5 million, and a total of $7 million over the four- day New Years frame. The weekend of 27 January 2018, following the announcement of the film's six Oscar nominations, it made $2.1 million. =Critical response= Gary Oldman's performance as Winston Churchill garnered widespread critical acclaim and earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 311 reviews, with an average rating of 7.33/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Darkest Hour is held together by Gary Oldman's electrifying performance, which brings Winston Churchill to life even when the movie's narrative falters.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a normalised score of 75 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". PostTrak reported that over 90% of audience members gave the film a rating of either \\"excellent\\" or \\"very good\\". Oldman was praised for his performance, with numerous critics labelling him a frontrunner to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, which he went on to win. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"Get busy engraving Oldman's name on an Oscar... those fearing that Darkest Hour is nothing but a dull tableau of blowhard stuffed shirts will be relieved to know that they're in for a lively, provocative historical drama that runs on its own nonstop creative fire\\". David Ehrlich of IndieWire praised Wright's direction and the musical score, writing: \\"Unfolding with the clockwork precision of a Broadway play... it's a deliciously unsubtle testament to the power of words and their infinite capacity to inspire\\". Conversely, Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com called the film \\"an acting exercise weighed down by costumes, make-up, and over- lighting\\", adding that \\"there's nothing new to the approach. It feels often like an obligation‚Äîa story that someone felt should be told again and a way to get a great actor his Oscar\\".  Home media  Darkest Hour was released on digital streaming platforms on 6 February 2018 and on Blu-ray, DVD and 4K UHD Blu-ray on 12 June 2018. Historical accuracy Writing in Slate, historian and academic John Broich called Darkest Hour \\"a piece of historical fiction that undertakes a serious historical task\\", presenting the British decision to fight Hitler as a choice rather than as inevitable. The situation in 1940 was as dire as depicted but liberties were taken with the facts. The shouting matches over possible peace negotiations were fictional. The journey on the London Underground was also fictional and there is evidence that most British people were not immediately inspired by Churchill's speeches. George Orwell believed that ordinary people already felt subjugated and might not object to a \\"new order\\".http://www.sandfordborins.com/2017/09/18/darkest-hour-not-even- remotely-based-on-a-true-story/ There is no conclusive evidence that Chamberlain and Viscount Halifax were planning an imminent vote of no confidence, though that threat existed until the mid-war victories in North Africa. It is a fact that Churchill was an object of suspicion for his fellow Tories. The Labour Party confirmed that they would serve in a national government under a leader other than Chamberlain but did not name Churchill. In The New Yorker, Adam Gopnik wrote: \\"‚Ä¶in late May of 1940, when the Conservative grandee Lord Halifax challenged Churchill, insisting that it was still possible to negotiate a deal with Hitler, through the good offices of Mussolini, it was the steadfast anti-Nazism of Attlee and his Labour colleagues that saved the day ‚Äì a vital truth badly underdramatized in the current Churchill-centric film, Darkest Hour\\". This criticism was echoed by Adrian Smith, emeritus professor of modern history at the University of Southampton, who wrote in the New Statesman that the film was \\"yet again overlooking Labour's key role at the most dangerous moment in this country's history ... in May 1940 its leaders gave Churchill the unequivocal support he needed when refusing to surrender. Ignoring Attlee's vital role is just one more failing in a deeply flawed film\\".http://www.sandfordborins.com/2017/09/18/darkest-hour-not-even-remotely- based-on-a-true-story/ Referring to Charles Moore's comment that the film was \\"superb Brexit propaganda\\", Afua Hirsch wrote in The Guardian: \\"I would call the film propaganda, more generally ‚Äì and a great example of the kind of myth we like to promote in modern Britain. Churchill has been re-branded as a tube- travelling, minority-adoring genius, in line with a general understanding of him as 'the greatest Briton of all time'.\\" Hirsch also criticised the film for \\"perpetuating the idea that Winston Churchill stood alone, at the Darkest Hour, as Nazi fascism encroached, with Britain a small and vulnerable nation isolated in the north Atlantic. In reality the United Kingdom was at that moment an imperial power with the collective might of Indian, African, Canadian and Australian manpower, resources and wealth at its disposal.\\" The film gives the impression that both Clemmie and the King were able to listen to the 'beaches' speech live from Parliament. This was impossible because radio broadcasts from Parliament did not start until the 1970s. Whilst Churchill did record the speech for posterity, he did not make the recording until 1949. Nor did he, unlike some other speeches, repeat that speech on the radio shortly after giving it in Parliament. The 'beaches' speech was first delivered on June 4, 1940 - after the Dunkirk evacuations, not on May 28 as suggested by the film. Elizabeth Layton did not start working as Churchill's private secretary until May 1941, a year after the events depicted in the film. Similarly the death of her brother during the retreat to Dunkirk, as alluded to in the film, is entirely fictional. Chamberlain is referred to as 'Chairman' of the Conservative Party, but in fact even after leaving Number 10 and becoming Lord President of the Council, he retained the far more important post of Leader of the Conservative Party. Awards and honours Sequel Gary Oldman stated, in February 2018, that there was talk of a sequel to Darkest Hour that could also include President Franklin D. Roosevelt (who had been voiced by David Strathairn in Darkest Hour) and take place during the Yalta Conference in 1945.

However, Imran has a cousin named Annie who will do anything to marry him when she clearly knows that he likes Aina. Mohsin knew of Aina's affair and forbade Aina from university, since he was the eldest of all so nobody dare to disagree him. Eventually, Aina convinces her family to meet Imran's family. However, Imran's father wants him to marry Annie so that all the properties and money stays the same between the families. Imran's family manages to convince him that they are going to Aina's house for the proposal when in reality he is getting engaged to Annie.

Later imran got pressurized from his father and he divorced aina. Soon aina found that she is pregnant. Soon Faraz discovered and reacted ao fiercely that Aina's mother had a heart attack and on her death bed she asked Faraz to take care of Aina and Sajal and not to tell about Aina to anyone. Aina's mother died. Her death was quite mysterious which provoked Mohsin and Nadia but Faraz started ignoring his brother and Nadia in order to hide Aina's pregnancy. Sajal after her mother's death turned out so cruel and venom-spewing sister to Aina. As Aina didn't want an abortion and therefore Faraz decided to end Aina's engagement with Noman and left for Islamabad along with his wife and Aina. This filled Mohsin with great rage and he abandoned Faraz, who decided that to deliver Aina's baby and pretend him as his and Sajal's. Unfortunately Sajal found her pregnant. Sajal blamed all the situation to Aina and Aina called Imran's mother to adopt his upcoming child as she can't keep him. Sajal had a miscarriage and followed barren life while Imran's mother told Imran about his child, who now is married to Annie. Meanwhile, Imran called Aina but a maid attended the call and told Imran that madam had a miscarriage. Imran assumed it for Aina and decided to forget Aina closing her chapter. Soon Aina gave birth to a baby boy whom Sajal quickly adopted and tried to keep Aina away from her son. Mohsin and Nadia were expecting twins now and Faraz decided to meet Mohsin and Nadia and to end this misunderstanding between them. Sajal and Faraz left for Karachi along with Maaz (Aina's son). Mohsin showed rude behaviour to Faraz who returned to Islamabad. Aina decided to overcome her problems and sorrows and to lead a normal life and started a job as a teacher. Their lives were going well when suddenly Mohsin called upon Faraz to Karachi due to Nadia's bad health. Faraz decided to stay in Karachi now along with Sajal and Aina staying at Mohsin's place. Nadia died and gave birth to a daughter and a son. This left Mohsin with great sorrow who regret over his cruel and selfish behavior towards his late wife. Aina started taking care of Mohsin's daughter but Mohsin was the same man with great rage and ego towards everyone especially Aina. Noman (Aina's ex-fianc√©) met Aina and desired of marrying her, Aina avoided Noman since she was not able to start a normal life with anyone. Noman requested Mohsin and Sajal and both of them wanted to get rid of Aina convinced Aina to marry Noman. Aina in order to get rid of situation told about her affair to Noman after knowing about Aina's affair Noman rejected Aina. This filled Mohsin and Sajal with huge anger and both of them taunted and teased Aina. Faraz on the other side decided to leave for America with Sajal and Maaz but kept this secret. Aina on the other side was constantly taunted by Mohsin and Sajal. Faraz's unending care for Aina as a younger sister raised Sajal with doubting of affair between them which hurt both Faraz and Aina who eventually bumped onto tears and anger and became furious in the rain where she yelled at Mohsin as well and claimed everyone as cruel people. The next morning Sajal apologized Faraz for doubting him while Faraz told everyone that he is leaving for America along with family. This made Aina worried as she thought that her son Maaz is going so far and how will she live with Mohsin. On the other side Mohsin became worried as well and requested Faraz not to go and asked about Aina over this Faraz offered Mohsin to marry Aina for the sake of his children. This shocked Mohsin and he rejected stating that this is quite impossible for him as he never considered aina in his life. Faraz and Sajal tried to convince Aina who reluctantly agreed over an agreement that Faraz would not leave for America. This shocked Mohsin as he wondered about Aina's agreement over his proposal but Mohsin disagreed over proposal. Meanwhile, Imran and Annie lived in devastating relationship which made realize Imran that he couldn't forget Aina. Incidentally Annie met Aina in a mall and told her that Imran has totally forgotten her and that he is happily married. Aina reacted firmly over this by stating she is living a happy life as well without Imran and that she is going to marry soon, and that she will spit on Imran's face next time she'll meet him. Annie was shocked over it and told Imran sarcastically who fiercely asked Annie to leave his home. On other side Aina intensively asked Mohsin to marry her and that she will take good care of his children but Mohsin disagreed and stated that he can't start a life with her as this is quite awkward for him, but deep inside Mohsin still thought that his children wants a mother's affections. Later on the nanny Nafeesa whom Mohsin hired to look after his children was kidnapping his daughter and Aina saved her so Mohsin agreed to marry her. Imran managed to meet Aina and asked for apology Aina slapped Imran claiming that he is coward. After their marriage Mohsin started thinking of her dead wife Nadia and thinks that he is doing wrong with her Faraz tried to convince Mohsin that he should live a happy life with Aaina but Mohsin's behaviour is rude with Aaina and he often humiliate aina for being a lazy wife and compares her to Nadia. Aina tries hard to become a hardworking housewife and mother but Mohsin is always unsatisfied and often loses his temper over her. He knows that not only the children need the support of Aina but he also needs as well as Aina also needs Mohsin. He doesn't want to scold her, but often does. Meanwhile, Faraz and Sajal decide to go to America knowing that Aina told them not to go and that is why she married Mohsin but Faraz tries to explain Aina that Sajal wants to live in America and he doesn't want to upset her. After so much of pressure she agrees to let them go but she is not happy about it. Since they left Aina is always thinking about Maaz and couldn't concentrate on anything and also she doesn't talks to Mohsin. Faraz calls Mohsin and asks if everything is okay he says that he doesn't know what happened to Aina Faraz then says Mohsin to take care of her and don't repeat the same mistake of the behaviour he kept with Nadia and says that if something happens to Aina he won't forgive himself. Mohsin couldn't take the behaviour of Aina anymore so he told Aina that why is she running away from him and why doesn't she accept this marriage then Aina hugs him and tells him she couldn't live like this, her loneliness will kill her. After saying that she faints and then Zubaida comes and scolds Mohsin for not taking care of Aina she tells him to call the doctor and the doctor says her blood pressure is low. After that he was remembering the old Aina that how joyful she used to be and now whatever he says to her she doesn't says a word. The next day Mohsin prepared breakfast for Aina and took her very nicely. Mohsin brought his twin children and told Aina that he don't want a child right now from her maybe later but not that time because he doesn't want Aina to take care of her child more than his children. Aina has now too many responsibilities so she asked Mohsin that she wants a maid. At first he didn't agree because of all that Nafeesa drama he didn't want to take anymore risks but later on he accepts. The next day Aina was happy because she got support of maid and told Mohsin that she works really nicely and told that she cooks also very well and then Mohsin told that the maid prepared the food and she told yes I was checking that if she can cook or not because if there is any emergency so she will cook. Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down. Then Mohsin came and helped her. After that he had to eat the food by maid the whole week. Ayna started to feel jealous seeing Nadia and Mohsin wedding picture and then she removed it from the wall and put the frame of her children. Mohsin noticed it and then got angry and said to put the frame back she said she will not put the frame and if he does she will throw the frame outside she told that I am your wife now Nadia I nowhere in her life. After a few days, Ayna went to her old home and was remembering her good old memories with Sajal and her mother. Mohsin arrived home and was waiting for Ayna when she came he told her where are you going everyday at this time and saying bad stuff to her. She then says that she doesn't want to live with her and then he says cause you want to marry I mean and then she says you are a very cheap person and then she leaves the home. She then went to Zubaida (Khala) home and said her everything what happened. After that she left her home and went again back to her old home i.e.. her mother's home and was crying there. On The other hand, Mohsin was thinking that why he scolds her every time he then was imaging a shadow of himself in which his shadow says him that he have to control himself otherwise he and his children will not be happy without her. Then he visits Zubaida's house and asked her about Ayna. She said that she went to her home and then he says she is not there. Then he thought that Ayna would must be in her old house and then he goes there and convinces her and apologize her and then she agrees to live with him. The story then leaps 18 years. The twins (Rania (Hina Altaf) and Aasher (Agha Jarrar) and Tabinda (Mariyam Nafees) have matured. Tabinda is shy and sweet while Rania is much the opposite and Rania is lively and confident. Tabinda wants to become an engineer and study in university however Mohsin denies as he doesn't want her end up doing the mistakes Aina did in the past when she went college. Tabinda tries to convince Mohsin but Mohsin's decision remains the same. Also Mohsin is planning to get Tabinda married but Tabinda does not agree. But as usual, what Mohsin wishes only that will happen. After few days, Mohsin and Faraz's sister Aliya (Zainab Qayyum) and her son Afaaq (Umer Naru) moved to Mohsin's house to stay there forever. Afaaq is a really selfish and irresponsible guy, Aliya is also not a really good woman. The next day, Aliya said to Mohsin that Ayna is a really good woman and she took a really good care of the kids to which Mohsin agrees then Ayna came inside and she sat on the sofa then Aliya asked Mohsin that why he didn't allow Tabinda to take admission in University. He then told her that she has grown older so he is looking for a boy to marry her. After that Aliya asked hand in marriage for Tabinda to Mohsin to which Mohsin was really happy and finally agreed. After that Ayna told Mohsin that he should have asked her point of view. Then Mohsin says I don't need to listen and that why is she not agreeing for Afaaq to which Ayna replied because he has just shifted here and they don't know him much and Tabi will also not agree. Then Mohsin says if Tabi doesn't agree then he will finish all his relations between his daughter and Ayna. Mohsin also decided that Rania will marry Maaz and Taabi will marry Afaaq to which Rania overheard and then she ran to Taabi and told her about what Mohsin says that she will marry Afaaq and when she heard that she cried a lot then Ayna was calming her down and told her not to cry. The next day, when Ayna gave tea to Mohsin, he asked how Taabi responded when she learned that she will marry Afaaq. Ayna said she was quiet. Meanwhile, Afaaq was happy to marry Taabi because he thought that then he can get money from Mohsin because he is going to be his son-in-law. While, Maaz (Raees Alam) is unaware of fact that he is step-son of Sajal and Faraz. Once, he comes to Aina's home, Aina initially don't know that he is Maaz, but when he says that he is Maaz, she is surprised. He has actually come without permission of Sajal but Faraz knows. Rania and Maaz start taking interest in each other and would marry in coming episodes. Initially Mohsin was not in favour of his son to get education from abroad but when he asked Affaq about it, Affaq also favour his (Mohsin's) son because he wanted to handle all the business of his father-in-law. while on the other side Faraz and Sajjal return to Pakistan and Sajjal is not happy with the soft behavior of Maaz towards Aina. Whereas Maaz has fallen in love with Rania. Sajjal continuously insults Rania and Maaz gave her choice of court marriage. Aina listens there conversation and thought Rania is going to do same mistake as Aina did in past Faraz gave proposal of Maaz to Rania parents though which Aina rejected. Maaz and Rania are is great sorrow and Sajal is quite happy. But Maaz began to hate his own mother after this. He then returned to America. When Sajal apologizes to Aina and Sajal wants Rania and Maaz to marry each other, when they found out they were so surprised, at Taabi's mehndi a girl threatens Taabi to stay away from Afaqq, she zoomed to Afaqq's prison of the house and gives him the photos, Aliya was shocked to see the photos. At the shaadi the boys were dancing (Maaz, Asher, and Afaqq) when the police arrived and took Afaq, when Mohsin blames Aliya for her sons misbehavior, they decide to replace Taabi's Shaadi With Rania's marriage. Then Mohsin finds out Maaz is not Faraz and Sajal son but does not know it is Aaina and tells Rania to divorce him. Maaz comes in and he tells Rania to go with him but Mohsin gets a gun out just to threaten Maaz but out of pressure Aaina tells Mohsin about Imran and Maaz being her son. Mohsin is shocked and Faraz tries to take the gun off and then Mohsin accidentally shoots Maaz. Aaina and Faraz take him to the hospital and gets him treated. Rania on the other hand is in a state of shock and Tabi tries to console her and says he is fine and is asking about her. Mohsin is thinking about what he has done and remembers about his past. When Aina is back to home to take Rania to hospital to see Maaz, Mohsin tells about the fact that Aina is not their mother. Despite this, they accepted her as their mother. Maaz went to meet his father and grandmother they were shocked and aina went back to Mohsin. At least Taabi and Afaq married and Rania and Maaz as well they had a family picture and that was the ending.

It created a an \\"agricultural tribes\\" category, the membership of which was almost compulsory to buy or sell land. British law and caste identity manipulation in colonial India: the Punjab Alienation of Land Act., Guilhem Cassan, Paris School of Economics (PSE), Laboratoire d‚ÄôEconomie Appliqu¬¥ee (LEA-INRA) and Centre de Sciences Humaines de Delhi (CSH), 12 January 2010 Why Dera Sacha Sauda draws followers, Sanjeev Nayar, Rediff, 28 August 2017  Background  The advent of British rule in India had led to a trend whereby ownership rights to land were increasingly concentrated in the hands of urban moneylenders and other commercial communities among the Hindu population. They were assigned the property previously held by poor peasants, who either sold or mortgaged for the short-term benefit derived from the increasing values of land caused by improved agricultural methods, irrigation and communications. Such transfers were enforceable under law but, in British eyes, potentially damaging to their colonial administration because they might ultimately result in a disaffected rural peasant population. British law was effectively supporting the growth of a class of people ‚Äî the new owners ‚Äî that might prove detrimental to its own purpose. In addition, historian Kenneth Jones says that the transfers were contrary to British sentiments: \\"Not only did this development threaten the stability and peace of the Punjab, it also struck at the British self-image of benevolent and paternalistic protectors of the lowly peasant\\". Legal framework = Legislation = Concern about developments turned to serious debate in the 1890s and on 27 September 1899 the future Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, Charles Rivaz, presented the Imperial Legislative Council with a proposal titled the Punjab Alienation of Land Bill. The measure was viewed by educated Hindus in the province as being another example of Raj discrimination against their interests. In classifying people as being either \\"agriculturalist\\" or \\"non-agriculturalist\\" and limiting the transfer of land between those two groups, they saw the measure as preventing free investment of capital and reducing their opportunity to acquire the status traditionally associated with land ownership. More, with the majority of those classified as agriculturists being Muslim, the educated elite saw it as being anti-Hindu, just as their diminishing ability to gain government employment, which was once their preserve, was considered to be such. Rivaz's proposed legislation reignited the interest of elite Hindu Punjabis in the Congress and Indian Association political movements, which had waned during the decade. When the Congress delegates at the 1899 gathering in Lucknow supported opposition to the proposal, it created a rift between the organisation and Punjabi Muslims and peasants. However, factional disputes among the Punjabi elite ‚Äî notably, between the Arya Samajists and the Brahmos ‚Äî meant that this revived enthusiasm for Congress was short-lived. = Aftermath = The National Unionist Party was established as a consequence of the 1900 legislation to protect the interests of agriculturists. The subsequent Punjab Land Alienation Act of 1907 further restricted the transfer of land ownership between various groups. Amendments =2019 Haryana amendment= In 2019, Haryana government passed the amendment to the Punjab Land Alienation Act, 1900 (PLPA), which had obtained ascent from the governor but has not yet been notified by the Haryana government, hence it is in limbo and has not become officially become a law. This amendment will reduce the Haryana‚Äôs Natural Conservation Zones (NCZs) by 47% or 60,000 acres from 122,113.30 hectares to only 64,384.66 hectares. This is in violation of multiple guidelines of the Supreme Court of India as well as \\"NCR Planning Board\\" (NCRPB) notification which states the original 122,113.30 hectares ecologically sensitive forest of South Haryana is a forest, \\"The major natural features, identified as environmentally sensitive areas, are the extension of Aravalli ridge in Rajasthan, Haryana and NCT-Delhi; forest areas; rivers and tributaries... major lakes and water bodies such as Badkhal lake, Suraj Kund and Damdama in Haryana sub-region\\".Law changes bring Aravalli conservation to the fore, Hindustan Times, 22 December 2019.

C. Bose National Fellow and the head of the Ghanshyam Swarup Research Group of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. He is known for his studies on glaucoma and the discovery of protein tyrosine phosphatase, a new protein influencing the regulation of cell proliferation. He is an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, the Indian National Science Academy and the National Academy of Sciences, India. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1996, for his contributions to biological sciences.  Biography  Ghanshyam Swarup, born on 23 November 1953 in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, graduated in science from Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University and continued his studies there to secure a master's degree before moving to Mumbai to complete his PhD at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). His post-doctoral studies were at David L. Garbers' laboratory of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine where he had the opportunity to work alongside Stanley Cohen, the 1986 Nobel laureate. Returning to India, he joined the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology as a scientist and is the head of Ghanshyam Swarup Group which carries out researches on optineurin and the functional defects caused in humans by its mutations.  Legacy  Ghanshyam Swarup, while working with Stanley Cohen in the US on cellular signaling mechanisms, is reported to have discovered a new nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) and his subsequent work demonstrated that the protein plays a part in the regulation of cell proliferation. Later, during his early days at CCMB, he elucidated the molecular cloning of a protein tyrosine phosphatase and its bind with DNA and established the methodology for alternative splicing of a gene to form four different variations of PTPase. His studies are known to have assisted in identifying the first cargo (PTP-S4/TC48) for the putative cargo receptors in mammalian cells. He has established a laboratory, Ghanshyam Swarup Group, where his team focuses on researches on protein optineurin and how disease- associated mutation affect humans. Associated with L. V. Prasad Eye Institute, he works on one of the mutated genes of optineurin as a causative factor of glaucoma, an eye disease leading to irrecoverable loss of vision and has elaborated on the pathogenesis in the disease from a molecular perspective. Swarup has published several articles detailing his research findings; ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 81 of them. He is a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Molecular Singaling and is known to be active in the researches done by others. He has mentored several scholars in their doctoral and post-doctoral researches at his research group in CCMB as well as scholars from other institutions.  Awards and honors  Swarup, who was elected as a fellow by the National Academy of Sciences, India in 1988, received the Young Scientist Award of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in 1989. The Indian Academy of Sciences made him their elected fellow in 1995 and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research honored him again in 1996 with the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards. An elected member of the Guha Research Conference, Swarup became an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy in 2003. In 2011, he was selected for the J. C. Bose National Fellowship of the Department of Science and Technology on which he pursues his current researches at CCMB.

The vehicle's frame is made from wood, as are its wheels. The engine is a single-cylinder model and was purchased second hand from a sawmill. The Express's boiler was obtained through Exchange and Mart. The flywheel brake acted on the engine, and following the principles of the horse-carriage braking system (brake shoes attached to a lever) another was applied to the rims of the back wheels. The Express steamed for the first time on 26 June 1897. After that Lawson would drive it at local festivals. He had ceased using the Express by 1934 and died in 1938. The Craigievar Express was then sold to a man from Aberdeen before later being repurchased by Andrew Lawson's son James. James carried out some restoration on the Express before transferring it to William Forbes-Sempill, 19th Lord Sempill. The Express was then steamed at various events. With Lord Sempill's death in 1965, his widow sold the vehicle to Maurice Smith, a Surrey-based car historian. Smith carried out further restoration work and obtained a MOT certificate for the vehicle. In 1971 Maurice Smith completed the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run with the Craigievar Express. In 1985 the Craigievar Express was purchased from Maurice Smith by the Grampian Transport Museum. The money for the purchase came partly from donations from the general public but also grants from the Scottish Postal Board, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Royal Scottish museum and the National Fund for Acquisitions.

The film was produced by Krishna Chaithanya under the banner of Sri Swarnalatha Productions and its theater distribution was handled by Jayanna films. The film was released on 27 May 2016. It was later dubbed in Tamil as Idam Porul Aavi.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRYNdfd-a9whttps://in.bookmyshow.com/payakaraopeta/movies/idam- porul-aavi/ET00065650 It is also dubbed in Hindi and available on Karvva on Youtube.  Plot  The film is a compendium of two linear story lines, related to the final plot. The first story line follows a documentary film crew who are out to debunk a rumor about a haunted house, while the other recounts the kidnapping of a rich businessman‚Äôs daughter. The connection between the two linear story lines is a classic, which is set in a worn down mansion located somewhere in the Karnataka countryside. When a non-residing Indian (NRI) attempts to sell his ancestral property, he finds that it has a nasty reputation as a haunted house. In an attempt to improve his chances of a sale, he enlists the help of a documentary filmmaker, specializing in investigations of supernatural events. The TV crew also has some kind of spiritual adviser and a scientist with a machine that measures ghost activity. However, despite all their skepticism, the crew finds more than they bargained for in the abandoned house. In a plan to exorcise the spirit, they aim to return at a more auspicious time. The other storyline follows Thilak, a spoiled, rich kid who lives the high life; until he loses a large amount of money gambling. When his father (Devaraj) decides that enough is enough after hearing a fake need for more money from Tilak and refuses to bail him out. Amruta (Anisha Ambrose), Thilak‚Äôs sister, tries to get her father to help Thilak, but is kidnapped and a ransom note sent to Devaraj. The kidnappers choose Thilak to deliver the ransom money and the directions he follows take him to an abandoned mansion somewhere in the Karnataka countryside. Thilak is shown to be conniving with the kidnappers to extort money from his father so that he can continue living his flamboyant lifestyle. When they decide to escape after obtaining the money from Thilak, the car refuses to start, leading Amruta to suggest that they spend that the night at the mansion itself. It is revealed that this mansion is the same as the one the TV crew was investigating in order to debunk the rumors of supernatural elements living in it. The five youngsters find an old book, which tells the story of Vaidehi, a woman who lived in that very mansion long ago. Vaidehi was considered to be an ill-omen right from the time of her marriage, and was tortured to death by her family members who had plotted to kill her. After her death, her spirit haunted the house, taking the lives of all those who entered. Mysterious happenings in the house terrify the five people, culminating in Rohit being mortally wounded, who warns Thilak about an evil spirit that his sister is housing, before apparently dying. Thilak and others flee the house and return to Bangalore, where they resume their normal lives. It is revealed that Thilak was conned by Rohit and Amruta working together to defraud him of a large sum of money, and all the mysterious happenings were engineered by Rohit (who is actually alive) and Amruta. Rohit plans to swindle other people as well, and is shown selling the house to some investors. When he goes into the bungalow after finalizing the deal with the buyers, the mysterious happenings at the house begin again (on the anniversary of Vaidehi's death), and the movie ends with the couple trapped in the house with Vaidehi's spirit.

The game's premise focuses on the player creating online videos for views and subscribers, the former of which they can use to purchase goods that can increase performance. The game was released on 29 September 2016 on iOS and Android. It became the Apple App Store's top download on its release day and on the following day Kjellberg reported that the app had been downloaded over ten million times. The game experienced server issues during its initial launch.  Gameplay  The gameplay of PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator mockingly simulates the life of a YouTuber, with modes similar to PewDiePie himself. The player creates videos which generate \\"views\\", a currency used to purchase items from the store as to decorate the player's room. The creation of videos also allows the player to gain YouTube subscribers, essential for the unlocking of select features and achievements. Achievements can be obtained by completing a specific task, with the reward of views and subscribers, as well as other goods. The player may also use \\"bux\\" to purchase special items such as clothing, or to increase the size of the player's room. \\"Brains\\" can be used to unlock extra features such as additional delivery slots. A series of user-wide competitions are also available for the player to partake in, each with a theme to match entered rooms. Entry into a competition costs five bux. Since recently, a player can trade unwanted items for a special magical dust. You can collect more dust for more expensive items, but once something is turned into dust, it cannot be turned back. Once enough dust has been obtained the user can swap it for cubes that range from grayscale to colourful to invisible. These can be used to show off pixel dust (the name of it) or to create pixel art with - another way to get pixel dust is to play \\"Puggle\\". = Minigames = A minigame called \\"Puggle\\" is also accessible, reminiscent of pachinko, which can be used to accelerate delivery processes and gain other goods, such as balls containing pixel dust (Up to 100 pixel dust in a ball), bux and egg tokens. How much time gets deducted from a player's delivery depends the delivery reduction multiplier, which depends on how much views they wager in the beginning, how many pegs and bubbles they hit, and the bowl they land in. Egg hatching minigame is where players buys an egg from the egg dispenser and publish videos with the theme that the egg likes to hatch it. To find out the egg's theme, players have to publish videos to find out. Afterwards, when the player clicks on the egg there should be a small icon indicating the egg's theme. In early-to-mid 2019, a new minigame called \\"Craniac\\" was added. It is like a \\"Washing Machine type game\\" where players operates a crane to grab balls containing exclusive items as well as views, brains, egg tokens, celebration mask reward tokens and prisma pixeling eggs.  Reception  Of the game, Rolling Stone commented that PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator \\"has more in common with Kim Kardashian: Hollywood than Game Dev Story\\" and that \\"I wasn't sure if I was playing a game or being integrated into a human milking machine\\". TouchArcade rated the game at four out of five stars, stating that \\"with some rather simple yet intricate and absorbing gameplay, coupled with PewDiePie‚Äôs signature humor and charm that is bound to go down well with his millions of die-hard fans, the game strikes a perfect balance between not taking itself seriously while being intriguing enough to keep interest long after the first cardboard box has been bought.\\" References Category:2016 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Cultural depictions of Swedish men Category:IOS games Category:PewDiePie Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games based on real people Category:Video games developed in Canada ","title":"PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator"},{"id":"51952773","title":"Miss Myanmar 2018"},{"id":"51952786","text":"The SRM TRP Engineering College is named after the well-known Educationalist, Philanthropist and Social entrepreneur Dr.T.R.Paarivendhar.

System BP Crucis is considered as the optical counterpart to the X-ray source GX 301-2. The system consists of a massive hypergiant star and a neutron star in an eccentric 41.5 day orbit. The distance is likely to be between three and four thousand parsecs. It is heavily reddened and has a K-band infrared magnitude of 5.72. There is a mass transfer from the hypergiant to the pulsar which occurs via a dense accretion disc. This produces a cyclotron effect with electron energies of 37 and 48 keV. Variability The system shows both optical and x-ray variability. Although no eclipses are observed, the x-ray luminosity varies during the orbit with large x-ray flares being observed during periastron passages. The system is an optical variable showing brightness changes of up to 0.08 magnitudes at visible wavelengths. These have been attributed to ellipsoidal variations as the hypergiant rotates and to Œ± Cygni variability. There is an intrinsic pseudo-period of 11.9 days as well as small variations corresponding to the orbital period. Properties BP Crucis is around 43 times as massive as the Sun, it is also one of the most luminous stars known in the Galaxy, with an estimated bolometric luminosity of around 470,000 times that of the Sun and a radius 70 times that of the Sun. The neutron star appears to belong to the \\"high mass\\" variety being at least . It is very likely to have a mass less than as the theoretical maximum mass based on the equation of state for a neutron star. The pulsar has a spin period of 685 seconds, but shows relatively large spindown rates thought to be due to its strong magnetic field, and also occasional spinups due to interaction with the accretion disk. It is calculated that a slowly spinning neutron star could be spun up to the current rotation rate by accretion in only ten years.

She moved off her original pre-med track and applied for a summer program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, graduating in 1996. Cobb completed her PhD in oceanography at Scripps in 2002, hunting El Ni√±o events in a sediment core from Santa Barbara. She spent two years as a post doc at Caltech before joining Georgia Tech as an assistant professor in 2004. She has published over 100 peer-reviewed publications in major journals. She became a full professor in 2015 and supervises several PhD and MSc students. Research Kim Cobb's group seeks to understand global climate change and identify the natural and anthropogenic causes. Cobb's research has taken her on several oceanographic voyages around the tropical Pacific and caving expeditions of the rainforests of Borneo. Cobb's research group uses corals and cave stalagmites as archives of past climate change and investigates past climate variability over the last several centuries to several hundreds of thousands of years ago. In addition to generating high-resolution paleoclimate records, Cobb's research group also monitors modern climate variability, performs model analysis, and characterizes tropical Pacific climate variability. She and her team collected ancient coral fragments from the islands of Kiribati and Palmyra, aged them with uranium‚Äìthorium dating and then used the oxygen isotope ratio cycle to measure the intensity of El Ni√±o events over the last 7,000 years. Cobb is on the editorial board of Geophysical Review Letters. Awards and recognition * In 2007, she won the NSF CAREER award and the Georgia Tech Education Partnership Award * In 2008, Cobb was recognised as one of the nation's top young scientists, winning the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) * In 2009, Cobb received a Kavli 'Frontiers of Science' Fellowship * Cobb was an invited guest at the White House Workplace Flexibility Policies Event in 2011 * In 2019, Cobb was awarded the 2020 Hans Oeschger Medal by the European Geosciences Union. Policy and public engagement Cobb in 2010 speaking at PopTech Cobb sits on the American Association of Advancement of Science Climate Science Panel, the international CLIVAR Pacific Panel and the international PAGES-CLIVAR intersection panel. She is on the advisory council for the AAAS Leshner Institute for Public Engagement. Cobb is an advocate for outreach with communities, and regularly lectures to schools, colleges and other public groups, on climate science. She has been involved with policy and is the writer of several public interest articles on climate change, trying to inspire other climate scientists to speak up in international debate. She has appeared on Showtime's documentary \\"Years of Living Dangerously\\". On Real Scientists, Cobb makes her case for studying the paleoclimate: \\"The instrumental record of climate is far too short to identify some of the most important changes in climate under greenhouse forcing. Paleoclimate data is coming to the rescue, looking at past droughts, extreme events, and sea level change\\". Cobb gave a presentation at the March for Science in Atlanta, Georgia, in April 2017. In February 2019, Cobb testified before the House Committee on Natural Resources for the hearing, \\"Climate Change: Impacts and the Need to Act.\\" In this testimony, she described how the 2016 Pacific Ocean El Ni√±o wiped out 90 percent of the corals in her study site, saying, \\"I had a front-row seat to the carnage.\\" She underscored the severity and clear increases in the effects of climate change, noting that many scientists she talked with have been willing to collaborate with lawmakers on climate change.

The Sabah State Water Department corruption probe (Malay: Siasatan Rasuah Jabatan Air Negeri Sabah) refers to a 2015 to 2016 widespread investigation by the Malaysian Anti- Corruption Commission (MACC) over the alleged abuse of power inside the Sabah State Water Department resulting in the arrest of two senior officers in the state agency along with the confiscation of RM3 million which had been kept inside a safe deposit box in the office of one of the suspects, together with a total of RM52 million cash were seized from various more places, including from the officials' house which also includes gold and stone jewellery, luxury brand watches, 94 branded handbags, nine luxury cars and folders containing 127 land grants of the two officers. Another businessman with the title of \\"Datuk\\" (one of the officials brother) and his accountant were also arrested in connection with the case. During the confiscation of the RM52 million, the MACC members of 30 people took 15 hours to go through, using the serial numbers to estimate some of the sealed stacks. The total confiscation then increase to RM53.7 million, RM112 million and finally to RM114.5 million, with the case been considered as the largest ever confiscation by MACC in the country corruption history. Until 12 October 2016, the four people remain arrested, with another five people been called to help facilitate the investigation following the record statements from 40 people, including department officers and contractors. Three of the witnesses surrender a total of RM1 million to MACC after giving their statements on the probe. Further investigation revealed another RM30 million in foreign banks with money trail leading to Australia and New Zealand and another RM30 million in land titles. For over 5 years, both of the two main suspects had taken 60% of state funds channelled by the federal government that supposedly been used for water supply works.  Background  Responding to complaints over the unfair distribution of water development project contracts in the department, the MACC spent over a year investigating the two suspects who appeared to be living in upper-middle-class lives. According to the investigations by 70 MACC personnel since 2015, both suspects are linked to 38 different companies since 2010, with the department director is linked to 17 companies owned by his siblings and proxies, while his deputy is connected to 21 companies owned by his family members. Almost every water development projects in the state were awarded to both suspects linked companies. The department were also seen as did not auditing its infrastructure projects since 2002. A check by local newspaper, New Straits Times on the auditor general (AG) reports from 2002 until 2015 found that the department had only been audited seven times, with the records only focusing on its non-revenue water (NRW) management and privatisation of supply. Based on the 2015 statistics from the National Water Services Commission (Malay: Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Air Negara (SPAN)), 87.9% of Sabah residents received a treated water supply compared to the state of Kelantan with only 64% as many Kelantan residents mostly depends on alternative water resources. The Sabah State Water Department are mostly poor in the handling of NRW due to theft, leakage, burst pipes, faulty meters and maintenance works, with Sabah's rate was 55.1%, the second bottom from Perlis with 56.3%. = Probe = Following a series of investigation for years, a team of MACC then raid the office of Sabah State Water Department on 4 October 2016, arresting the department's director Awang Tahir Awang Talib (aged 54) and his assistant Teo Chee Kong (52) on the spot along with the confiscation of RM114 million worth of assets and RM53.7 million in \\"cold cash\\", with further investigation revealed a money trail leading to Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. The shocking revelation led the MACC deputy chief commissioner saying: The two suspects account have since been frozen, with the money confiscated are believed to have been siphoned from federal government allocations to the department for infrastructure projects worth RM3.3 billion since 2010. The MACC deputy chief commissioner said that they would be using Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Legal Assistance Agreement (MLA) to get co-operation from neighbouring ASEAN country to get the money back in a bank account linked to both suspects. On 13 October 2016, a former deputy director for the department Lim Lam Beng (64) was arrested to assist in the ongoing investigation. The suspect has held the post for 11 years until 2015 before appointed as technical and engineering advisor in the Sabah Ministry of Finance. During his term, the suspect had received money from contractors. One of the two main suspects was however been released on bail in 16 October after his 12-day remand order had expired, thought neither of them can be working in the department anymore and were blacklisted from leaving the state of Sabah. Another two suspects that were arrested earlier released in the next day. On 19 October, 19 district engineers was arrested in connection with the probe for allegedly taking 30% of contracts value which were awarded to proxy contractors. A total of RM2.4 million were also seized from them along with procurement files from 27 locations around the state. Three other suspects who work as officers in the department was arrested in 20 October, while the position of the former director was replaced by a new officer in the same day. Until 1 December, the MACC has spent nearly a month to analyse 8,000 payment vouchers between 2008 and 2016 from \\"tens of thousands of documents\\" as part of their ongoing investigations. The MACC stated that it will complete the investigation soon with investigations papers would be submitted to the Attorney-General. On 29 December, the two main suspects together with one of the suspect wife Fauziah Piut (51) was charged by MACC at the state Sessions Court.  Trial  More than 200 witnesses are expected to give their statement for the trial that began on July 2017. On 13 December 2017, one of the four suspects Teo Chee Kong faces 146 counts of charges for misappropriation involving RM32 million. Early in 2018, the trial are supposed to be resumed on 2‚Äì3 April but was postponed to 7‚Äì11 May. In March 2018, Teo's application to quash all 146 corruption charges made against him are being dismissed by the court. On 15 May, the water department signed and pledged to the Corruption-Free Pledge of the MACC with participation from the Director of JANS, Heads of Division, District Engineers as well as senior officers and staff. On 18 May 2018, the Court of Appeal had allowed Teo to be suspended from the trial pending the court's decision on the accused‚Äôs application against Sessions Court Judge Abu Bakar Manat hearing the trial, and a joint trial with three other accused. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tengku Amir Zaki Tengku Abdul Rahman on behalf of the MACC then requested that the sessions court postpone the hearing to facilitate a trial for all the accused. The trial are subsequently allowed to be adjourned until a proper decision by the court of appeal as well as the recusal order is reached, while a hearing will be heard on 30 and 31 July as well on 1 and 2 August respectively with all four suspects is charged for a combined total of 183 counts of money laundering involving nearly RM100 million. Until November 2018 since the change of the state government, the new Infrastructure Development Minister Peter Anthony said he is still puzzled on the current status of the case as there is no new information received from the MACC. On 19 March 2019, the Sessions Court has set tentative trial dates commencing 6 August for the continuation of the trial of the money laundering case involving the four suspects with five witnesses had been called in the trial. All the suspects pleaded not guilty to 37 counts of money laundering involving RM61.57 million.  Reactions  The arrestment has been applauded by most of the public as well by the international anti-corruption organisation, Transparency International (TI). Thought the corruption issue also has led to many conspiracy theories and finger pointing, with attempts by politicians to link both suspects to political parties and their political opponents. The corruption within government officials has led the federal government to impose a new law to every development projects that costing more than RM500 million to involve the country Auditor General (AG) and MACC. TI has urged MACC to investigate any politicians involved in the corruption, with MACC has promised earlier to conduct further depth investigation as the corruption could be including any politicians. = Government officials = Sabah Chief Minister Musa Aman ordered a review on the management of external funds channelled to all state ministries, departments and agencies following the arrestment of its state government officials. Musa also urged the public to stop making speculation until the investigation is finished. Sabah Deputy Chief Minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan was shocked when heard of the arrest and assured that his ministry would leave no stone unturned in investigating the two officers suspected of corruption and abuse of power. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Abdul Rahman Dahlan expressing regret over the case but said \\"a total revamp is not necessary as not all government staff in the department were involved\\". Communications and Multimedia Minister Salleh Said Keruak support the arrestment and said \\"Malaysians, especially Sabahans, fully supported MACC action to expose corruption and abuse of power in the department\\" while also urging the public to refrain from making any further speculation. Foreign Minister Anifah Aman denied allegations that the two officers arrested are linked to his ministry and the Kimanis United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) division. Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) religious harmony bureau chairman Ti Lian Ker said the scandal shows that the government's check and balance system has failed and needs to be overhauled. Neighbouring Sarawak State Secretary Mohd Morshidi Abdul Ghani has warned of \\"dire consequences\\" if civil servants in Sarawak fail to uphold their integrity pledges, citing prior to the corruption case in Sabah. Chief Secretary to the Government, Ali Hamsa called on the public to not regard all the 1.61 million civil servants in Malaysia as corrupt because of the malpractices of a few individuals shortly after the revelation in the case. Tenom UMNO Member of parliament (MP) Raime Unggi said the case is \\"unlikely to be limited to state officials\\" as the corruption of such scale must logically involve collusion at the Rural and Regional Development Ministry given that the case involved RM3.3 billion in projects was handed out in 2010 during the time the ministry been headed by Shafie Apdal. = Opposition politicians = Penampang MP Darell Leiking has called on MACC to investigate every completed and on-going projects in Sabah for elements of corruption and hopes the commission will uncover many more abuses that had happen in the state for a long time. Darell also demands probe on the Kaiduan Dam project as officials in the water department before had ignored the complaints of villagers most affected by the projects with the state government has vowed to go ahead with the project to solve state water crisis despite claims by activists that the dam will displace and threaten the livelihoods of potentially more than 1,000 indigenous villagers when it submerges 12 square kilometres of forest and parts of the Crocker Range. While the founder of Sabah division for State Reform Party (STAR) Jeffrey Kitingan says the seizure of millions of money justifies calls to channel all development funds for federal projects to the Sabah state government for implementation. The statement by Tenom MP (see above) was responded by Likas assemblyman Junz Wong suggesting the \\"MACC should also probe the local Finance Ministry (MOF) for the corruption case\\" than solely blame the federal government as preferred by Raime before, he instead suggest the authorities should firstly investigate all state-level ministries to find more details on the corruption. Former Rural and Regional Development Minister Shafie Apdal denied that he and his former ministry had any links with the corruption in the awarding of infrastructure projects worth RM3.3 billion during his term, and said he is prepared to co-operate with the MACC. Sabah Democratic Action Party (DAP) Chairman Stephen Wong Tien Fatt demanded Joseph Pairin Kitingan to resign over the corruption case as the department was under his purview. Wong statement was then responded by the President of Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP) Yong Teck Lee, citing \\"it is too early to determined the political responsibility\\" in the case. Sabah People's Justice Party (PKR) lawmaker and sole opposition member in the Public Audit Committee (PAC) Dr. Roland Chia has indicated that he intends to table the report on the \\"Auditing of Infrastructure Projects\\" undertaken by the State Water Department since 2010 at the committee forthcoming meeting. Ba'kelalan PKR Assemblyman and a senior lawyer Baru Bian commenting on a local news report from The Borneo Post that asking the opinion of Sarawak leaders if the issue would affect Sarawak, said \\"one could say that nobody is surprised anymore about corruption scandals in our country\\", citing the MACC report following the investigation that \\"the wealth of the two officers involved was not commensurate with their salaries\\" is similar with the case of wealth of the former Sarawak Chief Minister. While former PKR leader Anwar Ibrahim blamed the corruption issue on \\"Sabahan nativist attitude\\", with his statement is believed to referring to the recent decision by several Sabahan politicians to quit federal-based opposition parties of DAP and PKR to join new Sabah- based political platforms. = Public = The corruption issue were met with criticism by most Sabahan peoples as many of the allocation by federal government that were supposedly been used to improve the poor water services in the state were instead been taken by corrupt officials in the state government. Local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Task Force Against Kaiduan Dam (TAKaD) spokesperson Mary Giun has said a Kaiduan Dam project by the state water department in Ulu Papar should be cancelled as the project had always been shrouded in controversy, while Jaringan Orang Asal SeMalaysia (JOAS) secretary Jannie Lasimbang said the disclosure has called into question all existing, implemented or proposed projects and contracts by the Sabah Water Department, and in particular the proposed Kaiduan Dam project. The corruption also become the reason on why the Malaysian ringgit getting weak due to persistent corrupt practice within the country officials with the public viewing the case as \\"just one of the many hidden corruption cases in the country\\".

It has a single narrow, hairy leaf and one or two creamy-white flowers with pink tips in early spring. Description Caladenia behrii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy, narrow lance- shaped leaf, long that develops during winter. There are one or two flowers on a thin, hairy raceme up to high, each flower up to in diameter. The lateral sepals and petals are long, creamy-white in colour with red glandular tips that produce an aroma described as \\"strong musky\\" or \\"subtle spicy\\". The petals and sepals spread widely at their bases but have drooping, thread-like ends. The labellum is egg-shaped to lance-shaped, about long, whitish-green with a pink or red curled tip. The labellum has a fringed edge and there are between four and six rows of red calli along its mid-line. Flowering occurs in August and September and is followed by an oblong-shaped capsule which releases hundreds of seeds in late October or November. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia behrii was first formally described by Diederich Schlechtendal in 1847 and the description was published in Linnaea: ein Journal f√ºr die Botanik in ihrem ganzen Umfange, oder Beitr√§ge zur Pflanzenkunde. The specific epithet honours the German-American botanist, Hans Hermann Behr. Distribution and habitat This caladenia occurs in two small disjunct populations, one near Kersbrook and Williamstown and the other near Belair and Clarendon. It grows on loamy soils in woodland. Ecology As with many other caladenias. the pink-lipped spider orchid is pollinated by male thynnid wasps when they attempt to copulate with the labellum. Since the orchid is an endangered species, hand pollination may be used to propagate the species artificially. Research has shown that cross pollination and pollination with a single pollinium increase the number and viability of seeds produced. Unlike for some other species, fire does not induce or increase the flowering of C. behrii. Conservation Caladenia behrii is classified as \\"Endangered\\" under the Government of South Australia National Parks and Wildlife Act of 1972 and the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).

It specified an \\"equitable allocation\\" among five regional zones, in addition to assignments proportional to population among the states within each zone. Its implementation resulted in the development of a complicated quota system by the Federal Radio Commission, and although its provisions were carried over to the Federal Communications Commission by the Communications Act of 1934, it ultimately proved impractical, and was repealed on June 5, 1936. Adoption Radio regulation in the United States had to be suspended in the summer of 1926, when it was ruled that the Commerce Department, operating under the provisions of the Radio Act of 1912, did not have the authority to specify the operating frequencies and powers for broadcasting stations. A period of worsening interference followed, and to restore order the Radio Act of 1927 was approved on February 23, 1927. This act created a new five member body, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), which was given one year to stabilize the broadcasting situation. Section 9 of the FRC's enabling act made a general declaration about the need to equitably distribute radio station assignments, stating: The FRC was unable to finalize its plans within its one-year deadline, so in March 1928 the U.S. Congress extended its authorization until March 16, 1929. Proposed as a part of the reauthorization was an amendment, authored by Ewin L. Davis, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from Tennessee, which specified in more detail the standards to be followed to ensure an \\"equitable allocation\\" of stations: The five U.S. zones among which stations were to be equally allocated under the provisions of the Davis Amendment. The territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were included in Zone 1, and Hawaii and Alaska in Zone 5. Davis' proposal was somewhat controversial. Support and opposition crossed party lines, and it was more likely to be favored in rural areas and the less developed south and west, while urban areas and the northeast and midwest, where most of the existing major radio stations were located, were more likely to oppose the measure. Despite strong opposition from the National Association of Broadcasters and the largest radio firms, the Davis Amendment rider was included as part of the FRC reauthorization. Implementation Partial list of CBS network affiliates, including their Davis Amendment \\"quota units\\" (1934) On November 11, 1928, the FRC put into effect a major reallocation of U.S. radio stations, under the provisions of its General Order 40. This reallocation partially met the requirements of the Davis Amendment, most notably by assigning eight clear channel frequencies to each of the five radio zones. However, there was still a need to quantify and reassign stations in order to more fully meet the Davis Amendment standards. On June 17, 1930 the FRC released General Order No. 92, \\"Broadcasting stations classified according to values (units) for allocation equality between the five radio zones\\", which specified how \\"quota units\\" would be determined for evaluating an individual station's impact on state and zone quota allocations. Stations were assigned unit values of up to 5 points each, which was primarily determined by their transmitting power and hours of operation. By late 1933, the FRC had adopted a policy that the national quota target would be 400 units, with 80 units assigned to each zone. Quota units assigned to individual stations ranged from 0.01 to 5. At this time the Commission reported difficulty in achieving balance within both the zone and individual state assignments. It reported that Zones 1 and 2 were currently under quota, while the other three were over. Some individual states were highly above or below their allocations, with the extremes of Florida at 107% over quota, and Wyoming at 59% under quota.Broadcast Facilities as of December 1, 1933, Preliminary Report on Communications Companies, House Reports: 73d Congress, 2d Session (January 3-June 18, 1934), Public, Volume 5, pages 229-263, 1934. The effort to achieve equalization among zones and between states led to a number of reassignments and legal battles. In 1934 KYW, operating on a clear channel frequency assigned to Zone 2, but located in the Zone 4 city of Chicago, Illinois, was compelled to move to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to conform to the zone requirements. Using the Davis Amendment standard as a justification, WJKS in Gary, Indiana petitioned the FRC to eliminate two stations located in Chicago, WIBO and WPCC, that were timesharing on 560 kHz, so that it could begin operating full-time on their cleared frequency. A major argument in favor of WJKS was that the \\"State of Indiana is 2.08 units or 22 per cent under-quota in station assignments and the State of Illinois is 12.49 units or 55 per cent over-quota\\". In 1933 the Supreme Court sided with the FRC's approval of the WJKS request, and WIBO and WPCC were deleted and replaced by WJKS. (Shortly thereafter WJKS changed its call letters to WIND, and a few years later, after the Davis Amendment had been repealed, moved from Gary to Chicago.) The Communications Act of 1934, which replaced the FRC with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), incorporated the Davis Amendment requirements in its Section 307(b), with one additional proviso: However, even with this change the FCC struggled with implementing the Davis Amendment equalization requirements, and worked for its repeal. Repeal Reflecting the opposition to the Davis Amendment by members of the FCC, Senator Burton K. Wheeler, head of the Committee on Interstate Commerce, reported that \\"on May 23, 1935, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission wrote the chairman of your committee as follows\\": Conforming to the wishes of the FCC, the U.S. Congress repealed the Davis Amendment on June 5, 1936. Although this allowed a modest increase in the number of radio stations, it did not lead to wholesale changes in the structure of the AM broadcast band, as most of its organization remained unchanged from what had been created while following the Davis Amendment requirements.

It had slightly thicker armour when compared with the Panther and some standardised components were implemented from the Tiger II tank. The Panther II did not progress beyond prototypes and did not enter production. Panther II on display at Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor, Fort Knox. The Panther G turret on display was not originally fitted to this hull and was installed later as a placeholder.  Development and production  The early motivation for improving the Panther tank came from the concern of Adolf Hitler and others who believed that it lacked sufficient armour. Hitler had already insisted on an increase in its armour once, early in the design of the original Panther in 1942. Discussions involving Hitler in January 1943 called for further increased armour; initially referred to as Panther 2, it was known as the Panther II after April 1943. There would have been the usual tank crew consisting of five: the driver, commander, gunner, loader and radio operator. Following the decision not to commence production, the concepts and ideas were used for the design of the E-50 Standardpanzer project. = Armour = This upgrade to the Panther tank increased the thickness of the glacis plate from to , the side hull armour from to , and decreased the armour on the top hull from to . Production of the Panther II was slated to begin in September 1943. Much of the Panther II's design was taken from the Tiger tank. On 10 February 1943, Dr. Wiebecke (chief design engineer for M.A.N.) suggested thoroughly redesigning the Panther II and incorporating Tiger components such as the steering gear, final drives, the suspension system and turret based on Eastern Front experiences. The total weight would have increased to more than 50 tonnes. Another meeting on 17 February 1943 focused on sharing and standardising parts between the Tiger II and the Panther II, such as the transmission, all-steel 80 centimetre diameter road-wheels that only overlapped (as on the Tiger II) and not interleaved (as the original 'Schachtellaufwerk' road-wheel system used) and running gear. Drawings from 1943 also showed the addition of a machine gun port for the turret, with a narrow gun mantlet. Additional meetings in February 1943 began to outline the various components, including a suggestion to use the 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 gun from the Tiger II. However, it was ultimately decided to continue use of the production Panther's 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70 gun. In March 1943, MAN indicated that the first prototype would be completed by August 1943. = Turret = The Panther II was to be fitted with a new turret, the Turm Panther 2 (schmale Blendenausf√ºhrung). For a long time, it was assumed that the Schmalturm was designed for the Panther II, but we now know this isn't true. The Schmalturm was designed after the Panther II was cancelled. = Engine = A number of engines were under consideration, among them the new Maybach HL234 fuel-injection engine (900 hp operated by an 8-speed hydraulic transmission) and the BMW 003 aviation turbojet-derived, GT 101 turboshaft powerplant, planned to be of 1,150 shaft horsepower output and weighing only 450 kg (992 lb) without its transmission, only 38% of the weight of the Panther's standard Maybach HL230 V-12 gasoline fueled piston engine. The engine would have given the Panther II an increased 200 hp, which would have made it faster than its predecessor, though it was heavier. Thus, plans to replace the original Panther design with the Panther II were already underway before the first Panther had even seen combat. But from May to June 1943 a final meeting was held at M.A.N where it was decided that production of the Panther II would cease, and work would focus on the Panther I. It is not clear if there was ever an official cancellation ‚Äì this may have been because the Panther II upgrade pathway was originally started at Hitler's insistence. = Crew = The Panther II required five crew members to operate, its turret accommodated three crew members, the commander, gunner and loader whilst the driver and radio operator sat in the hull, in an arrangement identical to the Panther I.  Surviving vehicles  One prototype hull was completed and captured by US forces. It was taken to Aberdeen Proving Ground, and then later moved to the Patton museum. A Panther Ausf. G turret was placed on the Panther II hull as a placeholder.

Certified by the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel. An agricultural drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle used to help optimize agriculture operations, increase crop production, and monitor crop growth. Sensors and digital imaging capabilities can give farmers a richer picture of their fields. Using an agriculture drone and gathering information from it may prove useful in improving crop yields and farm efficiency. Agricultural drones let farmers see their fields from the sky. This bird's-eye view can reveal many issues such as irrigation problems, soil variation, and pest and fungal infestations. Multispectral images show a near-infrared view as well as a visual spectrum view. The combination shows the farmer the differences between healthy and unhealthy plants, a difference not always clearly visible to the naked eye. Thus, these views can assist in assessing crop growth and production. Additionally, the drone can survey the crops for the farmer periodically to their liking. Weekly, daily, or even hourly, pictures can show the changes in the crops over time, thus showing possible ‚Äútrouble spots‚Äù. Having identified these trouble spots, the farmer can attempt to improve crop management and production. Legality As drones entered use in agriculture, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) encouraged farmers to use this new technology to monitor their fields. However, with the unexpected boom of agricultural drones, the FAA quickly retracted such encouragement, pending new rules and regulations. With incidents such as drones crashing into crop dusters, it was vital for the FAA and the AFBF (American Farm Bureau Federation) to agree on regulations that would allow the beneficial use of such drones in a safe and efficient manner. In 2016, the FAA published the long-awaited rules for commercial drone operations. Commonly referred to as Part 107, the full citation is: Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 14. Aeronautics and Space, Chapter I. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, Subchapter F. AIR TRAFFIC AND GENERAL OPERATING RULES, Part 107. SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS. These rules require that commercial drone operators pass a knowledge exam, register their aircraft, and fly in accordance to published restrictions. Although the American Farm Bureau Federation would like small adjustments to some of the restrictions that have been implemented, they are happy that the agricultural industry can actually use this new machinery without the worry of facing any legal issues. Many countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Australia have made laws regarding use of drones. The EU is moving towards a common set of drone regulations for all of its members. However, such laws are still nonexistent in many countries around the world making it difficult to determine how to provide legal drone services, and 15 countries have outlawed all drone operations. Security and ethics Other companies might start flying their drones in unregulated areas to survey their competition and get to know the condition of crops and agricultural yield. Such a scenario could lead to compromising vital company secrets. People want to know that they are safe and protected, so the burden doesn‚Äôt just fall on the farmer, but on many of those around the farmer, too. The use of agricultural drones has ethical and social implications. One benefit is that they are able to monitor and control the use of pesticides properly. This allows minimizing the environmental impact of pesticides. However, drones don't need access authority to flying overs someone's property at under 400 feet (130 m) altitude. They may have microphones and cameras attached, and the resulting concern for potential privacy violation has caused some opposition towards drones. Future use There is a large capacity for growth in the area of agricultural drones. With technology constantly improving, imaging of the crops will need to improve as well. With the data that drones record from the crops the farmers are able to analyze their crops and make educated decisions on how to proceed given the accurate crop information. Software programs for analyzing and correcting crop production have the potential to grow in this market. Farmers will fly a drone over their crops, accurately identify an issue in a specific area, and take the necessary actions to correct the problem. This gives the farmer time to focus on the big picture of production instead of spending time surveying their crops. Additional uses include keeping track of livestock, surveying fences, and monitoring for plant pathogens.

She specialised in the archaeology of Romano-British Northern England but was also involved in excavations outside the United Kingdom and the Roman period. Her 1935 work, A Gazetteer of Roman Remains in East Yorkshire, \\"remains one of the starting points for any study of the Romans in the north of England\\". Early life and education Kitson Clark was born on 14 May 1905 in Leeds, Yorkshire, England. She was the youngest of three children born to Edwin Kitson Clark (1866‚Äì1943) and Georgina Kitson Clark (n√©e Bidder); an elder brother was the historian George Kitson Clark. Her paternal grandfather was Edwin Charles Clark, Regius Professor of Civil Law at Cambridge University, and her maternal great-grandfather was George Parker Bidder, an eminent engineer. Kitson Clark was first educated at home and then at Leeds Girls' High School, a selective independent school in Leeds. She then matriculated into Girton College, Cambridge to study the history tripos. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, she remained at the University of Cambridge to study for the one-year diploma in archaeology. Career Kitson Clark belonged to the generation of amateur archaeologists who remained as independent scholars; over her lifetime she \\"witnessed the decline in influence of the amateur, independent scholar, and the rise of a professional class of archaeologist and historian\\". From 1929 to 1943, she was secretary of the Roman Antiquities Committee for Yorkshire; her father had been its treasurer. During this time, she published her magnum opus, A Gazetteer of Roman Remains in East Yorkshire (1935). It was described in 1990 as a \\"well- loved, well-thumbed classic\\", and according to her obituary in The Independent \\"remains one of the starting points for any study of the Romans in the north of England\\". From 1941 to 1943, she was also the curator of Roman Antiquities at the Yorkshire Museum in York. After her marriage in 1943, Kitson Clark remained a member of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society (which, among other things, ran the Yorkshire Museum), becoming its longest-lived Vice-President. After the death of her husband in 1971, she continued her research. She published a two-volume monograph on The Monks of Ynys Enlli (1992, 2000); the last volume was published just after her 95th birthday. Kitson Clark was involved in a number of archaeological excavations. She excavated at a number sites in East Yorkshire, and published her findings in Gazetteer of Roman Remains in East Yorkshire (1935). In 1929, she went to Palestine and worked on the Dorothy Garrod led excavations of palaeolithic sites. In 1935, she was part of a team that excavated Petuaria, a Roman fort in Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire. Personal life During her involvement in the 1929 excavations in Palestine, Kitson Clark met her future husband Derwas James Chitty (1901‚Äì1971); he was also an archaeologist and an Anglican priest. On 5 July 1943, she married Chitty. Together they had one child, a daughter. They then lived in Upton, Berkshire, where he served as its vicar. After he retired from full-time ministry in 1968, they lived in Llangwnnadl, Caernarfonshire, Wales. Her husband died in 1971 after a \\"domestic accident\\". In her obituary in The Independent it stated that after his death \\"Mary was much comforted by her strong Christian beliefs\\". On 1 February 2005, Kitson Clark died at M√¥r Awel, Llangwnnadl, at the age of 99. Her funeral and a Requiem Mass were held at St Gwynhoedl's Church in Llangwnadl on 5 February 2005. Honours On 13 January 1938, Kitson Clark was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA): at the time of her death she was the \\"last surviving fellow elected before the Second World War\\". In 1985, a conference was held in her honour by British Romanists; the proceedings of this conference were later published as Recent Research in Roman Yorkshire: studies in honour of Mary Kitson Clark (Mrs Derwas Chitty) (1988).

Known for opposing unionization of hotel workers and conflicts with Seattle city government, he has been audited multiple times. The R.C. Hedreen Company has built the Seattle Hilton Hotel, the Grand Hyatt, the Olive 8, the Hyatt Regency Seattle and other Seattle skyscrapers. Early Life Richard C. Hedreen was born in 1935 and attended Garfield High School. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1957 with a Bachelor's of Science in Civil Engineering. Career =1960s-1980s= In 1963 Hedreen began developing properties in Seattle; he built the 11-story Harbor House apartment building in Queen Anne for $1.6 million. Later that year he was named a board member of the Home Builders' Association of Greater Seattle. In 1967 Hedreen began building the 24-story Washington Park Tower in the Madison Park neighborhood. It took several years for permits to be issued for the structure after community protestors petitioned Seattle City Council to change rezoning laws and delayed construction. Freeway Park grounds with the Park Place building and parking garage entrance (left) In 1969 Hedreen began building the 27-story Seattle Hilton Hotel in downtown Seattle. Initially permitted as a 10-story parking garage adjacent to the Washington Athletic Club, Hedreen revealed that the structure was really the Hilton after Seattle interm-mayor Floyd C. Miller announced plans for nearby Freeway Park, part of the Forward Thrust initiative. Hedreen was developing the 22-story Park Place building on the site of the park. Miller and Hedreen reached an agreement where Hedreen would help develop the park and underground parking and still be allowed to build the Park Place building. Hedreen also opposed the City Council's decision to convert the nearby Wilhard Hotel into low- income housing for senior citizens. The $10 million Hilton Hotel opened in November 1970. Hedreen built the Crown Plaza Hotel (then called the Park Hilton) in 1979 and sold it to Holiday Inn for $32.5 million in 1983; and the Madison Renaissance in 1983. Hedreen was elected to the Seattle Art Museum (SAM) board of trustees in 1978, serving as chairman for the museums' Westlake construction committee that oversaw the construction of Westlake Mall, and disputed with mayor Charles Royer over who would develop it. In 1989 Hedreen purchased the historic Music Hall theatre with plans to demolish the it and build a 31-story hotel. Community activists, led by Allied Arts of Seattle, attempted to preserve the entertainment venue as a historic landmark, but it was demolished in 1992 and is currently an office building. Hedreen sued the city for $10 million after the activists delayed the project. =1990s-2020s= By the mid-1990s downtown Seattle's commercial building boom had slowed down. In 1992 Hedreen's Jefferson Square, a mixed-use apartment building in West Seattle, was foreclosed upon by Washington Mutual over an $18 million debt. Built in 1987, it had low occupancy and was criticized for being \\"ugly.\\" In 1996 Hedreen's company replaced Trammel Crow as the developer of a $144 million expansion of the Washington State Convention and Trade Center. In 2001 Hedreen developed the Elliot (later the Grand Hyatt) luxury hotel. A city ordinance allowed property developers \\"to exceed size limits on buildings if they agree to pay for low-income apartments, day care or open space as part of the project.\\" Hedreen had $6 million worth of \\"unused and expired bonus credits\\" from the convention center expansion and construction of the Elliott. In 2002 Hedreen hired land-use attorney Ryan Durkan and lobbyist Jamie Durkan (children of politician Martin Durkan and siblings of future Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan) to petition Seattle City Council to allow Hedreen to apply those credits for future projects. This was criticized for costing the city $6 million of affordable housing. The union \\"Hotel Employees and Restaurant Workers Local 8\\" protested the ordinance; Council member Nick Licata was vocally opposed, stating \\"He made a deal, and he wants the city to recoup the losses.\\" The legislature passed the council vote 5-3, with Peter Steinbrueck abstaining. The ordinance extended the life of the credits from 3 years to 20 and allowed it to be transferable between properties. Affordable housing activists, Licata and the union pressured mayor Greg Nickels to veto the legislature. Nickles was elected as a pro-union candidate and received opposition from hotel owners; but shortly after Nickels was sworn in Hedreen contributed to the mayors 2005 re-election campaign. Nickles vetoed the legislature, stating \\"changing the land-use rules for the sole benefit of one party is bad public policy.\\" This was considered a major win for organized labor, which had attempted to negotiate with Hedreen to allow his hotel employees to organize a union in exchange for support of the legislature, which Hedreen rejected. The veto was criticized by Walt Crowley of Allied Arts and Hedreen argued that he had made a \\"handshake deal\\" with former mayor Norm Rice to transfer the credits. The mayor's veto caused controversy for city council members; Judy Nicastro spoke publicly against Nickles and the union, whom she called bullies. Nicastro and fellow council member Heidi Wills were criticized for supporting the Hedreen legislation after being elected as left- wing, pro-affordble housing candidates. Both Nicastra and Wills lost their re- election bids after the Strippergate scandal. The Hyatt Regency Seattle under construction in 2017. Later in 2002 Hedreen and other SAM board members reached a deal with Washington Mutual to build the 42-story WaMu Center adjacent to the museum, tripling SAM's size. In 2005 Hedreen began construction on the Olive 8 building, utilizing Gluckman Tang Architects (a design firm better known for its work on art museums). In 2015 Hedreen began building the 45-story Hyatt Regency Seattle. He bought part of the land (site of the city's historic Greyhound Lines bus station) in 1995 and tried for years to develop it. In 2012 he purchased an adjacent plot of land and planned to develop the entire L-shaped parcel into one large 50-story building, but in 2015 building permits were revoked after pressure from hotel workers union Unite Here Local 8. Called the \\"Hedreen loophole\\", the combination of the two lots would have increased ground floor space and allowed Hedreen to not pay $3 million towards affordable housing. In a press conference outside the site, Seattle City Council member Mike O'Brien called for an audit and stated \\"They‚Äôre [the city auditor] going through to ensure that we, the people of Seattle, are getting every penny we deserve.‚Äù The remainder of the property is proposed to be the 34-story 824 Howell hotel building, currently being reviewed. In 2014 employees of the Hyatt attempted to negotiate unionizing with Hedreen through Unite Here Local 8, but no deal was reached. In 2017 Hedreen was part of the Seattle Hospitality for Progress PAC and Washington Hospitality PAC's lawsuit against the city over Initiative 124, a voter approved legislation which gave \\"hotel workers more protections against sexual harassment and assault.\\" Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan was criticized by Unite Here Local 8 for not taking a stand against the lawsuit, and received $50,000 from the PACs ($20,000 from Hedreen) during her mayoral campaign. Initiative 124 was overturned by the Washington State Court of Appeals in 2018. In 2018 Hedreen opposed the Seattle head tax, which would have raised $50 million per year to fund homeless services. In 2019 he was part of CASE, the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce's PAC, which donated money to pro-business candidates during the City Council election. Its members included Martin Selig, Amazon and Hedreen and unsuccessfully opposed pro-union candidates like Tammy Morales, Kshama Sawant and District 7's Andrew J. Lewis (whom Unite Here Local 8 supported). Art Collector Hedreen and his wife Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" (Petri) Hedreen are well-known art collectors. Their collection has included works by Pablo Picasso, Jasper Johns, and Anselm Kiefer. They have appeared on the ARTNews list of the world's top art collectors. A billionaire, Hedreen was audited in 1984, and again in 2004 when Washington state auditors issued him a fine for \\"$25 million, including penalties and interest, for the previous four years' worth of art purchases.\\" The Tom Otterness sculpture \\"The Miser\\" was displayed outside the lobby of Hedreen's Grand Hyatt Hotel, and has been called the \\"worst statue in Seattle.\\" In 2015 the Hedreen's donated James Rosati's sculpture Loo Wit to the Jesuit-run Seattle University, where it is displayed outside on the campus grounds. In 2011 Hedreen purchased a Frans Hals painting from Sotheby's for $10 million. In 2016 the painting was found to be a forgery and Hedreen was refunded.

Campbell originally settled in the Colony of Sierra Leone and traded in the Nunez River, Guinea. There he was a Member of His Majesty's Colonial Council of Sierra Leone and was thus accorded the title of 'Honorable'. In 1841 papers were found aboard the Segunda Rosario, a ship engaged in the slave trade condemned at the Havana Mixed Commission Court. This raised concerns that Campbell was involved in the slave trade. When Campbell was subsequently investigated, he replied that he had been engaged in trade with Niara Bely (aka Isabela Lightbourn) for sixteen years but only as regards legitimate commodities such as ivory, hides, wax, gold and coffee. Although Mrs Lightbourn also herself engaged in the slave trade, Campbell denied any personally involvement, and indeed claimed that he had suffered personal losses following the destruction of his property on the Nunez River, owing to his opposition to the slave trade. He was appointed as Consul in Lagos on 21 July 1853 and served in this capacity until his death on 17 April 1859.

The Globe also reported that another key investor, grocery entrepreneur Yuansheng Ou Yang who is a director of the bank, misrepresented his credentials on the bank's website. It claimed he had served as a member of the National People's Congress, which is the parliament of the People's Republic of China, and the People's Political Consultative Conference, a political advisory board to the Chinese government. Four of the directors of the bank, including the chairman and chief executive, acknowledged the website information was incorrect. On November 28, 2016, WOBC responded to The Globe and Mail, pointing out that : \\"like every other Schedule 1 bank in Canada, WOBC had to go through an exacting and rigorous process under the Bank Act and OSFI. It's one of the toughest processes in the world. And it's the key reason why the Canadian banking system is so highly regarded internationally. We're very proud of the fact that WOBC met those stringent standards. Far from 'murky', WOBC submitted itself to unrelenting and intense scrutiny and complete transparency ‚Äì and we more than met the test.\\" The WOBC letter pointed out that all the regulatory conditions that the bank was required to meet were set during the mandate of the previous (Harper) government.

The daughter of the last British Ambassador to Imperial Russia, she wrote a number of articles and books about her experiences during that time, most notably: Recollections of imperial Russia ( 1923) and Ambassador's daughter (1958).  Life  Meriel was the only child of Sir George Buchanan (1854-1924), and his wife Lady Georgina Meriel Bathurst (1863-1922). As her father was a career diplomat, Meriel early life was spent in the many countries where her father was posted: Hesse, Baden, Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.McCarthy, Women of the World\\", p.36 In 1910 the Buchanan family moved to Saint Petersburg, when Sir George Buchanan was appointed as the British Ambassador to Russia. In her early twenties at her arrival in Russia in 1910, she had a prominent position as the daughter of the British Ambassador at the court of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. This allowed her to meet many important figures at the Imperial Court. She was particularly close to Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna of Russia who took her under her wing.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 255 Meriel was popular in social circles and carried out a flirtation with Duke Alexander Georgievich of Leuchtenberg, a great grandson of Tsar Nicholas I and a distant cousin of Tsar Nikolai II. Duke Alexander, was the son of George Maximilianovich, 6th Duke of Leuchtenberg, and Duchess Therese Petrovna of Oldenburg. Both sets of parents were opposed to their romance. The Duke of Leuchtenberg refused his permission because Meriel, although daughter of a distinguished ambassador and possessing royal blood herself, was not considered the social equal of Alexander and did not have a sizable fortune.Sullivan, A Fatal Passion, p. 256 Meriel‚Äôs parents realized the impossibility of the situation and were fearful of a diplomatic scandal.

She worked at RAE Farnborough, where she headed the Wind Tunnels Section. Here she mentored many of the younger male engineers who joined the RAE.  Early Life and education  Frances Bradfield was born in 1895, in Leicester, and in 1914 \\"came up\\" to Newnham College, Cambridge, graduating with a second class BA degree in Mathematics in 1917.  Royal Aeronautical Establishment  Sometime after graduating from Cambridge, probably around 1919, Bradfield joined the Royal Aerospace Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, Hampshire, where she spent her entire career research aeronautics and specialising in Wind tunnel research. Bradfield's earliest published research at the RAE - credited gender ambiguously to \\"F.B. Bradfield\\" - was published in December 1919 on \\"Wind channel test of Bristol Pullman body.\\" During her first decade and beyond, Bradfield published her wind tunnel research with great prolificity, publishing two research papers most years. In the early 1930s (before 1934), Bradfield worked with George Douglas then Head of Wind Tunnels at RAE Farnborough as his mathematician. Her job was to liaise between Hermann Glauert, then Head of Aerodynamics Department, and Douglas. Glauert was killed in an accident in 1934 and so Douglas was appointed Head of Aerodynamics Department and Bradfield became the Head of Wind Tunnels (more informally known as the small wind tunnel section of the model research department), a role she held for the remainder of the 1930s and throughout World War II. In 1935, Bradfield appeared in the Imperial Calendar and Civil Service list for this year. Not being an engineer, Bradfield insisted on having Charles Callen as her supporting engineer, in order to ensure that what they did in the wind tunnels was sound engineering-wise. In March 1939, Bradfield in collaboration with D.L. Ellis presented a paper before the Royal Aeronautical Society on \\"The Use of Model Data in Aeroplane Design,\\" published in the Women Engineer. In November 1939, Bradfield was listed as a Senior Scientific Officer at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at RAE Farnborough. In December 1941, Bradfield was one of the two female Associate Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society doing \\"important work\\" at RAE Farnborough. By 1946, when Johanna Weber joined the Low Speed Wind Tunnels division at RAE Farnborough, Bradfield was head of the Aerodynamics Department. Bradfield's female colleagues at RAE Farnborough included Weber and Beatrice Shilling. Awards and recognition At some point between 1919 and 1935, Bradfield became a member of the Women's Engineering Society (WES) but was not a particularly active member and was only mentioned occasionally in their journal, The Women Engineer. Bradfield became a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society (FRAeS) in 1944 and won their Bronze Medal in 1949. In 1947 Bradfield was awarded an OBE in recognition of her role as Principal Scientific Officer at RAE Farnborough.  Later life  Bradfield died in Poole in 1967. A former colleague, John Green, described Bradfield, known as 'Miss B.', as \\"an exacting but kindly boss who had a powerful influence on the generation of young graduates who were posted into Aerodynamics Department at the beginning of the war ‚Äì an influence that they carried with them through their later careers into senior positions.\\" Bradfield's biography was published by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography on 9 May 2019 as part of their support for the Women's Engineering Society's centenary.

Erected about 1885, it is the town's oldest surviving brick commercial building, built during a period of growth occasioned by the arrival of the railroad in the village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The Billado Block stands in the village of Enosburg Falls, at the northwest corner of Bismarck Street and Main Street (Vermont Route 108N), a short way south of the former Missisquoi Railroad right-of-way. It is a three- story rectangular structure, built out of load-bearing red brick walls and covered by a flat roof. Its Italianate styling includes brick corner quoins brick hoods over segmented-arch windows, and a decorative cornice. The front facade is four bays wide, with the ground floor divided into two storefronts, each with plate glass windows flanking a recessed entrance. A banded brick pilaster, similar to the corner quoins, rises at the center of the facade. The ground floor is used for commercial purposes, while the second floor houses apartments. The third floor is open, and was probably used as a storage area when the building housed a general store. with The block was built about 1885 for William Billado, an immigrant from Canada who had established a general store in the village after moving there in 1876. Billado operated the general store on these premises, probably occupying one of the second-floor units as a residence, until his death in 1925. He rented a portion of the ground-floor space to a local bank, and the Enosburg Falls Bank acquired the entire building in 1960. It is now occupied by a successor via merger of that organization.

After the war she became a marriage guidance counsellor, then studied for a Master of Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. She worked at the university's Department of Social Administration and wrote several academic books about the psychological effects of divorce on children, including Someone to Turn to: Experiences of Help Before Divorce (1981) and Children in the Middle: Living Through Divorce (1985). Early life and education Ann Williamson was born in Oxford on 19 November 1922, to Herbert Stansfield Williamson and Winifred Lilian Williamson (' Kenyon). Herbert had previously worked in the Indian Civil Service; Winifred had helped organise one of the first family planning clinics in Britain. Mitchell gained a scholarship to Headington School, Oxford, from 1930 to 1939, before winning a place to study mathematics at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford, between 1940 and 1943. At the time relatively few women went to Oxford and even fewer studied maths. There were only five women in her year at Oxford and she remarked that the men coming to university had been taught maths much better at school than the girls. Indeed, it was suggested to her by the headmistress of her school that studying maths was \\"unladylike\\"; her parents had to overrule her school to allow her to take up her place at Oxford. Career =Second World War= Mitchell was recruited to work at Bletchley Park in September 1943 after she graduated from Oxford, and until May 1945 she worked in Hut 6 on German Army and Air Force Enigma decryptions. She was recruited as a temporary worker with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on an annual salary of ¬£150 (increased to ¬£200 after her 21st birthday). Much of her work involved converting 'cribs' into 'menus', the operating instructions for the Bombe decryption devices, to identify what that day's Enigma settings might be. The Germans changed their code every night at midnight, so Mitchell and the others had then to restart trying to crack the codes. Stuart Milner-Barry, the head of Hut 6, had difficulty recruiting enough men due to war demands and British civil service rules prevented men and women from working together on night shifts, so Mitchell worked solely with women in Hut 6. After the war, like others who worked at Bletchley, she was instructed to forget about her work there and never to talk about it. Once the work at Bletchley became public and the ban was lifted she gave many illustrated talks and interviews about her wartime role. Her story is included in the book The Bletchley Girls: War, Secrecy, Love and Loss: The Women of Bletchley Park Tell Their Story (2015) by the historian Tessa Dunlop. =Academic and social policy work= In the 1950s Mitchell worked as a marriage guidance counsellor with the Scottish Marriage Guidance Council (now known as Relate Scotland). In the 1970s she returned to university to study social policy and in 1980, she graduated with a Master of Philosophy from the University of Edinburgh. In the early 1980s she was research associate at the Department of Social Administration at the University of Edinburgh. Mitchell worked and published extensively on the subject of marriage breakup and divorce, and in particular on children's experience of family breakup. Her books include Someone to Turn To: Experiences of Help before Divorce (1981); When Parents Split Up (1982); Children in the Middle (1985); Coping with Separation and Divorce (1986); and Families (1987). They have been translated into a number of languages. Mitchell's work is referred to in several works on divorce in Scotland and further afield, and was used as supporting evidence in two reports by the Scottish Law Commission, \\"Family Law: Report on Aliment and Financial Provision\\" (1981) and \\"Report on Reform of the Ground for Divorce\\" (1989). In 2014, in an article in the Scots Law Times, the family law barrister Janys Scott QC reviewed Mitchell's work on the workings of the Scottish divorce court. Scott concluded that \\"Mitchell has had a profound influence on family law in Scotland\\", and that her 1985 book Children in the Middle was \\"a seminal work\\" in the field. =Historical research= In her seventies Mitchell researched and wrote about the history of Edinburgh. She published two books, The People of Calton Hill (1993) and No More Corncraiks: Lord Moray's Feuars in Edinburgh's New Town (1998). Personal life She married John Angus Macbeth Mitchell, known as Angus, on 13 December 1948; they had four children and lived in Edinburgh. He died in 2018 after retiring as a senior civil servant. During his life in the army, civil service and in the voluntary sector, he was awarded Companion of the Bath, Commander of the Royal Victorian Order and the Military Cross. Mitchell died on 11 May 2020, aged 97, in Edinburgh. She tested positive for COVID-19 shortly before her death.

Early life and education  Virginia Kline was born in Coleman, Michigan to father Ray Kline and mother Abbie Young Kline on July 14, 1910. She attended high school and college in Lansing, Michigan and eventually received her Bachelor of Science degree from Michigan State College in June 1931. Her undergraduate was completed at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and she obtained her Master's degree in June 1933, followed by her Doctor of Philosophy degree in geology in June, 1935 for her thesis entitled \\"Stratigraphy and Paleontology of the Silica Formation (Hamilton Age) of Southeastern Michigan\\". She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in library sciences several years later in May 1942.  Career  Kline started her career as a temporary stratigrapher in 1937, for the North Dakota Geological Survey in Grand Forks, North Dakota. During this time, she had the opportunity to spend most of her time in the field studying well samples, driller's logs, and fossil collections. Her first published work, \\"Stratigraphy of North Dakota\\" came as a result of the experience she acquired. Kline had a distinguished career working in her field of study for a number of companies in the Tri-State area of Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky during 1940. These companies included Michigan Oil Exploration, Chapman Minerals Corporation and Sohio Producing Company, where she worked as the only geologist for all three during the depression. During this time she became familiarized with the stratigraphic characteristics of the area, and proficient in tasks relating to sample studying and well-sitting. In 1941 she undertook consulting work in Lansing, Michigan, while simultaneously studying for her library sciences degree, eventually working briefly as the librarian for the Civil Engineering School at the University of Michigan. The following year, she accepted a position at the University of Mississippi as associate professor of geology in the Department of Geology, in addition to becoming an assistant geologist within the Mississippi Geological Survey. This position granted her the opportunity to co-author \\"Geology of Clay County, Mississippi\\", writing the section \\"Clay County Fossils: Midway Foraminifera and Ostracoda\\". In 1943, during World War II, Kline became assistant petroleum analyst in the Chicago Office of Petroleum Administration. In November 1944 she accepted a position at the Illinois State Geological Survey as an Associate Geologist in the Oil and Gas section, where she worked for fourteen years until her death in 1959, making many contributions to the knowledge of geology. In 1946, she became a member of the AAPG.  Applications of science  During her college days, Kline co-authored the publication titled \\"Revision of Alexander Winchell's Types of Brachiopods from the Middle Devonian Traverse Group of Rocks of Michigan.\\" This publication was an integral piece of literature illustrating the role that women played in geology and showed that science and specifically geology was still evolving during her time. This work also highlights the connection to the concept that science is an ongoing process of understanding knowledge that develops alongside new discoveries and ideas. Historically speaking, many amendments have been made in the name of science to fit newly available data, as illustrated by Ehlers' and Kline's work in correcting previous interpretations of strata, using Steno's rules of stratigraphy. The consequence of which revamps the fossil index of the area, which in turn dictates to companies that are invested in drilling a new approach in looking for areas to commit resources, but also challenging the established thoughts on the history of the area. As Kline's career continued she became heavily involved within the field of petroleum geology and more importantly stratigraphy and fossil indexing. In 1942, while working as an associate professor and geologist at the University of Mississippi, Kline conducted an extensive summary of the lithology and distribution of Geological formations within the state. Nearing the end of her time at the University of Mississippi, Kline co-authored another important publication on describing and illustrating microfossils, a topic that had only briefly been explored, showing again that science is an evolving process, created through the assimilation of new discoveries and existing understanding.  Contributions to science  Earning a doctorate in earth sciences was a considerable accomplishment considering that between 1920‚Äì1970 women obtained less than 4 percent of all doctorates awarded in this field. Furthering the advancement of how women were perceived in geology, a majority of Kline's career was heavily focused on fieldwork, which was uncommon for women at the time where even women professors advocated against office or laboratory work. Kline's contributions are highlighted by the fact that not only was she a women in a field dominated by men at the time, she was also the only geologist for three companies at the same time, and eventually earned enough respect to author her own work, and eventually came to be the sole author on reports put out by the Illinois Geological Survey.
