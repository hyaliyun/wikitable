It also gives federal district and appellate courts jurisdiction over these proceedings.Curtis, Russell H. Important Federal Statutes Annotated. Chicago: Callaghan and Co., 1891, p. 111. Congress had previously given the federal government the power to seek eminent domain in the Act of April 24, 1888 (\\"An act to facilitate the prosecution of works projected for the improvement of rivers and harbors\\", 25 Stat. 94), which provided for condemnation proceedings in order to improve rivers or harbors, and which also required the federal government to seek eminent domain only in state courts.Hughes, Robert M. Handbook of Jurisdiction and Procedure in United States Courts. St. Paul, Minn.: West, 1913, p. 199. It amended this act on June 29, 1906, to permit condemnation proceedings even if the exercise of eminent domain solely benefited private parties. But the Condemnation Act of 1888 is much broader than either of these other statutes, as it allows any federal official to seek condemnation proceedings, allows condemnation for any \\"public purpose\\", and allows federal officials to proceed in either federal or state court. The authority of federal officials to exercise their powers under the Act was challenged by private citizens and the state of Missouri in the 1940s. In United States v. Carmack, 329 U.S. 230 (1946), the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the federal government's eminent domain powers under the Condemnation Act and further upheld the government's right to exercise eminent domain over land containing buildings owned by a state or local government.Dimitrakopoulos, Dionyssis G. Individual Rights and Liberties Under the U.S. Constitution: The Case Law of the U.S. Supreme Court. Boston: M. Nijhoff, 2007, p. 820. In United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry. Co., 160 U.S. 668 (1896), the Supreme Court held that the Condemnation Act covered condemnation to acquire land for historic preservation purposes. This is a crucial precedent establishing broad federal authority to preserve historic sites.Byrne, J. Peter. \\"Hallowed Ground: The Gettysburg Battlefield in Historic Preservation Law.\\" Tulane Environmental Law Journal. 22:203 (Summer 2009), p. 222. The Supreme Court also relied on a general reading of the Act in Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246 (1934), when it decided that the highest value of a piece of land could be taken into consideration in eminent domain proceedings but was not the only factor to be used in determining the fair market value of the land. The Condemnation Act was still in force as of 2005.Croddy, Eric and Wirtz, James J. Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History. Santa Barbara, Calif.: ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 429.

History Norwalk was granted a town charter by the Connecticut General Court in 1651. On May 29, 1678, town records mention the establishment of community-supported teaching activities with a passage that reads: :\\"At a town meeting... voted and agreed to hier a scole master to teach all the children in ye town to lerne to Rede and write; and that Mr. Cornish shall be hierd for that service and the townsmen are to hier him upon as reasonable terms as they can.\\" The school that was established in the 1670s was located near the Ludlow Square area of East Norwalk (near the former Roger Ludlow Junior High School). In the 2005-06 fiscal year, the school system spent $26.7 million on special education services, nearly 20 percent of the total school budget. The State Education Department announced on January 28, 2008 that Norwalk was one of twelve districts in the state that it would help to close student achievement gaps. High schools There are three high schools in the Norwalk public school district, for grades 9-12: *Norwalk High School is the home of the Norwalk Bears. The school was founded in 1902. *Brien McMahon High School, named for Senator Brien McMahon, first chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, was founded in 1960. Brien McMahon High School is also home to the Center for Global Studies. *Briggs High School is an alternative school. In 2006 the state of Connecticut reported that Norwalk's 653 graduates represented a 95.7% graduation rate. Middle schools There are four middle schools in the Norwalk public school district, for grades 6-8: *Nathan Hale Middle School *Ponus Ridge Middle School *Roton Middle School *West Rocks Middle School =Ponus Ridge Middle School= In the 2005-06 school year 42.3 percent of the school's 640 students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches. A total of 40.3 percent of students come from homes where the primary language is not English. The primary language for many students is Spanish, but students also come from homes where Chinese or Haitian Creole are spoken. The school building was constructed in the late 1950s. On May 14, 2007, several state legislators toured the school in an attempt by Fairfield County lawmakers to educate them about the need for more state education funding in the richest county in the state.Chamoff, Lisa, \\"Legislators tour Norwalk school: City would like larger slice of state funds\\", news article in The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, May 15, 2007, pp 1, A4 =Roton Middle School= In the 2002-03 school year 27.5 percent of the school's 517 students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches. A total of 34.2 percent of students come from homes where the primary language is not English. The school building was constructed in 1966. Elementary schools There are twelve elementary schools in the Norwalk public school district, for grades K-5: *Brookside *Columbus (magnet school) *Cranbury *Fox Run *Jefferson (magnet school) *Kendall *Marvin *Naramake *Rowayton *Silvermine *Tracey (magnet school) *Wolfpit Radon levels in 2007-2008 State-mandated radon tests in early 2007 found rooms in five elementary schools with levels above the \\"federal action limit\\" of 4 picocuries per liter for the colorless, odorless gas. (The gas naturally occurs in Fairfield County and comes up from the ground from the decay of radium. It is the second leading cause of lung cancer, after smoking.) The 700 tests, conducted every five years by state law, found actionable levels of radon in Rowayton, Naramake, Cranbury and Wolfpit elementary schools as well as Richard C. Briggs High School. Mitigation work, including air-suction devices, was done on just over a dozen rooms at the various schools, then a follow-up test was done which found one Wolfpit classroom located farthest away from the air-suction devices still had 5.1 picocuries per liter, so an additional device was installed in early March 2008.Chamoff, Lisa, \\"Radon levels reduced at 5 schools: But Wolfpit Elementary faces more tests\\", The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, Norwalk edition, p A11, A13, March 18, 2007 = No Child Left Behind Act in Norwalk= In 2006, all high schools, three of the city's middle schools and nine of its elementary schools, along with a \\"community school\\" were cited as falling behind in standards for the federal \\"No Child Left Behind\\" Act.

Cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds bearing precipitation follow immediately after the passage of the wall-like bar. Altostratus, cirrostratus and cirrus clouds are usually visible in ascending order above the top of the bar, while the wind direction for an observer facing toward the bar is typically from the left and slightly behind the observer. History The dark layer of clouds on the horizon seen prior to a tropical cyclone's passage over a location was first described in 1687 and the observed phenomenon later published in 1697 by William Dampier while observing a typhoon in the South China Sea during a circumnavigation by pirate ship. These observations led to an improved understanding of the nature of tropical cyclones. The use of \\"bar\\" as a term to describe this cloud layer first appeared in the 19th century. Inside the bar The basic vertical structure of a mature tropical cyclone. The bar appears as the storm's main disk of initially the upper storm clouds followed by the lower clouds as viewed from a distance, and gaps exist in the rainbands after the bar passes over. When the bar of the storm approaches an observer, it appears stationary in azimuthal position, whereas a storm moving toward the observer at an angle or perpendicular to the observer will appear to drift along the horizon. A reddish tint sometimes appears toward the top of the bar, while the darkness often varies depending on the storm's intensity. Tints of indigo, green, yellow or violet may also be present depending on the time of day due to the prismatic effect of water droplets in the cloud. Cumulus clouds first appear at the outflow boundary of the lower part of the bar. As the bar passes overhead, barometric pressure at the observer's location falls steadily. The first rainband arrives, the clouds moving from left to right roughly along isobar lines, but this is often followed by short periods of relative calm. During the onset of the bar's arrival, winds continuously increase in intensity leading toward the eyewall. Navigators of ships at sea often use the first appearance of a bar to steer clear of the approaching tropical cyclone. Closer to the center of tropical cyclone, the eyewall also exhibits the appearance of a bar, and high lightning activity occurs within this central bar. After the bar passes through, the strongest winds and often the heaviest precipitation abruptly changes to calmer conditions within the eye, before the eyewall passes over again and the strongest winds arrive from the opposite direction. At sea, wind speeds typically reach level 8 on the Beaufort scale while waves become drastically higher when the bar reaches overhead and squall lines begin to arrive.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands close to All Saints Church, and to the bell tower of the former Evesham Abbey. History The nave of the church St Lawrence's Church and its neighbour All Saints were built by the Benedictine monks of Evesham Abbey in the 12th century. The first documentary evidence of the church is in 1195, and it was dedicated by the Bishop of St Asaph in 1295 (probably a re-dedication following the Battle of Evesham in 1265). The church was significantly rebuilt in about 1470, replacing the earlier church. From 1659 it ceased to have its own vicar and was served by the clergy of All Saints. The fabric of the church deteriorated and by the winter of 1718 it had become unusable. Repairs started in 1737, but these were done badly, and the roof collapsed in 1800. The church was abandoned. In the early 19th century, Edward Rudge commissioned the architect Harvey Eginton, who carried out a major re-building in 1836‚Äì37. This included adding a north aisle in a similar style to the south aisle, and rebuilding the roof. During the 20th century, the size of the congregation declined. In 1978 the parish of St Lawrence united with that of All Saints, and St Lawrence's was declared redundant. It was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust the following year. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in stone with slate roofs. Its plan consists of a four-bay nave with a clerestory and north and south aisles, and a two-bay chancel. The aisles are almost as wide as the nave and continue beside the chancel, with the east end of the chancel protruding beyond them to form a short sanctuary. At the west end is a tower with a porch, and there is a chapel on the south side. The tower has diagonal buttresses, and a stair turret to its southeast. On the west side is a Perpendicular doorway, over which is a large four-light window. The top stage contains two-light bell openings. At the top of the tower is a parapet with pinnacles, and it is surmounted by a short spire. The Perpendicular east window is large, with six lights, almost filling the east wall of the chancel. There are gables at the east and west ends of both aisles, which contain three-light Perpendicular windows. In the north aisle are three-light Perpendicular windows, an ogee-arched crocketted doorway, a pierced parapet, and crocketted finials. The chapel projects from the south side of the church, with diagonal buttresses, a pierced parapet, and a five-light transomed south window. The stained glass window at the east end of the nave was created by Thomas Willement in 1862. =Interior= There is no chancel arch. Between the nave and the aisles are four-bay arcades, with Tudor-style arches carried on lozenge-shaped piers, and there is a three-bay arcade between the chancel and the chancel chapels. The stone reredos dates from 1838 and consists of canopies over inscriptions of the Creed, the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments. There are carved screens between the chancel and the aisles dating from about 1900. The Jacobean communion table was donated to the church in 1610. The wooden pulpit is polygonal. It dates from 1906, and contains carved figures of the Four Evangelists, Bishop Egwin, and Saint Lawrence. The font is medieval and consists of an octagonal bowl on an octagonal stem. The south chapel has a stone fan vaulted rood and a floor of encaustic tiles. It contains a copy of the medieval font. In the east window is stained glass of 1862 by Thomas Willement, which includes depictions of the Resurrection, the Last Supper, and coats of arms. The windows in the north and south sanctuary walls are by Gibbs. The east window in the south aisle dated 1847 is by O'Connor, and the east window in the chapel is by Hardman & Co. In the north aisle are three windows from the early part of the 20th century by Geoffrey Webb, and there are other windows from later in the 20th century by Evans and Co. of Smethwick, Paul Woodroffe of Stroud, A. L. Wilkinson and Francis Skeat. The two-manual organ was made by Nicholson of Worcester in 1867.

The group's sound has been described as a \\"diverse and eclectic blend of jazz, space rock, R&B;, electronic, ambient, Krautrock and folk music\\".  History  The group was founded in November 1996 by drummer Pat Thomas. Thomas is known for his work as a percussionist, record producer, music journalist and editor of Ptolemaic Terrascope. His credits as a producer of reissue recordings include albums by Aretha Franklin, Dusty Springfield, Television, and for Omnivore Recordings, artists such as Game Theory. Thomas is the author of the book Listen, Whitey: The Sights and Sounds of Black Power, a 2012 work of African-American cultural history centering on the Black Panther Party, with a concurrently released CD and double LP recording of speeches and protest songs. Mushroom released its first recording in 1997, a 12\\" single called \\"The Reeperbahn,\\" described by critic Fred Mills in Magnet as a recording that \\"could fool a blindfolded test applicant into thinking its 25-minute psych blowout was some long lost Krautrock epic from the early '70s. Let the band's wah-wah guitar, feedback violin, volcanic bass, jazzbo percussion, and tape loops take you down the fabled motorway, never to return to the place you once knew.\\" \\"The Reeperbahn\\" provided the basis for CDs released in 1998 in Holland and Germany. In 1999, the band released Analog Hi- Fi Surprise in the United States and Germany, followed by a European tour, by which time keyboard player Graham Connah had exited and was replaced by Michael Holt. Toronto music magazine Exclaim! wrote that the band \\"dish out the tastiest psychedelic funk you're ever likely to encounter. The groove's the thang as these tasty tracks cruise on Rhodes-driven jazz, ambient beats, surf riffs, and post rock textures. The band brew all these elements into a mixture that travels the outer realms of progressive funk. Like Tortoise jamming with the Grateful Dead or Soft Machine exploring the Funkadelic catalog, these loose open-ended excursions raise the art of fusion to a new plateau. While each track works a groove toward heady epiphany, the album as a whole refuses to stay locked into any one genre. Booker T-styled organ gyrations, rock guitar virtuosity, Bootsy Collins funk ups, ambient jazz, electronic beats, and Krautrock trance all make a stand, but the bottom line is that this is music that will move you, and then some.\\" The band then recorded Foxy Music (2001), which included trumpeter Jon Birdsong (known for his work with Beck). Q magazine in England wrote, \\"On the Foxy Music CD, the band steer away from determined psychedelia in favor of a friendly looseness to their playing. Jabs of electro-trombone and flute cluster alongside churning organ and splintered Rhodes Piano. Beck's trumpeter Jon Birdsong also turns on a great big blubbery blast of tuba, while musical director Patrick O'Hearn's clattering drums have an automaton rotary action that sometimes recalls Can's Jaki Liebezeit.\\" As of 2015, the members of Mushroom were Pat Thomas (congas, bongos, drum kit), Ned Doherty (bass), Erik Pearson (flute, violin, effects, acoustic and electric guitar, electric sitar), Dave Brandt (congas, bongos, vibes, djembe, gongs), Josh Pollock (acoustic guitar, vocals, megaphone electronics), Alison Levy (vocals), Ralph Carney (woodwinds/horns), Gram Connah (keyboards), Matt Cunitz (keyboards), Tim Plowman (guitar), Dan Olmsted (guitar), and Dave Mihaly (vibes, percussion).

They were commissioned through a competitive process by the United States Department of the Treasury. Some 1,400 murals were created for federal post office buildings in more than 1,300 U.S. cities. Murals still extant are the subject of efforts by the U.S. Postal Service to preserve and protect them. History As one of the projects in the New Deal during the Great Depression in the United States, the Public Works of Art Project (1933‚Äì34) was developed to bring artist workers back into the job market and assure the American public that better financial times were on the way. In 1933, nearly $145 million in public funds was appropriated for the construction of federal buildings, such as courthouses, schools, libraries, post offices and other public structures, nationwide. Under the direction of the Public Works of Art Project, the agency oversaw the production of 15,660 works of art by 3,750 artists. These included 700 murals on public display. With the ending of the Public Works of Art Project in the summer of 1934, it was decided that the success of the program should be extended by founding the Section of Painting and Sculpture (renamed the Section of Fine Arts in 1938) under the U.S. Treasury Department. The Section of Painting and Sculpture was initiated to commission 1,400 murals in federal post offices buildings in more than 1,300 cities across America. The Section focused on reaching as many American citizens as possible. Since the local post office seemed to be the most frequented government building by the public, the Section requested that the murals, approximately 12' by 5' oil paintings on canvas, be placed on the walls of the newly constructed post offices exclusively. It was recommended that 1% of the money budgeted for each post office be set aside for the creation of the murals. The Treasury Relief Art Project (1935‚Äì38), which provided artistic decoration for existing Federal buildings, produced a smaller number of post office murals. TRAP was established with funds from the Works Progress Administration. The Section supervised the creative output of TRAP, and selected a master artist for each project. Assistants were then chosen by the artist from the rolls of the WPA Federal Art Project. The Section and the Treasury Relief Art Project were overseen by Edward Bruce, who had directed the Public Works of Art Project. They were commission-driven public work programs that employed artists to beautify American government buildings, strictly on the basis of quality. This contrasts with the work-relief mission of the Federal Art Project (1935‚Äì43) of the Works Progress Administration, the largest of the New Deal art projects. So great was its scope and cultural impact that the term \\"WPA\\" is often mistakenly used to describe all New Deal art, including the U.S. post office murals. The murals are the subject of efforts by the U.S. Postal Service to preserve and protect them. This is particularly important and problematical as some of them have disappeared or deteriorated. Some are installed in buildings that are worth far less than the artwork. Process Whereas the Public Works of Art Project paid artists hourly wages, the Section of Fine Arts program awarded contracts to artists based on works entered in both regional and national competitions. For this purpose, the country was divided into 16 regions. Artists submitted sketches anonymously to a committee of their peers for judging. The committees, composed of art critics, fellow artists and architects, selected the finest works. These were then sent, along with the artists' names in sealed envelopes, to the Section of Fine Arts for ultimate selection. This anonymity was to ensure that all competing artists had an equal opportunity of winning a commission. However, many local painters felt they were being kept out of the process, with the majority of contracts going to the better known artists. Artists were asked to paint in an \\"American scene\\" style, depicting ordinary citizens in a realistic manner. Abstract and modern art styles were discouraged. Artists were also encouraged to produce works that would be appropriate to the communities where they were to be located and to avoid controversial subjects.David Lembeck. \\"Rediscovering the People's Art: New Deal Murals in Pennsylvania‚Äôs Post Offices\\". Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission: 2014. Projects were closely scrutinized by the Section for style and content, and artists were paid only after each stage in the creative process was approved. Controversies The selection of out- of-state artists sometimes caused controversy, such as stereotypes of rural people being portrayed merely as hicks and hayseeds and not having the murals express their cultural values and work ethics. Many residents of small towns, most notably in the Southern states, resented the portrayal of rural lifestyles by artists who had never visited the areas where their artwork would be displayed. The controversy was of particularly acute in Arkansas, where 19 post offices received murals, with two post offices, one in Berryville, Carroll County and another in Monticello, Drew County, receiving sculpture. For seven decades following the Civil War, Arkansas had been perceived as the epitome of poverty and illiteracy by the rest of the nation. Many Arkansans had dealt with hardship and tribulation on a daily basis and the coming of the Depression had not made life easier. Although the sketches of such renowned artists as Thomas Hart Benton and Joseph P. Vorst were based on actual events and people encountered during their travels across the state, they sometimes focused on the worst aspects of life in these rural towns. This was not the legacy that Arkansans wished to leave their children and grandchildren. They wanted the murals to give hope to the younger generation in overcoming adversity, and provide inspiration for a brighter future with better things to come. In some instances, artists were asked to submit multiple drawings before being accepted by the community. When approval was given by the local residents on the artists‚Äô final sketches, work on the murals proceeded, much to the satisfaction of all those involved.

Its focus is the history of the coal industry in Eastern Kentucky, featuring specific exhibits on the company towns of Benham and neighboring Lynch. It is housed in a former company store that was built by International Harvester in 1923. In June 1990, the Tri-City Chamber of Commerce purchased the building for the future site of the museum. After receiving additional grants from the state of Kentucky, the museum opened in May 1994.History of the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum benhamky.org. Retrieved on November 10, 2010 Built in the 1920s by International Harvester, the museum features four stories of exhibits on the mining history and the coal miner's life. Artifacts, antiques, photographs, and machinery make up more than 30 exhibits in the museum. Other activities for visitors include having their picture taken outside by the two- ton block of coal and learning about the formation of coal by looking at visuals and fossil displays. One of the most well known tours is the Portal 31 Underground Mine Tour. This tour allows visitors to ride a rail car through a coal mine that include sounds and animated exhibits. The museum provides education and better insight on the life of hard working coal miners and the pressures they faced while working in dangerous underground mines. One employee Phyllis Sizemore that worked at the museum said \\"I hope when visitors come to this museum that each are touched emotionally as well as intellectually. I hope they learn something but I hope they find food for thought, I hope their heart is touched as they read and learn about the lives of people and how these people lived and how they raise a family.\\" This museum has welcomed over 6,000 visitors each year. In April 2017 the Kentucky Coal Museum added 80 solar panels which cut $8,000 off its annual electricity bill. The Southeastern Kentucky Community and Technical College own the Kentucky Coal Museum and thanks to them they paid for the installation of the solar panels. The solar panels for the museum now generate 60 kilowatts of power at maximum capacity. In early January, recent issues have caught the attention of residents of Benham and Lynch located in Harlan County about surface mining close to these historical towns. This could damage water sources and block the view of the city which helps tourism. This could effect the Kentucky Coal Museum due to a decrease in tourism investments.  Exhibits  Throughout the museum visitors have access to numerous exhibits and displays on all four floors. Some include the Mock Mine, life of a coal miner and their family, community art mural of Benham, mining tools, Native American & early settler displays, coal camp displays, coal camp schools, coal camps as multicultural places, mine safety exhibits, and the Loretta Lynn Exhibit. Below is a list of exhibits on each floor.

Savu had little to interest traders from Europe, or neighbouring kingdoms, and it remained largely insular until the late-20th century. Geographical structure Savu originally had six independent domains, Teriwu, Liae, Dimu, Menia, Seba and Mesara. Menia was defeated by Seba in the 19th century, while Teriwu disappeared much earlier. A raja and fetor of each domain were appointed by the Dutch during colonial times. After independence Savu was split into two kecamatan, East Savu (Liae and Dimu) and West Savu (Seba and Mesara plus Raijua). In the 2000s, the political structure of Savu has been reorganised to more closely reflect traditional lines, which retained local significance over and above the arbitrary divisions imposed by the Indonesian government. The kecamatan now are Hawu Mehara, West Savu, Central Savu, East Savu, Liae, and Raijua. Genealogy kinship The people of Savu are inherent in having a small family. The Savu people practice bilateral descent, with descendants of one the udu (patrilineal groups) termed kerogo, as well as a matrilineal descendant that is traced to in Savu mythology to one of two sisters. The moiety of the two sisters is termed hubi; the hubi are divided into wini. Marriage is between a man and a woman of the same wini as his mother, or at a minimum within the same hubi. There is non-reciprocal gift-giving from the groom's family to that of the bride. Wini and hubi play a role in ceremonies such as weddings, funerals and baptisms. The conclusion of marriage is within the three-year union. The marital residence of a Savu family is patrilocal. Savu ikat (traditional weaving) reflect many aspects of Savu genealogy, including specific motifs and colours representing the weaver's hubu and wini.http://www.kitlv-journals.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/3100/3861 Savu people place importance on genealogy, tracking both hubi and kerogo back through many generations. Culture A Savu girl from Melolo, circa 1950. The Savu measure time in units that range from six to 49 years, depending on the domain. Savu people place great importance on their genealogy, with names chosen to avoid repetition, and genealogies recited during ritual performances such as at funerals, where the connection of the departed to his or her ancestors is memorialised. The memorising of genealogies has also been observed in neighbouring cultures, in Roti and Kedang. As with many others parts of Indonesia, betel nut is popular, as indeed is tuak, wine made from the sugar palm, as well as the sap, drunk fresh from the tree.http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/travel/history-and-lethargy-on-sabu- island/378141 The palm tree is treated with great respect, and the apu lodo priest, descendant of the sun supervises the palm tapping season. =Architecture= The Savu house is built on poles, and is designed to resemble a proa boat, with the front beams resembling its bow. There are also anthropomorphic elements in the terminology used to refer to parts of the house.http://kitlv.library.uu.nl/index.php/btlv/article/viewFile/1785/2546 =Music= Savu music is based on the gong,http://www.kab- kupang.go.id/tour/esabuculture.htm and normally accompanies traditional dance. The D'o'a dance, known as Pado'a in Kupang Lingua Franca is performed in a circle, holding hands, with dancers rotating their legs clockwise, wearing kedu'e (beans wrapped in palm leaf to create a rattle). Pado'a/pedo'a derived from Savunese \\"pe ƒèeja ƒèo'a\\". The Ledo Hawu dance is performed by mixed pairs, with the men wearing bells. Religion =Jingi Tiu= The traditional religion of Savu is called Jingi Tiu. Each of the domains of Savu was led by a Jingi Tiu Council of Priests. Jingi Tiu is a polytheistic religion, with gods of earth, sea and sky, as well as many more minor spirits. =Protestantism= Evangelism began in 1854, and increased its impetus after 1861, when Esser, Dutch resident of Kupang, called for schools and a Christian teacher from Ambon in Savu.Catholics in Indonesia: 1808 - 1942 : a documented history Since the 1970s, when the Indonesian encouraged people throughout Indonesia to adopt Islam or Christianity, Protestantism has been in the ascendancy, with 80% of Savu people now Protestan, and Jingi Tiu on the decline. Despite this, many aspects of Jingi Tiu belief still influence Christian worship in Savu. Occupation The traditional occupation of the Savu people is farming; where in some places irrigation system is used. Crops such as rice, corn, millet and beans are usually grown. The Savu people make sweet syrup and wine from the juice of a lone palm tree. Savu people also breed small cattle, buffaloes and horses, and practice cockfights. Apart from that, they also engage in fishing. Weaving and braiding is considered as part of traditional crafts. Settlements Their housing are framed columns with gable roofing. Traditional settlements are cumulus structured, with a temple and stone shrines in the center square, surrounded by stone walls. While the harvest is ripening, they would live in temporary huts in the fields.

He went to school in Kingston, Jamaica, and travelled to Great Britain in 1936. With the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the Merchant Navy.Lee (2009) p.279 Boxing career Flynn's first recorded professional fight, weighing in as a flyweight, was as a nineteen-year-old facing similarly inexperienced fighters in Kingston, Jamaica. After a draw against Kid Walcott, He faced Kid Bailey three times, winning twice and drawing once. There is no official record of another professional encounter until four years later in 1931 when Flynn faced Young Harvey at the Ward Theatre in Jamaica. On 23 April 1932 he faced St Andrew Pup for the Jamaican Lightweight title, though there is no record of this being a vacant title and neither men being the holder. Flynn stopped Pup for the first time in his career, taking the championship crown. Flynn held the title until relinquishing the belt after rising to lightweight and challenging Kid Silver on 12 November 1932. Flynn failed in his challenge but continued to fight in Jamaica winning the majority of his contest. In early 1936, and now fighting at the next weight level of welterweight, Flynn fought Kid Silver again this time for the Jamaican Welterweight title. Silver was disqualified in the eighth giving Flynn his second Jamaican boxing title. Flynn fought a few more bouts in Jamaica, before travelling to Britain to continue his career. His first British fight was against Joe Kerr, a future Scottish Lightweight champion, winning by technical knockout in the second round. He lost to Boyo Rees towards the end of 1936, but then beat Len 'Tiger' Smith in January 1937. In Britain Flynn was unable to challenge for any of the British belts, but was a popular attraction on boxing cards during his time in the country. He fought at The Stadium in Liverpool, Earls Court Arena and both the National Sporting Club and Kelvin Hall in London. Flynn beat several notable British boxers during his time in the UK, including British champion Ronnie James, EBU welterweight champion Ernie Roderick, Welsh middleweight champion Tommy Davies and Southern area title holder Arthur Danahar. In 1946, Flynn left the United Kingdom and travelled back to the Caribbean. On 30 April 1946 he faced the Venezuelan welterweight champion, J.J. Fernandez at Port-of- Spain in Trinidad and Tobago. Flynn lost the match on points. Although no record of his interim fights is available, in 1954 Flynn re-appears on the boxing scene in a challenge for the British Honduras welterweight title against Rudolph Bent. Bent won the contest by points, and in a rematch two months later in November Bent beat Flynn again, this time by technical knockout.

It was effective in 2007 for publicly traded entities, and is now effective for all entities adhering to US GAAP. A business may recognize an income tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained. The amount of benefit recognized is based on relative probable outcomes. Background and concept Income for financial statements may differ from taxable income for many valid reasons. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have long required that income tax be accrued for all events recognized for financial reporting purposes.APB 11, released in 1967, was later superseded by [ SFAS 109] which is now codified as AC 740. The tax must be accrued if the liability is probable of assertion and can be determined with reasonable accuracy.SFAS 5, 1975, now incorporating fair value concepts at AC 450-20. The tax must be recognized on all worldwide income of the business that may eventually be taxed. Credits expected to be claimed may reduce this tax. Certain limited exceptions apply. Thus, the total income tax of a U.S. company is generally the U.S. Federal income tax rate times book income, plus state and foreign taxes, less credits to be claimed presently or in the future. This tax expense is recorded as a combination of taxes currently payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities. In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 on the above rules. Under FIN 48, businesses must analyze all tax positions that are less than certain. Only those positions that are more likely than not to produce benefit can be recognized in accruing tax. This is known as the recognition step. The likely outcomes of recognized positions are then computed and assigned probabilities. The most favorable set of outcomes that achieves 50% probability is then recognized. This is known as the measurement step. The business must then record tax expense or benefit, liabilities, and assets, as so measured. Tax positions requiring analysis include all aspects of tax returns, including whether tax returns are filed in a jurisdiction. Further, businesses must accrue and disclose the effect of interest and penalties as part of the FIN 48 analysis. Recognition Income tax expense, just as any other expense, must be generally recognized when income is earned. Credits or other items that reduce this tax are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the reductions will be sustained by tax authorities. FIN 48 clarifies several aspects of this process: *Analysis is at the \\"unit of account\\" rather than in aggregate *The \\"more likely than not\\" standard applies at this level *It is presumed that all positions will be examined, and tax authorities will have full knowledge of all relevant information *Whether a position can be sustained is based solely on the technical merits of the position The level of detail of the analysis (unit of account) depends on how the business keeps its records, presents its financial statements, and deals with tax authorities. This may vary from business to business, and may change over time. Further, materiality is determined at the unit of account level. One key clarification is the presumption of examination of all positions by knowledgeable tax authorities and a resolution of disputes over those positions solely on the technical merits of each position. All relevant tax law is to be considered for the individual position. Positions that are not technically correct are allowed only where there is widely understood administrative practice allowing the position.One example of such position is expensing rather than capitalizing and depreciating small assets. See AC 740-10-25-7b. Thus, for example, a position would not be acceptable merely because an Internal Revenue Service agent allowed it in a previous year. Measurement If it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained, then the effect of the position must be measured. Measurement is a three-step process: *Determine possible outcomes of each position, *Determine the likelihood of such outcome, and *Determine the outcome that is most favorable with a cumulative likelihood of more than 50%. For example, assume a position exists which is more likely than not to be sustained at least in part. Management determines that it is 25% likely that $100 of benefit will be sustained, and 30% likely that $75 of benefit will be sustained. The business must accrue only $75 of benefit. Positions that are highly certain of full recognition may require very limited analysis. Disclosure In addition to accruing the tax, FIN 48 requires disclosures in footnotes to the financial statements. Year end statements must include: *A tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, *The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate, *Total interest and penalties recognized in the analysis, *Unrecognized tax benefits that may significantly change within 12 months of the financial statements, and *A description of tax years that remain subject to examination, by major applicable tax jurisdiction. Impact on Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses Parties involved in disposition of a business to US publicly traded companies need to take into account the potential that FIN 48 disclosures might alert relevant tax authorities to aggressive tax positions taken by the business. This may be of particular concern in countries such as Brazil with complex tax legislation. .

He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1809, became a scholar of the college, and graduated B.A. in 1813 as fourth wrangler. He was elected Fellow in 1815, and proceeded M.A. in 1816. He took holy orders, but he never held any preferment, except that he was rector of the family living of Porthkerry, Glamorgan, from 1830 to 1837,M. G. R.

He belonged to the liberal party in the university, led by George Peacock and Adam Sedgwick, Romilly's intimate friend. In 1821 he joined the committee for promoting a subscription in the university to aid the Greeks in their war of independence. He was one of the party who successfully opposed the petition which it was planned should be presented in 1829 against Catholic emancipation. He opposed Christopher Wordsworth, then master of Trinity, on the question of Connop Thirlwall's dismissal in 1834. On 23 March 1832 Romilly was elected registrary of the University of Cambridge after a competition with Temple Chevallier, and remained in this office until 1861, when he retired. His major work as registrary was the arrangement and cataloguing of all the university papers. He died suddenly at Yarmouth, of heart disease, on Sunday 7 August 1864, and was buried in a vault in Christ Church, Barnwell.

For example, with Wilkinson's catalyst, one triphenylphosphine ligand must dissociate to give the coordinatively unsaturated 14-electron species which can participate in the catalytic cycle: :Wilkinson's catalyst requires activation before it can participate in the catalytic cycle Similarly, for an autocatalytic reaction, where one of the reaction products catalyzes the reaction itself, the rate of reaction is low initially until sufficient products have formed to catalyze the reaction. Reactions generally accelerate when heat is applied. Where a reaction is exothermic, the rate of the reaction may initially be low. As the reaction proceeds, heat is generated, and the rate of reaction increases. This type of reaction often exhibits an induction period as well. The reactions to form Grignard reagents are notorious for having induction periods. This is usually due to two reasons: Firstly, the thin film of oxide on the magnesium reagent must be removed before the bulk magnesium can react. Secondly, Grignard reactions, while exothermic, are typically conducted at low temperature for better selectivity. For these two reasons, Grignard reactions often can have a long induction period, followed by a thermal runaway, even causing the reaction solvent to boil-off.

Signs and Symptoms * Blepharochalasis : Recurrent episodes of swelling cause stretching and atrophy of the upper eyelid skin. This results in the relaxation of the tarsal fold allowing tissue to slack over the palpebral fissure. In severe cases, the lower eyelid is also involved. * Double Upper Lip : Swelling causes duplication between the inner and outer parts of the upper lip. Occasionally the lower lip is involved. * Euthyroid Goiter : Occurs in 10% of cases. It is not usually associated with toxic symptoms. Goiter usually presents several years after initial eyelid and lip edema. Diagnosis Treatment Cosmetic surgery is generally the treatment of choice.Atzeni M, et al.

He is generally believed to have derived from the Gaulish god Ogmios and is cognate to the Irish hero Oghma Grianainech.Rhys, John. \\"All around the Wrekin\\" Y Cymmrodor. vol. XXI. 1908. p 62. Role in Welsh tradition Eufydd appears in a number of Welsh texts, spelled variously as Euuyd, Eueyed, Euyd and Ieunydd. He appears twice in the Book of Taliesin; first in Prif Gyfarch Taliesin in which it is stated: :I have been with skilful men :With Matheu and Gofannon :With Eunydd and Elestron :In company with Achwyson, :For a year in Caer Gofannon.W. FSkene, Four Ancient Books of Wales. I. p 286-287. and then again in Marwnat Aeddon: :When Aeddon come from the country of Gwydyen, the thickly covered Seon. :A pure poison came four nightly fine-night seasons. :The contemporaries fell, the woods were no shelter against the wind on the coast. :Math and Euuyd, skilful with the magic wand, freed the elements. :In the life of Gwydion and Amaethon, there was counsel.W. FSkene, Four Ancient Books of Wales. The implication is that Eufydd was remembered in Welsh tradition as a skilled magician, intimately associated with his more illustrious brothers Gwydion and Gofannon, and with his uncle Math fab Mathonwy. Eufydd also appears in the genealogical tract Bonedd yr Arwyr (The Descent of the Saints) in which he is listed among the children of D√¥n. =Associations with Hefeydd Hen= It has been suggested that Eufydd can be identified with Hefeydd Hen, the father of Rhiannon who appears prominently in the first branch of the Mabinogi.Anwyl,Edward.

He was born in Ft. Smith, Arkansas, but grew up in Texarkana, Texas. He received his BA degree in English and Studio Art from Tulane University in 1967. DeWoody received his MFA degree from Pratt Institute in 1975 in painting, new forms, and art history, studying under George McNeil. DeWoody is also a Professor at the New York Institute of Technology in New York City where he teaches drawing, painting, printmaking, and art history. He previously taught studio courses at New York University and the Philadelphia College of Art. Paintings, prints and sculpture DeWoody paints in acrylic on canvas and paper, makes prints using a variety of techniques, principally pochoir and screened monoprints, and creates sculptures, primarily in fabricated and painted steel. The style and subject matter of DeWoody's work has evolved significantly over the years. His earliest work was figurative. His work became totally abstract in the 1970s, when he created paintings and prints with collaged, multi-colored torn papers, which gave them a sculptural dimension, and a series of works incorporating abstracted towers and zig zags. He returned to figurative work in the 1980s and years since, but with a wide range of techniques and subject matter, in several series of works, including \\"heroic\\" portraits of sports figures and buildings. Most of these were created with a hard-edged pochoir technique which DeWoody adapted from the earlier French pochoir tradition. Subsequently, he moved to screened monoprinting for a series of portraits of \\"Perps\\", \\"Babes\\", and Asians. Most recently the Asian series has shifted to Asian-made objects: Japanese porcelain figures and Chinese plastic toys in conversation tableaux. DeWoody works regularly with master printer Roni Henning in Brooklyn and is featured in her book Water-Based Screenprinting Today: From Hands-On Techniques to Digital Technology (2006) and on her website. He has also designed theatre sets, illustrated books, painted fourteen Stations of the Cross for the Church of the Heavenly Rest in Manhattan, and designed a fountain and gateway at the Federal Courthouse in Texarkana, Texas-Arkansas. B'way Boog, one of his largest paintings (11' x 8'), hangs in the lobby of the office building at 1675 Broadway, New York City. His public steel sculpture Big Zig is installed at 60 Henry Street in Manhattan. Collections DeWoody's work is in many public, corporate, and private collections. These include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Library of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, the Museum of the Rhode Island School of Design, the Library of Congress, the Fitzwilliam Museum of Cambridge University, Rutgers University, the Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, and Time Warner. His work has also been reviewed in many publications, including the New York Times and Art News. Exhibitions DeWoody's work has been shown in many solo exhibitions, including in Gallery 61, Arthur Roger Gallery in New York City and New Orleans, and Mary Ryan Gallery in New York City, More Gallery in Philadelphia, Molly Barnes Gallery in Los Angeles. His work has also been shown in many group exhibitions, including the Century Association in New York City, the Meadows Museum of Art, Shreveport, Louisiana, and the Parrish Museum of Art, Southampton, New York. His work was included in a travelling exhibition entitled All-Stars: American Sporting Prints from the Collection of Reba & Dave Williams which was shown in numerous museums across the United States.

The sharks featured in the film were animatronic sharks built by Edge Innovations, who previously built sharks for movies such as Deep Blue Sea, Austin Powers in Goldmember, and even the Orca in Free Willy. According to Walt Conti, the head of Edge Innovations, two models for each shark were built. One \\"attacker\\" and one \\"swimmer.\\" Each of which required very different internal mechanisms. \\"Sharks are this total contrast of stealthy, cruising lurking and these intense bursts of power,\\" Conti says. \\"We split those two behaviors into two different types of models, and optimized each to do one of those things best.\\" http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/3d/shark-night-3ds- predators-blow-jaws-out-of-the-water Although the movie was always going to be titled \\"Shark Night 3D\\" overseas Ellis fought for a name change for the North American release, at one point wanting to release the film under the title \\"Untitled Shark Thriller 3D. Bloody Disgusting would later compare the proposed title of the film to Elis's previous film Snakes on a Plane (2006). Reception Shark Night 3D received negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that the film holds only a 19% approval rating from 70 critics, with an average score of 3.42/10. The critics consensus reads, 'A joyless excursion into the water that doesn't even produce good gore or nudity thanks to the neutered PG-13 rating.\\" The film has a normalized score of 22/100 on Metacritic, indicating generally unfavorable reviews.

He is the brother of Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n and Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n. Mario was imprisoned in Matamoros from 1995 to 2003, but was later transferred to another prison in Jalisco after the Mexican authorities concluded that he was still managing marijuana and cocaine shipments behind bars. In 2007, he completed his sentence and was released. When his brother Antonio was killed on 5 November 2010, Mario took the lead of the Gulf Cartel along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. But by then, the Gulf Cartel had separated from Los Zetas, the former enforcer gang of the cartel. Part of the Gulf Cartel, instead of lining up behind Mario, decided to work for Costilla S√°nchez. This led for cartel's division and infighting between the two factions, where Mario and Costilla S√°nchez turned their guns against each other and Los Zetas. On 3 September 2012, the Mexican Navy arrested Mario in the city of Altamira, Tamaulipas. Criminal career C√°rdenas was first arrested in 1995 in Mexico on charges of organized crime and drug trafficking and spent 11 years in prison. While incarcerated in the 'Cereso II' prison in Matamoros, Mario C√°rdenas continued to organize the shipment of large amounts of cocaine and marijuana into the U.S. from an automobile body repair shop within the prison walls, having his sentence increased in 2003. While in prison, Mario was also known for holding large parties, inviting prostitutes, organized gambling rings for horse races and cockfights, and having all sort of commodities. He was then transferred to 'Puente Grande', a maximum security prison and after serving an 11-year sentence he was released in 2007 and rejoined the Gulf Cartel. =Arrest= C√°rdenas Guill√©n, wearing a black bullet-proof vest and flanked by two ski- masked marines, was presented on national television on 4 September 2012. According to reports issued by the Mexican Navy, C√°rdenas Guill√©n was arrested a day before in the city of Altamira, Tamaulipas. At the time of his arrest, C√°rdenas Guill√©n was carrying a rifle in front of a building entrance, along with $10,000 in cash, radiocommunication equipment, ammunition, several credit cards, and four envelopes containing cocaine. The arrest of Mario was one of the \\"highest-profile arrests in months\\" and a powerful blow to the Gulf Cartel, which lost much of its influence after it separated from Los Zetas in early 2010. Mario took the leadership of the Gulf Cartel after the death of his brother Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n, alias Tony Tormenta, in November 2010. Nonetheless, the death of his brother, among other things, created a division in the Gulf Cartel: those loyal to C√°rdenas Guill√©n and those loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. The latter, however, reportedly enjoys some protection from the Mexican military and aid of the Sinaloa Cartel, another drug trafficking organization. Nonetheless, the arrest of Mario weakens the power of the C√°rdenas Guill√©n family. A close associate of Mario known as Juan Gabriel \\"Sierra\\" Montes was captured by the Mexican Naval Infantry in Guadalajara, Jalisco on 11 September 2012. He allegedly conducted drug trafficking operations for the Gulf Cartel and headed a hit squad faction in the cartel called Los Kalimanes. Gulf Cartel infighting =Background= In the late 1990s, Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n, the former leader of the Gulf cartel, had other similar groups besides Los Zetas established in several cities in Tamaulipas. Each of these groups were identified by their radio codes: the Rojos were based in Reynosa; the Metros were headquartered in Matamoros; and the Lobos were established in Laredo. The infighting between the Metros and the Rojos of the Gulf cartel began in 2010, when Juan Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez, nicknamed El R-1, was overlooked as the candidate of the regional boss of Reynosa and was sent to La Frontera Chica, an area that encompasses Miguel Alem√°n, Camargo and Ciudad Mier ‚Äì directly across the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border from Starr County, Texas. The area that Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez wanted was given to Flores Borrego, suggesting that the Metros were above the Rojos. Unconfirmed information released by The Monitor indicated that two leaders of the Rojos, Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez and Rafael C√°rdenas Vela, teamed up to kill Flores Borrego. C√°rdenas Vela had held a grudge on Flores Borrego and the Metros because he believed that they had led the Mexican military to track down and kill his uncle Antonio C√°rdenas Guill√©n (Tony Tormenta) on 5 November 2010. Other sources indicate that the infighting could have been caused by the suspicions that the Rojos were \\"too soft\\" on the Gulf cartel's bitter enemy, Los Zetas. When the Gulf cartel and Los Zetas split in early 2010, some members of the Rojos stayed with the Gulf cartel, while others decided to leave and join the forces of Los Zetas. InSight Crime explains that the fundamental disagreement between the Rojos and the Metros was over leadership. Those who were more loyal to the C√°rdenas family stayed with the Rojos, while those loyal to Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez, like Flores Borrego, defended the Metros. Originally, the Gulf cartel was running smoothly, but the infighting between the two factions in the Gulf cartel triggered when Flores Borrego was killed on 2 September 2011. When the Rojos turned on the Metros, the largest faction in the Gulf cartel, firefights broke throughout Tamaulipas and drug loads were stolen among each other, but the Metros managed to retain control of the major cities that stretched from Matamoros to Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas. Personal life Guill√©n was born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Mario had two brothers working for the Gulf cartel: Osiel, who was arrested by the Mexican Army on 2003 and sentenced to 25 years in prison, and Antonio, who was killed during a confrontation with Mexican Marines on 5 November 2010. Mario has one son, Mario Alberto C√°rdenas Medina (a.k.a. El Betillo), who was captured along with three others by the Mexican authorities in Matamoros, Tamaulipas on 9 June 2009. He confessed to have been a top lieutenant of the Gulf Cartel under his uncle Antonio C√°rdenas, co-leader of the organization. C√°rdenas Medina allegedly took control of the shipments of cocaine in the Playa Bagdad area before moving them north to the United States. Reports indicated that Mario's brother, Homero C√°rdenas Guill√©n, was allegedly part of the Gulf Cartel in late 2010. On 30 June 2019, Mario's son was once again arrested by Mexican authorities.https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=es&u;=https://www.univision.com/noticias/america- latina/autoridades-mexicanas-capturan-a-mario-cardenas-el-betito-sobrino-del- exlider-del-cartel-del- golfo&prev;=searchhttps://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/cae-en-naucalpan-el- betito-sobrino-de-osiel-cardenas/1321715 He was arrested in the State of Mexico with a female companion identified as Miriam \\"M.\\" See also *War on Drugs *M√©rida Initiative *Mexican Drug War References External links * Mexican police capture alleged cartel leader (archived) ‚Äî CNN * Presenta la PGR y SEMAR a Mario C√°rdenas Guill√©n, presunto l√≠der del C√°rtel del Golfo ‚Äî Federal government of Mexico (Video) Category:Gulf Cartel members Category:Living people Category:People of the Mexican Drug War Category:People from Matamoros, Tamaulipas Category:Mexican mob bosses Category:Mexican prisoners and detainees Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mario C√°rdenas Guill√©n"},{"id":"29518509","text":"The Bhambi are a Hindu caste found in the state of Maharashtra and Punjab in India.

Some of Jigten Sumg√∂n's sayings were collected by Sherab Jungne into what is known as Gongchik (Wylie transliteration: dgongs gcig, \\"the single intention\\"), a profound philosophical compendium that further developed in commentarial works written in following generations.For the Gongchik see the blog by Jan-Ulrich Sobisch (Copenhagen University) dgongs1.com. Some of Jigten Sumg√∂n's teachings were collected by another disciple into what is known as The Heart of the Great Vehicle's Teachings (theg chen bstan pa'i snying po).  Family  Jigten G√∂npo's great-grandmother was Achi Ch√∂kyi Dr√∂lma, who prophesied his birth and vowed to protect his lineage. Jigten Sumg√∂n was born in 1143 into a famous clan called the Kyura (skyu ra) in the Kham (khams) region of Tibet by the name of Tsungu (tsu ngu); his mother was Rakyisa Tsunma, and his father, Naljorpa Dorje, was a devout VajrayƒÅna practitioner (of YamƒÅntaka) who died when Jigten Sumg√∂n was still a boy‚Äîat that time, Jigten Sumg√∂n started to support his family by reciting scriptures. It is said that when he was only eight years old, he understood that all phenomena are like a reflection in a mirror.  Name  The meaning of Jigten Sumg√∂n ('jig rten gsum mgon) is \\"The Lord of the Triple World\\". Jigten Sumg√∂n is known under various names: Drikung Kyobpa Jigten G√∂npo Rinpoche, Drikung Kyobpa Jikten G√∂npo Rinchen P√§l, Lord Jigten Sumg√∂n, Kyobpa Rinpoche, and many others. Because his mother had a connection with the B√∂n tradition, upon his birth Jigten Sumg√∂n was initially given a B√∂n name, Welbar Tar (dbal 'bar thar).  Teaching  Lord Jigten Sumg√∂n was one of the most notable masters of Tibetan Buddhism, and his teachings had wide-reaching influence for centuries to come; up to 130,000 monks and practitioners came to his teaching at one time. The eighth Karmapa referred to Jigten Sumg√∂n's philosophical text Gongchik as \\"siddhƒÅnta of the Kagyupas\\", suggesting he considered it to be the definitive text outlining the philosophical tenets of all Kagyu schools. Seven centuries later, Dudjom Rinpoche quotes Jigten Sumg√∂n on something else he emphasized, the significance of the preliminary practices (ng√∂ndro): > Other teachings consider the main practice profound, but here it is the > preliminary practices that we consider profound. In a praise to his guru, Sherab Jungne said about Jigten Sumg√∂n: > He teaches according to the four kinds of proof: First, the instructions of > the holy lord lamas; Second, the teachings of s≈´tra and tantra of the > Sugatas; Third, the experience of you yogins; Fourth, the history of the > Dharma of Interdependence. Regarding Buddhist philosophical tenets, Jigten Sumg√∂n and his followers generally held a dismissive attitude towards their usefulness. Jigten Sumg√∂n states in Gongchik (4.13): \\"The truth is veiled by all [philosophical] tenets whatsoever.\\" He also wrote: > May those who mistake the system of tenets, which is a knot of the mind, as > the Buddha‚Äôs intention, realise true reality and may their mindfulness be > purified in itself.Phag mo gru pa, lHan cig skyes sbyor in Schiller, > Alexander (2014) Die ‚ÄûVier Yoga‚Äú-Stufen der MahƒÅmudrƒÅ-Meditationstradition, > (Indian and Tibetan Studies 2), Hamburg: Department of Indian and Tibetan > Studies, Universit√§t Hamburg. p. 454. Moreover, echoing the mahƒÅsiddha Saraha, he says: > All the views starting from the Non-Buddhists‚Äô view of permanence and > nihilism and up to the Madhyamikas‚Äô [view] are something that is a mind-made > duality.

Due to his fame, many great masters came to study and practice in Drikung Thil for many centuries after Lord Jigten Sumg√∂n's passing into parinirvƒÅ·πáa. Perhaps the most famous of these was Lama Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. While staying near Drikung Thil, Tsongkhapa received the Drikung teachings on the Six Yogas of Naropa, as well as all of the outer and inner texts by Jigten Sumg√∂n. Many Gelugpas, including the fourteenth Dalai Lama, uphold Tsongkhapa's lineage of Naropa's yogas until today.  References   Bibliography  * Cuevas, Bryan J. (2006).

In 1922, she was elected President of the Glasgow and West Scotland Association of the Medical Women's Federation. She also became a leading member of the British Medical Association (and the first woman chairman of its Glasgow division), and a trustee of the Muirhead Trust. Death  Gilchrist never married. She died at her home on 7 September 1952.  Honours  Marion Gilchrist's achievements were honoured when her home town named a public garden and a car park after her. The University of Glasgow named the Postgraduate Club after her. In 1932, a gift of ¬£1,500 was used to endow a bed at Redlands Women‚Äôs hospital for the treatment of eye diseases which was also named in recognition of her. The Gilchrist Window (1936) in the north transept of the Parish Church in her birthplace of Bothwell was created by Douglas Strachan from funds gifted by Gilchrist. The inscription below the window reads, \\"To the Glory of God. Erected by Marion Gilchrist in memory of her father William Gilchrist and her mother Margaret Williamson, her brothers, John William and Douglas, and her sister Agnes.\\" The Marion Gilchrist Prize was established in 1952 from Marion Gilchrist's bequest and is awarded annually by the University of Glasgow to \\"the most distinguished woman graduate in Medicine of the year.\\" In 2012, on the 60th anniversary of her death, Bothwell Library had an exhibition to honour her achievements.

After Austria's defeat in the War of the Third Coalition the County of Tyrol and the Vorarlberg were ceded to Bavaria in the Fourth Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805. Angry at the imposition of Bavarian laws and conscription, the Tyrolese rebelled in support of Austria. During the first week, local irregular forces killed or captured the main Bavarian garrison and also forced a French force to capitulate. To assist the Tyrolean Rebellion, the Austrian high command sent a regular division into the Tyrol under the leadership of Feldmarschallleutnant Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles. The VII Corps, consisting of three Bavarian divisions under the overall command of Marshal Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre, invaded the Tyrol in mid- May. On 11 May, Lieutenant General Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy relieved the besieged Kufstein Fortress. Lieutenant General Karl Philipp von Wrede crushed Chasteler's division on 13 May at the Battle of W√∂rgl. Soon afterward, Lefebvre occupied Innsbruck. However, Deroy's division was attacked on 25 May and 29 May in the first two Battles of Bergisel and compelled to evacuate the Tyrol. By this time Chasteler's surviving regular troops were recalled to join the Army of Inner Austria, which was retreating toward Hungary. Only a handful of regulars were left to operate in the Tyrol. Soon after Emperor Napoleon I of France defeated the main Austrian army at the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, Austria sued for peace. However, the revolt in the Tyrol continued and the Bavarians invaded the region a second time in late July. After the insurgents beat Deroy at the Third Battle of Bergisel on 13 August, the Bavarians again withdrew. In the third invasion, the Bavarian 1st Division under General-Major Rechberg inflicted a bloody defeat on the irregulars on 17 October. Wrede won the Fourth Battle of Bergisel on 1 November and the revolt finally died down. One of the leaders of the rebellion, Andreas Hofer was betrayed to the French and executed in February 1810.

The Burmese chronicles give many inconsistent stories about her, her son and her brief husband Anawrahta. Most are regarded as legends: :She was a princess of Wethali Kingdom, who was sent to marry Anawrahta by her father the ruler of Wethali. (Wethali is believed to be in the present-day Rakhine State or in Bengal. Based on Kyansittha's features observed in his statute in the Ananda Temple, Pyinsa Kalayani was likely Indian.) On her way to Pagan, she became intimately involved with Yazataman, the Pagan official charged with guarding her. The official dispersed her retinue of 80. At Pagan, she was married to Anawrahta. Soon after the marriage, Yazataman reportedly pointed out to Anawrahta that she could not be a true royal princess because she lacked a retinue. Anawrahta then banished Pyinsa Kalayni, who was then pregnant, an area near Sagaing. There, she gave birth to Kyansittha and raised him by herself.Harvey 1925: 23‚Äì24 :(The chronicle stories here are filled with many inconsistencies. The chronicles claim that Anawrahta was already king when Pyinsa Kalayni was sent. But Anawrahta did not become king until 1044. Kyansittha was born in 1030. Moreover, it was unlikely that the ruler of Wethali would have sent his daughter to Anawrahta who until 1044 was a prince but not to Sokkate, the king himself. The chronicles also claim that Anawrahta tried to kill off all babies in the year that Kyansittha was born because his astrologers predicted that a newborn would be king. Again, Anawrahta was not the king.) History shows that Anawrahta did not seem to know (or care) about her alleged affair with Yazataman, and believed that Kyansittha was his son. He recalled Kyansittha to Pagan in the mid-1050s, and appointed the 15-year- old Kyansittha a senior commander in his army. Only the royalty could become a senior commander at a young age.

Assigned to the 3rd Naval District, Blue Bird operated in the New York City area for the remainder of World War I. She provided transportation for official passengers from place to place in the naval district, served as a boarding boat when later attached to the naval districts communication office, and operated in such areas as lower Gravesend Bay on patrol duty, tallying the names and numbers of vessels in those waters.

Its principal concert venue was the Muziekgebouw Frits Philips in Eindhoven. The orchestra also gave concerts at the Theater aan de Parade in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Concertzaal (Concert Hall) in Tilburg, and the Chass√© Theatre in Breda. The roots of the orchestra date to 1947, with the establishment of the Stichting Vrienden van het Orkest (Friends' Orchestra Foundation) by the province of North Brabant, to generate support for the formation of a full-time and full-sized symphony orchestra in the province. The full orchestra was formally established in 1949, at a size of 40 musicians, with Hein Jordans as its first chief conductor. Jordans held the chief conductorship from 1949 to 1979. Other chief conductors have included Lucas Vis (1979-1983), Andr√© Vandernoot, and Arpad Jo√≥. In 1994, the orchestra dismissed Jo√≥ and subsequently named Marc Soustrot its next chief conductor. However, controversy arose when the orchestra had appointed Jaap van Zweden as principal guest conductor, to the point where Soustrot had threatened not to take the chief conductorship because he did not feel sufficiently consulted on the van Zweden appointment. The controversy was resolved, and Soustrot served as chief conductor of the orchestra from 1996 to 2006. From 2008 to 2012, Alan Buribayev was the orchestra's chief conductor. The orchestra participated as accompanying ensemble in the Internationaal Vocalisten Concours, concerts of the Stichting Stabat Mater in Oirschot, \\"Carnaval Concerts\\", the Festival Cult & Tumult in Veldhoven and the \\"Festival Traces\\" in Tilburg. The orchestra also served as the accompanying ensemble in opera productions by Opera Zuid.

A group of Arizona taxpayers challenged a state law providing tax credits to people who donate to school tuition organizations providing scholarships to students attending private or religious schools. The taxpayers claimed a violation of the Establishment Clause. The District Court dismissed the case, holding that the taxpayers did not state a valid claim. The decision was reversed by the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that the respondents had standing to sue, citing Flast v. Cohen.

After breaking into the first team, he was under contract until 2013. =Juventus= S√∏rensen officially signed for Juventus on 27 August 2010 after a trial with the Turin-based club in July of the same year. He was originally included as a member of the Juventus Primavera team for the 2010‚Äì11 season, however he was called into the first team midway through the 2010‚Äì11 Serie A season by then-Juventus coach, Luigi Delneri. After injuries to Leandro Rinaudo and Zdenƒõk Grygera that would rule them out for several months, S√∏rensen was called up to the first team for the first time against Bologna on 23 October 2010, and again against Milan. In the next league match, on 7 November, due to the unavailability of centre-backs Giorgio Chiellini and Nicola Legrottaglie, S√∏rensen made his first start alongside Leonardo Bonucci in the centre of defence. In that match, The Old Lady defeated Cesena 3‚Äì1. In the next match, right back Marco Motta was suspended and S√∏rensen replaced him against Roma. From that match onwards, S√∏rensen continued to feature for the club at right back, and even managed to maintain a starting position for much of the second half of the season ahead of Motta and Grygera. On the long- awaited Derby d'Italia between Juventus and Internazionale, he notably played the full 90 minutes and silenced Inter forward Samuel Eto'o in an astounding performance in which he also made the assist for the game's only goal. On 10 May 2011, S√∏rensen had signed an additional four-year contract with Juve. During the 2011‚Äì12 Serie A season, he found little space in the first-team under new head coach Antonio Conte. He was thus sold on a co-ownership deal to fellow Serie A club Bologna during the winter transfer market in order to gain regular first-team playing time. =Bologna= On 17 January 2012, S√∏rensen was officially sent to Bologna in a co-ownership deal for ‚Ç¨2.5 million (initially in a cash-plus-player deal, for Saphir Ta√Øder). Despite making just three league appearances for his new club during the remainder of the 2011‚Äì12 Serie A campaign, the young defender became an integral part of his club's first team throughout the 2012‚Äì13 Serie A season, after they had renewed the co-ownership agreement with Juventus. On 20 June 2013, S√∏rensen's co-ownership deal with parent club Juventus was renewed once again, and Bologna continued to hold his registration for the 2013‚Äì14 Serie A campaign that had ultimately ended in relegation for the Emilia-Romagna-based club after they had finished 19th in the Serie A standings. =Return to Juventus= On 20 June 2014, S√∏rensen was re-signed on a permanent basis by Juventus for ‚Ç¨800,000.http://www.juventus.com/juve/en/news/co-ownership-of-gabbiadini-and- sorensen In August 2014, S√∏rensen started training with English side Leeds United ahead of completing a loan move to the club, however the move collapsed after a disagreement between the player's agent and Leeds owner Massimo Cellino, and he returned to Juventus. =Hellas Verona (loan)= S√∏rensen officially signed for Hellas Verona on 29 August 2014 on a one-year loan deal for ‚Ç¨300,000. =1.

It was Obama's second State of the Union Address and his third speech to a joint session of the United States Congress. Presiding over this joint session was the House Speaker, John Boehner, accompanied by Joe Biden, the Vice President of the United States. It was the first address to a Republican-controlled Congress since 2006. In this joint session Obama outlined his ‚Äúvision for an America that‚Äôs more determined, more competitive, better positioned for the future‚Äîan America where we out-innovate, we out- educate, we out-build the rest of the world; where we take responsibility for our deficits; where we reform our government to meet the demands of a new age.‚Äù  Disposition, seating, and attendance  As always, the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, Vice President Joe Biden (as Senate President) and House Speaker John Boehner sat behind the president. This is the first time a Republican has sat behind President Obama during a joint session of Congress. In light of the 2011 Tucson shooting of Representative Gabrielle Giffords and others, the Washington Third Way think tank sent a letter to Congressional leadership proposing members of Congress abandon a 96-year-long tradition of sitting with their party and instead sit together in a show of national unity. Senator Mark Udall of Colorado picked up Third Way's proposal and sent a letter to Congressional members urging them to sit together regardless of party, breaking with tradition. Sixty members of the House and Senate signaled their support for the plan, and members of both houses sat with members of the opposite party. Groups included Arizona's House delegation of five Republicans and two Democrats (with an empty chair for Giffords), past presidential candidates John Kerry and John McCain, and campaign leaders John Cornyn and Patty Murray. Legislators wore black-and- white ribbons in honor of the victims of the shooting. After visibly reacting to President Obama's criticism during the 2010 State of the Union of the Citizens United decision, Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas did not attend the speech. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar served as the designated survivor and did not attend the speech. U.S. President Barack Obama is greeted by House Speaker John Boehner, before delivering the 2011 State of the Union Address. Summary According to a White House fact sheet published by NMD Newswire US-President Obama underscored in his 2011 State of the Union Address \\"the need to maintain America‚Äôs leadership in a rapidly changing world so that our economy is competitive ‚Äì growing and working for all Americans.\\" In order to achieve this Obama outlined \\"a plan to help the United States win the future by out- innovating, out-educating, and out-building our global competition. At the same time, the President understands the need to reform the way our government does business and take responsibility for our deficit - by investing in what makes America stronger and cutting what doesn't.\\" Jon Favreau and President Obama work on the 2011 address in the Oval Office the day before the session. =Revenue/savings= * A five-year freeze in domestic spending projected to save $400 billion over the next decade. * Elimination of billions in tax breaks for oil companies. The president has previously sought to bring in more than $36 billion over the next decade through tax increases on oil and gas companies, but so far has been unable to win congressional support. * Reductions in health care costs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Obama said he's willing to consider medical malpractice reform to \\"rein in frivolous lawsuits\\" and presumably drive down health care costs to the government in return. Though that proposal so far has not moved far beyond talking points, the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation in 2009 estimated that tort reform could reduce federal government health care costs by $41 billion over 10 years. * Reform for Social Security. Obama did not offer specifics. * Ending the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans once the latest extension expires in two years.

The band members are Luis Arce, Andr√©s Velasco, Esteban Su√°rez and Armando David. They all met in high school between 1994 and 1997. Since the beginning of the band, Chikita Violenta looked for a sound close to the college rock, which can be related to bands such as Pavement, Sonic Youth, Built To Spill and Tortoise. History In 2003, the band self-produced their first album, Chikita Violenta. Two years later, the band contacted the well known producer Dave Newfeld who has worked with important indie bands like Apostle of Hustle, Broken Social Scene, Super Furry Animals and Los Campesinos! Their second album, The Stars and Suns Sessions, was named after Newfeld's Toronto studio. With this album, Chikita Violenta went on tour in Mexico City and in several cities across the west coast of the U.S. The band also performed two years in a row in the music festival SXSW. The band's video for the single \\"Laydown\\" was listed by Spin Magazine as a \\"Must see\\" in August 2008, for its \\"cute\\" use of 1970's home movies and \\"novel\\" mixing with modern-day footage of family members, all cut together into a \\"generation-spanning holiday party\\".Spin wrote that it \\"takes the cuteness and the novelty and blows them up like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. In the end of 2009 and early 2010 the band worked again with Newfeld and recorded their third album, TRE3S. The album was recorded over three trips to Canada and includes collaborations with Loel Campbell from Wintersleep, Tony Nesbitt-Larking from The Most Serene Republic and Lisa Lobsinger of Broken Social Scene. In the summer of 2010 Chikita Violenta was the opening act in 23 cities on Built to Spill‚Äôs and Ra Ra Riot‚Äôs tour, the band signed with Toronto label Arts & Crafts for future album releases, and it was selected as an Editor's Choice by the New Haven Register. TRE3S was released in early 2011, to a mix of mild and enthusiastic reviews. Spin magazine gave the album 7 out of 10 stars, stating \\"While the production's scope doesn't quite fit Chikita Violenta's knack for scrappy Superchunk-style guitar pop, the busy shimmer usually complements the songs' energy instead of burying it.\\" Scott Fallon of the Bergen County Record called it \\"the first great album of 2011,\\" and, noting producer Newfeld's work with Broken Social Scene, wrote \\"Chikita Violenta has taken the whole lo-fi anthemic pop thing to heart.\\" Discography =Albums= *Chikita Violenta (2005) *The Stars and Suns Sessions (2007) *TRE3S (2010) =Singles= *\\"Turnaround\\" (2005) *\\"Laydown\\" (2006) *\\"War\\" (2007) *\\"Tired\\" (2010) *\\"Roni\\" (2010) *\\"All I Need's a Little More\\" (2010) *\\"Colapsoman√≠a\\" (2013) *\\"Implosi√≥n F\\" (2013) *\\"F√°ciles\\" (2014) References External links * Official website * Chikita Violenta on Myspace * Chikita Violenta's on Twitter * Band's record label Arts&Crafts; in USA and Canada * Band's record label Arts&Crafts; in Mexico Category:Mexican indie rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 2000 Category:Arts & Crafts Productions artists ","title":"Chikita Violenta"},{"id":"29519754","text":"The 2002‚Äì03 Second League of Serbia and Montenegro season (Serbian: Druga Savezna Liga) consisted of four groups of 12 teams.

It is based on two of the survivors' journals, primarily Captain James Riley's memoir Sufferings in Africa. To research the book, Dean King embarked on a National Geographic Society sponsored expedition to retrace the horrific journey of Riley and his crew across the Saharan (\\"Zahara\\") desert. A screenplay adaptation was in 2010 reportedly being written by Roman Bennett for Independent studios.  Research  King was first inspired to research the subject matter in 1995 when he was in the New York Yacht Club library researching Harbors and High Seas, which he would publish in 2000. He spotted an old leather-bound book on a shelf with the title Sufferings In Africa. Originally published in 1817 and sub-titled An Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig Commerce, the book is a first-hand account written by Captain James Riley, an American sea captain wrecked off the coast of Africa in his ship . After narrowly escaping capture by nomadic Arabs plundering the wreck, Riley and his crew made a futile attempt at sea in a longboat, and upon return to shore were forced into slavery by Arab tribesmen. King did extensive research on the misadventure, often using the libraries at the University of Richmond and the Library of Virginia, and even the Science Museum of Virginia. He soon discovered there was a second first-hand account written by Archibald Robbins, another surviving member of Riley's crew. Knowing sailors are notorious for embellishing their histories, he crosschecked the accounts, something no academic had yet done. King found that Archibald's A Journal: Comprising an Account of the Loss of the Brig Commerce was accurate to Sufferings in Africa in most significant details. Both autobiographies had been international bestsellers upon their release, and Riley and Robbins were national heroes in their own time. When he was a boy, Abraham Lincoln read An Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the American Brig Commerce and would later cite it as one of the books that most influenced him, and he would often refer to it during his presidency. After his experiences, Riley had been a staunch abolitionist. The adventure story also influenced James Fennimore Cooper and Henry David Thoreau. After his initial research, King had written a proposal and already signed a $750,000 contract with Little, Brown and Company for the book project. =Travels with National Geographic= In order to more fully understand the travails of the sailors, King decided to personally retrace their struggles through the desert. He planned the trip for a year. The trip cost about $20,000, by King's estimate. National Geographic Adventure magazine paid part of the cost, and the rest came from an advance from King's publisher. The trip was scheduled for the week after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and King and his crew landed in Casablanca the day the United States started bombing Afghanistan. From Casablanca they flew to Western Sahara, a disputed territory now controlled by Morocco, where the nervous military police occasionally hindered their attempts to follow Riley's exact route. Also on the team were neighbor Ted Lawrence and Lawrence's wife Claudia D'Andrea. Both had experience doing peacekeeping work in East Timor. J.P. Kang served as their technology specialist and Remi Benali served as their National Geographic photographer. Their guides were Ali and Mohammed el Arab. ;Journey by camel They traveled more than 100 miles across the western Sahara Desert on foot and by camel in order to experience a similar journey to Captain Riley. While they tried avoid dangerous extremes of dehydration, starvation, and sunburn, King claims they experienced eerily similar events to Riley, King even falling off his camel in an identical way. King subjected himself to running barefoot across burning sand and sharp rocks, and scaling dangerous cliffs. He also endured the camel's torturous gait, called \\"the rack\\". \\"It was brutal,\\" King says. \\"After [riding for] 20 miles, I was bleeding through a hole in my back. It was like sitting on a jackhammer.\\" King was surprised to see that much of the land had stayed relatively unchanged since 1815.  Publishing  The book was published by Little, Brown, & Co. on February 16, 2004. By April 2004, the paperback edition was on the San Francisco Chronicles non-fiction bestseller list at No.6, and was climbing The New York Times Extended Bestseller List at No. 20. By May 22 of 2005, that number had reached 18. In the non-fiction category the book was #13 on the Book Sense national bestseller list, #5 on Southeast Booksellers AssociatioN list, #15 on the Mountains and Plains Booksellers Association, #11 at the Northern California Booksellers Association, #13 at the Southern California Booksellers Association, and #10 at the New Atlantic Booksellers Association bestsellers list. In November 2004, Amazon.com listed Skeletons of the Zahara as their #6 Best History Book of 2004. = Media coverage = The book garnered reviews in hundreds of publications such as The Sunday Times, The Times, The Seattle Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune, the Minneapolis Star, Time, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, The Washington Post, Daily Mail, Publishers Weekly, the San Francisco Chronicle, Variety.com, The Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Los Angeles Times, and Entertainment Weekly. In February 2004 National Geographic Adventure Magazine included a write-up of King's travels in Africa. Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"King is almost pornographic in his description of physical pain: skin bubbles, eyeballs burn, lips blacken, and men shrivel to less than 90 pounds‚Ä¶It's sensational stuff.\\"  Film version  Screenwriters Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard, writers of the 2005 film The Great Raid, were behind King's project since they first saw his book proposal in 2001. They wrote a screenplay based on King's proposal, and with King's blessing they shopped it around to Hollywood Studios. Intermedia executive Alex Litvak brought the book to his company in 2001, and they optioned the rights. In April 2004 it was announced that Steven Spielberg's film production company DreamWorks had bought the movie rights from Intermedia. DreamWorks was set to co-finance the project and provide distribution, while Intermedia was set to produce with Paula Weinstein and Barry Levinson. Shooting was intended to begin before the end of 2004, though a director and crew were never decided upon. In September 2010 it was announced that Roman Bennett, the screenwriter for Public Enemies, is writing a new script based on the book. The London- based sales company Independent is developing and producing. Previously responsible for the film Moon, Independent has not named a cast or director, though they claim to be seeking a prominent American actor to play Captain Riley.

The heat wave began on July 4, 1911 and didn't end until July 15. In Nashua, New Hampshire, the temperature peaked at 106 ¬∞F (41 ¬∞C). In New York City alone, 158 people and 600 horses died.  Description  Throughout June, the temperature had been consistent with what normally was felt during New England summers, but starting in July, dry air which originated from the southern great plains began to flow into Canada before being swept south toward the east coast. The hot wind suppressed cooler ocean breezes, and this caused the temperature to rise so suddenly and dramatically that in Providence there was an 11 degree rise in temperature in a half hour. The area between Pennsylvania to Maine was reportedly most affected by the heat. During the 11 days, temperature records were set all over New England. In Boston, the temperature rose to 104¬∞ (40 ¬∞C) on July 4, an all-time record high that still stands today.http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/daily/USMA0046?climoMonth=7 Toronto saw temperatures as high as 103¬∞ (39.4 ¬∞C), the highest temperature until 1936. The heatwave was finally ended by a severe thunderstorm, which traveled across the Northeast and killed an additional five people.  Heatwave impacts  The first day of the heatwave caused crowds in major cities to form around thermometers so they could watch the temperature rise. Pedestrians in these crowds reportedly began to collapse from heat stroke as the day went by. By night time, mothers walked the street with crying infants hoping to keep them awake in fear that if they slept in their cribs they would not awaken. As the heat wave's second day began, 17 people had died from drowning alone after trying to swim in order to escape the heat. By the time the sun had risen on July 5, industry had come to a standstill. Throughout the region factories were closed and mail service was suspended. Due to the temperature indoors many began sleeping outside either on roofs of apartments or on sidewalks with at least 5,000 people sleeping on the Boston Commons alone. Besides deaths caused directly by the heat, it was reported that in every major city affected by the heatwave that the temperatures had been driving people insane and causing suicides. One such example reported by The New London Day, was of an elderly Boston man named Jacob Seegar who reportedly was driven so insane by the heat that he killed himself with a revolver in order to escape it. Due to the excessive heat rail lines had become melted and bent. The death toll continued to rise until finally a sudden thunderstorm brought a wave of relief, soon after which temperatures returned to their normal levels for good. The 1911 heat wave is considered the most deadly weather related disaster in the history of New England. In Philadelphia alone, 158 people were reported to have died from the heatwave and across the north east 200 people were reported to have drowned while swimming in an attempt to escape the heat.

Frederick S. Heiskell (1786-1882), who had worked briefly for Knoxville's first newspaper, the Knoxville Gazette, cofounded the Register along with his brother-in-law, Hugh Brown. The Register initially supported the policies of Andrew Jackson, but became a primarily Whig sheet in 1836, when it snubbed Jackson's handpicked presidential successor, Martin Van Buren, in favor of local favorite Hugh Lawson White. In 1849, polemical editor William G. Brownlow moved his paper, the Whig, to Knoxville, and a rivalry developed between the two papers that lasted until the Civil War.East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (ed.), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 15, 294-296, 661.William G.

Publication The Register was a broadsheet published weekly for its first four decades. In April 1861, largely in response to the growing interest in the secession crisis, a daily edition of the Register was established. Typical of 19th century broadsheets, the Register reported local news and published political editorials. =Titles= The Register is known to have been published under the following titles:Library of Congress - Chronicling America.

On August 3, 1816, he and Hugh L. Brown, whose sister Heiskell had married a few weeks earlier, published the first issue of the Register. When the Gazette closed and its owner moved to Nashville in 1818, the Register became Knoxville's only newspaper.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: The Society, 1972), pp. 434. For a newspaper published in an obscure frontier town, the Register was relatively progressive in its early days. Heiskell and Brown supported the abolition of slavery and advocated religious tolerance. Between 1818 and 1820, they simultaneously published one of the nation's earliest abolitionist newsletters, the Western Monitor and Religious Observer. In 1820, the Register mourned the death of noted Jonesborough abolitionist, Elihu Embree.Merton Dillon, \\"Three Southern Antislavery Editors: The Myth of the Southern Antislavery Movement.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 42 (1970), p. 51n. Heiskell and Brown also published numerous pamphlets and state documents. In 1823, they published John Haywood's Civil and Political History of Tennessee, one of the first comprehensive histories of the state. By the late 1820s, the Register had positioned itself as one of the state's most influential newspapers, mostly through its support of President Andrew Jackson. The paper consistently called for internal improvements, especially regarding roads, railroads,Stanley Folmsbee, Sectionalism and Internal Improvements in Tennessee, 1796-1845 (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1939), pp. 64-70, 140. and postal service.Forrest Marion, \\"East Tennessee and the Sabbath.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 66 (1994), pp. 19-20. In 1826, the paper rallied support for East Tennessee College's move to Barbara Hill, just west of Knoxville, and the following year helped revive interest in the Knoxville Female Academy.Laura Luttrell, \\"One Hundred Years of a Female Academy: The Knoxville Female Academy, 1811-1846; The East Tennessee Female Institute, 1846-1911.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 17 (1945), p. 72. Although Brown left in 1829, future Confederate general Felix Zollicoffer joined the paper as a journeyman printer in 1831,James McKee, \\"Felix K. Zollicoffer: Confederate Defender of East Tennessee.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 43 (1971), p. 37. and future Knoxville mayor W.B.A. Ramsey joined as an editor in 1835. =The Whig period (1836-1859)= During the presidential election of 1836, the Register abandoned Jackson when it supported Whig candidate Hugh Lawson White instead of Jackson's choice, Martin Van Buren. In 1837, Heiskell retired and sold the paper to Ramsey and Robert Craighead. Ramsey and Craighead made several changes that angered subscribers, prompting local businessman Perez Dickinson and Exeter, New Hampshire-born editor James C. Moses to establish a rival paper, the Times, with Thomas William Humes as editor. In 1839, Moses bought the Register and merged the two papers. Humes edited the merged paper until 1840, after which Moses edited the paper himself. In 1849, attorneys William G. Swan and John Hervey Crozier formed a syndicate which purchased the Register,William G. Brownlow, Americanism Contrasted with Foreignism, Romanism, and Bogus Democracy, in the Light of Reason, History, and Scripture; in Which Certain Demagogues in Tennessee, and Elsewhere, are Shown Up in Their True Colors (University of Michigan University Library, 2010), pp. 187-188. and installed John Miller McKee as editor. That same year, William G. \\"Parson\\" Brownlow, already well known in Knoxville as publisher of the Whig, moved his paper from Jonesborough to Knoxville. Brownlow accused the owners of the Register of trying to prevent his move to the city, namely by trying to deny him advertisers, and initiated a barrage of attacks against the paper, its owners, and McKee. McKee initially brushed off Brownlow's attacks, but as they intensified, he finally began responding, touching off a lengthy editorial quarrel. Throughout the early 1850s, the Register struggled financially as the prices of paper and printing supplies continued to rise. In 1855, the cash- strapped paper was sold to the Kinslow Brothers, who installed a Brownlow ally, John M. Fleming, as editor, briefly ending its quarrel with the Whig. In 1859, however, Southern-rights advocate George Bradfield purchased the Register, and converted it into a pro-secession paper, again bringing the paper into conflict with the pro-Union Whig. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860, Bradfield called for immediate secession, claiming, \\"the last link is broken.\\" =Secession crisis= As the secession debate intensified in the weeks following Lincoln's election, Knoxville's disunionists grew increasingly concerned over the influence wielded by Brownlow, whom they believed responsible for East Tennessee's relatively strong Union sentiment. To counter Brownlow, a group of Knoxville secessionists purchased the Register in early 1861, and installed radical secessionist Jacob Austin Sperry as editor. Sperry immediately set out to attack Brownlow and other Union leaders, carefully tailoring his arguments to show how the demise of slavery would harm not just planters from the Deep South, but poor whites of East Tennessee as well. Brownlow dismissed Sperry's attacks, calling him a \\"tool\\" who \\"fathers the slang prepared for him by men too cowardly to write over their own signatures.\\" After the attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, Sperry began publishing a daily edition of the Register. Secession leaders Crozier, William H. Sneed, and J. G. M. Ramsey wrote editorials for the paper, and Sperry insisted that East Tennessee's Unionists would eventually come around and unite with the region's secessionists. =Civil War= Throughout the latter half of 1861, the Register called for harsh measures against the region's Unionists, and demanded they either take Oath of Allegiance to the Confederacy or be jailed for the duration of the coming war. Ironically, the paper's cofounder, Frederick Heiskell, then in his late 70s, was among the Unionists jailed for refusing to take the Oath. General Felix Zollicoffer, a former employee of the Register, commanded Confederate forces occupying East Tennessee in late 1861. After Brownlow was arrested in December 1861, the Register demanded he either be hanged or jailed. When Confederate authorities ordered his release, the Register blasted the decision as foolish, stating \\"that Brownlow is now laughing, like the king's fool, in his sleeve, we doubt not for a moment.\\" In February 1862, the Register issued a call for the formation of a Knoxville home-guard to help defend against a Union invasion, and supported the continued application of martial law in the region to root out Union loyalists.Charles Bryan, \\"'Tories' Amidst Rebels: Confederate Occupation of East Tennessee, 1861-63.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 60 (1988), pp. 12-13. As Union support in East Tennessee remained steady, Sperry grew increasingly frustrated. He complained that many county officials in East Tennessee who had taken the Oath still supported the Union, or otherwise refused to help the Confederate cause. While Unionism had \\"played out,\\" Sperry wrote in January 1863, its \\"bastard and malignant offspring, neutrality, has succeeded it.\\" Sperry slammed Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, and happily published a letter from prominent Unionist T.A.R. Nelson suggesting that East Tennessee Unionists had been deceived.Thomas Alexander, \\"Strange Bedfellows: The Interlocking Careers of T.A.R. Nelson, Andrew Johnson, and W.G. (Parson) Brownlow,\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, No. 24 (1952), pp. 68-91. =Demise= When General Ambrose Burnside's Union forces entered Knoxville in September 1863, Sperry was forced to suspend publication of the Register and flee south. He briefly revived the paper in Atlanta, but advancing Union forces again forced him to flee. Sperry finally settled in Bristol, Tennessee, in 1864, and attempted to again revive the Register, boasting that the paper was \\"once again published on East Tennessee soil.\\" Finally, in December 1864, Bristol fell to Union forces, and Sperry and several other Confederate leaders were captured and marched back to Knoxville. In Knoxville, Sperry was shackled to a ball-and-chain, and forced to work on the city's fortifications. Many of the city's Unionist leaders found this treatment too harsh and degrading, the exception being Brownlow, who demanded Sperry and other secessionists be hanged for treason. Sperry was eventually tried for slandering East Tennessee's Unionists, but acquitted.E. Merton Coulter, William G. Brownlow: Fighting Parson of the Southern Highlands (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1999), p. 274. In the 1870s, Knoxville's Democrats launched a new newspaper, the Tribune, which they considered a successor to the Register. Throughout the 1880s, the Tribune bickered with the city's Republican paper, the Chronicle, founded by William Rule as a successor to the Whig.James B.

Donation of Hill Memorial Library John Hill's elder son, John Hill, Jr., predeceased him on November 10, 1893. John Hill wished to create a memorial for his son, who had been a member of the Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University (LSU). He donated $33,000 to the University for a library which was constructed on the campus of LSU on North Third Street in Baton Rouge and completed in 1903. The library was named the Hill Memorial Library in memory of John Hill, Jr. The donation of the library was sorely needed and of great importance to LSU, because the university previously had had to house its books in an old powder magazine.History of Hill Memorial Library LSU moved to a new campus and a new library was constructed in the new campus and named the Hill Memorial Library.

Geography  The village is situated 13 miles (21 km) east from Lincoln and 2 miles (3.2 km) north-east from the large village of Woodhall Spa. The River Witham runs a little over a mile to the west of the village which lies on the southern end of the Lincolnshire Limewoods. Stixwould lies on a finger of higher ground on the edge of the Witham fenland, bordered to the north by the Catchwater Drain and to the south by Reeds Beck. The historic parish of Stixwould contains numerous woodlands most notable of which are Stixwould Wood to the north-west, Halstead Wood to the west and Long Wood to the south. Nowadays the ancient parish has been adjoined with the parish of Woodhall to form the parish of Stixwould and Woodhall with a combined population of 255 in 2011.  History  Stixwould's name originates from the Old English Stigr and wald meaning Stigr's forest or wood, appearing in the 1086 Domesday Book as Stigeswalde. Major John Edward Almonds, a founding member of the SAS, was from Stixwould. = Medieval = Stixwould is recorded in the Domesday Book as having twenty- one households in 1066. To the south of the village is a area of ridge and furrow field systems. = Nunnery = Stixwould Priory, as it is now commonly known, was a Cistercian nunnery founded in the twelfth century and dedicated to St. Mary. It was dissolved in 1536. Almost immediately after its founding it was redounded in the Benedictine order and by 1537 was of the Premonstratensian, before being finally suppressed in 1539. After the Dissolution in 1540 the property was given to Robert Dighton. The earthwork remains of the nunnery and associated fishponds are still visible. It was one of a number of monastic buildings along the sides of the Witham valley south of Lincoln. To its north is Tuphome Abbey and to the south is Kirkstead Abbey. = Stixwould Ferry = Stixwould Ferry in May 1967 A ferry operated across the Witham on the site of the now disused railway station from the middle of the nineteenth century until the middle of the twentieth. It was purchased by Kesteven Council in 1937. = Railway = Stixwould railway station and Signalbox In 1846 the Great Northern railway company purchased the land to build a 58 miles (93 km) rail link from Peterborough to Lincoln along the banks of the River Witham. Works commenced in 1847 and the line opened on 17 October 1848 along with Stixwould station one mile to the west of the village. The station was closed on 5 October 1970 and the station building is now a private residence. The Water Rail Way, part of the National Cycle Network (Route 1) managed by Sustrans, now runs along the course of the tracks. = School = A school was built in 1851 and enlarged in 1894. = Church = St Peter's Church, Stixwould The parish church is a Grade II listed building dedicated to Saint Peter, rebuilt in 1831 by Christopher Turner. The font dates from the 16th century. A 13th-century grave slab, found on the site of Stixwould Abbey, leans against north side of the church tower. There is also a 14th-century churchyard cross in the graveyard. Alice Cranmer, the sister of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer, was a nun at Stixwould and its sacristan by 1525. She played a crucial role in his spiritual uncertainties whilst awaiting execution in Oxford, but ultimately he rejected the Catholic view she espoused.D MacCulloch, Thomas Cranmer, pp.16-19 = Abbey Farm = Abbey Farm lies to the west of the village occupying the site of the now lost priory.

While a schoolboy, at the age of 13, he wrote a manuscript history of Northampton, and from that time he was always engaged in enlarging his collections. His first printed work was A Catalogue of Books, Poems, Tracts, and small detached pieces, printed at the press at Strawberry Hill, belonging to the late Horace Walpole, earl of Orford, London (twenty copies only, privately printed), 1810, 4to. His proposals for The History and Antiquities of the County of Northampton were issued in 1815. The first part was published in folio in 1822, the second in 1826, and the third, completing the first volume, in 1830. This volume contains the subdivisions of Spelho, Newbottle Grove, Fawsley, Wardon, and Sutton. The fourth part, containing the subdivisions of Norton and Cleley, appeared in 1836, and about one-third of a fifth part, containing the subdivision of Towcester, in 1841. At the latter date, 220 of his original subscribers had failed him, and with health and means exhausted he was compelled to bring the publication to a close. His library and manuscript collections were dispersed by auction in 1842, the latter passing into the possession of Sir Thomas Phillipps. Baker's Northamptonshire is, on the whole, as far as it goes, the most complete and systematic of all our county histories. In the elaboration and accuracy of its pedigrees it is unsurpassed. An index to the places mentioned in the work was published at London in 1868. Baker, who was a unitarian, took a deep interest in various local institutions, and was a magistrate for the borough of Northampton. He was not married. A sister, Miss Anne Elizabeth Baker, was his constant companion for more than sixty years. He died at his residence, Mare Fair, Northampton, on 12 October 1851.

The Peter Garretson House (also known as Garretson-Brocker Home) was built in 1720 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 19, 1974. History The history of Garretson Forge and Farm began during the 17th century, with the immigration of three Dutch emigres: Gerrit Gerritse, his wife Annetje Hermansse, and their son Gerrit. In 1719, Gerrit purchased a huge plot of land known as the Slooterdam Patent from a businessman named David Daniellse. This plot of land was very large, encompassing many towns that are now in Bergen and Passaic, one of these towns being Fair Lawn. Gerrit's son Peter started construction shortly after the land purchase, and the history of Garretson Forge and Farm began. Originally called \\"The Garretson-Brocker home\\", Garretson Forge and Farm housed six generations of Garretsons for over 100 years. During its early existence, Garreston Forge and Farm was a large plantation that grew various types of crops and also housed multiple slaves. Over the years, however, pieces of Garretson Forge and Farm were sold off. Currently, the property is just under 2 acres. Many additions were made to Garretson Forge and Farm throughout the years including the construction and renovation of the main estate, which is part of the living museum. In 1902, major changes were made to the manor house, adding a second floor, outside porch, and a new roof. These 1902 renovations made Garretson Forge and Farm look like what it does today.Garretson Forge and Farm Location Garretson Forge and Farm Sign Garretson Forge and Farm is located in Fair Lawn, New Jersey on 4-02 River Road. It is also in very close proximity to the Passaic River. Water from the river was used to make bricks in the early stages of construction of Garreston Forge and Farm.

There are numerous buildings around the property that are used to store farm equipment for the garden as well. Originally, Garretson Forge and Farm was used to grow a variety of herbs and vegetables. Commercial crops were grown as late as 1970 by the Garretson Family. Currently, the garden is mainly used to grow a wide a variety of herbs. The garden consists of over 50 herbs and spices, and also contains a butterfly garden and fruit orchard.

In the story, the new leader of the galaxy is chosen using a series of tests.  Plot summary A man attending a party in 20th century Boston suddenly realizes he is naked. When security guards accost him, he has to decide what to do. Then the scene shifts to a soldier leading his men in a battle against huge insectoid aliens. Next, the retainer to a lord must race against the clock to find a legal document in a crumbling city to save his master from being executed. He is tempted to neglect his mission by an attractive courtesan. An artist competes against others in the creation of imaginative mind compositions. Finally, a man is tortured by secret police, who try to get him to reveal a secret. It turns out that each of these situations is one of a series of virtual reality tests devised by the Prime, the current leader of the galaxy, to evaluate candidates for his successor. Eleven Elders have the task of either giving the Prime a second term or choosing a new leader. The simulations test various qualities: the ability to think quickly, creativity, loyalty, and so on. The Prime scores the highest on the tests, but the Elders choose another person. When he asks why, he is told that, because he created the tests, they tested the qualities he considers the most vital, so naturally he won. The Elders, however, feel that the nature of the tests shed light on his deficiencies, and that other, more empathetic qualities are of greater importance.

(), was a series of engagements between North Korean and United Nations (UN) forces during the Korean War. The battle took place from December 31, 1950 to January 20, 1951 around the South Korean town of Wonju. In coordination with the Chinese capture of Seoul on the western front, the North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) attempted to capture Wonju in an effort to destabilize the UN defenses along the central and the eastern fronts. After a joint Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) and KPA assault breached the UN defenses at Chuncheon on New Year's Eve of 1951, KPA V Corps attacked US X Corps at Wonju while KPA II Corps harassed US X Corps' rear by engaging in guerrilla warfare. In response, US X Corps under the command of Major General Edward Almond managed to cripple the KPA forces at Wonju, and the UN forces later carried out a number of anti-guerrilla operations against the KPA infiltrators. In the aftermath of the battle, the KPA forces on the central and the eastern fronts were decimated, allowing the UN front to be stabilized at the 37th parallel. Background alt=A series of front lines drawn over the Korean peninsula with each line labeled with a date After launching a surprise invasion of South Korea in June 1950, the KPA was shattered by the United Nations (UN) forces following the landing at Incheon and the UN September 1950 counteroffensive, with the remnants of the KPA fleeing northward while seeking sanctuaries in the mountainous region along the Sino- Korean border... The destruction of the KPA and the UN offensive into North Korea prompted China to intervene in the Korean War, and Chinese forces launched their Second Phase Offensive against the UN forces near the border during November 1950. The resulting battles in the Ch'ongch'on River valley and at Chosin Reservoir forced the UN forces to retreat from North Korea during December 1950 to a line north of the 38th Parallel.. On the eastern front, US X Corps had evacuated North Korea by sea by December 24, 1950.. In its absence, the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) was forced to take over the defenses of the central and the eastern fronts along the 38th Parallel,. including the important road junction of Wonju located near the central front.. The sudden defeat of the UN forces offered the decimated KPA a brief respite, and they rebuilt their strength at the end of 1950. In the aftermath of the Chinese successes, Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong immediately ordered another offensive against the UN forces on the urging of North Korean Premier Kim Il-sung.. The offensive, dubbed the \\"Third Phase Campaign\\", was a border intrusion into South Korea that envisioned the total destruction of South Korean forces along the 38th parallel,. and was aimed at pressuring the UN forces to withdraw from the Korean Peninsula.. The western sector of the offensive was under the control of the PVA 13th Army, and the 13th Army's action would later result in capture of Seoul on January 4.. With the PVA 9th Army decimated at the Chosin Reservoir, however, the eastern sector of the offensive was handed over to the rehabilitated KPA, under the overall command of Lieutenant General Kim Ung and Commissar Pak Il-u.. On December 23, 1950, General Walton Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, died in a traffic accident, and Lieutenant General Matthew B. Ridgway assumed command of the Eighth Army on December 26, 1950.. Prelude =Locations, terrain and weather= The battle's main focus was around a road dubbed \\"Route 29\\", a strategically important line of communication to the UN forces in central Korea. Wonju was a critical crossroad village on Route 29 which ran north to south and connects Chuncheon on the 38th Parallel with Daegu.. Another road, which ran from the northwest, connected Route 29 and Seoul at Wonju. Between Chuncheon and Wonju stood the town of Hoengseong, and from Wonju to Daegu were a series of towns such as Chechon, Tanyang, Punggi and Andong... The entire road network was situated within the rough hilly terrains of the Taebaek Mountain Range.. The fighting around Wonju occurred during some of the worst Korean winter conditions, with temperatures as low as and snow as thick as on the ground. Indeed, the weather was so cold that metal on artillery pieces would crack, while water could take an hour-and-a-half to boil.. At times the cold weather alone was enough to stall all military activities, while frostbite caused more casualties than combat during the course of the battle. =Forces and strategy= alt=A map with multiple red arrows pressing against a blue line at the 38th parallel Just days before his death, Walker had tried to bolster the defences of the central and eastern sections of the 38th Parallel by stretching the ROK forces from Chuncheon to the Korean east coast. Following his instructions, ROK III Corps was placed around Chuncheon while ROK I Corps was deployed on the east coast. Meanwhile, ROK II Corps, with its strength reduced to a single infantry division in the aftermath of the Ch'ongch'on River battle,. filled the gap between ROK I and III Corps. However, with the absence of US X Corps, the UN defenses on the central and eastern fronts were stretched thin, and there were gaps between the understrength ROK units.. Because the ROK forces had suffered nearly 45,000 casualties by the end of 1950,. most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little training,. and out of the four ROK divisions that defended Chuncheon, only one was deemed battle worthy.. Taking advantage of the situation, the KPA forces had been probing the ROK lines since mid- December, while thousands of North Korean guerrillas harassed the UN rear area from their mountain hideouts.. On December 27, 1950, KPA II Corps managed to move behind the UN defenses by mauling the ROK 9th Infantry Division on ROK I Corps' left flank at Hyon-ri. This development threatened to destabilize the entire UN eastern front... In order to defend against the KPA penetration, Ridgway ordered US X Corps to reinforce the ROK defenses. However, with most of US X Corps still assembling at Pusan, the only unit that was available in the Eighth Army's reserve was the US 2nd Infantry Division, which was still recovering from its earlier losses at the Ch'ongch'on River. On December 28, Ridgway ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to defend Wonju while placing the division under US X Corps control.. After the US 7th Infantry Division of US X Corps finished reorganization on December 30, Ridgway ordered Major General Edward Almond, commander of the US X Corps, to develop Route 29 as its main supply route, and the 7th Infantry Division was subsequently tasked with defending it.. In coordination with the Chinese assaults against Seoul in the western sector of the Third Phase Campaign, the North Koreans deployed the KPA II, III and V Corps, an estimated 61,500 soldiers, against the UN forces on the central front.. The KPA plan was a frontal attack at Wonju by Major General Pang Ho San's KPA V Corps, while Major General Ch'oe Hyon's KPA II Corps would infiltrate the US X Corps' rear as guerrillas and block Route 29. The aim of the offensive was to push US X Corps back in concert with the PVA attacks on Seoul, thereby isolating the ROK forces in the Taebaek Mountains.. As part of the attacks against Seoul, the PVA 42nd and 66th Corps were deployed near Chuncheon in support of KPA V Corps during the opening phase of the battle. Meanwhile, KPA III Corps would act as reinforcements for KPA II and V Corps. However, like the ROK they were facing, the KPA forces were also badly depleted and understrength. Although the KPA fielded more than 10 infantry divisions for the battle, most were only equivalent in strength to an infantry regiment. In contrast with the professional mechanized army that had existed at the start of the Korean War, the newly rebuilt KPA formations were poorly trained and armed.. Nevertheless, the start date of the Third Phase Campaign was set for New Year's Eve in order to take advantage of the full moon and the low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday. First Battle of Wonju =Opening moves= alt=A map with multiple red arrows running southward On the central front, ROK III Corps defended the 38th parallel north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon.. Composed of the ROK 2nd, 5th, 7th and 8th Infantry Divisions, ROK III Corps placed the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank in the hills north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The winter conditions created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the heavy snow hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition resupply. North Korean guerrillas were also active in the region, and caused serious disruption in the rear of the ROK III Corps. As part of the Chinese plan to capture Seoul, the PVA 42nd and the 66th Corps were tasked with protecting the PVA left flank by eliminating the ROK 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions, while cutting the road between Chuncheon and Seoul. Following instructions, the two Chinese corps struck quickly after midnight on New Year's Eve.. The PVA 124th Division first penetrated the flanks of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division, then blocked the division's withdrawal route.. The trapped ROK 17th and 32nd Regiments, 2nd Infantry Division were then forced to retreat in disarray. With the PVA 66th Corps pressuring the ROK 5th Infantry Division's front, the PVA 124th Division then advanced eastward in the rear and blocked the ROK 5th Infantry Division's retreat route as well. The maneuver soon left the ROK 36th Regiment, 5th Infantry Division surrounded by PVA and they had to escape by infiltrating the PVA lines using mountain trails.. By January 1, ROK III Corps was in full retreat, while the Corps' headquarters had lost contact with the 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions.. Responding to the crisis on the central front, ROK III Corps sector's defense was handed over to US X Corps. While the PVA were making a concentrated attack against the ROK front, the KPA forces that had infiltrated the UN rear were cutting the ROK withdrawal route.. In the days before the Chinese Third Phase Campaign, KPA II Corps established a major roadblock to the north of Hoengsong with an estimated strength of 10,000 soldiers, which blocked the retreat of ROK III Corps.. In response, ROK II Corps and the US 2nd Infantry Division conducted a siege operation against the roadblock from both the north and the south, and the roadblock was forced open by January 2... Although the UN forces managed to eliminate a KPA division at the roadblock, ROK II Corps was nearly destroyed during the fighting, and it was disbanded on January 10.. The success of the initial PVA/KPA attacks forced ROK I Corps to abandon its attempts to restore its original defensive position at Hyon-ri, and a large number of KPA soon streamed into the gap between the US 2nd Infantry Division at Wonju and ROK I Corps on the east coast. Ridgway interpreted the attack on the central front as an attempt to surround the UN defenders at Seoul, and he immediately ordered their evacuation on January 3... On January 5, Ridgway ordered all UN forces to withdraw to the 37th parallel to set up a new defensive line, dubbed Line D, with the UN forces on central and eastern fronts setting up defenses between Wonju and the coastal city of Jumunjin (Chumunjin).. At the same time, the PVA troops halted their offensive operations with KPA II and V Corps relieving the PVA 42nd and 66th Corps.. =Wonju falls= alt=A camp surrounded by foliage In the aftermath of the ROK collapse, KPA V Corps proceeded to launch frontal attacks against US X Corps while KPA II Corps infiltrated the UN rear through the area to the east of Wonju.. The US 2nd Infantry Division's position had now become an exposed northern salient,. and its defenses were further hampered by the flat terrain surrounding Wonju.. However, given the strategic importance of Wonju in controlling central Korea, Ridgway declared that the village was \\"only second to Seoul\\" in importance, and therefore must be defended at all cost. In accordance with Ridgway's instructions, Almond ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to defend the hills north of Wonju, yet Division commander Major General Robert B. McClure believed that the salient was untenable due to the terrain and the low morale of his division.. On January 7, two infantry battalions from KPA V Corps launched an attack against the US 2nd Infantry Division.. One KPA battalion managed to infiltrate the American positions disguised as refugees while another battalion launched a frontal assault.. Yet the weak attack was soon repulsed due to the lack of coordination between the KPA units, and about 114 infiltrators were later captured... Although the KPA attack inflicted little damage, the disruption caused by infiltrators in US 2nd Infantry Division's rear convinced McClure to abandon Wonju on January 7. Almond concurred with McClure's decision on the condition that the US 2nd Infantry Division would only retreat so that Wonju could be controlled by UN artillery fire.. Regardless, McClure ordered the division to retreat more than south, putting the village out of artillery range.. With Wonju under KPA control, the PVA declared that the Third Phase Campaign had reached a successful conclusion.. Second Battle of Wonju =Hill 247= alt=Two soldiers standing along a road that is located in a valley Hill 247 was located among the hill mass south of Wonju, and was a critical height that commanded Wonju.. With the loss of Wonju on January 7, Almond was furious at McClure for disobeying the order to hold it, and this later resulted in Major General Clark Ruffner replacing McClure on January 13... On January 8, Almond ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to retake Wonju. Following his orders, the US 23rd Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Paul L. Freeman, attacked towards Wonju on January 8.. The 23rd Infantry Regiment managed to reach within at the south of Wonju and caught a sleeping KPA regiment by surprise at Hill 247. About 200 KPA soldiers were killed in the ensuing battle, however the alerted KPA forces soon counterattacked by outflanking the 23rd Infantry Regiment to the east, and the Regiment was forced to retreat to avoid encirclement. Encouraged by the heavy KPA losses during the initial UN attacks, Almond again ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to recapture Wonju on January 9.. About four infantry battalions from the US 23rd and 38th Infantry Regiments supported by French and Dutch troops advanced toward Wonju on January 9, yet the attack was stalled at Hill 247 due to the cold weather and the lack of air support. As the UN forces tried to dislodge the KPA the next day, they were met by six defending KPA battalions with an estimated strength of 7,000 soldiers.. Under a heavy snowstorm and with no air support, the battle for Hill 247 continued for most of January 10, and the fighting around the French Battalion of the 23rd Infantry Regiment became particularly fierce. At one point, the French Battalion was forced to fend off several KPA counterattacks with bayonet charges after running out of ammunition. The French Battalion's action at Wonju impressed Ridgway, who later encouraged all American units in Korea to utilize bayonets in battle. The KPA tried to encircle the attacking UN forces as the latter began to gain the upper hand, however artillery fire broke up the KPA formations, and they had suffered an estimated 2,000 casualties in the aftermath of the battle. When air support returned on January 11,. the attacking UN forces inflicted another 1,100 KPA casualties and captured Hill 247 by January 12. Although the cold weather and the stubborn KPA defenses prevented the UN forces from entering Wonju, the capture of Hill 247 had put all of Wonju within UN artillery range, and the village soon became a no man's land under the devastating bombardment.. =Anti-guerrilla operations= M16 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage in Korea. Firepower provided by anti-aircraft vehicles such as this one had proven to be invaluable in patrol actions against North Korean guerrillas.alt=Several soldiers working around a machine gun mounted on a half-track Although the capture of Hill 247 had forced KPA V Corps to abandon Wonju with heavy losses on January 17,. KPA II Corps' infiltration in the UN rear area had become so serious that it threatened to outflank the entire UN front and force a complete evacuation of Korea by mid-January... With the bulk of US X Corps tied up to the south of Wonju while ROK III Corps was in disarray, the front between Wonju and the east coast was undefended, and about 16,000 KPA soldiers entered the gap while establishing guerrilla bases from Tanyang to Andong.. The battles along the central front soon degenerated into irregular warfare between company-sized UN patrols and KPA guerrilla bands.. In an effort to stabilize the front, Ridgway ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to withdraw from Wonju while pulling the central and eastern fronts back to the area between Wonju and Samch'ok, and this resulted in another retreat.. Ridgway also sent the US 187th Regimental Combat Team, the US 5th Cavalry Regiment, the US 1st Marine Division and the Greek Battalion to contain KPA guerrillas east of Route 29 and north of Andong and Yeongdeok... About 30,000 American infantry were deployed to the central front by mid-January,. and the KPA guerrillas were blocked in a narrow salient along the hills at the east of Route 29.. To eliminate the KPA threat in the UN rear, Almond ordered all X Corps units on Route 29 to launch aggressive patrols to destroy the KPA supply bases and guerrilla bands.. Specially trained irregular forces, such as X Corps' Special Action Group, also hunted KPA units by operating as guerrillas themselves. The constant UN pressure slowly depleted the ammunition and the manpower of KPA II Corps, while Major General Yu Jae-hung rallied ROK III Corps and sealed the gap between Wonju and the east coast by January 22.. On January 20, a patrol carried out by the US 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division managed to reoccupy Wonju without much resistance.. Lacking reinforcements and supplies, KPA II Corps was scattered by the end of January, and only 8,600 soldiers from KPA II Corps managed to survive and retreat back to North Korea.. The KPA 10th Division, vanguard of KPA II Corps, was also annihilated by US 1st Marine Division during the UN anti-guerrilla operations... Aftermath By the end of January, KPA II Corps was decimated during its guerrilla operations, and its estimated strength was reduced from 16,000 to 8,000. KPA V Corps' attempt to capture Wonju had also resulted in crippling casualties, and its estimated strength was reduced from 32,000 to 22,000 by the end of January. In contrast, UN losses were relatively moderate during the same period..Although the unit-by-unit casualty data provided by Ecker suggested the US casualty number was around 600, the extent of the South Korean losses is unknown due to the lack of records. See Appleman 1989, p. 403. The defeat of the KPA enabled the UN forces to consolidate their positions along the Korean central and eastern front, and the retreating US Eighth Army on the Korean western front could finally return to the offensive after its rear and eastern flank were secured.. As soon as US X Corps regained full control of the central front at the end of January, Ridgway ordered the US Eighth Army to launch Operation Thunderbolt against PVA/KPA forces on January 25, 1951..

Background Branivoje who served King Stefan Milutin Nemanjiƒá (r. 1282‚Äì1321) was given the rule of Ston and Pelje≈°ac. His family had by 1325 emerged as the strongest in Zahumlje (or Hum). Probably at their highest point they ruled from Cetina river to the town of Kotor. Though nominal vassals of Serbia, the Branivojeviƒá family attacked Serbian interests and other local nobles of Hum, who in 1326 turned against Serbia and the Branivojeviƒái. The Hum nobility approached Stjepan Kotromaniƒá II, the ban of Bosnia, who then entered conflict with Serbia. History In 1326, Ban Stephen II attacked Serbia in a military alliance with the Republic of Ragusa and conquered Zahumlje, gaining access to the Adriatic Sea and including a large Serbian Orthodox Christian population and the Serbian Orthodox Church. This changed the balance of religion in Bosnia, as the Bosnian Bogumils had lost its majority in the realm. He also expanded into Zavr≈°je, including the Fields of Glamoƒç, Duvanj and Livanj. The province of Zahumlje was ruled by the Serbian noble family of Branivojeviƒá who had tricked Stefan Deƒçanski's vassalaged Prince, Crep, who was a close friend, so King Stefan had no desire to defend those areas from Ban Stephen's forces. Bosnia controlled the coast from the border with Ragusa across Neretva to Omi≈°. Ban Stephen II killed two members of the Branivojeviƒá, while Branko Branivojeviƒá fled to Serbia and sought help from King Stefan and then headed to Ragusa, from where he proceeded to Ston. Ban Stephen pursued Branko, but eventually the Ragusan forces caught the last of the four Branivojeviƒá brothers. The Bosnian titles included Lord of the Hum Land ever after. Ban Stephen became the ruler of all the lands from Cetina to Neretva with the exception of Omi≈°, which was taken by the Hungarians. In 1329, Ban Stephen II of Kotroman pushed another military attempt into Serbia, assaulting Lord Vitomir of Trebinje and Konavli, but the main portion of his force was defeated by the Young King Stefan Du≈°an who commanded the forces of King Stefan of Deƒçani at Pribojska Banja. The Ban's horse was killed in the battle, and he would have lost his life if his vassal Vuk Vukoslaviƒá had not given him his own horse. By doing so, Vuk sacrificed his own life, and was killed in open battle. Thus the Ban managed to add Nevesinje and parts of Zagorje to his realm. Although the Zahumljans mostly accepted the Ban's rule, some resisted, like Petar Toljenoviƒá who ruled the Seaside from his capital in Popovo; he was the grandson of the famous Zachlumian Prince Andrew. Petar raised a rebellion, wishing either more autonomy or total independence and the eventual restoration of the conquered territories to Serbia. He lost a battle against Ban Stephen II and was imprisoned and put in irons. Stephen had him thrown with his horse off a cliff. Peter survived for a full hour after the fall. The Ban's vassal that governed Zahumlje started to raid Ragusan trade routes, which worsened Bosnian-Ragusan relations that were very high during the conquest of Zahumlje. To make matters worse, Ban Stephen II asked Ragusa to pay him the old traditional mogorish tax that they traditionally paid to the Serbian rulers and even asked them to recognize his supreme rule. The Republic of Ragusa refused outright.

It promoted the creation of the House Problem Solvers Caucus which has 48 members, evenly divided between Republican and Democrats to forge bipartisan cooperation on key issues. Since its creation the Caucus has proposed or supported bipartisan proposals on healthcare, infrastructure, immigration, border security, and gun control, and was a participant in budget negotiations.  The Speaker Project  On June 21, 2018 No Labels announced an initiative entitled The Speaker Project, which proposed using the election of a new House speaker as leverage to make rule changes in order to give bipartisan ideas a fair hearing and \\"a fighting chance in the next Congress\\". Some of the rules changes proposed included: * Vacate the Motion to Vacate: The next Congress should revise the ‚ÄúMotion to Vacate‚Äù rule which enables any House member to demand a no-confidence vote of the speaker enabling a majority of those ‚Äúpresent‚Äù to oust the speaker. The motion should be allowed only when one-third of the House publicly signs a petition to force such a vote. * An Opening for Amendments: Reduce the number of ‚Äúclosed rules‚Äù on proposed legislation. (A closed rule denies the minority party a chance to offer amendments on the House floor). * Return to Regular Order: Have major legislation debated and crafted in appropriate committees, not leaders‚Äô offices. In January 2019, the new Democratic majority in the House led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a comprehensive reform package that included House rules changes which No Labels had supported through The Speaker Project. As part of the package, Speaker Pelosi will create a ‚Äúconsensus calendar‚Äù that reserves time for bills with wide bipartisan support to be heard on the House floor. Other reforms included easing consideration of bipartisan amendments, and making it harder for extremists on the House's wings to threaten to oust the speaker. The hoped-for effect will be to promote legislation through compromise and limit the kind of showboating that blocked achievement during the recent Republican rule.  Senate hearings and early reforms  = Background = In December 2010, over 1,000 citizens from across the country gathered in New York to launch No Labels, a reform movement that calls on political leaders to work across partisan lines to solve America's most pressing problems. No Labels does not call for leaders to entirely shed their party affiliations, but simply to seek common ground and work together in a bipartisan fashion. In December 2011, No Labels introduced its Make Congress Work! campaign, which proposed several reforms including No Budget, No Pay, Filibuster Reform, and an Up or Down Vote in 90 days. No Labels subsequently released its Make the Presidency Work! and Make Government Work! initiatives. =Fast-track presidential appointments= In his 2012 State of the Union Address, Barack Obama endorsed No Labels' proposal of a rule requiring a simple yes or no vote within 90 days of all presidential judicial and public service nominations. =Bipartisan seating= In January 2012, No Labels proposed that Congress have bipartisan seating at the State of The Union. By the time of the address, 208 members agreed to sit with a member of the opposite party. =No Budget, No Pay = At the unveiling of the Make Congress Work! proposal, Senator (Sen.) Dean Heller (R-NV) and Representative (Rep.) Jim Cooper (D-TN) announced that they would introduce legislation for one of the Make Congress Work! proposals - barring legislators from receiving a salary if they fail to pass a budget resolution and all appropriation bills before October 1, the beginning of the upcoming fiscal year. Both the House and Senate bills were entitled the No Budget, No Pay Act. No Labels then ran a campaign in favor of the legislation. On March 14, 2012, a hearing was held in front of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, entitled \\"Raising the Bar for Congress: Reform Proposals for the 21st Century\\" on the particular subject of the No Budget, No Pay Act. No Labels' witnesses also discussed filibuster reform, the up-or-down- in-90-days proposal, and having a financial report to Congress. In addition, Senator Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) discussed a proposal of his own for biennial budgeting. On February 4, 2013, Obama signed H.R. 325 ‚ÄúNo Budget, No Pay Act of 2013‚Äù into law mandating the pay for lawmakers be held in escrow starting April 16 until their chamber has passed a 2014 budget resolution. This was a modified version of No Labels‚Äô original proposal, which had called for member pay to be lost permanently during any period in which they had failed to meet the budget deadline. = Healthcare for Heroes = In 2013, No Labels created a bill to help streamline electronic health-records and make the system more easily accessible for military service members and veterans. Language from the bill entitled 21st Century Healthcare for Heroes bill was adopted into the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) that was passed and signed by Obama in December 2013. = National Strategic Agenda = In 2015, a Senate Hearing on the No Labels framework for bi-partisan problem solving, The National Strategic Agenda, took place in front of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs. A number of Senators agreed to work towards solving the Agenda's four goals which polling had identified as important to majorities across the political spectrum: creating 25 million net new jobs in the next decade, securing Medicare and Social Security for 75 years, balancing the federal budget by 2030 and achieving energy security by 2024. Media Multiple news outlets have written about No Labels and its aim of achieving bipartisanship on key issues. The organization has received both support and criticism for its efforts from elements on the right and left, including writers from Bloomberg News, The Daily Beast, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Boston Globe. Frank Rich, The Bipartisanship Racket, New York Times (December 18, 2010).Katrina vanden Heuvel, Washington elites push for a consensus that ignores reality, Washington Post (April 16, 2012).Jennifer Rubin, No Labels, no relevance, Washington Post (January 14, 2013). Since No Labels is a registered 501(c)(4) nonprofit group, there is limited verifiable information available about its funding and it is not required to release its donor information. =Nancy Pelosi as Speaker= On November 26, 2018, The Daily Beast reported that \\"No Labels leadership contemplated a campaign to attack Pelosi aggressively after the primary campaign of centrist Rep. Dan Lipinski,\\" despite the fact that Pelosi had supported Lipinski in his primary campaign that year. In the same article, the group countered that ‚ÄúNo Labels is not against Nancy Pelosi or any other speaker candidate. We are FOR rules changes that empower members in both parties who want to work across the aisle to find solutions and prevent the fringes‚Äìin both parties‚Äìfrom perpetuating endless gridlock.‚Äù On November 28, 2018, the Problem Solvers Caucus reached an agreement with Leader Pelosi on house rules changes that would foster more bipartisan legislating. In January 2019, the new Democratic majority in the House led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a comprehensive reform package that included House rules changes which No Labels had supported through The Speaker Project. = Funding = The Intercept reported on November 29, 2018, that there are several PACs affiliated with No Labels and that a large portion of their funding comes from wealthy donors. Among these donors are Louis Bacon, as well as investor Nelson Peltz. On December 6, 2018, No Labels wrote in The Hill that \\"nobody who donates to No Labels does so with an expectation of a quid pro quo. If you‚Äôre a big donor or company looking to give money to an advocacy group who will push for your special tax break or regulatory exclusion, you shouldn‚Äôt bother looking at No Labels.\\"  See also  * Centrism * Political moderate * Problem Solvers Caucus References External links * * Hard Right And Hard Left Flock To No Labels, Kate Nocera, BuzzFeed, August 19, 2013 Category:Political movements in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.

J. Balaban or Abe Balaban (April 20, 1889 ‚Äì November 1, 1962), was an American showman whose particular influence on popular entertainment in the early 20th century led to enormous innovations in the American movie-going experience. Following the leasing and operation of a modest nickelodeon house in 1909,Balaban (1942), p.18. Balaban oversaw the commission and design of Chicago's great movie palaces for the Balaban & Katz (B&K;) exhibition chain, integrated live performers into themed stage extravaganzas with full orchestras and forever changing vaudeville, Tucker (1945), p.90. and inspired numerous and novel ideas for theatre management. A. J. Balaban's most productive period of achievement was from 1909 to 1929. It was a measure of his success and respect that in 1929, the February 27 issue of Variety was dedicated to him, and the following August a massive Citizens' Dinner in Chicago was organized to bid him farewell upon his move to New York to assume a creative position with Paramount/Publix, with which B&K; had merged in 1926.Balaban (1942), p.104. The artistic and managerial genius of the Balaban & Katz team (brother Barney was known for his financial and real estate acumen, while Katz was a lawyer),Cullen (2006), p.60. A. J. Balaban‚Äîfrom his earliest years as a young man singing in small theatres to illustrated glass slides, to the mastery of \\"presentations\\" that featured singers, dancers, and musicians in a variety of turns culminating into lavish tableaux‚Äîhad as an overarching inspiration the comfort and satisfaction of the audience. According to Abel Green, editor of Variety, the venerable show business trade newspaper, Balaban \\"did more than any individual to glorify the cinema setting\\", and his theatre management established a successful model for other national exhibitors. As for performers and the production of effective shows and pacing, William Morris Senior, the talent manager, wrote in an open letter in Variety to Balaban, \\"You have done more for [vaudeville's] proper presentation than any other man ever connected with it.\\" Among Balaban's many show-business innovations were large theatres seating thousands of people in grand architectural palaces that resembled \\"fairy-lands\\";Balaban (1942), p.33. the integration of movies and stage shows, alternating throughout the day; the presentation on movie-theatre stages of many of the giants of American show business, including The Four Marx Bros.,Balaban (1942), p.32-33.

Between bouts of elective retirement in Geneva, Switzerland, and other locales, Balaban returned to the film and exhibition business periodically. Beginning in 1942, Balaban began nearly a decade as Executive Director of New York's Roxy Theatre at the request of Spyros Skouras of 20th Century-Fox, restoring the theatre to profitability with access to first-run Fox films, as well as the production and presentation of first-class live shows. During this time, Balaban installed an ice rink on the Roxy stage, and instigated the first-ever \\"four-a-day\\" by the New York Philharmonic for two weeks in September 1950. Although the \\"presentation style\\" mix of movies and elaborate stage shows is no longer in popular or economic favor, it was Balaban's pioneering success in Chicago with this combination that today is often associated with Radio City Music Hall in New York.Minnelli (1974), p. 52. Early life and career A.J. Balaban was the second of eight children born to Russian Jewish parents Israel and Augusta (n√©e Mendeburskey) Balaban in Chicago. Barney, the financial mainstay of the family, was the first born and in young adulthood would come to work for the Western Cold Storage Company,Balaban (1942), p.13. earning $25 a week.Balaban (1942), p.19. After A.J. came a daughter, Ida, followed by brothers John, Max, Dave, Harry and Elmer. The large family lived in back of a grocery store run by the parents.Balaban (1942), p.1. At an early age, the two oldest boys would go to plays at local Chicago theatres,Balaban (1942), p.6. and Balaban confessed that \\"theatre fascinated me\\".Balaban (1942), p.11. After a variety of odd jobs,Balaban (1942), p.8-9. Balaban found steady employment as an errand boy for local clothiers, hauling woolens and delivering suits.Balaban (1942), p.9-10. In his off hours, he pursued opportunities to sing, with his sister accompanying him on the piano. At his older brother's urging, he prepared a business card that read: \\"Abe Balaban, Singer. Character Songs.\\"Balaban (1942), p.15. On New Year's Eve, just before 1917 rolled in, Balaban proposed to Carrie Strump, a girl he had known in grade schoolBalaban (1942), p.8, 106-107. and with whom he had become recently reacquainted. In April 1918, Balaban and his fianc√© traveled to New York, where Balaban phoned Variety to get the name of a good rabbi to perform the marriage ceremony.Balaban (1942), p.108. The couple was wed on April 7, 1918.Balaban (1942), p.57, 111. In September 1922, Balaban's sister Ida, now Mrs. Sam Katz, died.Balaban (1942), p.72. Balaban's first child, Idajoy, named after her deceased aunt, was born in December. (Balaban and wife Carrie had two other children‚Äîdaughter Cherry Blossom, born on her father's birthday in April 1924, and son Bruce in August 1928.)Balaban (1942), p.112. Early theatres When ice and ice-cream purveyor and owner and founder of the \\"Sparkle Ice Company\\" and \\"Nonebetter Ice Cream Company\\", Samuel Donian, owner of \\"The Kedzie\\", a \\"nickel show\\" in a store on the corner of Kedzie and 12th Street, needed a last-minute act, 18-year-old A.J. and his sister performed \\"Take Me Back to New York Town\\".Balaban (1942), p.16. \\"How different it all was to the worries about fruit and vegetables spoiling before they were sold, and quarrels about under- weight and over-charge!\\" he recounted in his 1942 memoir, Continuous Performance. \\"It seemed much more attractive to me to rent a store where we could sell people a good time. 'We have only to rent films and hire a picture operator,' I said. 'I could be the singer and Ida could play the piano.'\\"Balaban (1942), p.17. =The Kedzie= During the first week singing at the Kedzie, the family came to hear A.J. and Ida, and on the way home his mother Gusse was enticed by the idea of a 'cash business' for the family.Balaban, D. (2006), p.15. A.J. learned from Charles Klaproth, the Kedzie's theatre manager and picture operator, that the Kedzie would rent for $100 a month. Balaban met with Donian about taking over the theatre operation, and \\"persuaded his family to rent the Kedzie from Donian\\".Marquee (1995), p.5 Pooling their savings of $178, the two older Balaban brothers and their parents took over the Kedzie on January 11, 1908; they all kept their day jobs. A.J. Balaban would book the films during his lunch break, acquiring product from the Vitagraph, Biograph, Lubin, Essanay and Edison studios.Balaban (1942), p.27. At once he eliminated two of Donian's promotions‚Äîa \\"circus-spieler\\" urging audiences to step inside, and a large gramophone blasting tunes to the street‚Äîintuitively choosing a more restful and less honky-tonk image. After a day's work, he would go to the theatre, where the doors would open at 7 p.m. The house had 103 camp chairs, some of which were broken and therefore not revenue-producers, and there were difficulties with electricity and attendance during severe winter storms.Balaban (1942), p.20. The shows and entertainment changed daily, with Balaban and his sister performing to \\"Illustrated Songs\\". Balaban would mingle with the audience and urge everyone to sing together.Balaban (1942), p.22. In addition to performing, Balaban also greeted incoming customers, beginning a lifelong commitment to hospitality and personal attention. His first innovation was to celebrate a holiday with a related film and entertainment. According to Balaban, his St. Patrick's Day screening of \\"The Irish Blacksmith\\" with his singing of \\"She's the Daughter of an A.P.A.\\" and \\"Tipperary\\", was \\"the talk of the neighborhood\\".Balaban (1942), p.20-21. A violinist was hired whose job was to accompany the films and participate in the entertainment. At first the musician, preoccupied with watching the picture, played incompatible passages. Balaban suggested the application of faster and slower music to correspond with the action. \\"So began the first music-cuing of our films\\", he recalled.Balaban (1942), p.21. By spring, with competitors looking for locations on the same street, Balaban told his older brother that they needed to build a bigger theatre.Balaban (1942), p.22-23. In September 1908, the brothers announced that they would not renew their lease on the Kedzie, but would build a $25,000 theatre on a lot at Sawyer and 12th Street, one block away.Balaban (1942), p.23. Though they concluded their relationship with the Kedzie in January 1909, the new theatre‚Äîto be called the Circle‚Äîwould not open until Labor Day.Balaban (1942), p.24, 29. Debts piled up, but Balaban relayed that \\"I loved every minute of the terrific wrestling of planning shows and house-management policies. New ideas seemed to pop like fire-crackers in my mind.\\"Balaban (1942), p.28. =The Circle= With The Circle featuring 700 seats and a four-piece orchestra, Balaban instigated a two-show-nightly policy, with matinees on Saturday and Sunday. With those responsibilities, Balaban left his steady employment and spent most of his days at the offices of the Western Vaudeville Agency.Balaban (1942), p.30. Having studied talent wherever he sang, he had learned to assess the entertainment value of performers. And he began to consider how to routine the Circle's shows, alternating between short films like \\"Aesop's Fables\\" and \\"Pathe Weeklies\\" and live acts, creating terms like \\"openers\\", \\"fillers\\" and \\"chasers\\". Israel Balaban, his father, carried films to and from the theatre each day.Balaban (1942), p.40. A scant two months after its opening, the show business trade paper Variety called The Circle \\"a neat little house\\" that for an admission of 10 cents provided \\"four vaudeville acts and several reels of pictures. The house changes shows every Thursday and Monday, splitting with S. Chicago.\\" Still, a Variety review published in January 1910, (the Balabans are referred to as the Hardaman Brothers, with misspellings in subsequent reviews to include Bollaban, Bolabon, and Ballaban), chides the theatre for poor arrangement of its acts.Balaban (1942), p.32. Balaban admitted that, later, he \\"saw and remedied the monotony and sameness that had defeated 'variety'‚Äîthe other name for vaudeville.\\" One remedy was the recognition of pure talent. Balaban worked with Minnie Palmer, mother to The Four Marx Bros., to book the Marxes' \\"Fun in High School\\", a popular act, and he worked often at The Circle with singer Sophie Tucker. Tucker wrote in her autobiography that \\"A. J. was the first to put on presentation shows in all the picture houses. It was he who brought out the first big bands. His houses with their huge orchestras, stage show, and pictures, all for less than a dollar admission. ... A.J. had a positive genius for knowing what the public would go for.\\"Tucker (1945), p.99. The other remedy was a responsibility Balaban felt toward the audience, \\"for making these people happy and gay; to release them even for a moment from the depression of their drab homes and usually burdened lives. That was my big aim and it dominated my every thought.\\" Balaban considered theatre management to be as creative and exciting as booking and creating the entertainment.Balaban (1942), p.36. His innovations at The Circle included free admission for children under 10 (a younger brother drew a line on the wall approximating the height of a ten-year-old for questionable admissions)Balaban (1942), p.41. and a baby carriage serviceBalaban, D. (2006), p.20. that watched over sleeping infants on the sidewalk outside of the theatre. When a baby awoke, a slide would be flashed on the screen‚Äî\\"Mother, Number 47, your baby is crying.\\"Balaban (1942), p.41-42. Other innovations attributed to A. J. Balaban include themed holiday presentations; shoppers' bargain matinees; reduced prices for week-day and non-peak hours, and midnight shows; giant illuminated theatre signs; and on-site nursery playrooms and hospital facilities.Balaban (1942), p.173-181. In addition to entertainment and hospitality innovations, the Balabans continued to make new business connections, securing an interest in the Ashland Theatre, taking over the Magnet Theatre near The Circle, and starting a film exchange called The General Feature Film Co.Balaban (1942), p.40-42. Balaban, capitalizing on what he saw as American audiences' fascination with film stars, opened a restaurant called The Movie Inn decorated with portraits of Theda Bara, Mary Pickford, Dorothy Gish, Fatty Arbuckle, Francis X. Bushman, Norma Talmadge and many others.Balaban (1942), p.44. Problems with the liquor license, gigolos preying on married women, and \\"waiter trouble\\" led Balaban to retire from the caf√© business, declaring that the theatre business was \\"tame and safe by comparison.\\"Balaban (1942), p.45. Early picture palaces In 1914, Balaban met Sam Katz, a by-day law clerk assisting his father, Morris Katz, at nights with the Katz family's own theatres.Balaban (1942), p.46. The young men became close, lunching together every day and sharing their visions for the future. According to Balaban, his own dream was to build 5,000-seat \\"Presentation Houses\\" on every side of town. He wrote that Katz told him, \\"I see no future in this business for me.\\" In time, Katz married Balaban's sister, Ida. By 1915, Balaban suggested that his brother Barney resign his position as Chief Clerk at Western Cold Storage and take advantage of Chicago's real estate opportunities, created by the city's rapidly expanding middle-class.Balaban (1942), p.42-43. Pooling talents, Barney Balaban, A.J. Balaban and Sam Katz formed Balaban & Katz in 1916 and financed the construction of a new 2,400-seat theatre, the Central Park, on Chicago's West Side.Balaban (1942), p.48. =The Central Park= In 1916, Balaban \\"took Katz to Baraboo, Wisconsin, to see the memorial theatre of the Ringling Brothers designed by Rapp and Rapp. It was a replica of a small European opera house. Katz was impressed with the Rapps\\"United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National Register of Historic Places: Mainstreet Theatre, Section 8, p. 28 so A.J. Balaban engaged the brothers Cornelius W. and George L. Rapp as the architects for the new theatre,Balaban (1942), p.50. which‚Äîdue to strides in steel construction‚Äîboasted a column-free auditorium and a grand horseshoe mezzanine of boxes, with a full balcony above. The Central Park opened on October 27, 1917,Balaban (1942), p.53. and its success led to many more Rapp and Rapp commissions for Balaban and Katz. At that time, Balaban gave an interview to the Chicago Herald-Examiner outlining his vision for the future of motion picture houses: \\"Five thousand seat houses; theatres built and constructed with artistic themes dedicated to the people and their children's children; music and art; ladies' parlors where milady's every wish will be on call; men's lounging room; theatre that will bring the various arts into one grand finale; blending of the opera to the fastest tempo of jazz; meeting place of the aristocrat and humble worker; order of the day of just a place to sit and be amused is passing; future show business will not be conducted by showmen but by business men; amusement is a business and the future of that business lies in business hands; business to come of selling amusement to millions and millions of men, women and children; and to that business, we (Balaban and Katz), who have taken it upon ourselves, should give and dedicate our theatres.\\"Balaban (1942), p.51. Balaban (1942), p.159-162. Thanks to Barney Balaban's experience with cold storage, the theatre had a washed air system and was air-cooled, allowing for refuge from summer heat‚Äîand year-round patronage. The stage was flanked by two side stages decorated to resemble gardens. According to Balaban's memoir, \\"Our colored stage lighting was extended to take in the whole house. The gently changing colors traveled from wall to ceiling, melting from soft rose to blue, lavender and yellow as they touched the velour of seats, crystal of chandeliers and the beautifully painted murals.\\"Balaban (1942), p.52. Balaban also believed that \\"a central figure in the orchestra pit seemed essential\\", identifying a young Viennese, S. Leopold Kohls, whose continental manners made him an ideal host and \\"good theatre. ‚Ä¶ He understood and co-operated fully with my ideas of creating fairyland illusion by the use of music, beautiful girls, color and line.\\" Kohls was \\"an instant hit\\". Balaban engaged New York City-based New York Studios to provide the side stages, drop curtain and stage scenery, with Frank Cambria, the Studios' Art Director and General Manager, in charge. Cambria boasted associations with New York's well-known producers and managers Charles Frohman, James O'Neill, David Belasco, Klaw and Erlanger, Winthrop Ames, Daniel Frohman and others, and had designed many prestigious productions.Balaban (1942), p.54-55. With business booming only a few months after the opening of the Central Park, Balaban & Katz received an opportunity to take over an unfinished vaudeville house. With Rapp and Rapp in tow, it was determined that the shell was large enough for Balaban's newest \\"fairyland\\", the Riviera Theatre, on Chicago's North Side.Balaban (1942), p.56. =The Riviera= The new Riviera was in a race to open against the Pantheon, a competing theatre around the corner.Balaban (1942), p.57. By 4 p.m of opening day, September 9, 1918, crowds were in line around the block in anticipation of the doors opening at 6 p.m. Balaban wrote that he recognized many of his previous customers‚Äîfrom the Kedzie, Circle, and Central Park‚Äînow older, with a baby or two in tow.Balaban (1942), p.58. The stage bill consisted of semi- classics performed by vocalists including Gladys SwarthoutBalaban (1942), p.60. and Tess Gardell (sic; generally known as Gardella), also known as \\"Aunt Jemima\\", who once came to the rescue of anxious patrons when the lights went out accidentally. In the dark auditorium she began singing \\"You're In Virginia Sure As You're Born\\", calming frazzled nerves.Balaban (1942), p.62-63. Frank Cambria's design for Balaban's Thanksgiving-themed presentation, featuring a giant pumpkin and dancers representing a waif, a chicken and scarecrow, was a big hit, bringing a newspaper notice that read, \\"We see production in the motion picture shows.\\" And for the run of Humoresque, the story of a young violinist, Cambria broke the picture by injecting the appearance on stage of a young man playing the violin to bring drama to the entire theatrical experience. A columnist tagged \\"Observer\\" in the Chicago Herald-Examiner wrote, \\"... it would be well indeed if only as a matter of civic pride to bring New York to town to let it see how Balaban & Katz put pictures on.\\"Balaban (1942), p.59-60. Another Balaban innovation was to provide free tickets to orphans, the aged, and the handicapped, particularly during slow periods before the Christmas holidays. And he provided a club room for the ushers, a recreation room for the musicians, and the start of First Aid Rooms in all future B&K; theatres with a trained attendant. Additionally there was a playroom for children‚Äîagain with a trained attendant, a sand box, slide, and toys‚Äîand a free checking service for suitcases and parcels.Balaban (1942), p.173-177. The success of Balaban & Katz brought challenges. A ten-week musicians' strike in 1919 called on Balaban's encyclopedic knowledge of vaudeville acts with their own pianists, in order to substitute for large orchestras.Balaban (1942), p.61. And he and his family \\"lived under constant fear of hoodlums\\", requiring a nightly police escort home. =The Tivoli= The first of Balaban & Katz's \\"big three\\" Chicago theatres, The Tivoli opened at 6:30 p.m. on February 16, 1921, on Chicago's South Side.Balaban (1942), p.67. The opening night in the city's first 4,000-seat motion picture theatre reportedly was a mob scene, with some people who had no intention of going to the theatre swept in off the streets by the crushing crowds.Balaban (1942), p.67-68. The Chicago Health Commissioner declared that the air-conditioned air in The Tivoli \\"was better than that on Pike's Peak\\". The Tivoli also boasted military-style drilling of the ushers, who were uniformed college boys strictly coached in their duties and service to the patrons. When the young men went off duty at evening's end, their \\"maneuvers\\" were enjoyed by patrons.Balaban (1942), p.69-71. The type of usher desired was later published in \\"The Fundamental Principles of Balaban & Katz Theatre Management\\", a handbook outlining Balaban's successful principles for running a large theatre. =The Chicago= The opening of The Tivoli was followed eight months later on October 26, 1921, by the opening of the Rapp and Rapp-designed Chicago, a 3,600-seat theatre on State Street in the heart of the business and shopping district. The theatre featured a 50-piece orchestra, a specially built Wurlitzer organ with percussive effects, and a team of 125 ushers. The successful combining, in palatial surroundings, of an elaborate stage show, created by Balaban, with Hollywood's more sophisticated and popular movies was becoming a staple of the movie-going experience‚Äîand a profitable Balaban & Katz signature. Other exhibitors would travel to Chicago in attempts to copy the formula. Eventually the Skouras Bros. and others would select stage shows they wanted for their own theatres.Balaban (1942), p.78. =The Uptown= By the time the chain opened The Uptown, a 4,300-seat house and the last of its \\"big three\\", in 1925, the production of stage-show \\"units\\", as they came to be known,Balaban (1942), p.74. served as an elaborate pipeline to the entire B&K; circuit; the chain even had its own movie magazine.Balaban & Katz Magazine (1925) Frank Cambria, now living in Chicago, had become full-time Art Director for Balaban & Katz,Balaban (1942), p.59. and he hired a young costume designer, Vincent G. Minnelli (as he was billed in a B&K; Production Department ad in Variety), to begin making costumes that the chain had formerly rented. Minnelli eventually would be promoted to a set designer as well.Minnelli (1974), p. 60. By 1929, Hollywood composer-to-be Victor Young was also a part of the B&K; Production Department team, responsible for musical arrangements. In his autobiography, Minnelli wrote that The Chicago's stage presentations were \\"later copied by Radio City Music Hall. ‚Ä¶ The shows ran a week at each theater, opening at the Chicago, then moving on to the Tivoli and the Uptown. A.J. Balaban would tour the theatres with Mr. Cambria and me every Monday, when the shows changed. We'd catch the first show at the Chicago downtown, then to the second show at the Tivoli. We'd have dinner before driving to the North Side and the last show at the Uptown.\\"Minnelli (1974), pp. 52‚Äì53. On a Grand Scale = Stage attractions= In refining an entire sector of show business during the explosion of motion pictures, Balaban assisted in elevating and changing the vaudeville business. The type of stage attractions ballyhooed by the B&K; theatres (\\"10,000 turned away daily\\") that Balaban was in charge of,Gomery, p.52. include such titles as: * \\"Syncopation Week\\"; * a Washington's Birthday tribute with a full-stage depiction of \\"Washington Crossing the Delaware\\"; * \\"Opera Versus Jazz\\"; * \\"Anniversary Show\\" with dance bands on stage for the first time, featuring Ted Lewis, Roy Bargy, Ted Fiorita (sic; generally known as Fio Rito), Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians, Paul Whiteman and John Philip Sousa (the latter two had never played motion picture houses before, according to Balaban, and \\"had to be paid well to do four daily shows, with five on Saturdays and Sundays\\"); * \\"Short Versions of Opera\\"; * \\"Tableaux of Operettas\\"; * singing novelty \\"Great Lovers\\", in which lovers in history, like Romeo and Juliet and Abelard and Heloise, serenaded one other; * a Sunday noontime \\"Symphonic Hour\\" conducted by Nat Finston with opera stars Tito Schipa, Emanuel List, and Gladys Swarthout; * featured organists including Jesse Crawford, Milton Charles and Henry Keats; * \\"Jazz Nights\\" at the Central Park (with Victor Young as first violinist); and * \\"Midnight Shows\\" on New Year's Eve, presenting Fannie Brice, Van and Schenck, Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, Belle Baker, Blossom Seeley and Bennie Fields, Sophie Tucker, Ted Lewis and others.Balaban (1942), p.75-78. A Feb. 14, 1924 review in Variety said that a B&K; presentation titled \\"Going Up\\" \\"graduated the Chicago Theatre stage shows from a mere prologue to a full-blooded presentation.\\"Balaban (1942), p.77. =Master of Ceremonies= Balaban is attributed with playing an important role in the development of the dance band business in the 1920s, \\"as one of the early Chicago entrepreneurs who... created the venues in which the bands played and helped shape both bands and their establishments into key entertainment attractions. A.J. Balaban showcased his movie-theatre pit orchestras by putting them on stage. In doing so, he made stars out of nearly anonymous pit bandleaders.\\"Sengstock (2004), p. 7. Early in 1925, Balaban traveled to San Francisco's Granada Theatre to see orchestra conductor Paul Ash and was impressed with the bandleader's relationship with the audience‚Äî\\"the conductor as Master of Ceremonies.\\"Balaban (1942), p.81. Despite the offer of less money, Balaban convinced Ash to come to Chicago.Balaban (1942), p.83. According to Balaban, \\"Paul was the first and greatest of all M.C.'s\\", giving Ginger Rogers, Ruth Etting, Joe Penner, Martha Raye (\\"then Martha Reed\\"), Amos and Andy (\\"then known as 'Sam' and 'Henry'\\") great starts and/or showcases.Balaban (1942), p.84. Alumni of Ash's orchestra include Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller and Red Norvo.Solid (Paul Ash) \\"At one performance, Will Rogers sprang over the footlights and onto the stage of his own accord, and introduced himself to Paul and the audience, announcing enthusiastically that he had never been in such a theatre atmosphere before. He declared it was like a huge house-party and he loved it\\", recalled Balaban.Balaban (1942), p.84-85. Starting at Chicago's McVickers (a theatre that competitor Paramount/Publix had asked B&K; to manage)Balaban (1942), p.84, 81. where he played for a year, Ash moved to the B&K;'s Oriental for another two years, before leaving for New York in mid-1928. In May of that year, Variety determined that Ash had appeared 4,500 times in three years in Chicago, playing to 14,700,000 admissions for a total of approximately $6 million at the box office. =High priced talent= During the active years of preparing the stage productions, Balaban's right hand was Morris Silver, who made trips to New York to secure talent. Silver met Abe Lastfogel of the William Morris Vaudeville Agency, and urged Balaban to meet him. Balaban put the meeting off for many months until Lastfogel met him unexpectedly and invited him to see some acts. The men had an immediate bond. Soon the agency was providing $100 acts as well as $10,000 attractions.Balaban (1942), p.79-80. Balaban later became acquainted with \\"Senior [William] Morris\\", and recalled that Morris and Lastfogel's \\"devotion and understanding took them out of the vaudeville-agency class, and much of the B & K stage-show success was due to them because they worked as if they were my partners.\\"Balaban (1942), p.80. Later, Balaban would convince Paramount head Adolf Zukor to buy a half-interest in the William Morris Agency.Balaban (1942), p.119. Publix merger By 1924, as B&K; had become the most profitable movie theatre chain in the business.Waller (2002), p.126 and acknowledged as a leading motion picture exhibitor, a merger was being considered with a film company. Beginning with taking over the McVickers, the Balaban brothers' relationship with Paramount/Publix had deepened. In 1926, B&K; merged with Paramount/Publix in a multimillion-dollar and stock swap deal. Sam Katz moved to New York to begin transferring the B&K; system of theatre management to all Paramount Theatres across the nation. However, with the advent of the 'Talkies', by 1929, major theatres were systematically abandoning stage shows except in the largest houses. Short recordings of top vaudeville acts began to replace the high priced live talent in a strategy to lower costs and raise profits.Waller (2002), p.129.Balio (1976), p.225. Tributes In February 1929, Variety dedicated an issue to A.J. Balaban‚Äîa tribute the publicity-shy executive neither sought nor wanted. Three significant articles were written about him‚Äîthe largest by Sime Silverman, the founder and publisher of Variety, citing Balaban as \\"a pioneer years ago in the development of the present day picture theatre. ‚Ä¶ For years, innovations and departures in picture house operation and stages have seemed to come out of Chicago ‚Ä¶ always new and always starting in Chicago, in a Balaban & Katz house. These innovations remained. They became permanent. Imitated by other theaters. What was created in Chicago usually found itself inserted into the formula of theater running or stage entertainment. ‚Ä¶ The vision, foresight and acumen of Marcus Loew and Adolph Zukor have never been denied. Place A. J. Balaban in that exclusive class. If A. J. Balaban has ever made an error in the direction of stage policy or local theatre organization, Variety has no record of it. ‚Ä¶ [He] is one of those whom the picture trade historians will dwell upon in time to come, when the real record of the most spectacular industry in the world is placed in type.\\" The remaining tributes are written by Frank Cambria and Morris Silver. Writer Hal Halperin reported on how the issue came about, particularly that Balaban wanted nothing to do with it. The publications displays numerous tribute advertisements from William Morris Sr., the William Morris Agency, the Skouras Bros., Sid Grauman, and a vast number of William Morris artists and others, including Harry Lauder, John Philip Sousa, Ted Lewis, Gus Kahn, Sophie Tucker, Ginger Rogers, and Jesse Crawford. And a separate box, containing Balaban's 1917 predictions for the business (originally published in the Chicago Herald Examiner in October of that year after the opening of The Central Park) is headlined \\"A. J. Balaban Predicted in 1917 Future Show Business of Today.\\" New York By mid-1929, it was determined that Balaban and his family needed to move to New York,Balaban (1942), p.99, 113. along with Frank Cambria and the entire production department. Vincente Minnelli recalls Cambria delivering \\"an ultimatum. If I wanted to stay with Balaban and Katz, I'd have to move with them to New York.\\"Minnelli (1974), p. 54. Now a Vice President of Paramount, Balaban was to supervise the creation and booking of remaining presentation units. He was made responsible for short subjects, which were moving into sound, and radio programs. (\\"The shorts were made up mainly of Presentations such as we had heretofore used on our stages, called Prologues and Productions\\", recalled Balaban. \\"When properly grouped together, these combined as a well-balanced vaudeville bill\\".) By August 1929, when Balaban and family were ready to depart for Manhattan, the City of Chicago threw a Citizen's Dinner in his honor that befitted the showman's impressive career, as well as the high regard and affection held for him personally. In an article in the August 14, 1929, edition of the Chicago Evening American, columnist Rob Reel wrote, \\"The leave-taking of A.J., called by this columnist 'the beloved Balaban,' is quite an event in Chicago's history, as he will from now on no longer be concerned intimately with movie exhibition problems here. The head of the Balaban brothers, who is in large measure responsible for the entrance of the family in the picture business, and whose affiliation with Sam Katz so many years ago resulted in establishing an entertainment epoch, will go to New York to be placed in complete charge of all Publix stage presentations and the production of all Paramount talkie shorts. This dinner is really a nice gesture on the part of the community as well as the industry. The accommodations are limited to 1,600, and already reservations are pouring in so fast that it looks as though many friends and acquaintances of A. J. will be disappointed.\\" Two hundred musicians, culled from all of the individual B&K; theatre orchestras, created for the evening one giant ensemble. The Balabans moved into an apartment at the Dorset Hotel on West 54th Street. Balaban was able to walk to work in the Paramount Building in Times Square.Balaban (1942), p.113. His wife, Carrie, described his schedule: \\"My husband usually left for the Long Island Studios at 8 o'clock where he spent the morning. At two, he returned to his Paramount office to remain until late in the afternoon. Between 5:30 and six he would dash in to catch a glimpse of his babies and to snatch a bite of supper. Invariably he ate in silence, falling asleep on the couch immediately afterwards. ‚Ä¶ Frequently it was necessary to awaken him because a ten-minute picture sequence or an act on Broadway had to be reported on by seven o'clock. He'd return from that, finish his nap, and dress for the theatre. Every play had to be seen, every picture opening attended; every caf√© entertainer watched before or after theatre. There was never a free time to relax, not even one whole evening a week. I always accompanied him at night, even though many times I slept through entire second acts of the best plays.\\"Balaban (1942), p.114-115. Early retirement Balaban's success as a Paramount executive, he recalled, \\"nearly defeated me in another field of life which I deemed equally precious\\"‚Äîtime with his family and his eagerness to travel. And his wife told him, \\"You have no time to eat or to sleep and you never smile any more. This grind will kill us all off if we stay.\\"Balaban (1942), p.120. By his own admission, Balaban was \\"bleary-eyed from the loss of sleep and worry. ‚Ä¶ I made the decision to take a six months' vacation and to leave for Europe where no theatres could claim my services.\\"Balaban (1942), p.120-121. It appears that with the advent of sound pictures and their novelty, the influence of the presentation units so beloved by Balaban were on the wane and may have been an influence in his early retirement. Minnelli wrote in his memoir that Paramount ultimately disbanded all traveling presentation units in 1933. With his brother Barney and his partner Sam Katz, Balaban had spent more than twenty years building B&K;, helped pull the family out of a life of near poverty and hardship (including the payment of all of his father's debts),Balaban (1942), p.147. and brought the younger brothers into the family business as each became old enough. (The youngest brother was born the same year the family first rented the Kedzie). A. J. and Barney were \\"very close and always felt a great sense of responsibility for their family's welfare.\\"Balaban, D. (2002), p.18 Each brother received a piece of B&K; and the youngest were provided with college educations. Harry and Elmer would go on to form their own business and become pioneers in radio and television.Balaban, D. (2002), p.28 Balaban was ready to retire. In April 1930, he confirmed his resignation to the press, announcing that he intended \\"to enter a larger field in the theatrical business.\\"Balaban (1942), p.121. As early immigrants, Balaban's parents‚Äîintending to travel abroad with A.J. and his family‚Äîhad no official \\"papers\\" with which to secure passports.Balaban (1942), p.125. Thanks to a last-minute intervention by William Morris Sr., all of the Balabans sailed at last on the Berengaria to Europe in May 1930.Balaban (1942), p.124, 131. A.J. Balaban was 40 years old. The family lived in Geneva, Switzerland for a few years, and considered the city its base, no matter where their travels or interests took them. The Esquire In 1936, Balaban was induced by his brother Barney to return to Chicago to build a movie theatre for younger brothers Harry and Elmer,Balaban, D. (2006), p.21. of H&E; Theatres, with Paramount's backing. His family lived in Evanston, Illinois, during this period.Carrie and A. J. Balaban Papers Balaban selected two young Chicago- based consultants, Pereira and Pereira, to design the Esquire Theatre, which opened in 1938, in a posh Art Moderne style. One of the nation's first \\"art houses\\", the theatre featured an art gallery and a coffee bar lounge. Popcorn was not served. When asked if the theatre was going to have an orchestra pit, Balaban reportedly replied, \\"That's over.\\" Instead of offering a bill of multiple films, the theatre showed only one film, combined with \\"The Esquire Hour\\", a section of shorts, cartoons and a quote for the day. Oriented to only film presentations and not stage shows, its sight-lines and acoustics were designed for top projection and audio quality. Architectural Forum selected it as \\"Building of the Month\\" in April 1938. The family returned to Geneva‚Äîwhere Balaban was a frequent visitor to the League of Nations headquarters‚Äîthen lived in Paris until the advent of war in Europe, when the family returned to the U.S. They lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, and then moved back to New York and the Dorset Hotel. The Roxy In the early Forties, Spyros Skouras approached Balaban about managing The Roxy Theatre near Times Square, which was not operating profitably. Its executive group consisted of people Balaban knew; rather than replace them, he re-invigorated them. The theatre kept its stage shows, but Balaban oversaw them and \\"hired top names to head the stage shows. Milton Berle, Jack Benny, Cab Calloway ... all played the Roxy. A better class of films was booked, and the theater's fortunes improved. The all-time boxoffice-champion movie, Forever Amber, was booked during this period. That policy lasted only six years, however. Its next transformation was astounding. The stage area was covered with a 30-foot-by-30-foot ice floor for ice [skating] shows. The theater's seating capacity was reduced to 5,886. The Center Theater on Sixth Avenue was also converted to ice, and both theaters did successful business.\\"Bloom, p.465 He also invited the New York Philharmonic, then under conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos, to perform four shows a day for two weeks in September 1950 to excellent business. Just two years from his final retirement, Balaban was still at the forefront of how to best ensure successful business in theatres. The March 18, 1950, edition of BoxOffice magazine offers Balaban's 18 tips for \\"personalized service\\"‚Äîand the need to make sure the patrons know about them. These included the original tenets that made B&K; theatres so successful decades earlier‚Äî\\"the theatre should be a veritable fairyland of novelty, comfort, beauty and convenience\\", the on-site medical clinic, and the prohibition of gratuities, among them.BoxOffice 3/18/1050, p.25 Nearing the end of his career, Balaban persevered in demonstrating that the extension of courtesies to customers was a proven strategy for success. Personal life and death In 1918, Balaban married Carrie Strump; they had three children Ida Joy (b. 1922), Cherry Blossom (b. 1924), and Bruce (b. 1928).New York Public Library Archives: \\"A. J. and Carrie Balaban papers 1903-1960s retrieved October 18, 2017 A.J. Balaban officially retired after nearly 10 years with the Roxy (1942‚Äì52) and the family returned to Geneva. In 1962, Balaban and his wife were in New York. They dined with friends and returned to their residence at the Laurelton Hotel where Balaban suffered a heart attack. He died on November 1, 1962, and was entombed at Waldheim Cemetery in the Balaban Mausoleum (built by Rapp & Rapp). Obituaries appeared in publications around the country and the world, including The New York Times, Time Magazine, and Variety. Time Magazine, November 9, 1962, identified Balaban as a \\"Midwest impresario of the 1920s movie-palace era who operated on the idea that theatres should be 'a thing of beauty, a fairyland,'\\" and in Variety, (November 7, 1962), Abel Green wrote, \\"Like a number of other greats of a great era of theatrical expansion, years of retirement and obscurity made A. J Balaban relatively an unknown to many newcomers. They might be prone to doubt his former importance.\\" At a Chicago Convention of Publix Theatres in July, 1930, his brother Barney Balaban (who would continue on with Paramount and become president in 1936,) said: \\"... I found a Chicago Sunday Examiner clipping, dated 1916, two years before the opening of the Riviera, our first stage deluxe house. In this article, my brother A.J. is quoted as prophesying the type of theatre now represented in the Chicago, Tivoli, Uptown and Michigan and stating that within a few years, we would have one of these theatres erected on the West Side, another on the North Side, one South, and one in the Loop. I thought at the time that Abe was dreaming. In rapid succession followed the Tivoli, Chicago, Uptown, and other theatres and A.J.'s prophecy of 1916 became a fact.\\"Balaban (1942), p.177.

It was first published in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine in June 1979 and has been reprinted in various anthologies. Plot synopsis Carla Brice, a famous scientist, is diagnosed with a fatal and incurable disease. She is frozen in cryogenic suspension against a time in the future when her disease may be curable. Some centuries later, in the year 2139, technology and medicine have advanced; she and several other frozen bodies are thawed out and their diseases cured. To help reorient Carla with her new life, she is placed with her great-great- great-great-great granddaughter Tacey Brice. Tacey is an unsuccessful illustrator and artist who makes a bare living and is glad to receive the support payments for hosting Carla. But she's intimidated by Carla's great beauty and intellect. Visiting doctors and scientists detect gaps in Carla's memory, and Tacey also slowly realises that all is not well, when Carla starts eating the houseplants. She graduates to devouring a visiting doctor and Tacey now realises with horror that Carla is an insatiable flesh-eater. The story is told by Tacey in flashback; she has had it explained to her by Carla that during suspension, Carla's body and the other frozen bodies were invaded by extraterrestrial intelligences. They have occupied the bodies and plan to use Earth's population as a source of food. But Carla has taken a liking to Tacey and keeps her alive in the manner of a household pet.

Causes The infection is spread by saliva, urine, respiratory droplets, sexual contact, and blood transfusions. Most people are exposed to the virus in their lifetime, but it usually produces mild or no symptoms in healthy people. However, serious CMV infections can occur in people with weakened immune systems. This includes patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer and patients on immune-suppressing medicines following an organ transplant. In rare instances, more severe CMV infection involving the GI tract has been reported in people with a healthy immune system. =Risk factors= The systemic use of corticosteroids in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. Diagnosis The diagnosis of CMV colitis is based on serology, CMV antigen testing and colonoscopy with biopsy. Clinical suspicion should be aroused in the setting of immunocompromised patient but it is much rarer in immunocompetent patient. Although it is known that CMV colitis is almost always caused by reactivation of latent CMV infection in immunocompromised patients, new infection of CMV or reinfection of different strain of CMV can cause colitis in immunocompetent hosts. Because asymptomatic CMV viremia and viruria is common and about 1/3 of symptomatic CMV infection is caused by reinfection of different strain of CMV, the diagnosis of CMV colitis needs more direct causality. It is practically achieved by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy tissue sampling and pathological evidence of CMV infection under microscope. Positive CMV IgG doesn't necessarily mean that it is reactivation of latent infection because of the possibility of reinfection of different strain. Treatment The usual treatment is antivirals, specifically ganciclovir or valganciclovir. Severe CMV colitis may lead a colectomy.

These included controversial black heavyweight champion Jack Johnson, American welterweight contender and European champion Willie Lewis, and British world middleweight championship Billy Papke. On August 22, 1911, Burke defeated world welterweight claimant Billy Papke, at St. Nicholas Arena in New York City, but could not claim the title as both men were fighting over the middleweight limit of 160. Papke was defending his World Middleweight title which he claimed from Jim Sullivan in a British World Middleweight Championship match, in a winning ninth round knockout two months earlier on June 8, 1911 at London's Palladium.\\"Papke Battered by Sailor Burke\\", San Francisco Call, pg. 10, San Francisco, California, 23 August 1911 Early life and career Charles Presser, known by the ringname \\"Sailor Burke\\" was born in 1885 in New York city. He began his career by 1904, focusing first in Philadelphia, and then primarily the New York City area, featuring many short 3-6 round bouts in well known clubs. According to one boxing history, he lost only seven of his first 29 reported fights. Professional career =Burke's rare knockout of New York boxer Joe Grim, 1906= On May 21, 1906, Burke became one of the only men to knock out New York boxer Joe Grim in the third round of four at Remson Athletic Club in New York. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote that Grim was down once in the second and three times in the third.Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote Brooke was down three times in the third in He defeated Grim again easily on June 21, 1906, and April 4, 1906 in two six round newspaper decisions in Philadelphia. =Burke's historic bout with world heavyweight champion Jack Johnson, 1907= Heavyweight Jack Johnson circa 1910 Before a sizable crowd of 5000, on September 12, 1907, Burke fought black heavyweight champion Jack Johnson at Smith's Theatre in Bridgeport, Connecticut, losing decisively in a one-sided six round newspaper decision. Clearly outmatched, Burke was knocked down at least once in every round. Johnson's dominance aroused suspicion among some in the crowd that the bout was fixed. Burke fought with a 23 pound disadvantage in weight, though only a two inch disadvantage in height.\\"Johnson Defeats Sailor Burke\\", The New York Times, New York, New York, pg. 8, 13 September 1907 As expected, the heavier Johnson showed superior strength, but his scientific boxing skills, and hitting accuracy dominated in a bout where Burke was knocked to the floor fourteen times in the six rounds. After the third round, Burke hugged and clinched frequently to avoid the blows of Johnson. In the fifth, Burke was down three times. The Buffalo Evening News praised Burke for lasting six rounds with such a superior opponent and avoiding a loss by knockout, particularly in the sixth when Johnson worked hardest to achieve one.\\"Sailor Burke Badly Whipped\\", Buffalo Evening News, pg. 10, 13 September 1907 Burke's bout with the black heavyweight champion Johnson attracted more attention and probably had more press coverage than any of Burke's other matches. =First bout with future world middleweight champion Billy Papke, 1908= On August 18, 1908, he lost to the great Billy Papke in a six round newspaper decision at the National Athletic Club in New York. Papke would wrest the world middleweight champion from Stanley Ketchell only three weeks later. According to the Decatur Daily Review, \\"Papke's lead at the end was too clear to make any decision necessary\\". On August 31, 1909 he lost to Jim Flynn of Boston, in twelve rounds of tough fighting at Boston's Armory Athletic Club. Burke received a warning from the referee for hitting on the breaks. The final rounds belonged to Flynn with Burke having to clinch often to protect himself.\\"Sailor Burke loses bout with Jim Flynn\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 21, 1 September 1909 =Three matches with world welterweight contender and European champion Willie Lewis, 1909-11= Burke fought the outstanding American welterweight contender Willie Lewis three times, though lost each bout in the opinion of most newspapers or by points or knockout. His first loss on August 13, 1909 ended in a third round knockout at the Fairmont Athletic Club in the Bronx. The first three rounds revealed each fighter down at least once, with both fighters down simultaneously in the third. In their second meeting on October 21, 1910, in New York, Burke lost in a ten round points decision. In their final meeting on March 9, 1911, Burke lost in a ten round newspaper decision of the New York Times to the skilled Lewis who was then boxing as a middleweight. The early part of the bout included a great deal of clinching and was fought at a slow pace. In the last five rounds, Lewis dominated but Burke managed to stay on his feet against his skilled opponent. Lewis's most telling punch was his stinging left to the head.Stinging left to the head in \\"Sailor Burke Gets Terrible Beating\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 19 March 1911\\"Sailor Clinches Hard and Often and Escapes Knockout\\", New York Times, New York, New York, pg. 11, 10 March 1911 A formidable opponent, Lewis contended three times for the World Welterweight Title in Europe from 1909-10, twice with the great Harry Lewis in Paris. On May 2, 1908, Lewis defeated Walter Stanton in Paris in a match billed as the World 150 lbs Welterweight Title. He defeated Jack \\"Twin\\" Sullivan, brother of 1907 world welterweight champion Mike \\"Twin\\" Sullivan, on April 4, 1910 at the Marathon Athletic Club in Brooklyn, in a ten round newspaper decision of the New York Times. =Bout with world welterweight contender Frank Mantell, 1910= On December 2, 1910, Burke lost a well-publicized ten round newspaper decision to Frank Mantell, a former world welterweight contender, at the New Amsterdam Opera House in New York. Burke took a great deal of punishment in the bout from his accomplished opponent, and was fighting as a heavyweight at this late point in his career. Burke got in several good jabs in the fourth, but then retreated and fought from a distance. As was his habit with superior opponents, he clinched frequently, though Mantell often dealt some of his best blows during clinches.\\"Mantell Hammers Burke\\", The Scranton Truth, Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg. 9, 3 December 1910\\"Sailor Burke a Battered Man\\", New Castle Herald, New Castle, Pennsylvania, pg. 7, 3 December 1910 Mantell had previously fought welterweight champions Harry Lewis and Honey Mellody in November of 1907 and January of 1908 in bouts billed but not sanctioned as world championships. Mantell defeated Mellody in a fifteenth round knockout in their January bout, though no title was passed to him. On April 10, 1911 he fought Dan Sullivan of Montana at the New York Athletic Club and won. On May 9, 1911 he lost to Dan's brother, Montana Jack Sullivan, at the Olympic Athletic Club. =Later career, and boxing retirement= Win over World Middleweight claimant Billy Papke, 1911 Middleweight champion Billy Papke circa 1910 On August 22, 1911, he defeated Billy Papke, two time World Middleweight contender, at St. Nicholas Arena in New York City in a newspaper decision of the New York Times. Papke was defending his World Middleweight title which he claimed from Jim Sullivan in a British World Middleweight Championship match, in a winning ninth round knockout two months earlier on June 8, 1911 at London's Palladium. Despite Papke's claim, the title did not pass hands as both men were over the middleweight weight limit of 160, and weighing nearer 165. Papke had no claim to the American title that August, as it was not recognized by boxing authorities, who credited Papke with the title only from September 7 to November of 1908, when he defeated and then again lost to reigning champion Stanley Ketchell. Burke battered Papke, but used little science in his approach. Attending the fight was the Marquis of Queensbury, credited with the invention of modern boxing rules. On October 17, 1911, he knocked out the great boxer Alfred \\"Soldier\\" Kearns in the second round in New York. The bout included both clinching and wrestling in clinches, and Kearns did not appear in top form. Burke dropped Kearns to the mat in the second round and after an aggressive flurry of punches dropped him again. While Kearns remained there, many in the dissatisfied crowd filed out.\\"Sailor Burke Too Fast For one Soldier Kearns\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, pg. 24, 18 October 1911 His last fight was in 1912 against Bob Moha.

Li was an elementary school teacher in the city of Tonghua, in northeast China's Jilin province. He began teaching in 1998, and he began molesting his students in August of that year. He assaulted various girls in his class for the next four years. The victims were all under the age of 14.\\"Teacher Executed for Rape, Sexual Assault on Students\\". china.org.cn. Retrieved 2010-11-07. In August 2002, Li changed classes and tried to molest his new students. However, the girls in his new class rejected his advances. Three parents then complained about Li Feng's behavior to the school's principal; the principal told the parent to take the complaint to the city's education board and ask for Li Feng to be transferred to another school, and that the school had \\"no authority\\" to fire Li Feng. On September 2, 2002, the city's department of education suspended Li Feng from teaching, but added the stipulation that he would be put on \\"observation\\" for another year. Thereafter, Li Feng was transferred to work at the department of education. Li Feng's father, Li Fuchen (Ê†óÁ¶èËá£), a local village chief and legislator, attempted to settle with the parents of the three children who filed complaints with the principal by giving each family 7,000 yuan (~$950), roughly equivalent at the time to an annual salary of a migrant labourer. Although initially the families seem to have been appeased by Li Fuchen's gestures, word of the case quickly spread in the city. Upon hearing word that Li Feng's father had paid off the three parents who complained to the school, the parents of the other victims decided to report Li Feng directly to the police. Li Feng, with the help of his father, attempted to escape the city to avoid arrest. He was officially fired from his job and the city revoked his teaching license. He was arrested by authorities in September 8, 2002. The case garnered significant notoriety and earned the attention of top Jilin provincial government officials, including Party Secretary Wang Yunkun and Deputy Party Secretary Quan Zezhu, and highlighted the failure of the city's education bureaucrats and the school board itself in addressing the case appropriately. The case was also notable for the silence of the victims and the failure of parents to detect the abuse of their children despite protestations by the pupils themselves. The principal of the school Li Feng worked at was fired after the investigation. It was later discovered that Li Feng had raped nine students in total and molested ten others.\\"Teacher who raped students is executed\\". tes.co.uk. Retrieved 2010-11-07.

Biography =Early career= Foucher was born in Paris and began his career as an employee in the offices of the War Department.Glaeser, p. 258. One day he visited the poet Alexandre Soumet, who asked Foucher whether he had read his brother-in-law's play Amy Robsart. (Foucher's older sister Ad√®le had married Victor Hugo in 1822.) \\"If you have not read it, there are some fine scenes in it.\\" Later Foucher asked Hugo if he could look at the play, and Hugo, who had been planning to burn it, instead gave it to Foucher and consented to let him revise it. Hugo had written the first three acts himself at the age of nineteen. He had then shown it to Soumet, who had disliked it, so Hugo had given his approval for Soumet to alter and finish it. The play combined comedy and tragedy, and Foucher, under the influence of the enormous success of Shakespeare as recently performed in Paris, revised it further and produced it under his own name in 1829, but it was such a complete failure, that Hugo \\"came forward and avowed his own share in the production, taking responsibility of the non-success.\\"Barbou, p. 107.Pitou, p. 528. Nevertheless, the whole affair did gain the young Foucher some notability. The play was never published, although Hugo gave the manuscript to Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, \\"who had it for a long time in his possession.\\" =Career as a dramatist= Foucher soon obtained employment as a journalist and proceeded to write a new play, Yseul Raimbaud, which was first presented at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on on 17 November 1830.Foucher, Paul (1830). Yseult Raimbaud, drame historique en quatre Actes et en vers. Paris: R. Riga. View at Google Books. It was attacked by the classiques (as the opponents of romanticism were then called), \\"but all agreed that there was talent and vigor in it. From that time the author's success was assured.\\" He rapidly showed himself to be imaginative and prolific, producing in quick succession Sayn√®tes (1832),Foucher, Paul (1832). Sayn√®tes.

Herbert Weinstock, in his biography of Donizetti, has speculated that Foucher in turn may have been influenced by John Dryden's 1690 tragicomedy Don Sebastian.Weinstock, p. 193. Foucher also contributed libretti for several operas and ballets, which \\"were not always impressive successes,\\" but some for the Paris Opera \\"revealed a lively imagination and a feeling for the picturesque situations dear to the audiences of his time.\\" These included Pierre-Louis Dietsch's opera Le Vaisseau fant√¥me (9 November 1842),Pitou, p. 1340. Adolphe Adam's opera Richard en Palestine (7 October 1844),Pitou, p. 1110. Edouard Deldevez's ballet-pantomime Paquita (a collaboration with Joseph Mazilier, who also did the choreography, first performed on 1 April 1846),Pitou, p. 1011. and Count Nicolas Gabrielli's pantomime-ballet L'√âtoile de Messine (20 November 1861).Pitou, p. 432. Most of Foucher's dramatic works were written in collaboration with well-known authors including Mazilier, D'Ennery, Arvers, Anicet-Bourgeois, Berthet, Goubaux, Desnoyers, Lavergne, R√©gnier, Borri, Jarry, Herbin, Bouchardy, Duport, Delaporte, Alboize, and Jaime. =Career as a journalist and writer of nonfiction= In 1848 he began to engage in politics, becoming the Paris correspondent for L'Ind√©pendance belge in Brussels. His submissions were \\"very remarkable\\" and \\"full of life and spirit, and also full of information.\\" He also became a noted theatre and music critic, first for L'Opinion nationale, for which he later wrote a Monday column entitled \\"Revue dramatique et lyrique\\", then for La France in 1865, and finally for La Presse. \\"After Jules Janin he was the critic who was most respected and feared.\\" Many of his reviews were collected and published in 1867 in book form as Entre cour et jardin: √©tudes et souvenirs du th√©√¢tre (Between Court and Garden: Studies and Recollections of the Theatre).Foucher, Paul (1867).

View at Google Books. =Personal traits= Foucher had several distinctive personal traits. He was so near-sighted, that in Paris he became a standard for comparison: myope comme Paul Foucher. His handwriting was so bad that the journals at which he worked had to employ a special copyist whose sole job was to carry out \\"Foucher translations\\". And he was notoriously absent-minded. Once he attended a ball thrown by the Turkish Ambassador, Ve'ly-Pasha. When it came time to leave, he searched his pockets for his coat- check number, but could not find it. The cloak-room attendant was unable to help him, so as the evening wore on Foucher requested the help of three Turkish guests in turn, each more decorated and high-ranking than the previous, but all without success. Finally the attendant said: \\"\\"You are a regular nightmare, you had better sit down and wait.\\" Still without his coat at daybreak, Foucher finally decided to go home, where at last he discovered his coat and realized why he had lost his number. Many such stories were told about Foucher, \\"who took them all amiably and kindly.\\" Foucher was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honor on 29 April 1847. He died in Paris and was buried at Montparnasse Cemetery. Victor Hugo followed the hearse on foot, until eventually the acclamations of the crowds of the Quartier Latin forced him to retire to one of the mourning coaches. According to The New York Times, due to Foucher's \\"incessant labor\\", he \\"left his family in comfortable circumstances.\\"  Works  = Plays = * Yseul Raimbaud (1830) * Sayn√®tes (1832) * La Mis√®re dans l'Amour (1832) * Les Passions dans le Monde (1833) * Caravage (1834) * Jeanne de Naples (1837) * Don S√©bastien de Portugal, trag√©die (1839) * Les Chevaux du Carrousel (1839) * Le Pacte de famine (with √âlie Berthet) (1839) * Bianca Contadini (1840) * La Guerre de l'ind√©pendance en Am√©rique (1840) * La Voisin (1842) * Les Deux Perles (1844) * Les √âtouffeurs de Londres (1847) * L'H√©ritier du Czar (1849) * Notre-Dame de Paris (1850) * Mademoiselle A√Øss√© (1854) * La Bonne Aventure (1854) * La Joconde (1855) * Les R√¥deurs du Pont-Neuf (1858) * L'Amiral de l'escadre Bleue (1858) * L'Institutrice (1861) * Delphine Gerbet (1862) * Le Carnaval de Naples (1864) * La Bande Noire (1866) =Operas and ballets-pantomimes= * Le Vaisseau fant√¥me, music by Dietsch (1842) * Richard en Palestine, music by Adam (1844) * Paquita, music by Deldevez (1846) * L'Op√©ra au camp, music by Varney (1854) * L'√âtoile de Messine, music by Gabrielli (1861) = Serialized novels = * Le Guetteur du Cordouan (1854, 3 vol.) * La Vie de plaisir (1860) = Nonfiction works = * Entre cour et jardin: √©tudes et souvenirs du th√©√¢tre (1867) * Les Coulisses du pass√© (1873) * Les Si√®ges h√©ro√Øques (1873)  References  Notes Sources * Barbou, Alfred; Frewer, Ellen E., translatator (1882).

All of the four founding musicians are former members of Daisy Chainsaw and Queenadreena, notable bands of the London alternative scene.  History  The Dogbones were founded by Crispin Gray (a.k.a. Johnny Orion), a former guitarist of Daisy Chainsaw and Queenadreena who at the end of 2007 gathered other members of those two bands. Nomi Leonard, who played on bass in Queenadreena, took vocals and guitar along with Crispin Gray, while Michael Vakalis was on bass and Vince Johnson on drums. The Dogbones usually do not show their former affiliations, however, and they used numericals on the sleeves of their releases for identifying the musicians. Crispin Gray always uses his middle names alias Johnny Orion in relation to The Dogbones. The band were well known for using two drummers set in their live shows, with Vince Johnson being the primary drummer. Joao Pires (ex Selfish Cunt), the original second drummer in The Dogbones, was replaced circa June 2011 by Matt Banham. Angus Duprey (GOiD) replaced Matt in late February/early March 2013. The principal drummer Vince Johnson took over sole drumming duties circa February 2014. Their self-titled debut album was released in October 2010 in the UK through the band's own label Buzz Saw and distributed by Cadiz Music. In The Independent, Simon Price described the sound as \\"a seductively scuzzy, drum- heavy mix of ramshackle voodoo rock, chaotic glam-punk and shouty grrl music\\". The album was released earlier in Japan in March 2010 through 51 records with different artwork and a demo bonus track, 'Stitch'. It also features the English-language version of 'Ley Line' (the 'Aneurin' version on the UK release is in Welsh). In support of the album The Dogbones released two vinyl singles. The first one, \\"Mae Du Ffrindiau I Gyd (Am Du Ladd di)\\" (B side: \\"Gwlad Ar Fy'n Nghefn\\"), a 7\\" split single, is released in August 2010 jointly by The Dogbones and Klaus Kinski label and available through Ankst Music, distributed by Shellshock. The second one, \\"I want Alcohol\\" (B side: \\"Monkey\\"), again a 7\\" vinyl single, is released in November 2010, through Custom House Records. The band have published initially three music videos along with their debut album: Hey Chihuahua (2012), The Whole World is Weird (2011) and All Your Friends (Are Going to Kill You) (2011). Another two videos were released with tracks from their still unpublished second album. Everybody Thinks You're Strange (2013) was animated entirely by Crispin Gray and ‚ÄúGot To Get Out of Here‚Äù (2014) features visual extracts from various Georges M√©li√®s films: The Merry Frolics of Satan (1906), Le Voyage dans la Lune (1902), and La Royaume des f√©es (1903). As of 2015, The Dogbones have been on a mysterious hiatus, and both Gray and Vakalis are currently active in the indie rock band Starsha Lee.

Species in this genus include tree decay fungi that may be pathogenic and cause deterioration of tree health including mortality. Fungi in the genus produce shelf-like polyporous fruiting bodies that release spores from pores. Mating studies in the late twentieth century and genetic studies in the early twenty-first century have led to description of several new species and replacement of some of the original names. As a result, two former Heterobasidion species, H. annosum and H. insulare, are now recognized to each comprise multiple distinct species. Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato is a collection of the several species that cause Heterobasidion root disease and butt rot of forest trees and occasionally those in landscape plantings across the Northern Hemisphere. These fungi can be saprotrophic or necrotrophic, colonizing nonliving heartwood or living roots. Numerous tree species have been identified as hosts, but evergreen trees such as pine are most commonly affected. Heterobasidion root disease and butt rot are a serious issues to forest health due to tree mortality, decreased lumber volume and quality, and lessened carbon sequestration. This group of species include some of the most intensively studied forest tree pathogens, becoming the first basidiomycete forest pathogen to have its genome sequenced in 2012. Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato includes five species, which differ in host preference, genetics, morphology, and geographic range. Sexual mating tests have identified three inter-sterility groups: P, S, and F, named after their chief hosts (pine, spruce, and fir). The five species are H. abietinum (F-type), H. annosum sensu stricto (P-type), H. irregulare (P-type), H. occidentale (S-type), and H. parviporum (S-type). Genetic analysis have demonstrated the North American species, H. irregulare and H. occidentale, are distinct from each other and the European species within their inter-sterility groups. Heterobasidion insulare The H. insulare complex comprises seven Heterobasidion species present in Eastern Asia and India. These are primarily saprotrophic decay fungi that are rarely pathogenic. These fungi are found on stumps and logs of are evergreen forest tree species including pines, firs, cedars, and spruces. Some species of this fungal complex can be easily differentiated from H. annosum sensu lato due to the red coloration on the top surface of the fruiting body. Once considered a single species, theH. insulare complex is now considered to comprise six distinct species based on results of morphological studies, intersterility trials, and genetis. Mating tests have identified four inter-sterility groups: N, T, Y, and Z. The seven species are H. orientale (N-type), H. ecrustosum (T-type), H. insulare sensu typi, H. linzhiense, H. australe, H. amyloideum, H. tibeticum (Z-type). Heterobasidion araucariae Heterobasidion araucariae is a saprotrophic decay fungi found in Australia, Oceania, and may be present in Indochina. While not considered pathogenic it can help decay logs and stumps of Agathis, Araucaria, and Pine species. Other Species There are three isolates that have been proposed as new species but further description may be necessary. *Heterobasidion pahangense Corner *Heterobasidion rutilantiforme (Murrill) Stalpers *Heterobasidion arbitrarium Corner References Category:Russulales Category:Russulales genera ","title":"Heterobasidion"},{"id":"29523798","text":"Spiniger is a genus of fungi in the family Bondarzewiaceae.

Local characteristics  Udo shrine is in a cave in the side of the cliff, near the Nichinan coast of Miyazaki. The honden, or main shrine, is in a cavern with a view of the ocean. In the cave is the ochichi iwa, or \\"breast stone,\\" a dripping stone which is said to have fed the kami Ugayafukiaezu, father of the first emperor of Japan, when his mother returned to the sea. The shrine sells a candy made from the water of this stone, mizuame, a kind of taffy. In the slight distance of the cavern is a rocky island with two peaks. Attendees can purchase small clay balls and attempt to toss them between the peaks for good luck.

It extends from near Caergwrle in the north, southwards through Wrexham, Ruabon and Rhosllannerchrugog to Chirk in the south. A small part extends into Shropshire around Oswestry. Beyond Caergwrle the coal-bearing strata continue northwards as the Flintshire Coalfield. Together the two coalfields are known as the North Wales Coalfield. History The shallower parts of the Denbighshire Coalfield were worked extensively in the early nineteenth century, most of the coal being used in the iron industry. In the mid-nineteenth century, much deeper pits were established and a network of railways was built in the Wrexham area to transport the coal. A report on the North Wales Coalfield in the 1950s found that the reserves of coal were running low and that in the Denbighshire Coalfield, the geology of the coal- bearing strata dipped rapidly rendering it unlikely that the coalfield could be further developed. The last deep mine to operate in the coalfield was Bersham Colliery which closed in 1986. Prior to this time, as many as 38 collieries had been in operation across the area, with a peak output in excess of 2.6 million tons, and giving employment at the height of production to some 12,000 men.WCBC: Bersham Colliery Mining Museum Coal seams Several coal seams are named in the sequence.

In 2010, the group of companies was listed among the fastest growing in the world. In 2011, the group became the largest private power provider in India. Lanco was one of the first Independent Power Producers (IPP) in India. History Lanco was founded by a businessman Lagadapati Amarappa Naidu and his nephew Lagadapati Rajagopal, who was a member of 15th Lok Sabha representing Vijayawada from Indian National Congress. While Rajagopal remains inactive, his brother Lagadapati Madhusudan Rao is the executive chairman. Another brother Sridhar Lagadapati, was involved with the company in the early years, but now heads the related entertainment business, Larsco. Lanco grew at a tremendous pace since the early 1991s. Initial growth was driven by large contracts primarily in construction. Later, other infrastructure areas such as power generation, transportation were also added.

Debt restructuring  In June 2013, Lanco had won a contract for setting up two 300 MW power plants in Gujarat. However, the contract was cancelled in October 2013, when the company failed to put up the 10% guarantee required in the contract. By July 2013, the company had filed for debt restructuring, citing a business slowdown. Ailing infrastructure firm Lanco Infratech, which has a consolidated debt burden of over Rs 46,200 crore, said it has approached the lenders for restructuring the debt of some Rs 7,500 crore at the holding company level. In September, it was revealed that the company had cut down its employees by nearly half. In December 2006, the company won a large contract citing a collaboration with Singapore firm Globeleq.Lanco blames Globeleq for trouble over Sasan - Livemint In 2007, after winning the bid for the 1000 MW Anpara-C power plant, Lanco requested that the power output be re-negotiated. Some competing firms protested since the re-negotiation made the initial bidding meaningless. However, Lanco managed to retain the Anpara project. Repeatedly tarnished by charges of corrupt practices quote: Lanco has misled the Government on the question of ownership of projects and has won several projects using an opaque ownership structure when the rule says that a developer can secure only one project.

He is an author, Franco- Belgian comics (bande dessin√©e) scriptwriter, storyteller and lecturer at the origin of renewed interest in fairies and little people in France. Fascinated quite young by fairy tales and Fairytale fantasy, he became an illustrator after only a short study of Fine Arts. He has brought together local legends and recreated them in radio and television shows for over thirty years. He is the inventor of elficology (elficologie) as a name for the study of the \\"little people\\" (fairies and other similar beings), although it was originally just a joke on his part. His first comic book was published in 1986 and knew only a success of esteem. Since then he has produced one each year and also made regular appearances on television and at conferences, always in the area of fairy tales, dreams and legends related to the fairies, who have become his specialty. It is largely thanks to his encyclopedias of fairies, imps, and elves, results of twenty years of research and published in the 1990s, that Pierre Dubois won his international recognition as a French specialist in everything involving magic . These encyclopedias sold thousands of copies at a time when they were the very first works of their kind in France. Since then the works of Pierre Dubois, whether art books, encyclopedias, collections of short stories or collections of stories for adults or children have experienced a certain success, marked by scholarship and humor everywhere. Pierre Dubois has himself become a source of inspiration for other writers and designers who have taken up the idea of elficology.  Biography  Pierre Dubois is \\"a jack of all trades\\" who does as well at radio, television, and cinema, as in the literary world or the comic strip. In his speeches, his lectures and his interviews, he regularly evokes anecdotes from his childhood and his encounter with \\"the spirit of the place.\\" = Childhood = Pierre Dubois was born in Charleville in the Ardennes, then located in North Zone under the military administration of Belgium and the North. He remained \\"Belgian\\" for two years until the formation of the French Fourth Republic. He spent part of his childhood near the Ardennes forest, where many local legends circulate; this is where he began to believe in the \\"spirit of place\\". His parents moved to the Nord, in Valenciennes, which interrupted this and gave him a \\"contemplative and lonely\\" childhood. He described this \\"house of the North\\" with a scullery beside the garden which served as a laundry room, where he imagined stories, seeking the forest that was missing. Only reading, pictures and music could calm him down. During his childhood, he sometimes returned to spend his vacation in Montherm√©. His father is an industrial designer who was very serious and often absent. He forbade reading and comic books. From when Pierre learned to read, it was to try to find the atmosphere of fantasy adventure films. Indeed, in the 1950s, his mother quietly took him to the movies on Thursdays to see Technicolor films such as Robin Hood, Tarzan, and Ivanhoe; Pierre Dubois thus \\"met\\" Errol Flynn and Liz Taylor. For a long time comics and reading had an image of contraband for him; he read the comics that his mother bought for him in secret, like Ren√© Giffey's Buffalo Bill. = Vocation = His style of fantasy is above all Anglo-Saxon, after the manner of authors such as Bram Stoker, Mary Webb and Charlotte Bront√´, but also of Walter Scott, Lewis Carroll and Robert Louis Stevenson. Pierre Dubois rapidly developed a passion for legends and the little people. He began writing and drawing very early, \\"fascinated by image and narrative\\" and wishing to tell himself stories. He wanted to become a writer, but was criticized by his teachers for having \\"too much imagination\\" and writing \\"off topic.\\" Pierre Dubois has described himself as a \\"bad pupil\\". As a teenager, he wanted to be a hitman and at the age of fifteen, he wanted \\"to be edited by Jean-Jacques Pauvert or nobody\\". Pierre Dubois' interest in and talent for illustration, as well as his pronounced dislike of school, caused him to be enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Valenciennes, where he learned drawing and etching. While still a student, he wrote with a quill pen a manuscript on parchment covered with leather, which he succeeded in bringing to the attention of Jean-Jacques Pauvert. Upon receiving a rejection letter, he resubmitted his entire portfolio in person, decorated with illuminations, all on drawing cardboard flecked with green and black, with bookmarks of grass. Pauvert agreed to see him, but when Dubois refused to give him his only copy, the editor advised him to return in a few years. = Early career = illustration of an elf teasing a bird by Richard Doyle. Pierre Dubois left his studies early to devote himself to writing and illustration. He began his career as an illustrator for magazines like Creepy and Eerie, but had difficulty finding work. It was also at this time that he began to collect local legends that were disappearing. When he was younger he had had the opportunity to read La Malvenue (The Unwelcome), a novel by Claude Seignolle. He performed his military service much later in Epernay and met the daughter of folklorist Arnold Van Gennep, who advised him to talk to Claude Seignolle. This author has a passion for fairy tales and legends and Pierre Dubois made drawings for him, which finally put his \\"foot in the stirrup\\". These meetings with Claude Seignolle and later Gilles Lapouge resulted in Pierre Dubois becoming passionate about the old crafts, popular fairy tales, folklore and the marvelous. = References = dans Fan2Fantasy, 4, May 2009, p. 6 Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:People from Charleville- M√©zi√®res Category:French fantasy writers Category:Writers from Hauts-de-France Category:Storytellers Category:French male writers Category:21st-century French non-fiction writers ","title":"Pierre Dubois (author)"},{"id":"29524024","text":"Gustav A. \\"Geza\\" Silberer (1 December 1876 ‚Äì 5? 8?

Linnaea 4:157. (see External links below) They named it for Kadu, a native of Ulea, one of the Marshall Islands. Kadu was a friend of von Chamisso and provided valuable assistance to the 1815‚Äì1818 expedition led by Otto von Kotzebue. The generic name Kadua fell into disuse in the 20th century, because most authors considered it to be a synonym of Hedyotis. In 1999, twenty species of Kadua were described as species of Hedyotis in a Flora of Hawaii.Warren L. Wagner, Derral R. Herbst, and Sy H. Sohmer.

It combined British and Indian Army regiments, and initially its numbers were around 7,500 men, but they later reached about 14,000. The second phase of the Second Afghan War was set in motion by the murder of Cavagnari and his staff at Kabul on September 3, 1879. The only British troops then in Afghanistan were the Kurram Valley Field Force, commanded by Roberts. This was speedily reinforced by new units and ordered to advance on Kabul, with the objective of restoring Abdur Rahman Khan to the throne there.Robert Wilkinson-Latham, North-West Frontier, 1837-1947, pp. 15-16 online Roberts led his Force over the Shutargardan Pass into central Afghanistan. With twenty field guns and 7,500 men, infantry, cavalry, artillery, and Sappers & Miners. Roberts's force moved up the Kurram Valley, winning various skirmishes and receiving envoys from Ayub Khan denying responsibility for the murders. By the beginning of October the force was at Char Asiab, twelve miles from Kabul, where 8,000 Afghans were dug in, and it defeated the Afghan Army at Char Asiab on 6 October 1879. The subsequent capture of Kabul on 13 October was described by Howard Hensman, correspondent of the Daily News of London. On 11 November, a fall of snow caused the death of some of the force's elephants.Field Marshal Lord Roberts of Kandahar, Forty-one Years in India: from Subaltern to Commander-in-chief (1897, reprinted Asian Educational Services, New Delhi, 2005), p. 426 online By mid-November, the Force was divided into two Divisions, the first at and around Kabul, the 2nd on the Khyber line. The 1st Division contained 100 British Army officers and 2,783 other ranks, plus 71 Indian Army officers and 5,060 other ranks; while the 2nd Division contained 90 British Army officers and 2,385 other ranks, plus 118 Indian Army officers and 8,590 other ranks.Roberts, op. cit., p. 427 In December 1879, 10,000 Afghans rose against the invaders, but Roberts was well prepared and was victorious at the Battle of Sherpur. In an action at Killa Kazi on 11 December 1879, James Adams, a chaplain to the Force, rescued some men of the 9th Lancers from a ditch while under enemy fire, for which he was later awarded the Victoria Cross.

Although the cannibalistic ritual has been initiated by the town chief, the villagers feel close to rebelling against him as more of their food has been given to his soldiers than the townspeople. Agent 999 is rescued from the villagers by Rolex, who has been posing at the village chief's assistant. He rescues Agent 999 as an act to help redeem his career. Soon after, Rolex is caught by the village chief and eaten. This leads to Agent 999 escaping from several different villagers along with a newfound love in his life named Eileen. Themes We're Going to Eat You contains anti- communist themes. This is shown through the village chief's attitudes regarding the distribution of meat among the villagers and soldiers and his uniform. Tsui suggested that this theme possibly came from his own student film work.Morton, 2009. p.40 Production Large portions of the music from We're Going to Eat You are taken from the Italian horror film Suspiria. Tsui said that the reason for the use of this existing music at the time was that there was no budget for an original soundtrack. Release We're Going to Eat You debuted on 2 April 1980.Morton, 2009. p.38 It took in HK$1,054,985.50 in the Hong Kong box office. At the end of the year, it placed at number 113 of the top-grossing Hong Kong films for 1980. This was very low in comparison to Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind, which was the 33rd top-grossing film at the Hong Kong box office in 1980.Morton, 2009. p.39 We're Going to Eat You has been released under several titles, including Hell Has No Gates, No Door to Hell, We Are Going to Eat You, We're Going to Eat You! and Kung Fu Cannibals. Tsui has panned the film itself, saying that \\"it didn't turn out good\\".O'Brien, 2003. p.17 Notes =References= * * External links  Category:Hong Kong films Category:Hong Kong horror films Category:1980 horror films Category:1980s comedy horror films Category:1980 films Category:Films directed by Tsui Hark Category:Films about cannibalism Category:1980 comedy films ","title":"We're Going to Eat You"},{"id":"29524162","text":"Trifolium gymnocarpon is a species of clover known by the common name hollyleaf clover.

Originally from Portland, Maine, Scott has been involved the music scene since the age of 15. After playing with a number of bands, Scott branched out and began a solo career in the Fall of 2008. Since then he has been on several national tours, recorded his first EP, and most recently saw the release of his first national radio single, \\"Representin'\\". In February 2010, Scott recorded his first full length album titled \\"So Much More\\" which released on May 18, 2010. Scott plans to spend some quality time in the studio in early 2012 to begin work on his second album. Scott currently resides in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and works out of Nashville, Tennessee. Career =Three Days Down= Scott grew up in Portland, Maine as an only child and loved music right from the start. Scott occasionally sang in church growing up, and at the age of 12 played his first guitar chords. Scott's interest in guitar continued to grow as he spent many of his summers inside the house practicing chords and scales as he grew up through adolescence. He started writing music as soon as possible and was in his first band at the age of 15. Scott played lead guitar for a local Christian rock band and had the opportunity to play all around the state of Maine performing for youth groups. In 1997, Scott and some friends formed the band Three Days Down. During the next several years Scott got to travel all around the northeast and perform for audiences large and small. As the lead singer of Three Days Down, Scott had the opportunity to perform concerts with artists such as Downhere, Justin McRoberts, Geoff Moore, Sara Groves, and Seventh Day Slumber. =New Mercy Morning= Due to the inevitable name confusion with popular bands Three Doors Down and Three Days Grace, in 2004 Three Days Down became known as New Mercy Morning. Along with his friends and bandmates, Scott recorded two full length albums that did very well for the band and brought the group much indie success. Scott continued to perform around New England for the next 4 years until it was time for him to take his music to the next step. =Solo career= Scott Logan started his solo career in October 2008 and started to re-invent his style by adding some new and different elements into his music. In Summer of 2009, Scott worked with producer Dan Merrill to record his first solo EP. Scott enlisted the help of several area musicians to play on the album, including a couple of former bandmates from New Mercy Morning. In February 2010, Scott recorded his first full length album titled \\"So Much More\\" which released on May 18, 2010. It includes 10 songs. In early 2012, Scott plans to begin work on a second solo album. Personal life In addition to being a singer-songwriter, Scott has also been a worship leader within the non-denominational church organization Calvary Chapel. Scott travels across the country and occasionally tours through Calvary Chapel churches to lead worship as well as perform concerts. Scott was born Scott Logan Anderson. To avoid name confusion with his father (who is also named Scott Anderson) who was also a member of Three Days Down and New Mercy Morning, Scott legally changed his name to Scott Benjamin Logan. Scott married his wife Shanon in 2005, who became his inspiration for his other new radio single called, \\"Color.\\" While working out of Nashville, they have made Chattanooga, TN their new home.

She was born in Ota, Tokyo, Japan, and is currently married to Jun Nagura of the comedy trio Neptune. She is a former Japanese idol singer who is now known as a television commentator and author who speaks about fashion, travel, personal health, and contemporary issues. History =Biography= Marina Watanabe was born and raised within the Tokyo area. It is said that her father named his daughter \\"Marina\\", an unusual name in Japan which comes from Latin, because he enjoyed yachting. In 1986, she was discovered by star agents, and subsequently passed her audition tests to become an idol in the same year. Soon after, she joined the all-girl idol group Onyanko Club. It was during her time within the group that she made her debut. Her debut song \\"Shin Koukyuu Shite\\" (to breathe deep) became a number one song on Oricon charts, and later got her in the record books for setting the record for the youngest singer to have a number 1 Oricon hit (a record that stood for 15 years until it was broken by a member of the Morning Musume group in 2001). She was 15-years and 11-months old at the time. After her idol club was disbanded, Watanabe continued to participate in various variety shows as a singer. Initially she used mainstream idol clothing in her performances. However, because she decided to purchase her own clothes and design her performance style while abandoning traditional idol styles, she became more popular. Later, she was found to have talent as a comedian, thus she decided to take on more diverse roles such as that of a variety show announcer with a comedic yet sophisticated touch. It was from this period on that others started to notice that she was trying to hide or down-play the fact that she once was a member of an idol group. Throughout the 1990s she continued to build broad networks within the subculture genre of Japan as both an announcer and celebrity, which eventually led to her rising popularity. Currently, she is famous in Japan for her essays and books concerning her hobbies of fashion, travel, and personal health. She is also known widely as a \\"Taiwan-know-all\\". =Personal life= After marriage to her husband in 2005, her official name was changed to Nagura Marina, as she adopted her husband's surname \\"Nagura\\". However, she continues to work with her old maiden name, Watanabe Marina. She gave birth to her first child, a son, in December 2008. She gave birth to a daughter on June 24, 2010.

It extends from Point of Ayr in the north, through the Wrexham area to Oswestry in Shropshire in the south. A much smaller area on Anglesey where coal was formerly mined is not usually considered to form a part of the coalfield, although it is geographically in the North Wales region. History In north Wales, the Flintshire manors of Ewloe, Hopedale, and Mostyn and the Denbighshire manor of Brymbo were recorded as making profits from trading coal during the 14th and 15th centuries. By 1593, coal was exported from ports on the Dee estuary. Trade developed swiftly and by 1616, the principle collieries were at Bagillt, Englefield, Leaderbrook, Mostyn, Uphfytton and Wepre. Most were horizontal adits or shallow bell pits, although a few were sufficiently large to have accumulations of water and ventilation problems. In the Denbighshire Coalfield, the areas of Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham became heavily industrialised and exploited large deposits of iron, coal and clay. The last pit here, the Bersham Colliery closed in 1986 when it became uneconomic. Geography The North Wales Coalfield is divided into the Flintshire Coalfield to the north and the nearly contiguous Denbighshire Coalfield to the south.

The book earned Tatsumi the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize, and won two Eisner Awards. The work has been adapted into an animated feature film, Tatsumi, directed by Eric Khoo and released in 2011.  Publication history  Tatsumi spent 11 years working on A Drifting Life. It was released in Japan as two bound volumes on November 20, 2008. It is licensed in North America by Drawn and Quarterly and was released as an 840-page wide-ban volume in April 2009. The English version was translated by Taro Nettleton, and edited and designed by American cartoonist Adrian Tomine. The book has been translated into French as Une Vie dans les marges (\\"A Life on the Margins\\") (Editions Cornelius, 2011), and into German as Gegen den Strom ‚Äî Eine Autobiografie in Bilder (\\"Against the Current ‚Äî an Autobiography in Pictures\\") (Carlsen Verlag, 2013).  Plot  Hiroshi Katsumi (Yoshihiro Tatsumi) and his sickly older brother Okimasa (Sh≈çichi Sakurai) work on amateur four-panel manga to submit to magazines that feature reader's work, winning several times. After like-minded children correspond with Hiroshi, they form the Children's Manga Association. This results in a round table discussion for the grade school edition of Mainichi Shimbun with Osamu Tezuka. Hiroshi forms a relationship with Tezuka, who encourages him to try making longer stories. also gives him feedback and advice for his longer manga through letters. After Okimasa rips one of his works in progress, Hiroshi momentarily quits manga, but is encouraged after a letter from ≈åshiro. ≈åshiro later asks to redraw and publish Katsumi's Happily Adrift, but does not end up doing so. ≈åshiro offers Hiroshi a chance to live at his home \\"dojo\\" with other aspiring manga artists, but Hiroshi decides to postpone until he graduates high school. One of the members of ≈åshiro's dojo, Yoshiyasu ≈åtomo, shows Katsumi's Children's Island to the publisher Tsuru Shobo, who publishes it, though they preemptively reject his next work. Hiroshi decides to attend college instead of apprenticing with ≈åshiro, studying for entrance exams, but purposefully doesn't finish the exam. He meets with publisher Kenbunsha, who commissions him to create a detective story similar to Lupin, but they reduce their payment offer so instead he publishes Seven Faces with , with whom he would go on to publish many works. Okimasa also joins Katsumi at Hinomaru. Hinomaru's editor Kuroda establishes a new monthly collection with its top authors titled Shadow (Kage). Katsumi aspires to create more experimental manga utilizing cinematic techniques, an \\"anti-manga manga\\", against his friendly rival and colleague . Because Shadow was reducing its artists' output, Hinomaru requests them to also work on full-length work. It facilitates this by putting Katsumi, Matsumoto, Takao Saito, and Kuroda in a \\"manga camp\\", an apartment in Tenn≈çji-ku, Osaka. However, they are not very productive in the new environment and heat, and Katsumi finds himself attracted to the downstairs Suzume Diner's madam. Hinomaru also ventures into publishing gag panel manga from Tokyo artists, but this results in a large loss. After Matsumoto leaves the camp and Okimasa gets hospitalized, Katsumi and Saito leave as well. Back home, Katsumi experiences a burst of creativity and writes the manga he wanted to, titled Black Blizzard. Hinomaru starts to run out of funds and, after the boss is arrested for counterfeiting securities, Hinomaru goes bankrupt. Reception A Drifting Life has won the 13th Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2009. It was nominated for three categories for the Eisner Award: Best Reality-Based Work, Best U.S. Edition of International Material - Asia and Best Lettering for comics creator Adrian Tomine. It won two Eisner Awards in 2010: Best U.S. Edition of International Material - Asia category and Best Reality-Based Work of the year. In a spate of About.com online user polls in 2009, it was voted 7th most recommended manga for grown, ups. 11th most anticipated manga, 6th best new seinen/josei manga, 3rd best one-shot manga and best new edition of classic manga. Shaenon K. Garrity votes A Drifting Life as the 10th best defining manga. It won an award at the 2012 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. It was 3rd on The New York Times Best Seller list for paperback graphic books for the week ending on April 18, 2009. Anime News Network's Casey Brienza commends the manga for \\"a magnificent presentation, well told and wonderfully illustrated, of an important historical document\\" but criticises it for \\"the specialized subject matter may not appeal to readers who do not share similar, specialized interests\\". The New York Timess Dwight Garner commends Tatsumi's art saying \\"is more sophisticated, retaining the form's strange sparkle even at gloomy moments; he definitely does write manga that isn't quite manga. The genre can be a difficult one in which to portray aging. Mr. Tatsumi looks just about the same here at ages 10 and 25\\". he further comments \\"a book like A Drifting Life is fairly easy to pick apart on a drawing-by-drawing or line-by-line basis. Don't make that mistake. Its pleasures are cumulative; the book has a rolling, rumbling grandeur. It's as if someone had taken a Haruki Murakami novel and drawn, beautifully and comprehensively, in its margins\\". Manga Worth Reading's Johanna Draper Carlson criticises the manga saying, \\"I was also sometimes uncertain as to the depth of the emotion the lead character was feeling. The obvious reactions were there ‚Äî determination, for example, to finish a work for a publisher ‚Äî but the more subtler feelings were missing\\". Comics212's Christopher Butcher comments \\"At its heart A Drifting Life is a memoir, filled with a density of details to give it a setting and place that will be immediately familiar to Japanese readers of the last generation but that will largely evade North American ones. This is not a bad thing, if anything the unfamiliarity of the time and place of this story will add to the experience of the lead drifting through his life, tied only to the comic that I hope you'll be holding in your hands\\". Comic Book Resources's Chris Mautner commends the manga for its \\"basic bildungsroman qualities. At its heart, A Drifting Life is the simple story of a young man discovering his talent and by extension his place in the world. It's told in as direct and plain a manner as possible, but still full of energy and passion\\".

It originally aired on November 10, 2010; and was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. In its original American broadcast on November 10, 2010, \\"Coon vs. Coon and Friends\\" was watched by 3.249 million viewers, according to the Nielsen Media Research. It was the highest viewed scripted show. It received a 1.9 rating/5% share among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49. In this episode, Cartman shows himself to be even more evil than the dark lord, Cthulhu, as he punishes his former partners in Coon & Friends. Kenny is wrestling with the weight of his own super power through his alter- ego, Mysterion. The episode continues from previous South Park episodes \\"Coon 2: Hindsight\\" and \\"Mysterion Rises\\" and reveals the identities of all of Coon and Friends. The episode was rated TV-MA-LV in the United States. Plot Bradley Biggle, as Mint Berry Crunch is summarizing the previous episode in a comic book format. The boys raise concern over Mint Berry Crunch's super powers, as they do not accept \\"the power of mint and berry with a satisfying tasty crunch\\" as a legitimate super power. While discussing powers, the boys ask Mysterion about his power. Mysterion boldly states that \\"I can't die.\\" The other boys, who are only imagining their powers, casually take note. Mysterion sees that they are not taking him seriously, and with mounting frustration, he elaborates to them that \\"I really, really can't die.\\" He tries to remind them that they witnessed him being stabbed to death the night before, but the other boys do not remember at all. In an attempt to prove his point, Mysterion shouts at them to remember, pulls out a handgun, and shoots himself in the head, leaving the boys in utter shock. However, much to the annoyance of Mysterion, they later completely forget about it when everyone including himself returns for another meeting on good deeds. After providing his own distorted summary of the story so far, Cartman (after using the \\"LeBron James Technique\\" to confuse his mother into not grounding him) arrives and lures the heroes outside, where he orders Cthulhu to banish them to a dark oblivion. Mint Berry Crunch runs away and pretends to be heroic by watching Judge Judy, while the rest of the heroes are transported to R'lyeh. With that done, Cartman has Cthulhu head to the Burning Man festival to massacre hippies. At R'lyeh, seeing death as his only potential escape back to Earth and save his friends, Mysterion commits suicide by jumping into a pit of deadly spikes (complaining about the pain of this particular manner of death as he does so). Kenny awakens back in his bed and dons his Mysterion outfit, setting off to learn more about Cthulhu and his own powers in order to save his friends. He goes to Henrietta's house, where she and the other Goth kids are complaining about Cthulhu not changing everything as they were made to believe, and claiming \\"It's just like Obama\\". Just then, Henrietta's mother comes in and tells her that her brother, who turns out to be Bradley, wants to play with them. Upon entering the room, Bradley sees Mysterion and runs back to his room to change into his Mint Berry Crunch outfit. Meanwhile, the Goth kids tell Mysterion that Cthulhu can only be killed by another immortal, meaning that Kenny is seemingly the only one who has the power to stop Cthulhu's rampage. Followed by Mint Berry Crunch, Mysterion tracks down the Coon and Cthulhu as the latter have just finished massacring Justin Bieber and a number of his fans. After berating the Coon for re-making the world in his own image (something no superhero is meant to do), Mysterion challenges Cthulhu by offering him an easy win if he brings his friends back, only for Cthulhu to simply walk away after being influenced by the Coon's \\"cute kitten\\" act. A bright light descends from the air and a man appears inside, who reveals himself to be Bradley's biological father from a far away planet who sent his son to Earth to stop evil from taking over the Earth. Bradley, whose Mint Berry Crunch powers were actually real, manages to subdue Cthulhu, drag him back to the dimension from which he came, save the other heroes from oblivion, shut the hole which BP drilled into the Gulf of Mexico, and briefly return home to give the middle finger to his sister. With Cartman jailed at the Coon & Friends' secret base, Mint Berry Crunch vanishes in a flash of light as the rest of the heroes express surprise that Bradley really did have superpowers. Mysterion, disappointed that he did not learn anything about his true past and identity, says he is going to bed and shoots himself in the head. That night, his mother suddenly gives birth to another new baby Kenny. Wrapping him in an orange hoodie, she remarks to his father that they never should have gone to those cult meetings. Cultural references Like \\"Coon 2: Hindsight\\" and \\"Mysterion Rises\\" the third part heavily references the works of H. P. Lovecraft, especially the Cthulhu Mythos. This episode also references the Merrie Melodies cartoon short Feed the Kitty, with Cartman acting as Pussyfoot and Cthulhu as Marc Antony in his \\"cute kitten\\" routine. In his quest to \\"make the world a better place\\", the Coon (Eric Cartman's alter ego), persuades Cthulhu to destroy the Whole Food Market supermarket chain, which specializes in organic and healthy food. They attack the Burning Man festival, which is, according to Cartman, \\"the biggest hippie festival in the world\\". A news reporter at the site of the slaughter mistakes The Coon for \\"Bruce Vilanch in a rat costume\\", an assumption first made in \\"The Coon\\". Another target, and in Cartman's eyes, the \\"most challenging and most evil opponent\\", is teen-star Justin Bieber. The LeBron James Nike commercial is also spoofed again. Cartman tries to lure the boys out of his basement with promises of a double rainbow, coinciding with the popularity of the \\"Double Rainbow\\" viral video. The name of the song that Cartman sings while walking to his house is \\"Faith\\" by George Michael. At the end when Mint Berry Crunch discovers that he has powers, The NeverEnding Story theme song singer, Limahl, appears before him. Reception =Broadcast and ratings= In its original American broadcast on November 10, 2010, \\"Coon vs. Coon and Friends\\" was watched by 2.786 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night, surpassing shows such as Psych, Terriers, Meet the Browns and The Ultimate Fighter in ratings. The episode received a 1.8 rating/3 share, meaning it was seen by 1.8 percent of the population, and 3 percent of people watching television at the time of its broadcast. Among male viewers between ages 18 and 34, the episode received a 3.4 rating/11 share. Among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, the episode received a 1.6 rating/5 share, falling two tenths in the ratings since the last episode. =Critical response= The episode received mostly positive reviews. IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" score of 8.0 and said \\"The Coon and Friends trilogy comes to an end in grand fashion, with epic battles, strange alliances, and secret origins revealed. It's a tale told in the finest comic book traditions, and it's one of the most creative episodes South Park has produced recently.\\" The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, a vast improvement over the C and C+ rating given to Coon 2: Hindsight and Mysterion Rises, stating that the episode was \\"fleeter and funnier, it wasted less time on padded-out tangents, and it satisfactorily resolved the question of Kenny's immortality\\" and called the episode \\"as well-executed an ending as one could probably hope for here\\". Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5, calling it an \\"entertaining, fitting finish\\", stating that it \\"dropped all the things we hated about the first two parts\\" and delivered a \\"solid, fun half hour\\", praising the twist ending, the portrayal of Cartman and how he \\"believed he truly was making the world a better place\\", as well as the death of Justin Bieber. Home release \\"Coon vs. Coon and Friends\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's fourteenth season, were released on a three- disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.

He is best known for his work in esports, most notably for his commentating on StarCraft II, a video game published by Blizzard Entertainment. He regularly appeared as a commentator at StarCraft tournaments, with his commentary being viewable through various YouTube channels. In early 2015, Lamond quit sports commentating. In late 2018, after a four-year hiatus, Husky took down his old YouTube channel, which as of March 2019 had over 489 million views. He currently has a new channel on the platform and currently works with Rosanna Pansino on Nerdy Nummies.  Early life  Mike \\"Husky\\" Lamond was born in Bakersfield, California. He lived in Nipomo in San Luis Obispo County for the first 11 years of his life. He later moved with his family to Beavercreek, Oregon, where his parents and older brother still reside.  Professional career  = 2010‚Äì2014: Early work, esports commentating, StarCraft II and directing = An avid fan of real-time strategy video games, Husky first learned of StarCraft when he was 11 years old. He stated that he played for 12 years, and spent most of his time on Blizzard's online server Battle.net, accumulating several thousand played matches. Husky began following the electronic sports community when he discovered GOM TV, a streaming service in South Korea that broadcast StarCraft gameplay from professional gamers. This prompted him to begin a YouTube channel where he provided his own commentary on StarCraft: Brood War professional competition. The channel started expanding beyond Husky's own expectations, and at one point Husky was uploading around 100 videos per month. While his channel became popular among other StarCraft: Brood War commentators, he gained a meteoric rise when he decided to exclusively commentate on StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty matches with the game's beta release in February 2010. During the beta, Husky collaborated with fellow commentator and friend HD to host the HDH Invitational, a StarCraft II tournament consisting of 16 of the top professional StarCraft II gamers. The tournament was played in an entirely virtual environment over the Battle.net server, and the games were later broadcast on YouTube. The tournament was sponsored and cash prizes were awarded. In July 2010 Husky and HD along with several other game casters, participated in the launch of a new YouTube channel titled The Game Station which seeks to emulate an ESPN-esque presentation of gaming videos of all genres. The channel quickly grew in size, and its success has been attributed partly to Husky's own success on YouTube. Later that year, Husky moved to Los Angeles to pursue a full-time job working at The Game Station. HuskyStarcraft has cast a number of professional tournaments, starting with the HDH invitational and his most recent being the Red Bull Training Grounds Santa Monica on June 21, 2013. In mid-April 2013, Husky teamed up with TheWarpzone and Stage5TV (The Red5 Studios media channel) to create a music video which was a parody of Maroon 5's \\"One More Night\\" titled \\"One More Fight.\\" To explain his view of why StarCraft is an exemplary video game for both casting and spectating, Husky stated, \\"Nearly every single person I have introduced competitive StarCraft to has completely fallen in love with it... The level of skill and mental precision required to play StarCraft 2 at the highest levels is completely mind blowing. This is why it is an extremely fun sport to watch.\\" Husky's commentary style has been described as matching the fast-paced progression of the game, with him often losing his breath at eventful moments. This is contrasted with HD's more composed and analytical approach to casting. In describing his passion for video games and the electronic sports scene, Husky stated, \\"Gaming has always been more than just a hobby for me. I wouldn't say it's a lifestyle, but I just get so much joy out of it that I will forever try and be involved with it as much as possible... No outside job will ever limit me when it comes to gaming.\\" On 26 September 2012 Genna Bain announced the creation of Axiom ESports, with TotalBiscuit and Husky as the team's sponsors and CranK, now AxCrank, as their first player. In 2013, Husky was on the crew for directing the internet series Broken Quest, in which he self starred as the main character as well as starring Rosanna Pansino in the lead female role. Throughout his career of gaming and casting he has also produced and co- produced music video parodies and originals with Kurt Hugo Schneider under the name of Nerd Alert such as Banelings (Justin Bieber - Baby Parody), Nerdy and I know it (LMFAO - Sexy and I know it Parody), Void Rays (Rebecca Black - Friday Parody) and Dear Peach (Luigi Love Song). = 2015‚Äìpresent: Retirement from esports and work on Nerdy Nummies = In early 2015, Husky stopped casting esports tournaments and submitting content to his YouTube channel. He appeared several times on Rosanna Pansino‚Äôs YouTube channel as a helper for her \\"Nerdy Nummies\\" series mid-2013. He continues to work as a manager, director, and producer per his Twitter bio. In early November 2016, Husky posted several Twitter posts referencing Starcraft, prompting many followers to speculate about his return to commentating. However, this never materialized; and, in 2018, he took down his YouTube content. In May 2019 he revealed that he quit esport casting due to medical reasons, specifically citing damage to his vocal cords due to casting work. He has since uploaded no other videos and currently does not have an official or active channel on any video platform.{{cite weblast1=Starcraftfirst1=Huskytitle=Why I Deleted My 1,000,000 Subscriber Channel (Q&A;)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfjAg2KrGW0website=YouTube}  Personal life  In November 2018, it was revealed by Rosanna Pansino that she and Lamond were dating.{{cite weblast1=Nummiesfirst1=Nerdyurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3APQsYrkw4%7Cwebsite=YouTube  Filmography  * Broken Quest (2013; director, voice actor) * Nerdy Nummies (2013‚Äìpresent; director, producer, manager, guest) References External links *\\"HuskyStarcraft\\" YouTube channel - Main YouTube channel, mostly StarCraft. *\\"Husky\\" YouTube channel - Second YouTube channel, described as \\"[Stuff that] doesn't fit in with my main channel\\".

Although the missile was successfully tested, the end of World War II removed the requirement for the missile, and the project was abandoned in 1946. Design and development The development of the Little Joe rocket began in 1945, as the United States Navy sought an effective point defense against Japanese Kamikaze aircraft.Parsch 2003Weyl 1949, p.115. The definitive surface-to-air missile project, Lark, was expected to take some time to come to fruition, so a simpler missile, based on existing parts, was proposed by the Naval Air Material Unit.Friedman 1982, p.149. Named \\"Little Joe\\", and designated KAN-1, the missile was the first SAM developed and tested by the United States.Gunston 1979, p.197. The Little Joe's fuselage was essentially the same as the standard Aerojet Jet-Assisted Take-Off (JATO) rocket, ordinarily used to provide additional takeoff thrust for heavily loaded aircraft. Cruciform wings and canard control surfaces were fitted to the missile; guidance was provided by a radio command-to-line-of-sight system. Four auxiliary rockets were mounted as boosters to provide for the rapid launch response needed to deal with Kamikaze aircraft. The warhead used was a standard general-purpose aerial bomb. A proximity fuse would cause the warhead to detonate within lethal distance of the target; the heavy warhead was expected to ensure the destruction of the attacking aircraft.Fitzsimons 1969, p.1753. Operational history Point Mugu. Initial tests of Little Joe took place in July 1945. Testing showed that the missile's performance was less than had been anticipated. In addition, smoke from the boosters and the sustainer made it difficult for the missile's controller to keep track of the weapon. In an attempt to deal with the missile's issues, an improved version of Little Joe, designated KAN-2, was developed. This used a new, less smokey propellant for the sustainer; in addition, flares were installed on the missile's tail to assist in visual tracking, while two additional boosters, for a total of six, were added to boost performance. A total of 15 Little Joe missiles were built and flown during the test program. With the end of World War II having removed the immediate requirement for the missile, in addition to the test program continuing to be problematic, the Little Joe program was canceled during 1946.

Smartface is headquartered in Palo Alto with offices in New Jersey, Istanbul and Dubai. Smartface Cloud, a cloud-based native mobile application development and application lifecycle management platform for enterprises, is the latest generation of the products offered by Smartface Inc. The previous generation product Smartface App Studio was a desktop based \\"Cross-platform Native Mobility Framework\\" for mobile application development. In 2019, Smartface announced their focus on digital transformation with two new products, Appcircle.io for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for mobile application development and Smartface Middleware Platform as a middleware specialized for frontend integration.  Appcircle.io Mobile CI/CD Platform  Appcircle is a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery platform specific for mobile app development. As a CI/CD platform, it enables developers to automate their mobile app build, sign and deployment processes and it also provides in-browser mobile device emulator/simulators for iOS and Android. For automation and application lifecycle management, it uses a workflow-based system where developers can configure steps with a visual interface and add steps from a component marketplace. It is an extension of the Smartface Cloud lifecycle management modules for universal use for any type of mobile app project as an independent product and for this reason, it has a separate presence at Appcircle.io. Similar to Smartface Cloud, it doesn't require the presence of a Mac to build, deploy and test iOS apps. One important difference from Smartface Cloud is that it is based on Kubernetes and supports private cloud and on-premise deployments besides software as a service use.  Smartface Middleware Platform  Smartface Middleware Platform is a middleware specialized in frontend integration for modern frontends like mobile apps or chatbots. For this purpose, it can be categorized as \\"Backend for Frontend\\" (BFF) instead of a full-fledged middleware for communication between backend systems. It includes features focusing on unifying cross-cutting concerns on a single platform to eliminate the repetition of work and to ensure frontend compatibility. It specifically focuses on rapid delivery and productivitization with its cloud-native architecture running on Kubernetes for scalability and availability.  Smartface Cloud  Smartface Cloud is a Mobile Enterprise Application Platform (MEAP) with native iOS and Android app development and lifecycle management capabilities. It incorporates a cloud- based integrated development environment (Cloud IDE) that runs on the browser to develop native mobile apps with JavaScript. The apps developed in the cloud can be deployed directly on \\"on-device emulators\\" for iOS and Android, eliminating the dependency on a specific OS and hardware as well as physical connectivity for mobile application development (e.g. iOS apps can be developed without a Mac). As for the lifecycle management, it incorporates integrated modules for testing, enterprise and app store distribution along with the ability to update native iOS and Android apps remotely. As a JavaScript based interpreter framework, Smartface allows updating application code and assets from a remote resource and run the updated app without the need for recompilation (e.g. critical updates can be done without waiting for the App Store review). Smartface App Studio Smartface App Studio is now deprecated and replaced with the Cloud IDE offered in Smartface Cloud. It is a cross-platform mobility framework (mobile application development platform) which offers its own integrated development environment to design, develop and publish native apps for Android and iOS. Smartface App Studio offers a WYSIWYG design editor to design mobile apps and the design fits into Android and iOS devices without any additional effort. Coding is done with an integrated 100% JavaScript code editor. Native iOS and Android apps can be developed with a single JavaScript codebase. Smartface App Studio is the only environment that allows whole native iOS development process to be done on Windows (as an alternative to Mac-only Xcode) with an on-device iPad/iPhone emulator for Windows PCs. The emulator also offers a full featured iOS debugger on Windows. .apk output for Android and .xcodeproj output for iOS can be created with a single-click. Downloading Smartface App Studio and developing, publishing & submitting apps to app stores are free with the community license without any feature limitations. Also there are indie, professional, and enterprise license options available.

He started killing his customers in 1948, when he was in his fifties. After his capture, Pilƒç√≠k committed suicide in a prison in Plze≈à on September 9, 1951. He was accused of five murders, although the exact number of his victims is unknown.http://zpravy.idnes.cz/krimi.aspx?r=krimi&c;=A060303_102326_krimi_nad It is possible he killed tens of people.  Biography  Hubert Pilƒç√≠k was born on October 14, 1891 in Nov√Ω Hrozenkov, Vset√≠n District in what is now the Czech Republic. He went from job to job, ending up in the ≈†koda factory in Plze≈à, where he remained until his retirement. His wife, Antonie, was 11 years younger. They had no children. After the Communist Party came to power in 1948, up to 250,000 people emigrated from Czechoslovakia. Many people used the services of human smugglers to go to West Germany or Austria. On the evening of March 6, 1951, a fire broke out in an abandoned forestry cottage called \\"Lipovka\\". Burnt human remains were found the next day. Investigators determined that the body was burnt using accelerants. An autopsy concluded that the remains belonged to a man who was likely to have been burnt alive, but no definite conclusion was reached. On July 20, children playing in sand near the city of Senec found a human leg. This led to the discovery of a shallow grave containing the decaying remains of a young woman. She was gagged and had a rope around her neck. Through a specific dental work, the victim was identified as Renata Balleyova, a photographer from Plze≈à. Interviews with relatives determined that Balleyova and her father Emanuel were intending to defect from Czechoslovakia. One of her relatives provided letters from Bavaria which \\"proved\\" that Balleyova, Emanuel, and his 12-year-old niece were in West Germany. Soon, the investigators focused on Pilƒç√≠k, then a retiree with a good reputation. Pilƒç√≠k was known to be a nature-lover and claimed to have been a sailor who survived the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. Pilƒç√≠k was considered dangerous; therefore, in September, a special team of police officers entered his home, along with two members of SNB, disguised as electricians, and arrested him. They found four firearms and numerous items in suitcases (from various victims); they also rescued Emanuel's 12-year-old niece. She had been kept by Pilƒç√≠k in a hidden compartment of a pigsty, where she was belted to a structure that included a double-walled box for her head - to muffle the screaming. The girl was held there for most of the day and was regularly raped. Pilƒç√≠k also forced her to write letters from \\"Bavaria\\". He then delivered the letters and demanded payment for this service in jewellery. Pilƒç√≠k killed Emanuel in his sleep at \\"Lipovka\\", while the man waited to be smuggled to Bavaria. Balleyova, also planning to defect, was killed less than two weeks later, near Senec. Both victims were killed by baton blows to the head. In his confession, Pilƒç√≠k stated that he had planned to kill Emanuel's niece, as well as another relative and his wife. However, by that time, he had been imprisoned, and committed suicide using two handkerchiefs. Given the amount of jewellery (the only \\"currency\\" of value to emigrants) found in his house, it was believed that Pilƒç√≠k had killed more people trying to escape the Iron Curtain.  In popular culture  The story of Pilƒç√≠k was used as a basis for one of the episodes of the TV series Thirty Cases of Major Zeman (30 p≈ô√≠pad≈Ø majora Zemana), filmed in 1975. The episode inspired by Pilƒç√≠k is called \\"The Beast\\" (\\"Bestie\\").  See also  * V√°clav Mr√°zek  References  = Sources = * J.

The first four issues were published by Pacific Comics; after Pacific went out of business the last two issues were published by Eclipse Comics which later collected all six issues into a trade paperback. http://gunsinthegutters.blogspot.com/2008/01/somerset-holmes.html. A review of the series, including its publication history. The first issue of Somerset Holmes was cover dated September 1983, the last December 1984. Somerset Holmes tells the story of an amnesiac young woman, chased by criminals intent on killing her, and her attempts to stay alive while simultaneously struggling to solve the mystery of her past life and true identity. She takes her assumed name, Somerset Holmes, from a sign advertising a housing project, Somerset Homes. The physical appearance of the main character was based on author Jones' wife April Campbell, a former model, who posed as photo reference for the character, including the image used for the first issue's cover. The series was a deliberate attempt to create a comics property that could then be sold to Hollywood as a movie, and the storyline, panel arrangements and scene angles were consciously cinematic. Somerset Holmes, although never made into a movie, was actually optioned by Ed Pressman and, because of the screenplay Jones and Campbell wrote for it, both gained Hollywood agents and were accepted into the Screen Writers Guild. They subsequently worked on television and movie projects, as well as more comic books, and both went on to write novels. Both Jones and Campbell feel strongly that the 1996 Geena Davis movie The Long Kiss Goodnight was an unauthorized, and unpaid for, theft of the Somerset Holmes idea. http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&m;=1&c;=34&s;=265&ai;=43997&ssd;=8/23/2003&arch;=y.

With the California Gold Rush of 1849, thousands of American settlers headed west through Mohave country and into California. The influx of migrants passing through, combined with simple misunderstandings, led to conflict. Fort Mohave on the Arizona side of the Colorado River was built for operations against the hostile natives and was the second American military post established on the river after Fort Yuma. Eventually advanced weaponry and tactics forced the Mohave and their allies to surrender. After the signing of a peace treaty in 1859, the Mohave never again opposed the United States through warfare. The peace also ended a long guerrilla war between the Mohave and the Maricopa of south central Arizona. Military and Pioneer Period (Pioneers in the Mojave) Rose-Bailey Wagon Train from mojavedesert.net accessed December 8, 2014Kroeber, pp. 11‚Äì12 Battle of Beale's Crossing In 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Edward Fitzgerald Beale to survey and build a 1,000 mile (1,600 km) road from Fort Defiance in northern New Mexico Territory, to the Colorado River. The road was meant for immigrants, traveling to the California gold fields and crossed the Colorado at Beale's Crossing within Mohave territory. Beale's Crossing in 1857 was little more than a shallow point in the river until a party of emigrants known as the Rose-Baley Party arrived. The wagon train set out from Santa Fe and when they got to the Colorado, they made camp and built a dock for the construction of rafts to ferry the heavier wagon equipment across. Chiefs Irataba, Cairook and Sickahot approached the American settlers and in a pow wow the Mohave asked the party's leader, L. J. Rose if they intended to build a town along the river. Rose responded with no and informed the chiefs that they were headed for California and would only be staying for a short while.Kroeber, pg. 11-12\\" Tension arose when the Mohave learned that the Bailey company would be coming through just after the Rose company, so they began stealing cattle for the meat. The Americans noticed that some of their herd had gone missing and when they caught the Mohaves in the act L. R. Rose confronted them, but the Mohave responded as though it was a joke. Also, near the American camp was a patch of cottonwood trees that belonged to the Mohave who used it for buildings and clothing. Rose and his men did not realize that the trees were Mohave property so they were cut down and used to build the rafts. When the Mohave discovered that their valuable cottonwoods had been disturbed, they responded by attacking the settlers with their Walapai allies. The Rose Party included dozens of women and children with only twenty-five men at arms fighting against hundreds of Mohave warriors. The Walapai with a small bunch of Mohaves focused on attacking four women and children held up in a cabin built in the mountains outside of the camp while the main Mohave force attacked the camp itself. In the end seventeen warriors were killed and left on the battlefield while the Americans lost one killed and eleven seriously injured. The settlers won the day by repulsing the Mohave attack but they lost most of their livestock and instead of crossing the border into California, they turned around and went back to New Mexico. A sketch of Fort Mohave in the late 1800s. Irataba and his band of Mohaves, who had been key in establishing peace at the end of the Yuma War, were against conflict with the United States and later Irataba became a high-ranking leader among his people after helping end the Mohave War. The war with the Maricopa was also ongoing and this was a major reason why Irataba was for cooperating with the Americans. Irataba's opinion was not accepted in 1858 though, other important chiefs were for war with the United States, including Cairook and Sickahot. The other chiefs were highly popular among their warriors so Irataba was powerless to stop them. First Mohave Expedition News of the battle at Beale's Crossing reached the media quickly followed by the United States War Department and General Newman S. Clarke in Los Angeles. Clarke sent Lieutenant Colonel William Hoffman of the 6th Cavalry on an expedition to Beale's Crossing to build a post for protecting settlers crossing the Colorado. Hoffman set out from a ranch in Cajon Canyon on December 28, 1858, hoping to make it across the Mohave Desert along the Mohave Road before the heat of summer could set in. In January 1859, Hoffman was encamped with his fifty men near Beaver Lake. Chief Cairook was in the area with about 300 men and the two sides encountered one another in an Indian war skirmish known as the Battle of Beaver Lake. The American camp was surrounded but accurate musket fire proved deadly for the Mohaves and ten to twelve were seen to fall according to Hoffman's account. The Americans went back to base after this fight without establishing a post on the Colorado. On March 1, Lieutenant Samuel A. Bishop was sent from Los Angeles to deliver fresh supplies to Lieutenant Edward Beale who was working on his road in northern Arizona. With thirty-eight men on camels and several wagons and mules, the column was met at Cave Canyon in the Mohave Desert by employees of the Central Overland Mail company and soon after by 1,500 warriors. The Mohaves opened fire on the small troop of Americans but they reportedly missed their targets intentionally but later moved in closer for a deliberate attack. In the ensuing skirmish, two natives were wounded by musketry, one of whom died later on. Lieutenant Bishop decided it would be best to send the wagons back to the coast while he successfully proceeded to Beale's camp. Two Mohave men next to the Colorado River in 1871. Second Mohave Expedition Lieutenant Colonel Hoffman used the battle at Beaver Lake as justification to ask the War Department for more troops. So in April 1859, another expedition was sent to the Colorado which included over 600 infantry, cavalry and artillery. After establishing Camp Gaston as an advance base, Hoffman's second expedition reached Beale's Crossing and Camp Colorado was officially established on April 19 and nine days later it was renamed Fort Mohave by Captain Lewis Addison Armistead. On April 23, Lieutenant Colonel Hoffman arrived at the Mohave Villages and discussed peace with the inhabitants. Hoffman told the chiefs that if they would agree to not attack immigrants traveling through their land and not oppose the government's building of roads and forts in Mohave territory, then they would not be destroyed. Reluctantly the Mohave agreed and Chief Cairook surrendered himself and was taken down the Colorado to Fort Yuma with eight others. Hoffman then went to San Bernardino and left Captain Armistead of the 6th Infantry in charge of Fort Mohave with fifty men and a few artillery pieces. Meanwhile, troops and two river steamers were waiting at Fort Yuma to reinforce Fort Mohave if necessary. Military and Pioneer Period (Military in the Mojave) Hoffman Establishes Fort Mojave from mohavedesert.net accessed December 8, 2014] Richard E. Lingenfelter, Steamboats on the Colorado River, 1852-1916, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, 1978 Escape from Fort Yuma After several weeks of a long hot summer in a cell, Chief Cairook and the eight others plotted their escape. Every day the prisoners were allowed to leave the cell for fresh air; and it was during one of these recesses in late June that the simple plan unfolded. Cairook seized one of his sentries while the eight others ran for the brush. The other sentries noticed and opened fire on the fleeing Mohaves; one was killed and Cairook was bayoneted and shot. Three of the Mohaves eventually made it back to their villages and told the high chief, Espaniole, who decided to end the peace and attack a mail station two miles south of Fort Mohave. There the station was destroyed along with a field of melons planted by the Americans. When Captain Armistead learned of this he launched a series of small operations against the Mohaves with his fifty men and engaged in several small skirmishes. Battle of the Colorado River It was not until August 4, 1859 that the only pitched battle of the war was fought. Captain Armstead and First Lieutenant Elisha Marshall led fifty men in an attack on over 200 Mohaves twelve miles south of the fort along the Colorado River. The natives were routed, leaving twenty-three warriors on the field, while only three Americans were wounded. Next the Mohave under the direction of Chief Espaniole sued for peace and the war was over. There was still a group among the Mohaves that wanted to continue fighting the United States, though no renewed conflict came about. Irataba, with support of the United States Army, became a prominent leader and was considered vital for maintaining the peace. When word of peace reached the Maricopa, they sent Chief Ahwantsevarih to Mohave territory to end their war, which was little more than minor raiding, with the exception of one engagement at Pima Butte in 1857. Irataba met with Ahwantsevarih, and the two chiefs agreed to have peace and establish trade relations.Kroeber, p. 14 References Bibliography * * See also *American Indian Wars Category:Wars fought in Arizona Category:Wars involving the United States Category:Wars involving the indigenous peoples of North America Category:History of Arizona Category:History of Southern California Category:Wars between the United States and Native Americans Category:Guerrilla wars Category:Indian wars of the American Old West Category:Lower Colorado River Valley Category:Native American history of Arizona ","title":"Mohave War"},{"id":"29525101","text":"The V Corps of the Ottoman Empire (Turkish: 5 nci Kolordu or Be≈üinci Kolordu) was one of the corps of the Ottoman Army.

She was laid down in 1816 at Woolwich Dockyard, and launched on 21 June 1822. Although designed for 60 guns, she and the rest of the class carried 52 guns. From 1831 to 1861 she served in North America and South East Asia. In 1861 she became the training ship Conway at Liverpool, and from 1876 she was the training ship Mount Edgcumbe. She was sold in 1921. Operational service =Flagship in North America, Cape of Good Hope and the East Indies= Although ordered in 1816 and laid down in 1818, Winchester was not launched until 21 June 1822, and commissioned on 16 September later that year. In October 1829 Captain Charles Austen, brother of the novelist Jane Austen, took command in Bermuda where Winchester was the flagship on the North America and West Indies Station. In 1832 Lord Willeam Paget commanded her until June 1833 when she was paid off. Between 1834 and 1838 she was on the East Indies station and under the command of Captain E. Sparshott. From 1842 she served as the flagship on the Cape of Good Hope Station, under the command of Captain Charles Eden. In 1852 Captain Granville Gower Loch commissioned Winchester to relieve as flagship in China and the East Indies. During 1852 and 1853 she took part in military operations on coast of Burma during the Second Burmese War. Shortly after arriving at Rangoon Rear-Admiral Charles Austen died; Commodore George Lambert was off the coast, and the command on the Irrawaddy River devolved on Loch. The subsequent action resolved itself into keeping the river clear and driving the Burmese out of such positions as they occupied on its banks. Grave marker of crew that died on HMS Winchester while at Halifax, Royal Navy Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) Rear Admiral Fleetwood Pellew raised his flag aboard Winchester in April 1853, and by September 1854 he was off Hong Kong to take command of the East Indies and China Station. Here he seems to have decided that he would not allow shore leave until the dangerous season for fevers and infections had passed, but neglected to make his reasoning known to his men. The crew were apparently in a mutinous mood, so Pellew ordered them to beat to quarters. When they refused, he sent the officers onto the lower deck to force them up at sword point. Several of the crew were wounded and the nascent mutiny was quashed. From 11 May 1854 Winchester was the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir James Stirling. Shortly afterwards news arrived that war had been declared on Russia. Stirling was anxious to prevent Russian ships from sheltering in Japanese ports and menacing allied shipping and led a squadron of four vessels to Nagasaki where he concluded the Anglo- Japanese Friendship Treaty with representatives of the Tokugawa shogunate. Winchester subsequently was involved in the Second Opium War, when her boats and some of her ship's company were used in the attack on Canton. =Discovery of Russian coast= In August 1855, during the Crimean War, Winchester and entered and first charted the waters of Peter the Great Gulf, while searching for the Russian squadron commanded by Vasily Zavoyko. Training ship Conway From 1861 Winchester replaced the 26-gun sixth-rate as the training ship in the port of Liverpool, and was renamed Conway that year. She was used as an educational vessel for homeless and destitute children. She was replaced in 1876 by , which in turn was renamed Conway. The former Winchester was returned to the Admiralty on 1 September 1876, and was renamed HMS Mount Edgcumbe. Training ship Mount Edgcumbe The Devon and Cornwall Industrial Training Ship Association was formed in 1874 to provide a training ship for the homeless boys of Plymouth, and Mount Edgcumbe was anchored in the River Tamar off Saltash. On 28 March 1912 another training ship, , based in Hull, closed down. The boys aboard HMS Southampton were transferred to Devonport to continue their training aboard Mount Edgcumbe. The training ship was closed down on 4 December 1920.

The film features an ensemble cast consisting of Hrithik Roshan, Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar, Katrina Kaif, and Kalki Koechlin. It was filmed in Spain, India, Egypt, and the United Kingdom on a budget of . The music and score were composed by Shankar‚ÄìEhsaan‚ÄìLoy with lyrics by Javed Akhtar. The film's story follows three childhood friends, Arjun, Kabir, and Imraan, who reunite for a three-week road trip. They set off to Spain and meet Laila, who falls in love with Arjun and helps him overcome his compulsion to work. Kabir and his fianc√©e Natasha experience significant misunderstandings. During their trip, each friend chooses a dangerous sport for the group to partake in. The release of Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was initially planned for 27 May 2011 but technical problems with post-production work led to the release being postponed to 24 June and again to 15 July that year. The film had a worldwide release in 1,800 screens and was a critical and commercial success that grossed and received critical acclaim for its performances, story, music, humour, and direction. After its theatrical run, the film was nominated for and won several awards, including two National Film Awards.  Plot  Kabir Dewan, a member of a family construction business, proposes to his girlfriend Natasha Arora. Their families meet at the engagement party where Natasha learns that Kabir is planning a three-week bachelor party road trip to Spain with his school friends ‚Äì Imran Qureshi, an advertisement copywriter; and Arjun Saluja, a financial broker who is working in London. Kabir says the three friends have a long-standing pact, and that during the road trip each of them will pick an adventure sport that all three will try together. Arjun is initially reluctant to take the trip as he does not want to miss work. Imran secretly plans to find his estranged biological father Salman Habib, an artist who lives in Spain. The three men fly to Spain separately and meet in Barcelona. They plan to visit Costa Brava, Seville, and Pamplona. On the way to Costa Brava, Imran and Kabir are annoyed when Arjun, a workaholic, continues working. Imran casually throws Arjun's mobile phone out of their car, causing an argument in which Arjun accuses Imran of being unapologetic for having an affair four years prior with Arjun's then- girlfriend Sonali. However, the argument is ceased by Kabir who pacifies them both. Upon reaching their destination, they meet Laila, an Anglo-Indian woman, whom Arjun is immediately attracted to; Imran flirts with her and makes Arjun jealous. Kabir announces he has chosen underwater diving as their first sport, and they later find that Laila is their diving instructor. Arjun, who cannot swim and is aquaphobic, receives assistance from Laila to overcome his fears and finish the sport successfully. Laila suggests they attend the La Tomatina festival with her in Bu√±ol. Meanwhile, Natasha becomes suspicious of Kabir's involvement with Laila when she sees them via webcam when Laila has been invited over to the boys' villa for dinner. She crashes Kabir's bachelor party trip, much to Kabir's discomfort. Imran spends time with Laila's friend Nuria, and Arjun with Laila. After the men leave, both Arjun and Laila realise they have fallen in love and to not regret the partition, Laila chases them on a bike, kissing Arjun passionately before saying goodbye. On their way to Seville, Kabir drops Natasha at the airport, while Arjun and Imran discuss Kabir's change in behaviour around Natasha. The trio then visits Seville to go skydiving, which is Arjun's choice. During the task, Imran is forced to confront his acrophobia and hesitates to take part, but does so. After skydiving, the three men go to a bar and get drunk. They get into a fight with a stranger on whom they had tried to pull a prank. They are jailed after the fight; Imran calls Salman, who bails them out and takes them to his home. Salman reveals that he never wanted the responsibility of married life or children but Imran's mother Rahila did. Imran, heartbroken, realises how his actions must have hurt Arjun four years ago. He apologises to Arjun, and Arjun, seeing the genuineness of the apology, forgives him with a hug. The three men learn of the running of the bulls in Pamplona, which is Imran's choice, baffling Kabir and Arjun. Imran contacts Laila, who joins them. When confronted by his friends, Kabir admits to the others that he does not love Natasha and is not ready for marriage. He reveals that Natasha had mistaken a ring he had bought as a birthday present for his mother as a proposal ring for herself. Arjun asks Kabir if that is why the trip was so important to him; because no one else apart from his two best friends would tell him to cancel his wedding. On the morning of the bull run, Imran suggests they make another pact: if they survive the event, Imran vows to publish the poetry he has written in his diary, Arjun vows to go to Morocco with Laila, and Kabir promises to tell Natasha he does not want to marry her yet. As they complete the event, the friends gain a renewed sense of their relationships with each other, their families and friends, and themselves. During the credits, Imran, Kabir, Nuria and Natasha attend Arjun and Laila's wedding. Natasha and Kabir are no longer together, as she came with a companion, but are still friends, and Imran's poems are revealed to have been published.

(2008). Akhtar and Kagti incorporated real-life observations and wrote the character of Imran for the former's brother Farhan, who wrote the dialogue for the film. Farhan produced the film with Ritesh Sidhwani under Excel Entertainment. The theme of the film was \\"three guys on the verge of making commitments in life\\", according to him. They used Farhan's father Javed Akhtar's poetry as a voiceover because they felt the poetry added depth to the characters and lent voice to their feelings. A special poem inspired by a fan's poem was written for Katrina Kaif's character after she was cast in the project. The first choice for the location of principal photography was Mexico, but was later changed to Spain because the climax features the running of bulls and Zoya wanted a country that blended history, culture, and sports. The film's release date was postponed twice because its original editor Chandan Arora fell ill and they had to re-edit it. = Casting = Initially, the producers wanted Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor to play two of the three leads, but they declined without specifying a reason. Farhan Akhtar had worked with Zoya on her debut film Luck by Chance and also wrote dialogue for the film; Zoya felt he would know exactly what she wanted from the film. He was the first actor to be cast in the film. Farhan Akhtar defined his role as a \\"fun character\\" and a \\"guy who for the longest time takes nothing seriously\\". Hrithik Roshan was chosen for another lead role because he was one of Zoya's favourite actors. After finalising the two, she needed someone \\"who could not just fit in with them visually but also bring something new to the table.\\" She sought Abhay Deol for the role, as he was her friend and had worked with her before in Kagti's Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd. For the role of Laila, Zoya wanted someone with an accent who would be willing to scuba dive, and was a half-Indian and half- Caucasian woman. A lot of women were auditioned for the part in New York and London. Later, at a party, Zoya met Katrina Kaif and chose her for the role. Her role was described as \\"a free- spirited girl, a wanderer at heart and a bohemian gypsy by nature\\". Zoya had wanted to work with Kalki Koechlin ever since seeing her in Dev.D and That Girl in Yellow Boots; she felt Koechlin would suit the character of Natasha because she had \\"the sense of comedy, but not over the top\\". Spanish actress Ariadna Cabrol was chosen for the role of Nuria because Zoya liked her work in the 2009 Spanish film Elo√Øse's Lover. = Filming = Principal photography began in June 2010 and took place in the United Kingdom, Egypt, Mumbai, and in Spain at Barcelona, Pamplona, Bu√±ol and Andalusia. Cinematographer Carlos Catalan, who had worked with Zoya on Luck by Chance, wanted all three lead actors to appear tanned because he \\"didn't want everything glossed over\\" and wanted to make the film as realistic as possible. Kaif's introduction scene was shot on a nudist beach; during the filming, the crew asked beach-goers stay out of the frame to avoid objections from the Central Board of Film Certification. The La Tomatina festival of Bu√±ol was re- created for the song \\"Ik Junoon\\"; almost sixteen tons of tomatoes worth were flown in from Portugal for the scene. A scene involving a kiss between Roshan and Kaif was filmed despite the couple's reluctance to do so. The filming of the flamenco song \\"Se√±orita\\" took place in Al√°jar, a town in the province of Huelva. The crew warned local residents about the song's volume because the scene was filmed at night. On the third day of filming, locals dressed in costumes attended and the mayor of Al√°jar joined them. The climax of the film, which features the Running of the bulls, was filmed at Pamplona. The final schedules were at Vashi and Alibag in Mumbai in December 2010.  Soundtrack  Composer trio Shankar‚ÄìEhsaan‚ÄìLoy, who had worked with Farhan Akhtar in Rock On!! and Karthik Calling Karthik, composed the soundtrack for the film. The lyrics were written by Javed Akhtar. The composers engaged Mar√≠a del Mar Fern√°ndez, a Spanish flamenco singer, to perform the vocals on \\"Se√±orita\\"; her film-singing debut. The song is also the singing debut of Abhay Deol, who sang it along with the other lead actors Hrithik Roshan and Farhan Akhtar.  Marketing  A Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara press conference at Chandigarh.

And will continue to.\\" Shivesh Kumar of IndiaWeekly awarded the movie 4 stars. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 3.5/5, calling it a film for \\"a more evolved, mature and cinema-literate audience that's geared up to embrace and support newer genres of cinema\\". Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 stars and lauded its lead performances; \\"If Abhay is the anchor of the group, Farhan's funster role is full of beans and Hrithik's metamorphosis from uptight, money- minded stock broker to carefree vagabond is a class act\\". S. Chatterjee of NDTV, gave the film 3/5 stars and said its philosophy is quite old; he praised Zoya Akhtar's direction, stating, \\"Zoya Akhtar, by investing the tale with a delightful lightness of touch and dollops of gentle wit, brings a degree of freshness to bear upon the plot\\". Shaikh Ayaz of Rediff rated the film 3.5/5 stars and wrote that Zoya Akhtar had put together a familiar plot but the film's fresh energy is entertaining. He wrote, \\"Akhtar's invigorating characters pump in fresh energy into a film that could have been strictly mediocre\\".

Blessy Chettiar of DNA India praised the music and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film, saying, \\"For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep-sea diving at Costa Brava, sky-diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, not to forget the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls\\", giving it 3 stars. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, \\"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on why we should live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts\\". He also praised the performances, highlighting them as one of the main positives of the film, but also said the film's length \\"sucks some fun of out of the ride\\" and gave a rating of 3.5 stars. Raja Sen of Rediff said the film \\"tried too hard to be cool\\" and gave it 1.5/5 stars. Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu said \\"Zoya Akhtar's second outing as a director is way more filmi than her first about the film industry. This one only pretends to be real. It's not.\\" Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian was broadly positive about the film; he wrote, \\"It's still playing to full houses, and you can see why. Slick it may be. But tourist board employees representing the various Spanish cities flattered in the movie are not the only ones who will come out grinning\\", and that he found the movie \\"stubbornly un-macho\\" for a buddy film. The National reviewer Kaleem Aftab, in his 4-star review wrote; \\"Throwing together road trip, romcom and buddy-buddy action in a single picture may sound like an ill-conceived masala mash-up, but like any good dish, the ingredients are blended together with affection to create one of the best feel-good movies of the year\\". = Box office = In India, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was released alongside Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2.

These oral traditions included different types of stories about Jesus. For example, people told anecdotes about Jesus healing the sick and debating with his opponents. The traditions also included sayings attributed to Jesus, such as parables and teachings on various subjects which, along with other sayings, formed the oral gospel tradition. Critical methods: source and form criticism Biblical scholars use a variety of critical methodologies known as biblical criticism. They apply source criticism to identify the written sources beneath the canonical gospels. Scholars generally understood that these written sources must have had a prehistory as oral tellings, but the very nature of oral transmission seemed to rule out the possibility of recovering them. However, in the early 20th century the German scholar Hermann Gunkel demonstrated a new critical method, form criticism, which he believed could discover traces of oral tradition in written texts. Gunkel specialized in Old Testament studies, but other scholars soon adopted and adapted his methods to the study of the New Testament. The essence of form criticism is the identification of the Sitz im Leben, \\"situation in life\\", which gave rise to a particular written passage. When form critics discuss oral traditions about Jesus, they theorize about the particular social situation in which different accounts of Jesus were told. For New Testament scholars, this focus remains the Second Temple period. It needs be remembered that the first century Palestine of Jesus was predominantly an oral society. A modern consensus exists that Jesus must be understood as a Jew in a Jewish environment. According to scholar Bart D. Ehrman, Jesus was so very firmly rooted in his own time and place as a first-century Palestinian Jew ‚Äì with his ancient Jewish comprehension of the world, and God ‚Äì that he does not translate easily into a modern idiom. Ehrman stresses that Jesus was raised in a Jewish household in the Jewish hamlet of Nazareth. He was brought up in a Jewish culture, accepted Jewish ways and eventually became a Jewish teacher, who, like other Jewish teachers of his time, debated the Law of Moses orally. Early Christians sustained these teachings of Jesus orally. Rabbis or teachers in every generation were raised and trained to deliver this oral tradition accurately. It consisted of two parts: the Jesus tradition (i.e., logia or sayings of Jesus) and inspired opinion. The distinction is one of authority: where the earthly Jesus has spoken on a subject, that word is to be regarded as an instruction or command. The accuracy of the oral gospel tradition was insured by the community designating certain learned individuals to bear the main responsibility for retaining the gospel message of Jesus. The prominence of teachers in the earliest communities such as the Jerusalem Church is best explained by the communities' reliance on them as repositories of oral tradition. One of the most striking features to emerge from recent study is the \\"amazing consistency\\" of the history of the tradition \\"which gave birth to the NT\\". A review of Richard Bauckham's book Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony states \\"The common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing.\\" Oral traditions and the formation of the gospels Modern scholars have concluded that the Canonical Gospels went through four stages in their formation: # The first stage was oral, and included various stories about Jesus such as healing the sick, or debating with opponents, as well as parables and teachings. # In the second stage, the oral traditions began to be written down in collections (collections of miracles, collections of sayings, etc.), while the oral traditions continued to circulate # In the third stage, early Christians began combining the written collections and oral traditions into what might be called \\"proto-gospels\\" ‚Äì hence Luke's reference to the existence of \\"many\\" earlier narratives about Jesus # In the fourth stage, the authors of our four Gospels drew on these proto-gospels, collections, and still-circulating oral traditions to produce the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Mark, Matthew and Luke are known as the Synoptic Gospels because they have such a high degree of interdependence. Modern scholars generally agree that Mark was the first of the gospels to be written (see Marcan priority). The author does not seem to have used extensive written sources, but rather to have woven together small collections and individual traditions into a coherent presentation. It is generally, though not universally, agreed that the authors of Matthew and Luke used as sources the gospel of Mark and a collection of sayings called the Q source. These two together account for the bulk of each of Matthew and Luke, with the remainder made up of smaller amounts of source material unique to each, called the M source for Matthew and the L source for Luke, which may have been a mix of written and oral material (see Two-source hypothesis). Most scholars believe that the author of John's gospel used oral and written sources different from those available to the Synoptic authors ‚Äì a \\"signs\\" source, a \\"revelatory discourse\\" source, and others ‚Äì although there are indications that a later editor of this gospel may have used Mark and Luke. Oral transmission may also be seen as a different approach to understanding the Synoptic Gospels in New Testament scholarship. Current theories attempt to link the three synoptic gospels together through a common textual tradition. However, many problems arise when linking these three texts together (see the Synoptic problem). This has led many scholars to hypothesize the existence of a fourth document from which Matthew and Luke drew upon independently of each other (for example, the Q source). The Oral Transmission hypothesis based on the oral tradition steps away from this model, proposing instead that this common, shared tradition was transmitted orally rather than through a lost document.

It is the largest tributary located entirely within the Washington city limits. Course Located in the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., the stream flows next to Piney Branch Parkway and empties into Rock Creek near the intersection of the parkway and Beach Drive, inside Rock Creek Park. Rock Creek drains to the Potomac River, which empties into the Chesapeake Bay. Piney Branch is a first order stream (i.e., no tributaries) with a surface length of . It is generally about wide and deep. It is the largest tributary located entirely within the Washington city limits. Watershed and water quality Piney Branch drains a watershed of about 0.48 square miles (= 309 acres = 124 hectares = 1,240,000 m sq). Its surface stream drainage is augmented by four combined sewer systems that discharge into it. About 5 percent of the watershed consists of forested parkland near its surface stream. The rest of the area is mainly residential, with some light industrial zones. The creek is listed as polluted by 10 chemicals and four metals: lead, copper, zinc, and arsenic. It is spanned by the 16th Street Bridge, the country's first parabolic arch bridge. History In prehistoric times, the creek's valley was a source of quartzite cobbles for toolmaking. One quarry site is located at the bluffs overlooking Piney Branch from the north, about 30 feet below the summit of a southeast-facing hill. Dubbed the \\"Piney Branch Quarry Site\\", it was first examined by archeologist William Henry Holmes in 1889 and 1890. Another investigation begin in 2006 revealed quartzite debitage, whole and broken turtleback ‚Äúpreforms,‚Äù and half of a large ax. In the mid-1800s, the creek's valley was the location of the first road through the area that would become Rock Creek Park. Called Piney Branch Road or 14th Street Road, the narrow country way went north from the Mount Pleasant neighborhood down into the valley, across a rickety bridge just west of today's 16th Street Bridge, then climbed up to the present-day neighborhood of Crestwood. Funding to build the Piney Branch Parkway, which runs along the creek for most of its length, was \\"authorized in 1907, but not built until the mid-1930s when funding and workers became available through the New Deal.\\" In 2014, the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority began design work on the Piney Branch Trunk Sewer Rehabilitation Project, a series of repairs and improvements to the combined sewer system that discharges into the creek. Composed of 8- to 10-foot brick and concrete pipes, the Piney Branch Trunk Sewer is one of the city's major trunk sewers. Project design was slated to start in January 2014 and last one year. As of early 2016, work was to begin in 2017 and last until 2019. See also *List of rivers of Washington, D.C.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1900 to 1906, and then had a long career in local government in Lincolnshire.  Early life  Welby was the second son of the Conservative Party politician Sir William Welby-Gregory, 4th Baronet and his wife Victoria, a philosopher of language who was the daughter of Charles Stuart-Wortley. He was educated at Eton College and then at Christ Church, Oxford. Welby succeeded to the baronetcy in 1898 on the death of his father.  Career  From 1887 to 1892, Welby was private secretary to Edward Stanhope, the Conservative Secretary of State for War.His obituary in the Times records him as having been \\"assistant private secretary\\" to Stanhope, but Debretts 1901 records him as Stanhope's \\"assistant private secretary\\". When the Conservatives resumed office in 1895 he became private secretary to the new War Secretary Lord Lansdowne, holding the post until 1899 or 1900 He was made a Companion of the Bath (CB) in the 1897 Diamond Jubilee Honours. After resigning as private secretary in 1899, he was elected at a by-election in February 1900 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Newark division of Nottinghamshire, after the sitting Conservative MP Viscount Newark had succeeded to the peerage. He was re-elected unopposed at the 1900 general election. In November 1900, he was appointed an extra (unpaid) Assistant Under-Secretary of State for War to assist during the pressure of the Second Boer War. He resigned the appointment in August 1902, two months after the end of the war and following the reshuffle of the cabinet. He stood down from Parliament at the 1906 general election, and concentrated on local government. In 1898, he had succeeded his father an alderman of Kesteven County Council, and remained an alderman until his death 40 years later. He was chairman of the council for many years. Welby was mayor of Grantham from 1912 to 1913, and also served for long periods as chairman of the governors of Grantham Hospital, and chairman of the governors of The King's School, Grantham. He was also a Justice of the Peace in Kesteven, and a Deputy Lieutenant of Lincolnshire.  Family  In 1887 Welby married Maria Louise Helen, daughter of Lord Augustus Hervey; they lived at Denton Manor, near Grantham, and had two sons and four daughters. The eldest son, Richard William Gregory Welby (1888‚Äì1914), became a Lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards and was killed in action during World War I, on 16 September 1914. Maria died in 1920. Her father Lord Augustus Hervey had been the second son of the 2nd Marquess of Bristol. When his older brother, the 3rd Marquess died in August 1907, he would have succeeded to the title had he not died in 1875. On 15 November the King decreed that the children of Lord Augustus would \\"enjoy the title, rank, place and precedence as the sons and daughters of a Marquess\\", which they would have held if their father had survived. Welby died at a nursing home in London on 19 March 1938, aged 72. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his second son, Oliver Charles Earle Welby (1902‚Äì1977).

The Parliament is a bicameral, or two-house, legislature. It comprises the Queen of Australia, the Legislative Assembly or Lower House and the Legislative Council or Upper House. The head of the State Government is the Premier of Victoria. The Transport Legislation Review was a policy and legislation review project conducted by the Department of Transport in the State of Victoria, Australia between 2004 and late 2010. The aim of the project was review of transport policy and laws and generation of new policy and legislation as a platform for better transport across the State. The Review was the most extensive project of its kind in transport in VictoriaA review between 1982 and 1988 produced the following major statutes ‚Äì the Transport Act 1983, the Road Safety Act 1986 and the Marine Act 1988. A major proposal for a Victorian Ports Authority Act was defeated in Parliament in 1985. The period 1995-1999 was also a major period of policy and legislative activity although not on a portfolio-wide scale. Review work and outputs in that period were mainly confined to statutes relating to reorganisation of rail services in the state and initial new safety regulation schemes in the rail and bus sectors. and touched all areas of transport including land and water based transport activities. Proposals were developed by the Review for consideration by the Victorian Government and proceeded initially as policy ideas. Proposals were progressively refined over time using modules and sub projects sometimes in response to stakeholder input. Outputs from Review often proceeded as new State regulatory schemes and laws, commonly in the form of Bills considered by the Victorian Parliament. The new laws which arose from the Review had regulatory and de-regulatory effects in particular areas.The Accident Towing Services Act 2007 provides an example of a de-regulatory initiative. The Act repealed provisions which regulated the towing industry in the former Transport Act 1983. While some provisions were re-enacted in a modified form in the new statute, provisions regulating trade towing were not continued therefore removing economic regulation controls from that sector. The Review was notable for pursuing principle-based initiatives,See, for example, the policy framework reflected in the Transport Integration Act 2010. introducing performance-based concepts into transport law often in the form of safety duties owed by industry participants to persons using transport services and to other industry participantsSee the safety duties contained in the Rail Safety Act 2006, the Bus Safety Act 2009 and the Marine Safety Act 2010. and suites of new administrative and court sanctions targeted at non compliance. The project also had significant impacts on organisational arrangements in Victorian transport. The Victorian Government Ministers who oversaw the work of the project at times were Peter Batchelor, Lynne Kosky, Tim Pallas and Martin Pakula.  Scope  The work of the Transport Legislation Review was described in a 2009 paper released by the Department of Transport: ::A comprehensive review of Victoria‚Äôs transport policy and legislation has been underway since 2004. Its aim has been to modernise transport policy, legislation and regulatory practices, drawing on developments in regulatory theory and approaches in other industry sectors and in other jurisdictions.Improving Marine Safety in Victoria ‚Äì Review of the Marine Act 1988, Discussion Paper, July 2009. Foreword, Page 1. Paper available at the Department of Transport website. The explanatory memorandum to the Transport Legislation Amendment (Compliance, Enforcement and Regulation) Bill 2010 also observed that: ::\\"...major renewal is underway across the transport portfolios through the Government's Transport Legislation Review. This project is ...generating an entire new legislative framework for the State along best practice lines.\\"Explanatory memorandum, page 1, Transport Legislation (Compliance, Enforcement and Regulation) Bill 2010, from the official Victorian Government legislation site.  Context  The Transport Legislation Review arose from concerns about the poor state of Victoria's transport laws. In particular, most transport legislation was thought to be complex, unnecessarily detailed and generally based on old policy.For example, see the Minister's second reading speech in support of the Rail Safety Act 2006 which contained numerous criticisms of the style and substance of the former legislation. Another example can be found in the explanatory memorandum for the Tourist and Heritage Railways Bill 2010 which observes that, \\"Tourist and heritage railways were previously governed by the Transport Act 1983, under which the Governor in Council was empowered to make Orders in Council granting persons the right to occupy, operate and maintain tourist railway services. Importantly, this regulatory scheme only covered a narrow range of matters affecting the sector and did not provide sufficient clarity or make appropriate provision for the occupation and use of Victorian railways and railway infrastructure.\\" The Victorian Government was also troubled that areas of the laws did not reflect regulatory advances in other industries and were not sufficiently informed by overseas reforms. Pearce and Shepherd observed that it \\"...was a timely point to commence the review, given it had been 20 years since the State's central transport statute, the Transport Act 1983, was first enacted....Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, The Transport Integration Act 2010: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation, Urban Transport XVII, page 356. They went on to say that the - ::\\"...Transport Act had become the largest statute in Victoria with over 700 pages of dense and prescriptive provisions in accordance with the prevailing legislative style. A number of other transport related Acts (and amendments to the Transport Act) had also been created to respond to different transport policies of successive governments over time. Most of these were examples of either facilitative or coercive legislative approaches. Importantly, however, there was no overarching framework for transport policy reflected in the State's legislation. In other words, transport legislation did not have aspirational elements. More specifically: ::* there was no clear vision for the transport system ::* bodies (such as VicRoads and the Director of Public Transport) were established with different (and potentially competing) objectives ::* there was no overarching framework to express broader policy objectives for transport as a whole ::* the legislation contained minimal reference to social policy objectives and no reference to environmental objectives ::* linkages with related areas (such as planning and local government) were not clear or not recognised.\\"Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, The Transport Integration Act 2010: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation, Urban Transport XVII, page 356-7.  Plan and approach  The Review aimed to complete a wholesale revision of the State's transport policies and legislation. The project was guided by a target legislative framework diagram showing the final desired state of transport legislation in Victoria after completion of work. The diagram was headed by a overarching portfolio-based statute intended to provide long term symbolic and aspirational direction, the Transport Integration Act, supported by a range of transport modal and subject-specific statutes. Diagrams showing the current and former legislative structures were also used.Current, future and past legislative structure diagrams are available online at the relevant pages on the Department of Transport web site. The Review was policy-driven and proceeded on a modular basis.Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, The Transport Integration Act 2010: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation, Urban Transport XVII, page 357. This approach \\"...sought to more clearly delineate between overarching institutional elements and more detailed regulatory, operational, project and service delivery elements. It also sought to explicitly identify linkages within the transport portfolio (road, rail, tram, bus, taxi, hire car, tow trucks) and interfaces with other portolios (local government authorities and planning portfolios).\\"Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, The Transport Integration Act 2010: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation, Urban Transport XVII, page 357. The majority of the new statutes which emerged from the work of the Review were preceded by extensive policy and stakeholder processes. This typically involved the public release of documents outlining issues in the relevant transport sector and later circulation of draft proposals which signalled the intended direction of change. The conduct of industry and public consultation forums and the receipt of public submissions was a feature of this activity.The Rail Safety Act, the Accident Towing Services Act, the Bus Safety Act, the Transport Integration Act, the Marine Safety Act and the Tourist and Heritage Railways Act all involved such processes. Copies of papers from these reviews can be located at the Department of Transport web site at www.transport.vic.gov.au.  New laws generated  The Review concentrated on long, medium and short term measures. Global sector or scheme reviews typically resulted in the creation of suites of new contemporary regulatory policy which led in most instances to new Acts of Parliament which repealed existing Acts.See Principal statutes section below. These are called principal statutes and typically take two years or more to fully complete. Smaller or mid range reforms, on the other hand, were pursued through Acts which amended existing principal statutes.See Other statutes section below. = Principal statutes = Many of the major proposals originated by the Transport Legislation Review were developed using workshops or meetings with key stakeholders who were informed by the release of comprehensive discussion papers. The process for developing the Marine Safety Act 2010, for example, involved the holding of 26 public sessions throughout Victoria. The work of the Transport Legislation Review led to the development and enactment of seven major principal statutes between early 2006 and late 2010. The centrepiece of the Review and now the prime transport statute in Victoria is the Transport Integration Act 2010 which came into effect on 1 July 2010. The Act \\"....locates the development of a policy framework for integrated and sustainable transport in Victoria within global and international debates regarding sustainable development. This has resulted in the inclusion of a vision, set of objectives and decision making principles for transport in the (transport Integration Act) reflecting an integration and sustainability policy framework.\\"Robert Pearce and Ian Shepherd, The Transport Integration Act 2010: driving integrated and sustainable transport outcomes through legislation, Urban Transport XVII, page 355. In addition to the Transport Integration Act, the six principal statutes generated by the Review were: = Other statutes = A wide range of amending statutes was also generated. While generally smaller than most principal statutes, the amending Acts often dealt with significant \\"big picture\\" changes and were routinely used to pursue discrete, urgent and priority regulatory reforms. Some of these statutes developed by the Review included: = Regulations = A range of new regulations was also generated by the Review. In the majority of cases, the regulations were advertised publicly in draft form accompanied by regulatory impact statements, and made available for comment by individuals, the community and affected industries.For example, the Transport (Conduct) Regulations 2005 and the Transport (Ticketing) Regulations 2006 were both subject to such processes. Copies of regulatory impact statements for these regulations are available from the website of the Victorian Competition and Efficiency Commission ‚Äì www.vcec.vic.gov.au.  Principal regulations  Examples of new principal regulations developed by the Review included:  Other regulations  Examples of other regulations developed by the Review included: = Organisational impacts = The work of the Transport Legislation Review had significant impacts on governance arrangements in the Victorian Transport portfolio. These effects can be summarised as follows: = Legislative structure impacts = The Review had major impacts on Victoria's transport legislation suite. Before the Review, Victoria's suite of legislation was divided into land-based and water-based groupings. The land- based group covering rail and road statutes and associated activities was headed by the Transport Act 1983. By contrast, the water-based grouping regulating the ports and marine sectors had no central coordinating statute. Both groupings were characterised by old and inconsistent underlying policy frameworks. The Transport Integration Act was developed by the Review to provide a central statute to facilitate integration and co-ordination of the whole transport portfolio through the introduction of a modern policy framework and re-establishment of agencies with consistent charters which were tied bound by the framework. The development of the Transport Integration Act also ultimately led to the subordination and renaming of the Transport Act as the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. Further complex and discrete structural changes were driven by the Review through policy reviews and the development of new individual statutory schemes. For example, the work of the Review led to Victoria's first ever stand alone statutory schemes for rail and bus safety (the Rail Safety Act and Bus Safety Act), vehicle towing regulation (the Accident Towing Services Act), reduction of red tape in respect of approval and delivery of major transport projects (the Major Transport Projects Facilitation Act), tourist railways regulation (the Tourist and Heritage Railways Act) and public transport ticketing requirements (the Transport (Ticketing) Regulations).  Incomplete or pending reviews  The work of the Transport Legislation Review concluded in late 2010. Major areas signalled for overhaul before the conclusion of the projectSee, for example, the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum for the Transport Integration Bill. Copies of documents sourced from the official Victorian Government legislation site. included policy reviews and new statutes in the following areas: * Taxi and Hire Car regulation * Walking and Cycling * Road Safety * Port Management * compliance, enforcement and other matters covered by the Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983. Taxi industry reform was taken up as a major issue by the Victorian Government when the Review concluded. The Government established a Taxi Industry Inquiry in May 2011 under a new agency, the Taxi Services Commission. The Inquiry ultimately recommended major changes to policy and legislation to reform the taxi and small commercial passenger vehicles sector. The recommendations are currently being implemented.  Support and criticism  The Transport Legislation Review project and its policy and legislation projects were well supported during the term of the project. Most Acts and regulations generated by the project were passed or made with broad support and little or no opposition from affected parties. In the six years of the project, no Act or regulation failed to be passed by the Victorian Parliament even when the Government of the day did not control Parliamentary numbers. The overwhelming majority of Act products, for example, were passed by Parliament with all party support. While the Review was not subject to public criticism, some individual policy and legislative proposals arising from it were criticised. For example, the Rail Safety Act 2006 was opposed on a reasoned basis in the Victorian Parliament by Liberal and National party members of Parliament. However, the Bill was ultimately passed.A reasoned amendment calling for the withdrawal of the Bill was defeated in the Victorian Parliament on 1 March 2006. Several policy proposals developed by the project including in 2009 during a review of the Marine Act 1988 were abandoned and not included in the subsequent Marine Safety Act 2010 due to widespread opposition. The Bill for the Transport Integration Act was criticised by Liberal and National party members during its passage through ParliamentSee Hansard in the Legislative Assembly on 4 February 2010 but was not opposed. Finally, a proposal to add port authorities to the Transport Integration Act organisational framework was opposed and eventually defeated in the Legislative Council by the Liberal, National and Green parties.See Hansard for the Legislative Council proceedings on 22 June 2010. However, the Bill was later passed by the Victorian Parliament due to use of a dispute resolution process.The Legislative Assembly returned the Bill to the Legislative Council for its agreement as recommended in the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Parliament on 27 July 2010. The Bill was subsequently passed by the Legislative Council on 12 August 2010.

Owned for many years by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the work was sold by art dealer Hank Ebes on 24 July 2007, setting a record price for a contemporary Indigenous Australian art work bought at auction when it was purchased by the National Gallery of Australia for A$2.4 million. The painting illustrates the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata, together with eight other dreamings associated with localities about which Clifford Possum had traditional knowledge. It exemplifies a distinctive painting style developed by Papunya Tula artists in the 1970s, and blends representation of landscape with ceremonial iconography. Art critic Benjamin Genocchio describes it as \\"a work of real national significance [and] one of the most important 20th-century Australian paintings\\". Background Contemporary Indigenous Australian art originated with the Indigenous men of Papunya, located around northwest of Alice Springs in Australia's Western Desert, who began painting in 1971. The youngest was Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, encouraged by his older brother Tim Leura Tjapaltjarri. A number of the men developed a distinctive style of narrative painting that, beginning around 1976, resulted in the production of several \\"monumental\\" works that included representations of both their traditional lands and of ceremonial iconography. Clifford Possum was the first to make this transition commencing with a related painting, also titled Warlugulong (1976), now held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The two images are amongst five that the artist created between 1976 and 1979 that linked the iconography of sacred stories to geographic representation of his country ‚Äì the land to which he belonged and about which he had traditional knowledge. The artist's images of this period are visually complex, and contain a wide variety of patterns, unified by strong background motifs and structure. The painting Created in synthetic polymer paint on canvas, and a substantial in size, the work's title is taken from a location roughly \\"northwest of Alice Springs associated with a powerful desert dreaming\\". Clifford Possum would often collaborate with other artists, particularly his brother Tim Leura, and the brothers together created the 1976 work of the same name. Art critic Benjamin Genocchio has referred to the 1977 work as also being by the brothers; however, the National Gallery of Australia credits it solely to Clifford Possum. Like the other four works of the period that are symbolic maps of the artist's country, the painting is accompanied by annotated diagrams of the images and notes that explain the dreamings that they include. Detail showing the skeleton of one of Lungkata's sons, against a background representing smoke and ashes While the painting has been described as showing the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata starting the first bushfire, it portrays elements of nine distinct dreamings, of which Lungkata's tale is the central motif. Lungkata was the Bluetongue Lizard Man, an ancestral figure responsible for creating bushfire. The painting portrays the results of a fire, caused by Lungkata to punish his two sons who did not share with their father the kangaroo they had caught. The sons' skeletons are on the right hand side of the image, shown against a background representing smoke and ashes. Around this central motif are arranged elements of eight other stories, all of them represented at least in part by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure. This work excludes elements of several dreamings associated with country further south, which had been included in the painting created by Clifford Possum and his brother a year earlier. The omission led scholar Vivien Johnson to conclude that Warlugulong (1977) portrays a narrower geographic area than the preceding work. The artist also modified some of the iconography, and limited the explanations of the painting, omitting secret-sacred dimensions of the stories to avoid offending other Indigenous men, and in recognition that most of the audience for the work would be uninitiated non-Indigenous people. Johnson's analysis of the painting emphasises the relationship between the representation of geographical sites in the Yuendumu region and the dreaming stories associated with those sites. She concludes that there is \\"a topographic rationale for the order in which the Dreamings appear from left to right (that is, east to west) across the painting [as well as for] the transverse Dreaming trails\\". However, beyond this general principle, she argues that the layout of symbols and images is influenced by the desire to present a symmetrical work. There is greater visual symmetry in this painting than in its 1976 predecessor; symmetry is a strong influence in the works of many of the early Western Desert artists, including Clifford Possum, Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri and Kaapa Tjampitjinpa. Warlugulong (1977) is acclaimed as a landmark Indigenous painting; a great work by one of the country's foremost artists. Described as \\"epic\\" and \\"sprawling\\", Genocchio said of it that is \\"a work of real national significance [and] one of the most important 20th-century Australian paintings\\". The authors of the National Gallery of Australia's book, Collection Highlights, characterises the painting as the artist's most significant. Artist and curator Brenda L Croft agreed, considering it \\"an epic painting, encyclopaedic in both content and ambition\\" and \\"the artist's most significant work\\". The work and the price it achieved at auction in 2007 are cited as evidence of both the importance of Clifford Possum as an artist, and of the maturation and growth of the Australian Indigenous art market. Sale history Warlugulong was first exhibited at a show in Alice Springs, where it attracted crowds of interested viewers, but failed to sell. Realities Gallery in Melbourne then included the work in a major exhibition of Papunya Tula artworks. It was purchased for A$1,200 by the Commonwealth Bank, which hung it in a bank training centre cafeteria on the Mornington Peninsula. The bank sold it by auction in 1996. The auction house trading the work expected it to fetch around $5,000 and did not make a feature of it in the catalogue, but dealers including Hank Ebes, the successful bidder, recognised the painting's significance and it sold for $36,000 plus commission. After hanging in Ebes's living room for eleven years, it was auctioned in Melbourne by Sotheby's on 24 July 2007. It sold for $2.4 million, thoroughly eclipsing the previous record for an Indigenous Australian painting, set when Emily Kngwarreye's Earth's Creation was bought in May of the same year for just over $1 million. Warlugulong's buyer was the National Gallery of Australia, which purchased the work as part of its 25th Anniversary Gifts Program. The Gallery considers the painting to be possibly the most important in its collection of Indigenous Australian art. As of 2016, the work is on display in the National Gallery. When the Australian government in 2009 introduced a resale royalty scheme, the sale history of Warlugulong was frequently used to argue in favour of the scheme, designed to ensure that artists and their families continued to benefit from the appreciating value of old works.

Mining began at Mount Morgan in 1882 and continued until 1981. Over its lifespan, the mine yielded approximately of gold, of silver and of copper.Queensland Government: Mines and Energy: Mount Morgan Mine Rehabilitation Project: Project Summary The mine was once the largest gold mine in the world. The Mount Morgan Mine also operated assay laboratories, brickworks, foundry, power house and workshops (including carpentry, electrical and plumbing) as part of its operations.Operations of Mount Morgan Limited, September, 1969 pp12-27 The Mount Morgan Mine also contained Fireclay Caverns excavated to provide clay for the mine brickworks. Wealth from the Mount Morgan mine funded Persian oil exploration, establishing the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, which became BP in 1954. Wealth from the Mount Morgan mine was also bequeathed in 1912 to establish the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. Resources The area near the mine contains sedimentary and igneous rocks. The gold was rated 0.998 fine.  History  View of the town of Mount Morgan and the mine beyond from the Queensland National Hotel = The Beginning (1882 to 1886) = Walter Hall and D'Arcy ~1885 In 1882, a syndicate was created to open a gold mine at Ironstone Mountain, south of Rockhampton, Queensland. The syndicate comprised William Knox Darcy (later influential in establishing the Anglo Persian Oil Company), Walter Russell Hall (later influential in establishing the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research), Thomas Skarratt Hall, and Thomas, Frederick and Edwin Morgan. Ironstone Mountain was later renamed Mount Morgan after the Morgan members of the syndicate. = Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited (1886‚Äì1928) = Mount Morgan Mine, 1906 In October 1886, the syndicate became the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited, with James Wesley Hall, the younger brother of Walter Russell and Thomas Skarratt Hall, as the first general manager. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited operated using underground mining methods until 1927 when fire destroyed underground workings. The company deliberately flooded its underground workings in response to the fire and went into liquidation. By 1907 the mine had produced $60,000,000 worth of gold, making it one of the most productive in the world. = Mount Morgan Limited (1928‚Äì1990) = The Mount Morgan Mine was reestablished using open-cut mining methods in 1928, operating as Mount Morgan Limited. Conversion to open-cut operation included substantial modernization of Mount Morgan‚Äôs mining infrastructure and mining techniques. Mount Morgan Limited became a subsidiary of Peko Wallsend Limited in 1968 and continued operations until 1974, when Mount Morgan Limited began to reach the end of its ore body. Mount Morgan Limited progressively scaled back its workforce and operations until it reached the end of its ore body in 1981. From 1982 to 1990, Mount Morgan Limited began processing tailings of its previous operations at the Mount Morgan mine site. In parallel, Mount Morgan mine facilities were used to process materials from other Peko Wallsend operations. At the end of both such operations in 1990, the Queensland Government began negotiating with Mount Morgan Limited regarding terms of closure. = Recent = The Queensland Government began administration of the site in 1992. Perilya/Aumin NL commenced further exploration in 1992 leading to plans for potential further reprocessing at the Mount Morgan mine site in the future. Since 2007 the mine and mining leases have been owned by Norton Gold Fields. An estimated of gold still exist at the site.  Broader influence of the mine  = BP = William Knox Darcy, an original member of the Mount Morgan gold mine syndicate, used proceeds from the Mount Morgan gold mine to fund oil exploration in Persia. The exploration made successful oil discovery in 1908 and commenced the Anglo Persian Oil Company. The company became The British Petroleum Company (BP) in 1954. = Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research = Walter Russell Hall was also a member of the original Mount Morgan Gold Mine syndicate. Substantial personal wealth of Walter Russell Hall was bequeathed on his death in 1912 to establish the Walter and Eliza Hall Trust. The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research was established from the trust in 1915.  Today  The Mount Morgan mine site is currently a tourist attraction in the Central Queensland region. The site contains remaining structures of its mining operations including the General Office, Gold Rooms and Main Stack. The Arthur Timms lookout overlooks remaining mine buildings and the Mount Morgan township. According to former Queensland Minister for Mining, Stirling Hinchliffe, water in the pit contains elevated levels of copper, aluminium, magnesium and other metals. The site contains a lime dosing water treatment plant and onsite evaporators. Controlled water releases done to prevent an uncontrolled release during heavy rainfall events has been done twice in March 2011, once in January 2013 and again in February 2013. In June 2011, the Government of Queensland announced $24.2 million in funding for site rehabilitation and management. On 26 January 2013, the mine filled with water and overflowed in the Dee River for the first time ever. Although mining company Carbine Resources announced plans in 2014 to extract gold, copper and pyrite from tailings and improve the mine's acid mine drainage problem, it withdrew the proposal in March 2018 due to its doubts over the financial viability of the project.

It differs from rainwater harvesting as the runoff is collected from drains or creeks, rather than roofs.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/stormwater/managestormwatera06137.pdf page 10 It can also include other catchment areas from man made surfaces, such as roads, or other urban environments such as parks, gardens and playing fields. A main challenge stormwater harvesting poses is the removal of pollutants in order to make this water available for reuse. Stormwater harvesting is practiced across the United States in Texas and other States as a way to address rising demands as populations rise. Internationally, Australia has been a country also active in stormwater harvesting. Water that comes in contact with impervious surfaces becomes polluted and is denominated surface runoff. As the water travels more distance over impervious surfaces it collects an increasing amount of pollutants.  Concerns  Major concerns in new projects for stormwater harvesting include cost effectiveness as well as quality, quantity, and reliability of the reclamation, as well as existing water management infrastructure and soil characteristics. Some project cost estimates have produced results for stormwater being around twice as expensive factoring operating cost per unit versus potable water alternatives. However, other benefits include reducing soil erosion and reducing demands on local aquifers, as well as reduction of pollution into local waterways.thumb300px Ground catchment system Systems Ground catchments systems channel water from a prepared catchment area into storage. Generally they are only considered in areas where rainwater is very scarce and other sources of water are not available. If properly designed, ground catchment systems can collect large quantities of rainwater.  Stormwater Capture  Five Core Steps: \\"End Use, Collection, Treatment, Storage, and Distribution\\". * End Use  Water sources become scarce as the population grows. People need to come up with methods to recycle water at the end of its use. For non-portable water purpose of lower water quality, people use stormwater for toilet flushing, gardening, fire fighting, irrigation, etc. For potable water use of higher water quality, stormwater needs to be treated before putting into use. The latter has been rarely used around the world. * Collection  Stormwater collection is a process of directing water into a storage from stormwater gathering, such as urban runoff. Generally, there are two types, online storages and offline storages. Online storages are a conventional way of acquiring stormwater directly from waterways or drains. For instance, the urban drainage system of channels and pipes conduct stormwater into storages. One inconvenient part of the drainage system is to keep maintenance in case that conduits break and stormwater leaks away. Based on online storages, another drainage system called WSUD is featured. Offline storages require additional facilities to conduct water from waterways indirectly For instance, weirs divert low flows into the stormwater container and contribute to a large part of stormwater catchment for a city. * Treatment  Stormwater treatment is what mostly hinders the progress of stormwater catchment. Water treatment process depends on the intended end use and the catchment equipment, which decides the level of and size of the pollutants to be filtered and removed. Generally, the steps applied for different end uses vary. For instance, as construction uses may not require high-quality water. The water recycling includes only filtration and disinfection. However, for potable uses of higher water quality, the treatment process requires screening, coagulation, filtration, carbon adsorption, and disinfection. * Storage  There are three factors to consider in terms of storage: function, location and capacity. For function, the planner is responsible for deciding the purpose of the stored stormwater, such as fire fighting, industrial water supplies, farming and irrigation, recreational amenity and flood mitigation. For location, to establish a water tank or an injection system to aquifers above or below the ground should be considered. Besides, choices between online and offline storages can affect the surrounding natural aquatic system and yields different maintenance costs and flood mitigation effeteness. The capacity of a storage relies on the demand of the end use in a particular climate or period. * Distribution  Generally, there are two types of stormwater distribution systems. The first one is open space irrigation systems. The other one is non-potable distribution systems. Some key points are underscored in terms of designing an appropriate distribution system: \\"Consideration of customer requirements; Adjusting design criteria; Selecting design peak factors; Methods for peak leveling; Controlling distribution non-potable water; Minimisation of bacterial and algal build up; Corrosion risk and so forth\\".

The Red Crescent has a particular role to play during Hajj (the annual pilgrimage to Mecca), providing on-the-spot first aid and using its fleet of vehicles (1300 in 2009) to take emergency cases to the nearest medical facility. The Saudi Red Crescent Authorities offer medical service of first aid to citizens and foreign labors who are staying in the kingdom in ordinary circumstances and at time of catastrophes. The Authority contributes relief work inside the Kingdom and abroad. It offers service according to Islamic morals and instructions.  Establishment of the National Medical Emergency Association  It was the first independent medical entity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as no previous organizational association for ambulatory services existed before the year of 1353 H. That idea brought up by key men of education and business and philanthropy to form the authority due to the war between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Battles broke out in mountains of Asir and Tihamah coasts where no convenient facilities or medical supplies for the wounded civilians and militants were available. The elite people in Saudi Arabia decided to strongly participate with their effort and prospects in that war to relieve the harshness of the war on the army. For that they requested from the government to form an authority in the holy city of Makkah assigned to perform ambulatory services of militants by doctors and medicines and bandages during the war.  Ambulance Charity Association  As the government of the late King Faisal bin Abdul-Aziz believed in the necessity of providing ambulatory medical care within the delivered services with more wide and independent method, the idea of establishing the association was proposed in the year of 1353 H by key personalities in Makkah. As they noticed the difficulties encountered by pilgrims while performing Hajj rituals, those generous people, the late Tala'at Harb Pasha was one of them, intended to support pilgrims with first aid and medical services. Heatstroke, exhaustion due diseases and the age issues and problems were all occurred to the pilgrims at that time and their families are the one who took care of transferring them to Ajyad hospital, the only hospital in Makkah at that time. Those problems increased rapidly and caused death of those patients due delay in transferring them to the hospital.

E. Evans, was a geographer and archaeologist, whose primary field of interest was the Irish neolithic. Early life He was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, the son of a Welsh Presbyterian minister, George Owen Evans. He was educated at Welshpool Intermediate (County) School and University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he read Geography and Anthropology. Due to illness he was obliged to turn down a post at Oxford University and worked instead for geographer and zoologist H. J. Fleure, preparing contributions for the 14th edition of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Career After recovering from tuberculosis, he accepted a post in 1928 as lecturer in Geography at Queen's University, Belfast, where he was responsible for establishing a new department. He was promoted to Reader in 1944 and Professor in 1945, a position he held until his retirement in 1968. His academic activities focussed initially on relationships between prehistoric and proto-historic communities and their natural environment. In 1931 he was awarded an MA (Wales) for a thesis entitled A Study of the Origins and Distributions of some Late Bronze Age Industries in Western Europe. In 1938 he was elected a Member of the Royal Irish Academy and in 1939 awarded a DSc for published work. He led an archaeological survey of Northern Ireland which discovered many previously unrecorded megalithic monuments. These were described in A Preliminary Survey of the Ancient Monuments of Northern Ireland (1940) which he published with D. A. Chart and H. C. Lawlor. In 1937‚Äì38 he excavated the largest Neolithic site in Northern Ireland, that at Lyle's Hill, Country Antrim. He later became interested in Ulster's disappearing peasant culture and folklore and served as President of the Ulster Folklife Society. He wrote a number of books on the subject, namely Irish Heritage: The Landscape, the People and their Work (1942), Mourne Country: Landscape and Life in South Down (1951), Irish Folk Ways (1957), Prehistoric and Early Christian Ireland: A Guide (1966) and The Personality of Ireland: Habitat, Heritage and History (1973), which was revised and released in paperback in 1981. The 1981 edition was essentially a reprint but corrected some factual errors, expanded some sections in light of new information, and increased the number of illustrations. In this book, he focused on the underlying continuities of history as opposed to the common historical focus on institutional change. He described his approach as a trilogy of geography, history, and anthropology but his approach also made excellent use of geology and ecology. A further book, Ireland and the Atlantic Heritage: Selected Writings (1996), in which Gwyneth Evans wrote ‚ÄòA Biographical Memoir‚Äô of her late husband, was published after his death. Honours and awards He received many awards, including the Victoria Medal of the Royal Geographical Society (1973), the merit award of the Association of American Geographers (1979), and honorary doctorates from University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, NUI, Queen's University Belfast and Bowdoin College in Maine. He was also President of the British Association Section E (Geography) (1958) and Section H (Anthropology) (1960), President of the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society (1967‚Äì77) and of the Institute of British Geographers (1970). He was appointed a CBE in 1970 for services to the community. Private life He died in Belfast on 12 August 1989. He had married Gwyneth, the daughter of Professor Abel E. Jones and had four sons.

It is increasingly popular as an ornamental creeper in gardens, and it has a wide range of uses in traditional medicine. Appearance A lush, dense, attractive creeper that naturally reaches up to the forest canopy and covers the tree-tops with its foliage. New velvety shoots grow upwards, reaching out with their tendrils, while old stems or lianas hang like rope from the canopy. The large, simple, roughly circular leaves are deep green above and soft and velvety below. In fact, they resemble the 3-lobed leaves of their Eurasian relative, the Grapevine (Vitis vinifera), with slightly serrated, wavy margins. The leaves start off as maroon or copper-coloured with thick velvety fur (tomentosa = \\"velvety\\"), they turn a dark rich green as they mature, and finally before they fall they become crimson. The creeper produces clumps of furry flower-buds that open into small flowers in summer. These are followed by bunches of dark purple, edible, grape-like berries. The berries make a good jam. Distribution The Cape grape can be found throughout the wetter regions of southern Africa, from the forests on the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, eastwards throughout the coastal afro- temperate forests of South Africa (Cape Provinces, KwaZulu-Natal, Northern Provinces) and then on to Zimbabwe and Malawi. Growing Rhoicissus tomentosa A very attractive and easy-to-grow creeper for gardening. Its even, multi-coloured, evergreen foliage is particularly attractive and ornamental, and it makes a good local alternative to ivy for African gardens. It can also be grown in the shade (and even indoors) as well as in the open sun. It can be used as a groundcover in shady areas; it can be planted to grow up walls like ivy (although it requires a trellis of some sort for its tendrils to hold onto); it readily climbs up and over a fence to form a screen or hedge; and it can even be used to make wire-basket topiaries. The Cape Grape can easily be grown from seed, although cuttings can also be rooted. Pictures File:Rhoicissus tomentosa capensis creeper - Cape Town 2.JPGLeaf detail.

Life and career He was born in Pomona, California, the youngest of four children of Jesse and Adelheide Gutheil Morain, and grew up living in a shack in a northern California lumber town where his father worked as a minister. His father later practiced law, and his mother became a teacher at UCLA. Ingrid Matson Wekerle, Obituary of Lloyd L. Morain, The Carmel Pine Cone, August 27 ‚Äì September 2, 2010, pp. 6‚Äì7 In his teens, he won an essay- writing competition, as a result of which he gained a scholarship to UCLA. After graduating, he worked in the movie industry in Los Angeles, his friend Irving Wallace engaging him as psychological consultant and palmist for film stars such as Marlene Dietrich, Hedy Lamarr, and Charles Boyer. He became president of the Los Angeles Society for General Semantics, through which he met Mary Stone Dewing; they married in 1946. Obituary, The Humanist, September 2010 During World War II he served in the US Army Air Corps, and at the end of the war was involved in setting up schools in Europe for the many servicemen experiencing long delays before their return home. While with the USAAC in Britain he also acted as a field representative for the American Humanist Association. Through his discussions with leading secular humanists in Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States, he played a leading role in establishing the International Humanist and Ethical Union, formed in 1952. He and his wife were founding Directors of the IHEU. International Humanist and Ethical Union: Lloyd and Mary Morain After his return to the US, he started a career in the mining and utilities industries, initially as a result of being appointed as an industrial psychologist with U.S. Steel. From 1950, he worked for the Illinois Gas Company, and served as its President from 1971 to 1988. He also invested in mining activities in Colorado. He served his first term as President of the American Humanist Association from 1951 to 1955. AHA: Past Presidents At the same time, he supported his wife's work as a supporter of global initiatives on planned parenthood. In 1954, the couple co-authored Humanism as the Next Step: an introduction for liberal Protestants, Catholics, and Jews, which has since been republished in several later editions, most recently in 2007. American Humanist Association, Humanism as the Next Step Gay Today: review of Humanism as the Next Step Both were later elected as Fellows of the World Academy of Art and Science. Lloyd Morain received the Humanist Merit Award in 1956. He became involved in the movie industry again in the late 1950s, producing the movie Flight, based on John Steinbeck's short story, which won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Between 1969 and 1972 he served an unprecedented second term as President of the American Humanist Association, and was awarded the Humanist Distinguished Service Award in 1972. He was editor of the Humanist Magazine between 1979 and 1990, and wrote for the magazine on issues as diverse as general semantics, international cooperation, affordable housing, and humanism in developing countries. Roy Speckhardt, speech at 2007 AHA Annual Conference He was a major financial donor to the AHA, and also served on the board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. He researched and wrote a book on working drifters, The Human Cougar, published in 1976. He saw the drifters, who he had first encountered in his youth, as epitomizing the American ideal of personal independence, and often rode boxcars and camped with them while gathering their stories. In the 1980s, he and his wife funded a refuge for migrant workers in Salinas. He also worked closely with prison governors on the rehabilitation of prisoners through finding them employment opportunities. In the 1990s, he was given the Philanthropist of the Year award for the Monterey Peninsula, and in 1994 he and his wife were jointly honored by the American Humanist Association as Humanists of the Year. He helped his friend and business partner Michael McOmber establish a school for troubled adolescent boys, Bridges Academy, in Bend, Oregon in 1997.Bridges Academy He supported local performers through theatre scholarships, and purchased a large area at Rancho San Carlos near his home in Carmel, California, to protect the redwoods from logging. In 2003 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. He also sponsored the environmentalist film, Fuel, in 2008. He was actively involved in the international organisation of arm wrestling as a sporting activity, and competed for the US in the sport at the Goodwill Games in Moscow in 1988.

He was a pupil of Antonio Isopi and worked for Leo von Klenze, mainly in Munich where in 1830 he became Professor of Sculpture at the Polytechnic, now the Technical University. Life Mayer was the ninth child of Johann Ernst Mayer (1754 - 1812), a stocking manufacturer, who had become master of the household and garden supervisor at the Ludwigsburg castle of Duke (later King) Friedrich I of W√ºrttemberg. After elementary school, in 1810, Ernst Mayer was apprenticed to Antonio Isopi, the Italian sculptor working for the king. From him he learned the crafts of sculpture, casting and ornament as well as the Italian language, which was beneficial to him on his later sojourn in Rome. When he had finished his apprenticeship he worked for Isopi both in Ludwigsburg and in Wasseralfingen, where Isopi's colossal sculptures of a lion and stag ‚Äì still to be seen in front of the Stuttgart New Castle ‚Äì were cast. In 1818 Leo von Klenze invited the 22-year-old Ernst Mayer, together with Isopi, to Munich and employed him in his workshop. Between 1818 and 1820 Mayer restored antique sculptures for the Glyptothek. He also created stucco models for the ceiling of Klenze's riding hall and casting moulds for Johann Martin von Wagner's ornaments of the portal and the fa√ßade of the new riding school. From 1821 to 1825 Mayer was in Rome and again worked for von Wagner, who acquired antique statues for crown prince and future king Ludwig I of Bavaria. At the same time he was employed by the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, for whom he created reliefs for the Walhalla in Regensburg. Mayer also created part of the memorial for Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, stepson of Napoleon's stepson and son-in-law of King Maximilian I of Bavaria, which had been designed by Klenze and was completed by Thorvaldsen. The two genii at the bottom of the monument are by Mayer. Back in Munich, Mayer continued restoring antique statues, but also created sculptures of his own, including the pediment figures for the Glyptothek building, among them three antique artists representing the crafts that Mayer himself practised: the modeller (Koroplastes), the bronze caster (Statuarius) and the stone sculptor (Glyptos). In 1830 Mayer became Professor of Stone Sculpting at the Polytechnic in Munich. He married Amailie Burgett (1808 - 1880) and the couple had three daughters and one son. Mayer died in Munich at the age of 47 on 21 January 1844 of a skull fracture after a fall on ice in front of his workshop. His successor at the Munich Polytechnic was his pupil Johann Halbig.

It is a remake of the 1970 American war film Kelly's Heroes.  Plot  In French Tunisia, during the Second World War, a convoy of the French Foreign Legion is charged to recover gold bars of six billion francs from a bank in El Ksour in order to bring them into a safe place for the French government. On 5 April 1943, a contingent of the Foreign Legion enters the seemingly abandoned and partially destroyed town of El Ksour. Unbeknownst to them, a German platoon holds the town and ambushes the FFL convoy - killing most of them. Only five legionnaires survive the attack and take refuge in a hotel in ruins. At night, legionnaire Borzik heads out with Adjudant Mahuzard (Michel Constantin) to recover arms and ammunition. But Borzik is killed. The remaining l√©gionnaires include Sergent Augagneur (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and Boissier (Michel Creton). They find the corpulent and pusillanimous artilleryman B√©ral (Jacques Villeret) sitting in the toilets, suffering from dysentery. Beral and Augagneur then sneak out and use a Howitzer on the Germans, killing them all except Captain Karl Brenner. The legionnaires enter the bank. Augagneur and Boissier want to steal the gold for themselves but Mahuzard wishes to continue the original mission. A fight breaks out between Mahuzard and Augagneur. Augagneur wins and locks Mahuzard in a room, as the manager of the bank arrives, Fran√ßois de La Roche-Fr√©on. Augagneur then tries to seduce Helene, Francois' wife. They are interrupted by the German lieutenant Karl, who arrives in a tank. Karl became friendly with Helen during the occupation. Helen helps Augagneur capture Karl and suggests they take the gold and sell it to an American launderer, Bob Turner, and split it three ways. Meanwhile, in the bank, Mahuzard convinces B√©ral release him. He captures Augagneur and Karl upon their return and locks them in a vault with Bossier. Mahuzard has dinner with the bank manager and his wife, who steals the key to the vault. Helen releases Augagneur, Boissier and Karl. They return with the tank surprise Mahuzard and B√©ral who have just completed the loading of gold in an armored car and preparing to leave. In the meantime, Francois has electrocuted himself to death by urinating on a live wire. Augagneur sends Boissier seize the van. Mahuzard shoots Boissier dead. Karl fires the tank and completely destroys the van containing the gold, killing Mahuzard and B√©ral instantly. Helene tries to get Augagneur to kill Karl but he refuses, Karl also reveals Helene made the same offer to him against Augagneur. The two ex- soldiers then loaded the bulk of bullion on the truck, leaving only 300 kilos of gold to Helene while they take 10,000. Augagneur and Karl head south in the tank to sell the gold, but has to stop at a German German filling station to refuel. Karl persuades Augagneur to leave the tank so he won't be spotted. The German commander wants the tank. Augagneur escapes into the desert and has to give up the gold. The film concludes with a quote from Blaise Cendrars : \\"I was the richest man in the world, gold has ruined me. \\" Cast * Jean-Paul Belmondo (Sergent Pierre Augagneur) * Michel Constantin (Adjudant Edouard Mahuzard) * Marie Lafor√™t (H√©l√®ne de La Roche-Fr√©on) * Michel Creton (L√©gionnaire Boissier) * Jacques Villeret (Brigadier B√©ral) * Fran√ßois Perrot (Fran√ßois de La Roche-Fr√©on) * Maurice Auzel (L√©gionnaire Borzik) * Matthias Habich (Oberstleutnant Karl Brenner) * Pierre Semmler (Hauptmann Ulrich Dieterle) Production Verneuil was developing the project for a number of years and was thinking of casting Victor Lanoux when Belmondo read the script and wanted to do it. Filming took place on location in Tunisia. Reception The film was the sixth most popular movie of 1984 in France. However its box office performance was considered a slight disappointment.

It took place on the eastern flank of the Greek- Italian front, where the Italian forces had remained on the defensive during the initial Italian invasion toward Epirus. It was a major success for the Greek forces, not only on operational terms, but also as a morale boost, as the breaching of Morava‚ÄìIvan line led to the fall of the city of Kor√ß√´ to Greek hands, and made news internationally. Prelude =Initial conception= The plans for the offensive had been laid by the Greek General Staff before the start of the war. Following the torpedoing of the Greek cruiser Elli by an Italian submarine on 15 August 1940, the Greek authorities became certain that an Italian invasion was imminent and started to assess the situation. Greek intelligence had revealed fairly accurately the Italian disposition of forces in Albania, which showed that the Italian forces planned to attack towards Epirus while keeping a defensive posture on the Macedonian sector. The Greek plan was finalised in the second half of September. The Greek forces in North-Western Macedonia would keep a defensive posture, potentially improving the positions with limited attacks in Albanian ground, until the necessary forces arrived. The objective of the offensive was to boost the morale of the Greek forces and the nation in general, as well as to capture the important transportation centre that was Kor√ß√´. =28 October ‚Äì 13 November= The Greek forces available on the sector were the 9th Infantry Division and the 4th Infantry Brigade (soon expanded into the 15th Infantry Division), under the III Army Corps. In the first three days of the war, they were not attacked in any appreciable scale. From 1‚Äì6 November, they began their own limited offensives, entering in some places Albania. During these clashes, it was revealed that they faced the Parma, Piemonte and Venezia divisions of the Italian XXVI Corps. =Terrain= Map of the Greek counter- offensive during the Greco-Italian War. The terrain was very favourable for defence, although it afforded little strategic depth. The Greek and Italian positions were separated by the Devoll river valley. North of the valley lay the Morava mountain, a continuation of the Grammos mountains, with a maximum altitude of . North of the Morava is the Kor√ß√´ plateau. The Morava massif provided good defensive positions for the Italians but the lack of depth meant that if the defences on Morava collapsed, they had no option but to abandon Kor√ß√´ and the Kor√ß√´ plateau and retreat north to the Kandauian mountains. The upper Devoll valley communicated with the Kor√ß√´ plateau through the Cangonj pass, which was defined by the Morava on the south and the Ivan mountain on the north. The Ivan mountain is steep and reaches the height of . Through the Cangonj pass was a paved road and another hard surfaced road, in the southern part of Morava, crossed the mountain towards Korce. Opposing forces =Greek= \\"Greek attack\\" by Georgios Prokopiou. By 13 November, the Greek forces concentrated for the attack were the 10th, 9th and 15th (the former 4th Œírigade) Divisions, all under III Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Georgios Tsolakoglou, which in turn was subordinate to West Macedonia Army Section under Lt. Gen. Ioannis Pitsikas. The 11th and 13th Divisions were on the march to further reinforce the Greek forces. During the battle, the \\"K\\" Group of Divisions (ŒüŒºŒ¨œÇ ŒúŒµœÅŒ±œÅœáŒπœéŒΩ ¬´Œö¬ª) was created under Lt. Gen. Georgios Kosmas, taking the 10th and 11th Divisions under its command. =Italy= On the Italian side, there was the XXVI Corps, with the Parma, Piemonte and Venezia Divisions on the front, and the Arezzo Division as the reserve corps. Additional reinforcements in the form of the Alpini Division Tridentina and other Alpini elements began arriving from 13 November, but were committed piece-meal and had little impact. Plan The Greek plan was to put the main effort on the left, along the mountainous road through the village Darza, rather through the Cangonj pass, as there were fears that the Italians could use armour through the relatively flat terrain of the Cangonj pass. The Greeks would attack with the 15th Division on the right (toward Cangonj), the 9th in the centre and the 10th on the left. The 15th had the task of approaching the Cangonj pass, between Ivan and Morava, and capturing if possible its western exit. The 9th would attack toward the Morava mountain, coordinating its left flank with the 10th Division. The 10th Division had the task of penetrating the Italian position, through the use of surprise, and if possible flank the Italian positions atop of Morava.

It was instituted on 10 January 1941 by Hermann G√∂ring in his capacity as the Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe. The badge was awarded to servicemen of the Flak artillery who distinguished themselves in action against enemy aerial or ground attacks. Designed by Wilhelm Ernst Peekhaus, the badge was of single piece construction with a pin back and clasp. It was made in one grade; it had a Luftwaffe eagle at the top, and an oak leaf wreath around the outside rim. In the middle was an 88 mm flak gun with the barrel facing upwards to the right. The badge was worn on the lower part of the left breast pocket of the service tunic, underneath the 1st class Iron Cross if awarded.  Criteria  It was awarded after the accumulation of 16 points or could also be awarded outside of the points system for an act of merit or bravery in the performance of air defense duties. If the candidates' battery brought down an enemy aircraft then the crew members were awarded four points. If two batteries were involved then each battery received two points. Both officers and crews were eligible for the badge. The commanding officer for an anti-aircraft unit was eligible for the badge once half of his men also qualified for the badge. The award was also available to searchlight crews and sound-locator crews. Searchlight and sound-locator crews which assisted in the action by detection of aircraft could be awarded one point each. The German Army had a similar badge, however, earning points towards it were only awarded for the downing of aircraft and not for ground targets. Prior to the introduction of the Ground Assault Badge of the Luftwaffe, this badge could be awarded to a serviceman for the participation in three separate combat operations against tanks, bunkers or ships.

Conceived by Sigbert Prais and Christopher Winsten in 1954, it is a modification of Cochrane‚ÄìOrcutt estimation in the sense that it does not lose the first observation, which leads to more efficiency as a result and makes it a special case of feasible generalized least squares. Theory Consider the model :y_t = \\\\alpha + X_t \\\\beta+\\\\varepsilon_t,\\\\, where y_{t} is the time series of interest at time t, \\\\beta is a vector of coefficients, X_{t} is a matrix of explanatory variables, and \\\\varepsilon_t is the error term. The error term can be serially correlated over time: \\\\varepsilon_t =\\\\rho \\\\varepsilon_{t-1}+e_t,\\\\ \\\\rho <1 and e_t is white noise. In addition to the Cochrane‚ÄìOrcutt transformation, which is :y_t - \\\\rho y_{t-1} = \\\\alpha(1-\\\\rho)+\\\\beta(X_t - \\\\rho X_{t-1}) + e_t, \\\\, for t = 2,3,...,T, the Prais-Winsten procedure makes a reasonable transformation for t = 1 in the following form: :\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\rho^2}y_1 = \\\\alpha\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\rho^2}+\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\rho^2}X_1\\\\right)\\\\beta + \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\rho^2}\\\\varepsilon_1. \\\\, Then the usual least squares estimation is done. Estimation procedure To do the estimation in a compact way one must look at the autocovariance function of the error term considered in the model blow: : \\\\mathrm{cov}(\\\\varepsilon_t,\\\\varepsilon_{t+h})=\\\\frac{\\\\rho^h}{1-\\\\rho^2}, \\\\text{ for } h=0,\\\\pm 1, \\\\pm 2, \\\\dots \\\\, . It is easy to see that the variance‚Äìcovariance matrix, \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega} , of the model is : \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\frac{\\\\rho^2}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{T-1}}{1-\\\\rho^2} \\\\[8pt] \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{T-2}}{1-\\\\rho^2} \\\\[8pt] \\\\frac{\\\\rho^2}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\frac{\\\\rho}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{T-3}}{1-\\\\rho^2} \\\\[8pt] \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\[8pt] \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{T-1}}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{T-2}}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{T-3}}{1-\\\\rho^2} & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\rho^2} \\\\end{bmatrix}. Having \\\\rho (or an estimate of it), we see that, : \\\\hat{\\\\Theta}=(\\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Z})^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{Z}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{Y}), \\\\, where \\\\mathbf{Z} is a matrix of observations on the independent variable (Xt, t = 1, 2, ..., T) including a vector of ones, \\\\mathbf{Y} is a vector stacking the observations on the dependent variable (yt, t = 1, 2, ..., T) and \\\\hat{\\\\Theta} includes the model parameters. Note To see why the initial observation assumption stated by Prais‚ÄìWinsten (1954) is reasonable, considering the mechanics of generalized least square estimation procedure sketched above is helpful. The inverse of \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega} can be decomposed as \\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}^{-1}=\\\\mathbf{G}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}\\\\mathbf{G} with : \\\\mathbf{G} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\rho^2} & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0  -\\\\rho & 1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0  0 & -\\\\rho & 1 & \\\\cdots & 0  \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. A pre-multiplication of model in a matrix notation with this matrix gives the transformed model of Prais‚ÄìWinsten. Restrictions The error term is still restricted to be of an AR(1) type. If \\\\rho is not known, a recursive procedure (Cochrane‚ÄìOrcutt estimation) or grid-search (Hildreth‚ÄìLu estimation) may be used to make the estimation feasible. Alternatively, a full information maximum likelihood procedure that estimates all parameters simultaneously has been suggested by Beach and MacKinnon.

It lies along National Highway 3, approximately 24 kilometres to the north of Lashio. History In the early 20th century, the area around Kutkai was explored by British botanists. In 1912, Stephenson documented that he had found the earthworm species Pheretima molesta of the genus Pheretima in Katkai. Shan State became a major Christian area of Burma from the mid 19th century. Kutkai was an important centre for the Kachin Baptist Church and was visited by missionaries, notably Baptist Reverend George J. Geis in the 1930s and Gustaf A. Sword from 1936 to 1942. Geis died in Kutkai on October 28, 1936 whilst he was working there at the Kachin Bible Training School he had established. A B-25 Mitchell, the same type of aircraft as those that bombed Kutkai During World War II, Kutkai was occupied by the Japanese. On September 10, 1944, the Chinese Fourteenth Air Force sent out 45 B-25 Mitchells to bomb Kutkai along with the towns of Tunganhsien, Lingling and Tunghsiangchiao. but the town was abandoned without a fight when the Chinese reached it on February 19, 1945. In July 1954, Hoo Kya Chin, a Kokang businessman from Mu Kwan was arrested by the immigration officials in Kutkai for not carrying an identification card which caused some controversy in the region. In the 1980s, two privates and a sergeant of the Kachin Independence Army insurgent 4th Brigade surrendered at Kutkai garrison. Geography Map showing location of Kutkai Kutkai is situated in eastern- central Burma, several kilometres by road north of Hsenwi and about north of Lashio. It lies at an altitude of . To the east of Kutkai is the Nam Ting River and the Salween River. It sits on Mandalay-Lashio-Muse road aka Asian Highway route 14 (AH14). It is from Mandalay, from Lashio and to Muse. Kutkai- Tarmoene road is , Kutkai-Kaungkha road is , Kutkai-Manbyien road is and Kutkai-Karlaing road is also. Economy As with many parts of Burma, the economy relies on agriculture, particularly rice production. Villagers in Kutkai Township are generally well educated in farming practices and in canning-bottling. Of major note is the Kutkai Market in the town where people come from miles to sell their goods. Kutkai High School is located in the southern part of the town. The town also contains the Kutkai General Hospital. In the 1990s, Kutkai township was exposed as a major raw opium producing area. From September 1996, the U.S. Department of State funded $530,000 and established agricultural cooperatives in 25 villages in Kutkai township to crack down on the illegal drugs trade by promoting the growth of buckwheat, wheat, potatoes and other vegetables. Large quantities of opium were confiscated from the houses of villagers in the area in the summer of 1999. On July 31-August 1, 2003, a refinery was raided in Kutkai Township between the villages of Namhsaungkye and Nampyin revealing 62.452 kilos of heroin, 36.4 kilos of raw opium, 661.5 litres of lysol, 135 kilos of ether, 2,844 litres of chloroform, 202.5 litres of hydrochloric acid, 972 litres of acetic anhydrite, 2,975 kilos of ammonium chloride, 500 kilos of sodium carbonate, 500 grams of potassium chloride and 3.6 kilos of sodium, various weapons and 13 implements used in the refining of narcotic drugs.

As one of the Byzantine Empire's three dedicated naval themes (Greek: ), it served chiefly to provide ships and troops for the Byzantine navy. Origins The dates of establishment and the territorial reach of the various Byzantine naval commands in the 7th‚Äì9th centuries are mostly unclear. After the unitary navy of the Karabisianoi was split up in the early 8th century, regional naval commands were established, of which the naval theme of the Cibyrrhaeots is the first known and most important. The 10th-century Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913‚Äì959) records that \\"at the time the Empire was divided into themes\\", Samos became the seat of the \\"theme of the sailors\\" (); the meaning of this passage is unclear. The historian Warren Treadgold interprets this to mean that Samos was the first seat of the Karabisianoi fleet, until their disbandment . Alternatively, it could imply a command that formed part of the Karabisianoi and was abolished with them, or a later, short-lived successor, perhaps even identical with the Cibyrrhaeots. The existence of a \\"strategos of Samos\\" in the 8th century is attested through a surviving seal of a strategos named Theodore. In the late 8th century, the southern Aegean appears to have come under the jurisdiction of the \\"droungarios of the Dodekanesos\\",\\"Dodekanesos\\" in middle Byzantine times was a term used for the Cyclades, not to be confused with the modern Dodecanese. . whom some scholars (following H√©l√®ne Ahrweiler) identify with the post of \\"droungarios of Kos\\" and the later \\"droungarios of the Gulf (Kolpos)\\", listed in the mid-9th century Taktikon Uspensky. This command then, or at least the eastern part of it, apparently evolved into the theme of Samos. History Seal of Constantine Argyropoulos, magistros and strategos of Samos The theme of Samos, with its governing strategos, is first documented in Philotheos's Kletorologion of 899. It included the islands of the eastern Aegean, as well as the western coast of Asia Minor between Adramyttion and Ephesos (also known as Theologos at the time). The seat of the theme was at Smyrna, while subordinate tourmarchai (vice-admirals) had their seats at Adramyttion and Ephesos. In 911, the forces of the naval theme of Samos are recorded as being 3,980 oarsmen and 600 marines, with a fleet of 22 warships. The mainland portion of the theme, however, is also explicitly mentioned as belonging to the Thracesian Theme, which had a special tourmarches in charge of defending the coast. This, along with a lack of mention of civil officials attached to the naval theme, most probably reflects a division of tasks: the strategos of Samos and his officials were responsible for furnishing the ships and crews of the thematic fleet as well as defending the islands, while the mainland coast, with its cities and population, came under the control of the Thracesian strategos and his officials, who were responsible for their taxation and defence. Samos seems to have remained a purely military formation until the late 11th century, when its fleet was disbanded and it was converted into a regular theme with its own civil officials.

The Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen commissioned the piece for a gala concert celebrating a visit from the Faroe Islands. The composer conducted the premiere on 27 November 1927. Background In a letter to his wife dated 4 January 1927, Nielsen wrote: \\"Now over the next 8-10 days I have to write an overture to mark a big Faroese gala at the Royal Theatre supported by the State... I will use motifs from the Faroese ballads, and I can easily manage that, and it will give me some pleasure as it is good that we do something for them.\\" In fact the visit was postponed until November owing to an influenza epidemic.Niels Bo Foltmann, \\"Rhapsodic Overture: A Fantasy Voyage to the Faroe Islands\\", Orchestral Works 2, Carl Nielsen Edition , Royal Danish Library. Retrieved 8 November 2010. There were only two performances of the work during Nielsen's lifetime, both of them in connection with the Faroese celebrations. The first was at the Royal Theatre on 27 November 1927, the second at a concert in Copenhagen City Hall with the Copenhagen Philharmonic Orchestra. Music A couple of days before the gala performance on 27 November 1927, a long interview with Nielsen was published in Politiken where the composer had the opportunity to comment on his music. \\"After all it‚Äôs just an occasional work, an example of workmanship if you like... but I have personally been happy working with it and I think it has come to sound very good. I have used many of the Faroese melodies in it, but the introduction and ending are free composition.\\" He then goes on to describe the voyage: \\"I begin by describing the sea, as you feel it during the crossing ‚Äì the monotonous mighty sea. It is quiet, but I think that it is precisely when the sea is calm that you most strongly sense its terrible depth... its depth and endlessness at the same time. During the voyage we suddenly hear a bird cry that makes us think that we are near land. Of course generally speaking I am no great lover of programme music, but this time I think that the occasion called for a programme for the journey... some people on board now seem to see land, they get enthusiastic, a fanfare tells you, but the mist obscures the view, and it quietens down again. Then new bird cries rise up, and the land looms ahead. The music grows in volume and seriousness and breaks into a Faroese melody; on the shore many people are waiting to welcome us, and we hear them shouting and stamping. With no explanatory transition I now place the traveller in the midst of a feast, with singing and dancing. I depict this feast in powerful music where the ballad motifs play a role ‚Äì and the depiction of the feast is interrupted by a Faroese folk tune. It calms down the music for a moment, creates a mood of gentleness amidst the dancing. But again the feast livens up to dancing and merriment, until the end ‚Äì then it all subsides in one long note, a very low clarinet note that quietly fades away...\\" When asked how he became acquainted with Faroese tunes, Nielsen explained: \\"They have interested me for many years. I knew Hjalmar Thuren, who collected many of them out there, getting people to sing them for him, and I have studied Dr. Gr√ºner- Nielsen's large collection. Many of the songs are very beautiful, and they have a wealth of songs on the Faroe Islands. They are often closely related to the Danish ones, but with small variations ‚Äì just as there are variants of the old texts that Svend Grundtvig collected. But some of the melodies also have their own tone. It‚Äôs borne up by a certain quiet seriousness. It reminds me of people who go around quietly and yet have a strong effect on others because behind the calm you sense solid substance. You can‚Äôt call Faroese song melancholy ‚Äì rather, it gives the impression of a mind that is resigned to the will of Fate. It is these melodies that I have had as material... they have set the tone for my overture. I did not create so much of it myself through any spiritual experience, and yet the work has filled me with pleasure. I have tried to offer some of the same spirit that the painter or sculptor creates when he places his abilities at the service of applied art.\\" The programme for the concert listed the following subtitles for the work: *The Calm Sea *The Land on Arrival *Dancing and Singing *Farewell *Calm at Sea References Category:Compositions by Carl Nielsen Category:Incidental music Category:1927 compositions ","title":"An Imaginary Trip to the Faroe Islands"},{"id":"29526177","text":"Caloptilia eurythiota is a moth of the family Gracillariidae.

See Port Walcott for the associated iron ore loading port. Overview Cape Lambert is one of the sea ports for exporting iron ore from Rio Tinto's mining operations in the Pilbara. (The other port is Dampier.) Ore is carried to the two ports on the Hamersley & Robe River railway. Cape Lambert is East of Karratha (59 km), West of Point Samson (11 km) and Port Hedland (220 km) and due North of Wickham (10 km), Roebourne (22 km) and Millstream National Park (108 km). Point Samson Beach Linking the facility at Cape Lambert with the small holiday town of Point Samson is a long white beach. The flawless white beach stretches for over 1 km and is the perfect vantage point to observe queued iron ore bulk tankers waiting to dock, turtles nesting in the sand, or whales migrating just off the cape. Sunsets at the beach can be dramatically red. Boat Beach Boat Beach which is a very popular local swimming and fishing spot situated immediately west of the Port rail and processing facilities, but easiest accessed off Walcott Drive not far from the town of Wickham.

The port at Cape Lambert was opened in 1972 and is operated by Pilbara Iron on behalf of Rio Tinto. Employees at the Cape Lambert facilities live in the nearby town of Wickham or a temporary construction camp between the Port and the Point Samson Road. The port has an annual capacity to handle 80 million tonnes of iron ore. In comparison, the port of Dampier can handle 140 million tonnes annually.

It was an implementation of the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon design. Robert Hillberg, the designer, envisioned a weapon that was cheap to manufacture, easy to use, and provided a significant chance of being effective in the hands of someone who had never handled a firearm before. Pistols and submachine guns were eliminated from consideration due to the training required to use them effectively. The shotgun was chosen because it provided a very high volume of fire with a high hit probability. The mechanism used was that of a derringer, with four fixed barrels. The linear hammer and its integral firing pin rotated within a fixed breechblock behind these barrels. The lock action was driven by a central coil spring around the hammer rotation axis, cocked by the ratchet mechanism that rotated the hammer after each shot. This ratchet mechanism, although only visible when the hammer was stripped and removed, bore some relation to the cylinder of the Webley-Fosbery self-loading revolver or even some retractable ballpoint pens. A similar rotating hammer in a 4-barrel breech was later used by Hillberg in the COP .357 Derringer. Reloading was in the usual derringer fashion, by the barrels tipping forward on a hinge ahead of the breech block. Both Winchester and Colt built prototypes, although the Colt Defender eight-shot design came late in the Vietnam War and was adapted for the civilian law enforcement market. No known samples were ever produced for military use.

Nys√§ter, or V√§rmlands Nys√§ter, is a village in V√§rmland County, Sweden, located north of the city of S√§ffle. It belongs to Gillberga Parish. The first inhabits came to the place now called Nys√§ter 2000-1500 years ago. The sand ridge is a place where you can see traces of the prehistoric age and also Kungsh√∂jden and the market-shop. Kungsh√∂jden is a burial mound from 400-500 years ago. The market-shop is from 1750. In Nys√§ter you can find the small grocery store, ICA Vikinghallen and a Viking Center. Every year in August, there's a fair held in Nys√§ter, which brings many people to the small village. In 2010, Nys√§ter had 149 inhabitants. Despite that, there are both a school and a preschool there.:sv:Nys√§ter  History  In 1678 Nys√§ter village was burned down to the ground, and it was a big catastrophe for the inhabits in Nys√§ter, since they lost everything they had. The people in the village were in church when the fire begun. When they came home the whole village had been destroyed by the fire. The inhabits in Nys√§ter began to build up the village again after the fire. But it's not known if they built up the village on the same place that were before the fire. Gillberga Church In 1700 the village consisted of seven farms. After that the it begun to expand and more farms had begun to be built built or bought as the market in Nys√§ter expanded. Nys√§ters Cottage was build in the middle of the 1800s. The quire, who owned the whole village, came to live there. This was the start of a new era of growth and modernization. Not long after, a dairy and tannery was built, as well as a bank office was constructed. Sea transports were modernized due to the industrialization and had ships embarked and disembarked on a regular basis . Gillberga was an independent county in V√§rmland from 1862 to 1970. Every inhabitant in Gillberga parish was invited to the first county meeting, but only landowners and people who had enough income had right to vote. Over the years changes were made, and finally all inhabitants of age had the right to vote.  Geography  Gilberga parish is situated in an area that the geologists called Gillberga Sk√•len, because it has the shape of a bowl. There are lots of various types of rocks in the area. Grey-stone, granite and red gneiss are some of the rocks that can be found. The parish consisted long ago of high mountains and valleys, and it still does even though they are not that characteristic. The ground in the area has mainly been hardened due to processes in Prehistoric Times. The farmland consists mostly of clayey soils because for many thousand years the ocean covered what now is Gilberga parish. The Ice Age affected the area, the ground was elevated from the ocean level and clay was left in this place as the ocean withdrew. An interesting finding from the Ice age are the big sand hill in Nys√§ter and Hasslerud. By the shore of the Gillberga lake, the water has been swirled the sand and done so that the rocks are round cut. Gillberga Lake (2019)  Gilberga lake  Gillberga lake is a 200 hectare nature reserve. 1986 was the year as it became a nature reserve, a reason for that was the cultural and historical value and it is uniqueness in the county of V√§rmland. The reserve is located south of Gilberga church. In March and the beginning of April are the bird skylark there. Later the will be many other birds there.

Membership to the organization is, without a mandatory membership fee, open to UN-member states and intergovernmental organizations. History =Background= The process of creating an international organization focusing on anti-corruption education dates to 2005, when an Interpol working group began discussing such an endeavor. At Interpol's 75th general assembly in September 2006, member states voted unanimously in favor of forming an academy \\"aimed at tackling the problem of corruption within public services worldwide.\\" On 9 October 2006, following the assembly, Austrian Minister of the Interior Liese Prokop, Interpol secretary-general Ronald Noble and B√ºro f√ºr Interne Angelegenheiten (BIA) director Martin Kreutner formally announced the intention to create the IACA in the Austrian capital Vienna. In July 2007, Noble and Austria's Minister of the Interior, G√ºnther Platter, met in Vienna and signed an agreement for the establishment of the IACA in Laxenburg. The agreement was approved at Interpol's 76th general assembly in November 2007. In October 2008, Noble and United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) executive director Antonio Maria Costa signed a partnership agreement to help the IACA \\"enable more effective implementation\\" of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, which went into effect in December 2005. =Launch= IACA was launched on September 2, 2010 by the UNODC, Interpol, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the Republic of Austria. On March 8, 2011, IACA gained the status of an international organization and was registered as such with the United Nations. Display of flags of IACA's membership at its Laxenburg headquarters Since the accession of Kenya to the IACA in August 2020, the organisation has 80 members, including four intergovernmental organizations and 76 UN member states. Organization =Educational program= IACA is recognized as an institution for post- graduate education by the Austrian ministry of Science, Research and Economy and is subsequently entitled to offer post-graduate education under the framework of the Bologna process. It started its first Masters program in February 2013; at that time the coursework was run in seven twelve-day blocks, taken over two years. IACA offers two Masters programs. IACA's approach towards its Masters programs is described as holistic by the OSCE and the research portal of the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance. El Mundo reported that the studies are designed to be interdisciplinary and have a practical dimension. In 2018 there were approximately 1,600 alumni. =Finances= The Austrian news magazine, News, reported that IACA posted a budget of ‚Ç¨12.98 million for the 2014 financial year and a budget of ‚Ç¨13.24 million for 2015; while noting that the actual revenues for 2013 were ‚Ç¨2.3 million and expenditures were around ‚Ç¨2.1 million. IACA told the News that the higher numbers were based on their fund-raising goals. At the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 IACA underwent a turnover in staff. During IACA's seventh Assembly of Parties in September 2018, Eduardo Vetere, the chairman of IACA's Board of Governors, referred to an external auditor's report which concluded that IACA was in danger of insolvency. A working group was set up in December 2018 to restructure the income situation and generate membership contributions. The Austrian government made a contribution of ‚Ç¨544,000 in December 2018. =Leadership= IACA is headed by its dean, who also serves as the executive secretary of the organization. Martin Kreutner served from IACA's creation in March 2011 to the end of January 2019 as IACA's first dean. The position remained vacant and was taken over by Christiane Pohn-Hufnagel, the organizations Chief of Staff and Head of General Services, in an acting capacity. On March 2, 2020 Thomas Stelzer took office as IACA's new dean and executive secretary. His initial term is limited to four years and might be extended. Relationships with member countries IACA's relations with Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation were criticized after IACA held its 2014 annual conference in Baku at the time of a governmental crackdown on non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and anti-corruption activists. According to Correctiv, one of the students at IACA was an Azerbaijani public prosecutor, who worked for the investigating authority that was prosecuting the Azerbaijani anti-corruption activist and journalist Khadija Ismayilova. Another international controversy that was discussed within IACA occurred in 2012, when tensions arose as the representative of Syria stressed that, notwithstanding the election of the Israeli Mordechai Kremnitzer to IACA's board of governors, his government did not accept Israel's right of existence. The comment was rebuked by the Israeli ambassador in a fashion that was described as breaching the diplomatic protocol.

Life Fellowes was the youngest of the five sons of William Fellowes, physician-extraordinary to the Prince Regent ‚Äì one of Thomas's brothers was the physician Sir James Fellowes and James's son was the later Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Hounsom Butler Fellowes. Serving for a while on ships of the East India Company, Thomas moved to the Royal Navy in 1797 as the master's mate on HMS Royal George. He then moved to HMS Diana and then to other ships before the Peace of Amiens in 1802. When the war broke out again he was deployed to the East Indies under Sir Edward Pellew, rising to lieutenant in 1807 and spending time in the West Indies in HMS Northumberland, Sir Alexander Cochrane's flagship. His first command was the brig HMS Swinger in 1808 as lieutenant-commander, with which he fought at the capture of the island of Deseada. This was followed on 13 November 1808 by command of the brig Unique, from which (on 21 May 1809) he made a landing at Basseterre on Guadeloupe, spiking an enemy battery's guns despite being opposed by a large French regular force ‚Äì he was the only unwounded man to return from the raid. After Unique was used as a fireship, Fellowes was promoted to commander on 16 September 1809 and put in charge of the gunboats at Cadiz from August 1810 to June 1811, during which time he was promoted to post rank in March 1811. His next command came on 11 February 1812, with the 20-gun in the West Indies, with which he fought against privateers until November 1814 and the end of the Napoleonic Wars. He was made a Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1815 and a knight of the Spanish Order of Charles III on 22 February 1822, the latter for his command at Cadiz. His next command, however, only came fifteen years after the peace, with the 42 gun HMS Dartmouth, which he commanded from 21 February 1827 to 16 March 1830 in the Mediterranean ‚Äì there his attempt to remove a Turkish fireship caused the battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827. His actions in that command gained him the cross of the L√©gion d'honneur, the Order of St Anne 2nd class, the cross of the Order of the Redeemer, a British knighthood, a presentation sword from William, Duke of Clarence, Lord High Admiral, and a DCL from the University of Oxford. His final seaborne commands were HMS Pembroke on the Lisbon station (1836‚Äì1837) and HMS Vanguard in the Mediterranean (1837‚Äì1840). He then returned to the United Kingdom to superintend Plymouth's victualling yard and hospital (1843‚Äì1846). He was promoted to rear admiral on 26 July 1847 and died in 1853. Along with Sir William Abdy, 7th Baronet, Fellowes co-owned three sugar plantations in Antigua and St Vincent. In the 1830s, when the British government emancipated the slaves, Fellowes was compensated to the tune of about ¬£13,000 for the liberation of over 300 slaves.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/40828 Marriage and issue *on 9 November 1813, Katherine Mary (? ‚Äì October 1817), eldest daughter of Sir William Abdy, 6th Baronet *on 24 August 1819, to Mary Anne Catharine, only child of Colonel Isaac Humphreys, Bengal Artillery, military secretary to the Bengal government; their children included: Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Fellowes (1823‚Äì1886), who died while commanding the channel squadron.

Geography The glacier flows toward the coast of East Antarctica, pushing through a channel between the Lazarev Mountains and the north-western tip of the Wilson terrain. Constrained by surrounding rocks, the river of ice holds together. But stresses resulting from the glacier's movement make deep crevasses, or cracks, in the ice. After passing through the channel, the glacier has room to spread out as it floats on the ocean. The expanded area and the jostling of ocean waves prompts the ice to break apart, which it often does along existing crevasses. Matusevich Glacier does not drain a significant amount of ice off of the Antarctic continent, so the glacier's advances and retreats lack global significance. Like other Antarctic glaciers, however, Matusevich helps glaciologists form a larger picture of Antarctica's glacial health and ice sheet volume. Discovery and naming The region was photographed by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 1946‚Äì47, the Soviet Antarctic Expedition, 1957‚Äì58, and the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions, 1959 and 1962. It was named by the Soviet expedition after N.N. Matusevich, a Soviet hydrographer and surveyor. Matusevich Glacier Tongue Matusevich Glacier Tongue, located at , is a glacier tongue about 18 nautical miles (33 km) long which is the broad seaward extension of the Matusevich Glacier. The Magga Dan, vessel of the ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) led by Phillip Law, sailed around the tongue, February 21, 1959, at which time the seaward extremity was determined to be floating in 300 fathoms of ocean.

Despite hailing from Glasgow, he started his career with Broxburn, near Edinburgh, and later played for Armadale in the Scottish Football League Second Division. He returned to his birthplace to join Shawfield, before re- entering League football with East Stirlingshire in August 1921. After a trial spell with St Johnstone, Brown found himself with Brechin City in the Scottish Third Division. In 1925, he was signed by First Division outfit Morton, and in a single season with the club he netted 7 goals in 21 first-team appearances. Following Morton's relegation from the top-flight in 1926, Brown left the club and moved to England in the hope of furthering his professional career. He had a trial spell with Burnley in January 1927 but was not offered a contract, and the following month he began a loan spell at nearby Nelson. Due to the absence of Buchanan Sharp, who was suffering with influenza, Brown made his debut for Nelson in the Football League Third Division North match against Bradford Park Avenue on 12 February 1927.

Pieczenik (; born December 7, 1943) is Cuban-born American writer, publisher, psychiatrist, and former United States Department of State official. Early life Pieczenik was born in Havana, Cuba of Jewish parents from Russia and Poland and was raised in France. His father, a doctor from Dombrovicz who studied and worked in Toulouse, France, fled Poland before World War II. His mother, a Russian Jew from Bia≈Çystok, Poland, fled Europe after many of her family members were killed. The couple met in Portugal, where both had fled ahead of the Nazi invaders. Pieczenik was born in Cuba in 1943. After living in Toulouse for six years, Pieczenik's family migrated to the United States, where they settled in the Harlem area of New York City, New York. Steve Pieczenik was 8 years old when his parents received their entry visa to the United States. Pieczenik is fluent in five languages, including Russian, Spanish and French.  Education  Pieczenik claims in his autobiography to have received a full scholarship to Cornell University at the age of 16. According to Pieczenik, he received a BA degree in Pre-Medicine and Psychology from Cornell in 1964, and later received his M.D. from Cornell University Medical College. He attained his PhD in international relations from MIT while studying at Harvard Medical School. Pieczenik claims to be the first psychiatrist ever to receive a PhD focusing on international relations. While performing his psychiatry residency at Harvard, he was awarded the Harry E. Solomon award for his paper titled: \\"The hierarchy of ego-defense mechanisms in foreign policy decision making\\". An article written by Pieczenik, \\"Psychological dimensions of international dependency\\", appears in the American Journal of Psychiatry, Vol 132(4), Apr 1975, 428‚Äì431. Pieczenik educational history has been disputed by journalists, who claim that he falsely inflated or misled his credentials.  Civil service career  Pieczenik was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance and James Baker. He served the presidential administrations of Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush in the capacity of deputy assistant secretary. In 1974, Pieczenik joined the United States Department of State as a consultant to help in the restructuring of its Office for the Prevention of Terrorism. In 1976, Pieczenik was made Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for management. At the Department of State, he served as a \\"specialist on hostage taking\\". He has been credited with devising successful negotiating strategies and tactics used in several high-profile hostage situations, including the 1976 TWA Flight 355 hostage situation and the 1977 kidnapping of the son of Cyprus' president. Pieczenik was often utilized as a press source for early information on the mental state of the hostages involved in the Iran hostage crisis after they were freed. He worked \\"side by side\\" with Police Chief Maurice J. Cullinane in the Washington, D.C. command center of Mayor Walter Washington during the 1977 Hanafi Siege. In 1978 Pieczenik was a special envoy for President Jimmy Carter to Italy to assist in the search for Italy's Prime Minister Aldo Moro. Pieczenik, as an international crisis manager and hostage negotiator in the State Department, was sent to Italy on March 16, 1978, the day that Moro was kidnapped, and was involved in the negotiations for the release of Moro. He was part of a \\"crisis committee\\" headed by Francesco Cossiga, the interior minister. Moro was held for 54 days, Pieczenik said the committee was jolted into action by the fear that Moro would reveal state secrets in an attempt to free himself. Moro's widow, Eleonora, later said Henry Kissinger had warned her husband against his strategy of Historic Compromise (Italian: Compromesso storico). \\"You will pay dearly for it,\\" he is alleged to have said. A false statement, attributed to the Red Brigades, was leaked saying that Moro was dead. Pieczenick claimed that this had a dual purpose; to prepare the Italian public for the worst, and to let the Red Brigades know that the state would not negotiate for Moro, and considered him already dead. Moro was shot and placed in the back of a car in central Rome, midway between the headquarters of the Communist Party and the Christian Democrats. In a documentary Cossiga admitted the committee had taken the decision to release the false statement. Pieczenik said that Moro had been \\"sacrificed\\" for the \\"stability\\" of Italy. On September 17, 1978 the Camp David Accords were signed. Pieczenik claims to have been present at secret Camp David negotiations leading up to the signing of the Accords, working out strategy and tactics based on psychopolitical dynamics. In 1979, he resigned as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State over the handling of the Iranian hostage crisis.  Post-civil service career  In the early 1980s, Pieczenik wrote an article for The Washington Post in which he claimed to have heard a senior U.S. official in the Department of State Operations Center give permission for the attack that led to the death of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1979. Pieczenik got to know Syrian President Hafez al-Assad well during his 20 years in the Department of State. In 1982, Pieczenik was mentioned in an article in The New York Times as \\"a psychiatrist who has treated C.I.A. employees\\". In 2001, Pieczenik operated as chief executive officer of Strategic Intelligence Associates, a consulting firm. Pieczenik has been affiliated in a professional capacity as a psychiatrist with the National Institute of Mental Health. Pieczenik has consulted with the United States Institute of Peace and the RAND Corporation.

Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ_CYS-KMjM As recently as October 6, 2012, Pieczenik was listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). According to Internet Archive, his name was removed from the CFR roster sometime between October 6 and November 18, 2012. Publicly, Pieczenik no longer appears as a member of the CFR. Pieczenik has lectured at the National Defense University.  Writing ventures  Pieczenik has made a number of ventures into fiction, as an author and as a business partner of Tom Clancy for several series of novels. For example he is a co-author of the book \\"Divide and Conquer\\" He studied medicine and writing, beginning with drama and poetry. But eventually \\"I turned to fiction because it allows me to address reality as it is or could be.\\" Pieczenik received a listed credit as co-creator for both Tom Clancy's Op-Center and Tom Clancy's Net Force, two best-selling series of novels, as a result of a business relationship with Tom Clancy. He was not directly involved in writing books in these series, but \\"assembled a team\\" including the ghost-writer who did author the novels, and someone to handle the \\"packaging\\" of the novels. The Op-Center series alone had earned more than 28 million dollars in net profit for the partnership by 2003. He's also credited under the pseudonym Alexander Court for writing the novels Active Measures (2001), and Active Pursuit (2002). Pieczenik has had at least two articles published in the American Intelligence Journal, a peer- reviewed journal published by the National Military Intelligence Association. In September 2010, John Neustadt was recognized by Elsevier as being one of the Top Ten Cited Authors in 2007 and 2008 for his article, \\"Mitochondrial dysfunction and molecular pathways of disease.\\" This article was co-authored with Pieczenik.  Controversies  In 1992, Pieczenik told Newsday that in his professional opinion, President [George H. W.] Bush was \\"clinically depressed.\\" As a result, he was brought up on an ethics charge before the American Psychiatric Association and reprimanded. He subsequently quit the APA. The role he played in the negotiations to bring about the release of Aldo Moro, an Italian politician kidnapped by the Red Brigades, is fraught with controversy. = Alex Jones = Pieczenik has made several appearances on InfoWars, the flagship radio program of Alex Jones, where he has promoted various opinions; Pieczenik repeatedly claimed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a \\"false flag\\" operation and that the September 11 attacks were conducted by CIA agents. He has also repeatedly expressed a desire to see Melania Trump become President of the United States, and has repeated his opinion.

It grows to a mere 50 cm ( ft) high, with crowded small silvery leaves and insignificant pink or cream flowers. It occurs only in southwestern Australia, where it is found in Fitzgerald River National Park on the south coast. Description Adenanthos dobagii grows as a small open shrub up to half a metre ( ft) high. The leaves, which are usually crowded together at the ends of branches, are from long, and deeply lobed into laciniae. They always have three primary segments, with the outer two segments usually further dividing into two, resulting in five laciniae. They appear silvery in colour, but this is due to a dense covering of hairs. Flowers occur in groups of three, borne at the ends of branches. They are pale pink or cream, and only about long, making them the smallest flowers in the genus. Overall the species is similar in appearance to A. flavidiflorus, but differs in having smaller flowers and lacking a lignotuber. Taxonomy Specimens of this species were collected in 1972 and 1973 by Irish botanist Ernest Charles Nelson, from the vicinity of Quoin Head in the Fitzgerald River National Park on the south coast of Western Australia. Nelson published the species in 1978, as part of a comprehensive taxonomic revision of the genus. He chose the specific epithet dobagii from the initials of the Department of Biogeography and Geomorphology, the Australian National University department at which Nelson had performed the work underpinning the publication. Nelson followed George Bentham in dividing Adenanthos into two sections, placing A. dobagii into A. sect. Adenanthos because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle. He further divided the section into two subsections, with A. dobagii placed into A. subsect. Anaclastos for reasons including the length of its perianth. However Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. The placement of A. dobagii in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens (2 subspecies) :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens (2 subspecies) :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus (2 subspecies) :::A. √ó cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum (2 subspecies) :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus Distribution and habitat Adenanthos dobagii is certainly endemic to Western Australia, and appears to be restricted to a small area in the Fitzgerald River National Park, on the south coast of the state. A population numbering in the thousands ranges over about between Telegraph Track and Quoin Head; and there are also scattered plants along the coast between Quoin Head and Marshes Beach. In total there are seven populations comprising around 125000 plants. It occurs in sandy soil in low- lying areas at the foot of hills. It has been reported growing in sand-heath, open mallee, and in a low mixed shrubland of Allocasuarina humilis (Dwarf Sheoak), Isopogon trilobus (Three-lobed Conebush) and Melaleuca pulchella (Clawflower) over sedges. Conservation Because of its very limited range, it was gazetted as rare in 1980, affording it legislative protection under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. It was subsequently listed as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, and this listing was retained when the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 came into force. It is said to have been \\"rediscovered\\" in 1998. The main threat to the species is bushfire. Other potential threats include damage during track maintenance, and dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, to which highly susceptible. Cultivation It is unknown in cultivation, and has little to offer as an ornamental plant. It has been suggested that it would do best in a built-up rockery.

Youngman (December 17, 1841 ‚Äì September 29, 1910) was an American missionary who established the Ihaien leprosy hospital in Tokyo, Japan, in 1894. It was active from 1894 until 1942. History Kate M. Youngman was born in Kingston, New York, on December 17, 1841. Her mother died when she was 14 and her father died when she was 17. Her fianc√© died in the American Civil War when she was 21. She was dispatched to Japan as a missionary in 1873 by the American Presbyterian Church, when the freedom of faith was ascertained in Japan. She worked as a teacher and missionary at Shin-ei Girls' School. In 1877, she established the \\"Kohzensha\\", a Christian organization which was dedicated to the propagation of Christianity, education, and charity. In 1892, Youngman found that a Christian developed leprosy and escaped from a Catholic leprosy hospital because of difference of religion. Youngman proposed that another facility be made for leprosy patients to live without fear of spiritual conflict, but The Presbyterian Church rejected her proposal for funding the project. However, in 1894, the Mission to Lepers began funding her organization. In October 1894, Ihaien was started on 4,950 square meters of land at Meguro, Tokyo. Kitasato Shibasabur≈ç proposed to send doctors and supplies if Ihaien would change to a hospital which was accomplished in 1899. Youngman herself was reluctant to the hospitalization of the organization, and lost interest in the project. In 1910, she left the Kohzensha and died on September 29, 1910 after 12 days in bed. Her monument is in Somei, Tokyo. Ihaien Hospital The original idea of the Ihaien was to house people with leprosy and let them live with spiritual comfort. Kitasato Shibasaburo, a famous doctor at the Institute of Infectious Diseases belonging to the Interior Ministry, sent a doctor and also patients in 1899 when it was changed to a hospital. The hospital's patients numbered about 50 and were also quite poor. In addition to them, the government sent patients called Seikan (government patients) which sometimes led to strife between them and the already established patients.: The Ihaien and the Ihaien and \\"Seikan\\", Hirai Y: National Hansen's Disease Museum Research Bulletin No.1 p30-43, 2010 The Ihaien Hospital was closed in 1942 because of financial difficulties, and 55 patients were transferred to Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium.History of leprosy in Japan, p33.

The narrative revolves around a successful artist, and involves a fictional murder of Houellebecq. It was published on 4 September 2010 by Flammarion and received the Prix Goncourt, the most prestigious French literary prize, in 2010. The title is a reference to the map‚Äìterritory relation. The Map and the Territory is Michel Houellebecq's fifth novel. It was published five years after his prior novel, The Possibility of an Island. The Map and the Territory was among the most eagerly awaited and discussed novels of the 2010 literary season in France. The first printing was for copies, as announced by the publisher. An English translation by Gavin Bowd was published in January 2012. The Map and the Territory received the Prix Goncourt on 8 November 2010 on the first ballot with seven votes against two for Apocalypse b√©b√© by Virginie Despentes.  Synopsis  The novel tells the story of the life and art of Jed Martin, a fictional French artist who becomes famous by photographing Michelin maps and painting scenes about professional activities. His father is slowly entering old age. Jed falls for a beautiful Russian executive from Michelin but the relationship ends when she returns to Russia. Jed becomes extraordinarily successful after a new series of paintings and therefore suddenly rich as the most prominent artist in France around the year 2010. He meets Michel Houellebecq in Ireland in order to ask him to write the text for the catalog of one of his exhibitions, and in exchange offers to paint the writer's portrait. A few months later Houellebecq is brutally murdered and Jed Martin gets involved in the case. Themes In a televised interview given after the Goncourt award, Houellebecq declared that the main themes of the novel were \\"aging, the relationship between father and son and the representation of reality through art\\".France 2 evening news - 8 November 2010 As a tongue-in-cheek gimmick, the novel also portrays a few celebrities from French literature and the French media, including Houellebecq himself, Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder, Julien Lepers, and Jean-Pierre Pernaut.  Accusations of plagiarism  The novel incorporates a few abstracts from the French edition of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia without mentioning the source, thus not complying with the Creative Commons licence BY-SA.Houellebecq sous licence Creative Commons !, 21 September 2010 Flammarion, his publisher, has clarified the issue and noted that Houellebecq often uses existing texts from available documentation and web sites as raw literary material for his novels; for instance, the description of a police officer is taken from the official web site of the Ministry of the Interior and the text of a touristic leaflet is used for the humorous description of the Carpe Diem hotel. Reaction after Goncourt award Houellebecq had already been a contender for the Goncourt on two previous occasions. It was the first time since 1980 that the award had gone to a novel published by Flammarion. Houellebecq commented right after the award that \\"it is a strange feeling, but I am deeply happy\\" (C'est une sensation bizarre mais je suis profond√©ment heureux).

Her subject material consisted mainly of birds, fruit and flowers painted in a realistic style. Anne came from a family of artists and occasionally butted heads with her contemporaries and faced criticisms due to sexism among artists and painters in her time. Life and Family Roses and Grapes Anne Frances Byrne was born in 1775 in London. Her father was William Byrne, a notable engraver who specialized in landscapes. Anne was the oldest of her three other siblings, all of whom went on to become artists themselves. Mary Byrne Green was the second oldest Byrne sibling, a student of Swiss painting, and specialized in miniature painted landscapes. Letitia Byrne was the youngest Byrne sister, and she became popularized for her etchings and engravings, a craft that William Byrne passed down to his children. Her work also focused mainly on landscapes. John Byrne was the youngest of the four Byrne children, and he too specialized in landscape paintings, although his medium of choice was watercolor. Anne Frances Byrne and her siblings grew up helping in their father's engraving shop and learned artistic techniques from him before going off on their own to study under masters. Anne Frances Byrne died in January 1837 at the age of 62.  The Academy  Anne Frances Byrne started off painting with oil paints early in her career, but later moved on to watercolors as her medium of choice. She exhibited her first piece, a fruit painting, in 1796 at 21 years old. She had a rocky relationship with the academy due to the sexism that was predominant in the art world and in society at the time. This relationship was characterized by Byrne's inability to decide whether or not to continue to be a part of the academy. Byrne became a full member of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1809, withdrew her membership in 1813, rejoined in 1821, and left again in 1834. Harriet Gouldsmith, one of Byrne's contemporaries, wrote that when art of the time was praised, \\"the highest praise bestowed [and] publicly exhibited‚Ä¶ was in great measure retracted when the picture was understood to be the production of a female\\". Although Gouldsmith wrote about her own work, this experience was widespread among females in art at the time. The effect is still noticeable today due to the lack of documentation of Anne Frances Byrne and her contemporaries. The works of women in this time were often less respected simply due to the gender of the artist, and not based upon the merit of the work itself.  Notable works  The following works were exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists and the Royal Watercolour Society. Byrne is noted to have exhibited 77 total works in London exhibitions between 1796 and 1837. * Hollyhock * Roses From Nature * Foxgloves From Nature * Flowers and Grapes * Roses and Grapes * Grapes and Strawberries References ;Attribution Category:1775 births Category:1837 deaths Category:18th-century women artists Category:British women painters Category:English watercolourists Category:Painters from London Category:Women watercolorists ","title":"Anne Frances Byrne"},{"id":"29526893","text":"An engraving by Letitia Byrne and Paul Amsinck Letitia Byrne (1779‚Äì1849) was a British engraver.

She spent her early years from 1921 in the UK, on the Isle of Wight and Epsom, Surrey, where she was encouraged to paint and draw. Ability at acting led her to win a scholarship to RADA in 1934 and parts in several films. She was also a successful photographer and exhibited at the London Salon of Photography. During the Second World War she trained and then worked as a nurse and drove ambulances. She met her future husband who was a junior officer in the Staffordshire regiment. They married in 1941 and subsequently had 4 children. After the war, she and her husband successfully ran a small dairy farm near Liskeard for 20 years. An editor from a London publishing house spotted her work at a display of amateur art in Cornwall and her career as a full-time book illustrator was born. She thus took up illustrating professionally at the age of 48.Cornish Guardian May 9, 2007 Wednesday Her first commission was for a book on magnolias by the Cornish horticulturist Neil Treseder. Another early book, and Marjorie Blamey's first major success, was Wildflowers Of Britain And Ireland, published by Collins in their famous Pocket Guide series. Translated into all European languages, it has sold more than a million copies and was still in print in 2020. She illustrated this book and the text was written by Richard Fitter, probably the most successful author of natural history field guides ever. Fitter's son Alastair contributed the distribution maps. Blamey stated \\"It was a privilege to work with Richard. He was such a vivid writer.\\" She soon became regarded as one of the leading botanical illustrators in the world. Over the years, the Blameys' built up an archive of more than 10,000 paintings of flowers from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean, which were used in publications worldwide. They travelled extensively so she could paint specimens and flowers were also sent to her. These illustrations were all carefully kept in files as well as on the computers of the Blameys and their editor in France. It was part of her husband Philip's role to look after the archive. These paintings, and their related notes and pressed flowers, are now permanently loaned to the University of Plymouth, UK. Other painting are in public and private collections. She was awarded three gold medals by the Royal Horticultural Society and two from the Alpine Garden Society. Blamey's books have received accolades. Cassell's Wild Flowers Of Britain And Northern Europe was selected as Book of the Year by the journal Natural World in 1989. Wild Flowers Of Britain And Ireland was the Book of the Year choice of the Botanical Society of the British Isles in 2003. Another book, Wild Flowers By Colour, was the Editor's Choice of BBC Wildlife Magazine in 2005. She was also a founder member of the charity Plantlife International which concentrates on the conservation of plants. Her books have been translated into at least 10 languages. In 2007, Marjorie Blamey was presented with an MBE at a special ceremony in Fowey. She felt that a trip to Buckingham Palace would be too tiring and was presented with her award for services to illustration by Lady Mary Holborow, the Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall, at the Fowey Hotel. Blamey's daughter, Anne Irons, said of the occasion: \\"We had a brilliant time, it was just wonderful. The whole family is so proud of her. A group of 20 family members, including grandchildren, children and my aunt and uncle, met at the hotel to see Lady Mary hand my mother the award, and read a citation. We then enjoyed a wonderful buffet lunch.\\" Until his death in 2014, Blamey lived with her husband Philip at their home in the Cornish village of St Germans.

The National Moot Court Competition was created in 1947 by Harrison Tweed, then president of the New York City Bar Association, as part of a campaign to recruit younger members to the City Bar in the years following World War II. The first competition was held at the City Bar's building in January 1950. Twelve law school teams debated the legality of \\"rainmaking,\\" or the use by farmers of rainmaking devices to divert water from adjacent land. The program was formatted as a mock appeal, in order to develop the skills of appellate advocacy among law students.\\"Fifty Years of Moot Court.\\" 44th Street Notes. February, 2001. p. 3.

The case consists of two issues drawn from current legal issues that are likely to be considered by the Supreme Court in the near future. The cases are devised and prepared each year by the Young Lawyers Committee of the New York City Bar Association. The National Moot Court Competition begins on the regional level. The United States is divided into fifteen regions, each of which hosts its own regional competition for teams whose law schools fall within their jurisdiction. Each fall, the New York City Bar Association invites all ABA-accredited law schools to field moot court teams of two to three students to participate in regional competitions. The regional winners and runners-up compete in a four-day national competition, as the 30-team field narrows to sixteen, eight, four, two, and ultimately one champion over the course of the competition. The best overall team is presented with the Fulton Haight Award,http://www.actl.com/Content/NavigationMenu/AboutUs/AwardsandCompetitions/NationalMootCourt/default.htm which includes a trophy and a cash reward. The team presenting the best oral arguments is awarded the John W. Davis award, which includes an engraved silver cup. Best individual speaker and runner-up for best individual speaker are both awarded crystal obelisks by the American College of Trial Lawyers. Rules Every participating team is required to submit a brief in advance of the regional and (if they qualify to attend) national competitions. At each competition, teams are required to argue both sides of their appeal. Competitors are judged 40% on written briefs, and 60% on oral presentation.

Several songs from the set did not make it to the albums, as evidenced by audience tapes (ROIO).

In Australia, it would also be released as a double-album in 1983 (Interfusion L45837). This had a gatefold sleeve, with different artwork to the UK release. The first CD edition, in 1989, had a banner on the front reading 'The complete double set', yet dropped 'My Baby Loves Me' and reordered some tracks.

Geis worked in the northeast Kachin and eastern Shan states. The Reverend George J. Geis (c. 1860 ‚Äì October 28, 1936 in Kutkai) was an American Baptist minister and anthropologist of German descent, best known for his missionary work in northeastern Burma. He promoted Christianity amongst the Kachin people, a group which he also studied, collecting general ethnographical data about them.American anthropologist, Volume 10 (1908), American Anthropological Association He arrived in Burma with his wife in 1892, and spent most of the rest of his life there, establishing missions throughout Kachin State and Shan State. Geis is best known for his work in Myitkyina in Kachin State, but in the 1930s he established a mission in Kutkai in Shan State, and at the time of his death in 1936 was working there at the Kachin Bible Training School. Background The American Baptist Eugenio Kincaid visited Burma in 1837. While distributing religious tracts and New Testaments among the villages north of Ava, Kincaid heard of a people named \\"Hka Khyens\\", who were said to believe in a supreme being. He appealed for other missionaries to come to preach to these people, but with no immediate result. However, in 1877 a Christian named Bogalay, from Bassein, began to learn the Jinghpaw language of the Kachins. In 1878 the first overseas Baptist missionary to the Kachins, Albert Lyon, arrived in Bhamo, but died of consumption within a month. Lyon was succeeded by William Henry Roberts, a former soldier who had fought in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. Roberts obtained grudging permission from the Burmese king, Thibaw Min, to build a school and educate the Kachins. Although his wife soon died from Malaria, Roberts was to carry out his mission for 34 years. Ola Hanson, an accomplished linguist of Swedish origin, arrived in Katchinland in 1890 and was to remain for 38 years. He formulated an alphabet for the Jinghpaw language using the Latin script, prepared educational materials in the language as well as a grammar and a Jinghpaw-English dictionary, translated over 200 hymns into Jinghpaw and wrote a book on Katchins: Their Customs and Traditions (1913). Hanson also began work on a Jinghpaw translation of the Bible, translating St. John's Gospel within two years of his arrival. Early Burmese mission Kachin people on the Irrawaddy River When Geis arrived with his wife in 1892 he was the third Baptist missionary in the area. Gies made the difficult journey up the Irrawaddy River in the rainy season, and decided to establish a mission at Myitkyina. This was planned to become the headquarters of the Kachin District and the northern terminus of the Burma Railway. The first buildings of Geis' new mission were built by Christian converts from Bhamo. By 1894 Geis was able to report: \\"During the past year we have had many tokens of the Lord's blessings resting upon our work. Never have more Kachins come to us, and never have they shown a greater interest in the gospel message. Hundreds from the distant north as they came down to Myitkyina on bamboo rafts have for the first time heard the story of Jesus\\". He reported on his extensive travels, growing friendship with the local people, the opening of the first out-station in the mountains and the substantial and convenient site that the government had granted for the new mission compound. However, his report was written in the United States, to which he had been forced to temporarily return due to his wife's severe illness. Karen men, 1922. Karen missionaries assisted Geis Geis's work was not confined to Kachins. He first visited a Lisu village is 1898. He was accompanied by Karen missionaries from the Karen Bible Seminary, he was the only Western missionary to visit the Lisu people in their mountain villages until 1910. In October 1902 he baptized his first Lisu converts, a couple named Ngwa Tar and Gu Na Du, and this was followed by further conversions. In 1906 the first Lisu church was built in Manhkring, a Kachin village located in the valley between Namhkam and Bhamo. The Lisu established their own village beside the Kachins, and became part of the Manhkring Kachin Baptist Church, although they held some services in their own tongue. Growth of local church leaders On December 15, 1901, the first ordination council convened in the Kachin Hills. The candidates were Damau Naw, who had come as a school boy almost twenty years earlier, and after being educated in Rangoon had helped Hanson in his literary work since 1893; Ning Grawng, who had accompanied Geis since 1894 in the Myitkyina area; and Shwe So, a Karen missionary who had served since 1884. By 1911, there were more than 300 communicants of the Kachin Baptist Church, many of whom had been educated at the mission schools. More pastors were ordained in 1911, although foreign missionaries remained the leaders of the church for many years. Ba Thaw (1891‚Äì1967), who had studied for his bachelor of arts in Calcutta, India, worked with Geis from 1911 and quickly became fluent in the Lisu and Kachin languages. He made great efforts to adapt to the Liu lifestyle, but realized that \\"a tribe having no literature cannot be improved much in education, social activities, and also in spiritual aspects.\\" Ba Thaw visited Lisu villages in China, where he collaborated with James O. Fraser of the China Inland Mission to develop a Lisu alphabet using Romanized letters and translate central Christian texts. During a long and fruitful life he was an evangelist, pastor, and teacher. Later mission career Shan people, 1902 Elderly Lahu Woman The Geis's were transferred to the Philippines in 1918, where they worked for four years. In 1922 they were able to return to their \\"first love\\" in Myitkyina, to work again among the hill tribes of Upper Burma. In the late 1920s, George Geis was planning to start a small bible school in the hills east of Bhamo to train additional workers to those who had completed the course at the Burmese Seminary at Insein. This area had shown increasing interest in the Baptist message, not only among the lowland Shan people, but also with the Lahus and Was in mountain villages east of Kengtung. There was a severe shortage of trained teachers. In the 1930s Geis established a mission in Kutkai, and he was working there at the Kachin Bible Training School when he died in his seventies on 28 October 1936.

It succeeded the Vilafrancada (1823) and foreshadowed the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834).  History  On , Infante Miguel, who had been appointed generalissimo of the Portuguese Army, had top civilian and military people of the country arrested and placed in the dungeons of the Castle of S√£o Jorge and the Tower of Bel√©m. Among them stood out the figures of the Quartermaster-General of Police, Baron Rendufe, the Duke of Palmela (then in government in coalition with the Earl of Subserra) and the Viscount of Santa Marta. D. Miguel, who had the support of his mother Carlota Joaquina, considered them guilty of being supporters of liberalism and of his father, D. John VI. Miguel's stated intention was to end what he called \\"pestilential bevy of free-masons\\", a reference to Freemasonry liberal and constitutional. D. Miguel rides into Bemposta, during the events of the Vilafrancada, declaring his support for absolute monarchy Various military corps were then sent to the former Palace of the Inquisition, (where the Teatro Nacional D. Maria II stands today), in Rossio, Lisbon, then installing its headquarters. He then gave orders to besiege the Palace of Bemposta, where the king was accompanied by his English adviser, General William Carr Beresford. The support of John by the diplomatic corps in Portugal was decisive to solve this conflict, in particular the action of the French ambassador Hyde de Neuville. In an attempt at appeasement, one diplomat managed to enter the palace and convince the king to call his son. He achieved, thereby, an agreement that brought back the troops to barracks, but that the detainees remain imprisoned, with the exception of Palmela, who took refuge in a British ship, continuing the political and military instability. In May, diplomats helped D. John VI to take refuge in the British ship Windsor Castle, where he took a series of measures: he deposed D. Miguel from his position as head of the Army, ordered the release of political prisoners and the capture of the supporters of his son, who was summoned to come aboard. Once retained, D. Miguel was forced to embark for France in the frigate Pearl, putting an end to the uprising of miguelistas. The infante was deported from there to Vienna, and Dona Carlota Joaquina, was placed under house arrest in the Palace of Queluz.

Riemer was also founder of the Institute for Automotive and Management (IVA) in Driebergen. The building which used to house Riemer's collection has since been used as a practical center for the IVA. The current owner of the collection is Evert Louwman, the Dutch importer of Lexus, Toyota and Suzuki. In 1969 the collection was moved to Leidschendam to the newly opened National Automobile Museum. In 1981 the museum was moved to a new location on the property of importer Louwman & Parqui in Raamsdonksveer. On 18 April 2003 the name \\"Louwman Collection\\" was adopted. On 3 July 2010 the current museum in The Hague, named Louwman Museum, was opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, whose former home Huis ten Bosch neighbors the museum. Building 100px The Louwman Museum is housed in a building with three floors and over 10,000 m¬≤ of exhibition space, on The Hague's Leidsestraatweg. It was specifically designed as a museum by Driehaus Prize winner Michael Graves, a New Classical American architect. Landscape architect Louis Baljon designed the layout of the park surrounding the building. The hall when entering the museum is modern, focusing more on architecture than on the cars. Evert Louwman is the brother of Jan Louwman, owner of the former Wassenaar Zoo, which closed in 1985. The Zoo used to have a gate with two brick pillars on which two lions stood. This old gate became the entrance to the new museum. Collection The collection is internationally oriented and consists of over 230 automobiles. The museum has the largest collection of cars in the world from 1910 or older.Koningin opende zojuist het Louwman Museum (Dutch) The museum displays a large collection of the current remaining 15 classic cars of the Dutch brand Spyker and the only remaining Eysink (a car-brand from Amersfoort). In the former museum of Raamsdonksveer these Dutch cars used to be displayed at the so-called \\"Trompenburg Square\\" with original fence of the original Spyker-factory, dismantled in 1993. From post-World War II the museum features a car of Winston Churchill, the Aston Martin DB5 used in the James Bond movie Goldfinger, and a Cadillac of Elvis Presley. The former collection of old cars of the Dutch in Rosmalen had been on display since 2005 in Raamsdonksveer, and was moved to the new museum in The Hague. The Autotron has not had an automotive museum since its reorganisation in 2007. In 2009, the museum acquired the 1913 Black Bess, a Bugatti Type 18, owned first by World War I flying ace Roland Garros (1888-1918) and then by British racing driver Ivy Cummings (1900-1971) who gave the car its name. The museum also displays a large collection of paintings and drawings by Frederick Gordon Crosby.

Early years =Planning and founding= The New Jersey system of public higher education immediately prior to 1969 primarily consisted of the designated state university, Rutgers, along with six teachers colleges. The rest of the state's college students sought their educations at a handful of medium-sized private institutions, Princeton University, or an out-of-state college or university. In fact, New Jersey had the highest rate of students leaving the state for their college education. The New Jersey Department of Education produced a report in 1962 recommending a massive expansion and retooling of the public higher education system. Opposition to \\"broad based\\" taxes such as a sales or income tax generally hindered greater efforts by the state to spend further sums on higher education. Richard Hughes ran for governor in 1962 on a platform including among its proposal one to institute a broad-based tax and another to increase the capacity of public higher education. While in office, he succeeded in implementing a sales tax and in passing the Higher Education Act, which, in conjunction with a bond issue approved by the voters, established a Department of Higher Education, a Board of Higher Education, and two new state colleges. State officials rewarded Bergen County legislators for their support of the Higher Education Act with a new college among their constituents. The Board of Trustees for the new state college in northern New Jersey assembled for the first time in February 1969. The Department of Higher Education gave the Board much latitude in carrying out its responsibilities‚Äînamely, hiring a President, selecting a site, and choosing a basic model for their school. The Department did make clear, however, that they favored an innovative, experimental college. In June, the Board selected George Potter, a somewhat controversial administrator at the experimental Grand Valley State University in Michigan with a master's degree from Oxford University. The search for space on which to establish the new campus met a number of challenges, including cost and negative reception in the communities it explored. Eventually the college arranged to purchase the estate of the former Stephen Birch in Mahwah, New Jersey. The Board of Trustees set the opening for the fall of 1971. The architects commissioned produced plans for an L-shaped, glass-walled facility, with connected spaces devoted to particular departments or divisions. The architects also recommended a building systems approach in construction to allow for rapid construction of the wings before the opening of the college. Potter would later regret this choice of construction in for its drawbacks in comfort and aesthetics. Potter took on a number of assistants to help through the planning stages of the college. One of them, Thomas Goss, a colleague of Potter's from Grand Valley State, would exert an outsize influence on the guiding principles and organization of the college. From the beginning, the college made interdisciplinary education a priority and planned to accomplish much of its teaching through seminars, independent study, and experiential learning. Potter and Goss, in effect, charted a middle course between those on the Board of Trustees who favored a largely traditional institution and those on the other hand who favored a far more radical approach. =Admissions and opening= Of 3018 formal applications (2701 freshmen and 717 transfer students), Ramapo College accepted 1855 (1302 freshman, or 57%, and 553 transfer students, or 77%). Of those admitted, 1186 left deposits with the school. Potter had planned for an enrollment of 800 students in the College's first year. Standards for admission set by the school were considerably relaxed during the course of recruitment. More than half of the students came from Bergen county, and of those, roughly two-thirds came from the more affluent northern expanse. Classes began September 22, 1971. At the time of the College's opening, five schools had established themselves. The School of Contemporary Arts combined communication arts and fine arts, the School of Theoretical and Applied Science taught pure and applied sciences in a relatively disciplinary manner, the School of International Studies (later School of Intercultural Studies) focused on international cultures and history, the School of American Studies emphasized literature and American history, and the School of Human Environment encompassed a variety of disciplinary and interdisciplinary programs predominantly in the social sciences. Business and other professional programs did not yet exist as majors. The Institute of Management Science, the College name for the business program housed in the Division of Professional Institutes, had a few faculty teaching a few basic business courses and arranging for student field placements. Among the more distinctive features of Ramapo's undergraduate education, in addition to the persistent interdisciplinary organization, were the tutorial and the core of \\"Scopes and Methods\\" courses. The \\"tutorial\\" was in fact a series of courses, usually two credits, where faculty were to advise and direct the study of their students. The courses were taught in a small format and often covered some academic content. The tutorials, as established by the college, were fairly unstructured, and not all faculty and students were willing or able to create the bond between students and faculty the tutorial intended. The tutorial resulted in diverse and ultimately uneven experiences for students and faculty alike. Scopes and Methods courses were, on the other hand, an introduction to the history of a discipline and its methodology. Many faculty members, though, felt uncomfortable and unprepared with the emphasis teaching their own work and methodology to their students. Restructuring =Academic reorganization and general education revision= The student environment the College had been planned for was changing significantly in the years follow its founding. Student demands for career- oriented programs increased, demands were made for a business school, state funding was cut, and demographic changes resulted in decreasing levels of college-aged students entering institutions of higher education. Financial difficulties, the formation of a business school, and dropping enrollment, the faculty and the Dean of Schools, Teo Halpern, lead a major reorganization of the College's composite schools. The School of American Studies merged with the School of Intercultural Studies to form the School of American and International Studies. One of the three schools that grew out of the School of Human Environment, Metropolitan and Community Studies, reorganized as the School of Social Science and Human Services. The remaining two derivative schools of Human Environment‚ÄîSocial Relations and Environmental Studies‚Äîdissolved, their faculties and programs largely transferred to the School of Social Science and Human Services and the School of Theoretical and Applied Science, respectively. A number of faculty also transferred into the new School of Administration and Business, created by mandate of the Board of Trustees in the wake of sustained controversy and resistance on the part of much of the non-business faculty. In addition, financial difficulties put the college in a position to reconsider the resource-intensive structure of general education and investigate effective new means to give students a liberal arts foundation. Many reports were produced by the faculty making recommendations for changes, some fairly extensive, but the debate was not yet over. Action would come in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s under a new administration. =Potter's resignation and Silverman's initiatives= President Potter seemed unable to reconcile his earlier innovative ideas with changing student demands and a declining fiscal outlook. He did not produce \\"effective\\" results in campaigns to produce private contributions, and his formal long-term planning report was far behind schedule. In addition, his administration was pressured by the Department of Higher Education to execute several faculty cuts which proved very unpopular, and his administration's handling of a subordinate's sexual harassment charges and subsequent lawsuit was inept. Potter's increasing conflicts with the Department of Higher Education lead the Department to put pressure on the Board of Trustees to remove Potter. Board action seemed inevitable, as the Department was implicitly withholding funds for a desperately needed housing project. Potter resigned in February 1984. The Board of Trustees had already made arrangements for the aftermath of Potter's departure. Sidney Silverman, a retired president of Bergen Community College, stepped in as interim president. Silverman took action to improve relations in the college community with the administration. Additionally, Silverman worked to comply with mandates from the Department of Higher Education regarding the College's finances. One of Silverman's proposal was to reduce the credit awarded for most classes from four to three credits. Under a three credit system, students would take more classes and professors would teach more courses on the same pay. The College, in turn, would save money by being able to reduce the number of adjuncts. While the faculty bitterly protested this measure, the Board of Trustees, under pressure from the Department, felt it had no choice but to implement it. Consolidation =General education revisions and presidency of Robert Scott= During the meeting of the Faculty Assembly on April 24, 1985, the faculty voted to approve a new structure in general education, to be phased in over the next several years. The new structure mandated courses to ensure basic skills in freshman and to provide a liberal arts foundation to students on an all- college basis. This was to be accomplished through a series of freshman courses continued with several upper-level courses. While there was much to be left defined and room for revision, this basic structure would guide Ramapo general education for the next twenty-five years. In the spring of 1985, the search committee for the new president ended and the Board of Trustees hired Robert Scott. Scott had been Director of Academic Affairs at the Indiana Commission for Higher Education. Scott would continue to serve the college through the end of the 1990s, presiding over a period of rising tuition, increased competition among colleges for students, and increased autonomy from the state. That being said, under Scott's tenure, Ramapo dramatically expanded its residential facilities, improved academic facilities, and increased student enrollment.\\"Ramapo College Self Study Report\\" (Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Self-Study, December 1999), Ramapo College Archives, 26, 131.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, The church has a dual function. Its nave and tower form an active parish church in the united benefice of Adderley, Ash, Calverhall, Ightfield and Moreton Say, in the deanery of Hodnet, the archdeaconry of Salop, and the diocese of Lichfield. The chancel and transepts are under the care of The Churches Conservation Trust. History The oldest existing part of the present church is the north transept, which was built in 1635‚Äì36 as a burial chapel for the Needham family, the Viscounts Kilmorey of Shavington. The other remaining part of the older church is the tower, built in 1712. The rest of the church was built in 1801 by Richard Baker; it is the only known work by this architect. The chancel was restored in 1822. The interior of the church was divided in about 1970 (the church's own records show this taking place in 1956) for the nave to continue in use as a parish church, and the rest of the church to be preserved by the Churches Conservation Trust. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in yellow-grey sandstone, with some red sandstone in the tower. The roofs are in slate. Its plan is cruciform, with a three-bay nave, a single-bay chancel and transepts, and a west tower. There is an apsidal end to the chancel and the south transept. The tower is in two stages on a plinth. At the corners are Doric pilasters. In the lower stage is a round-headed west doorway. The upper stage contains two-light louvred bell openings. At the top is a moulded cornice, and a plain parapet. The north transept (Kilmorey chapel) has a battlemented parapet with crocketed pinnacles at the corners and on the apex of the gable. It contains a three-light north window, a two-light east window, and a west doorway with four steps leading up to it. The remainder of the church has a plain parapet. Each of the gable ends has a triangular pediment, and on the north and south gables are small gabled finials. The windows have pointed arches and Gothic-style tracery. The windows have cast iron frames and tracery in Perpendicular style. These were made in nearby Coalbrookdale. On the south side of the nave is a pair of doors. =Interior= The church is divided between the nave and the rest of the church. At the entrance to the north transept is an elaborately carved wooden screen dating from about 1637 with Tuscan columns. The chancel screen dates from 1908, includes Corinthian columns, and was probably made by C. Hodgson Fowler. The font is large, square, and Norman in style. Its carving includes rosettes and volutes, and it contains a medieval inscription in Latin, which translates as \\"Here wickedly the first man enjoyed the apple with his wife\\". The wooden pulpit is hexagonal and dates from about 1801. On each side of the tower arch are Commandment boards, and in the vestry, under the tower, is a benefactors board. Above the south doorway are tablets inscribed with the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. There is a fireplace in the west wall of the north transept. The stained glass consists of twelve heraldic panels containing the Needham family arms. The oldest monument is a brass dating from about 1390. Another brass commemorates Sir Robert Needham who died in 1556 and his wife, Agnes who died in 1560. This brass was lifted c. 1970 under the supervision of Peter Scott, Paul Dinsdale, and Brian Egan, members of the Monumental Brass Society, together with local resident Albert Edwards,as it had loosened in its setting and required to be relaid. It was discovered to be a 'palimpsest' - i.e. an earlier brass, probably fourteenth century Flemish in origin, which had been cut up and re-used by engraving the reverse side. There are other memorials to members of the Needham family. External features There are two structures in the churchyard that are listed Grade II. One is a red sandstone sundial dating from the 18th century consisting of a square base, a square shaft, and a cubic block containing a wrought iron gnomon and a globe finial. (The sundial was taken as part of a theft at the church a number of years ago and has never been recovered.) The other is a mounting block dating from 1774 consisting of four sandstone steps.

Dell announced that Fitzgerald had been selected as the school's head football coach following a national search in January 2014. Fitzgerald is the 13th head coach in the 54-year history of the Bobcats football program. In his first season at Frostburg State, the Bobcats posted a record of 4‚Äì6, the best record the program had earned in over five years. The Bobcats improved on both offense and defense as well as special teams leading the Empire 8 conference in fewest turnovers (12) and blocked kicks (6). In his second season at Frostburg State, Fitzgerald's Bobcats improved to a 6‚Äì4 record, including a five-game winning streak.http://www.frostburgsports.com/news/2014/2/7/FB_0207142449.aspx In his third season, in 2016, Fitzgerald's Bobcats went 10‚Äì1. After starting 1‚Äì1, the Bobcats finished the year on a nine-game winning streak. Although Fitzgerald is known for his offense, Frostburg State boasted one of the top defensive units in NCAA Division III football. The Bobcats were fourth in team passing efficiency defense (87.94), fourth in team tackles for loss (10.1), fourth in passing yards allowed (130.3), and 11th in scoring defense (12.8). This was just the second time in the 56-years history of the program that the team had a 10-win season. Frostburg State earned a share of the New Jersey Athletic Conference football championship with the Wesley Wolverines. Frostburg won the 18th Annual Regents Cup Game against the NJAC rival, Salisbury on November 12. The Bobcats beat the 22nd-rank St. John Fisher Cardinals in the ECAC Asa S.

Last fall the Bobcats finished 39th in the country in a total offense (435.9), while in 2016, the Bobcats defense was 9th in total defense as limited opponents to just 240.6 yards per game. In 2018, FSU was second in the country with five blocked punts. Frostburg was ranked near the top of the NCAA statistics in blocked kicks in every year he's been at the helm.http://www.forstburgsports.com/staff-directory/delane- fitzgerald/281 In 2017, the Bobcats captured a program record 11 wins (11-2) that included NCAA Playoff victories over No. 9 Wittenberg (35-7) and No. 10 Washington & Jefferson (46-23). Frostburg captured second in the NJAC standings (8-1), scored a school record 468 points and tied a school record with 13-straight wins that started in the 2016 season.

The idea was first proposed by walkers, and in November 2009 Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) hosted a conference on the subject. In 2010 SNH estimated that around 2,700 km of coastal paths and routes were existence, compared to a total coastline length of 10,192 km. The existing coastal paths were predominantly in the more populous parts of the country, and few coastal paths exist in more remote areas such as Highlands and Islands. It was recognised that a coastal route, along the lines of the Wales Coast Path, would have many positives, but that development of a fully waymarked route would conflict with conservation aims such as the preservation of the \\"wild land\\" qualities of much of the Scottish coast. The right to responsible access to land allows people to access all of Scotland's coastline, and so there is no bar to a person wishing to walk the length of the coastline.

The building opened in 2001 at a cost of $6.5 million, replacing a former branch closed in 1981. The library itself contains an area of . The materials used to build the library include slate panels, shingles and rough sculpings, unfinished iron-wood cladding, and wood windows. The Honan-Allston branch has more than 50,000 items for adults, teenagers and children. There is a large literacy collection, as well as more than 100 newspapers and magazines subscriptions. The Honan-Allston Branch has partnered with the Jackson Mann School and the Jackson Mann Community Center as part of Mayor Menino's Community Learning Initiative, a multi-department collaboration aimed at helping Boston's youth reach their full capacity by combining learning and recreation. The library is accessible on public transportation via the MBTA bus 66 route, which stops directly at the building. History The Honan-Allston Branch Library building in 2009 Library service began in 1889 in a delivery station in Frank Howe's drugstore at 26 Franklin Street. Horse-drawn carriages delivered books from other branch libraries to local businesses, which in turn displayed the books for customers. The demand for books increased as the delivery station grew, and volunteers organized expanded library services. In 1905, the Allston Reading Room at 354 Cambridge Street replaced the 16-year-old delivery station. A Boston Public Library librarian staffed the reading room. It became a full-service branch of the Boston Public Library in 1924. The branch moved to rented space at 161 Harvard Avenue in 1929, and in 1979 celebrated its 90th anniversary. In 1981, amid statewide budget cuts, the branch was closed. Neighborhood groups lobbied for its reinstatement, however. In 1993, Mayor Menino said he would advocate construction of a new branch in the neighborhood. On January 19, 2000, ground was broken for the new facility. Designed by Machado and Silvetti Associates, the branch officially opened on June 16, 2001. On March 13, 2003, the branch was renamed the Honan-Allston branch in honor of the late City Councilor Brian Honan, who died in 2002. He served Brighton and Allston‚Äôs District 9 from 1996-2002. In 2006, tree guards and bicycle racks designed by sculptor Rich Duca were added to the property. Programs A close-up of the slate panels Machado and Silvetti Associates used for part of the library's exterior wall For adults, the Honan-Allston Branch offers a monthly book discussion group, weekly English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) conversation groups and basic computer instruction. Children‚Äôs activities include storytimes for babies through preschoolers, creative drama instruction, chess instruction, summer reading activities, hands-on science programs and a playgroup for young children and their caregivers. Computers are available throughout the branch for the public to use for office software, library catalogs and databases and the Internet. Laptop-friendly tables and study carrels are located in the adult reading area; each has a power source at the seat and access to wired and wireless Internet connections. A large function room for events and meetings also holds a Yamaha baby grand piano; a private study room for small groups and a conference room for meetings and activities are also available for public use. All of the meeting rooms have wired Internet access. In addition, an art gallery showcases monthly exhibits by local artists and organizations. Semi-annual book sales are also held in these back rooms. The Honan-Allston Branch has seen extensive community use of these spaces, including student piano recitals, a teen video production program, a monthly Asian languages \\"meetup\\" group and large meetings by local civic groups. Patrons can also obtain museum passes for various Boston organizations, including the Boston Children's Museum, New England Aquarium, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Harvard University Art Museums, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Museum of Science and the Wheelock Family Theatre. Raymond V. Mellone Park The misting fountain built with granite lion heads, in winter of 2012 In July 2011, the branch opened its new 1.74-acre park, called Library Park and located at the rear of the library building, to the public. The park was created on the one-time site of a concrete plant through a partnership among Harvard University, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Boston Parks & Recreation Department, the Boston Public Library, and members of the Allston-Brighton community. Harvard also committed to 10 years of park maintenance using sustainable techniques such as organic fertilizer. The park‚Äôs planning and design team included the landscape architectural firm Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates Inc. and representatives from Harvard and the Boston Redevelopment Authority. The hilltop at Raymond V. Mellone Park, in winter of 2012 Construction began in 2009 and drew heavily upon residents‚Äô and patrons‚Äô suggestions. A water feature was not included in the plans, although patrons asked for one that could include a fountain or stream. Instead, a funnel feature will redirect rainwater to a small wild garden at the north section of the park, thus allowing for sustainability and the reduction of flooding in the neighborhood. A misting feature was added, as well, with three granite lions as the spouts, and an additional fourth lion hidden to the side. In 2013, the four lions were named by neighborhood children, winners of a naming contest, and plaques were added to the statues. In November 2011, Library Park was renamed Raymond V. Mellone Park, in honor of Mellone, a Brighton native, Korean War veteran and who served on the Boston Rent Control Board and with the Transportation Department, among other agencies. The finished park includes a quarter-mile of pathways, as well as half an acre of open space, a winding path to the east of the park and a coiled, low-incline ramp up a hilltop to the west. One hundred and fifty trees and other foliage around the park‚Äôs border surround an open lawn in the center, along with a misting fountain built with three granite lion heads, salvaged from a Western Ave. business. Some areas are meant to encourage residents to use the park for gatherings or educational purposes. The park‚Äôs eastern area features an open- air \\"classroom\\" for public and library programming and has space for 50 people. A hill was constructed near the rear of the library itself. Patrons can visit a flat meeting area at the top by climbing one of two staircases or by walking around coiled pathway to the top.

They have been used in predictability analysis and as initial perturbations for ensemble forecasting in numerical weather prediction. In modern practice they are often replaced by bred vectors for this purpose. Mathematical description Depiction of the asymmetric growth of perturbations along an evolved trajectory. Lyapunov vectors are defined along the trajectories of a dynamical system. If the system can be described by a d-dimensional state vector x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d the Lyapunov vectors v^{(k)}(x), (k=1\\\\dots d) point in the directions in which an infinitesimal perturbation will grow asymptotically, exponentially at an average rate given by the Lyapunov exponents \\\\lambda_k. * When expanded in terms of Lyapunov vectors a perturbation asymptotically aligns with the Lyapunov vector in that expansion corresponding to the largest Lyapunov exponent as this direction outgrows all others. Therefore almost all perturbations align asymptotically with the Lyapunov vector corresponding to the largest Lyapunov exponent in the system. * In some cases Lyapunov vectors may not exist. * Lyapunov vectors are not necessarily orthogonal. * Lyapunov vectors are not identical with the local principal expanding and contracting directions, i.e. the eigenvectors of the Jacobian. While the latter require only local knowledge of the system, the Lyapunov vectors are influenced by all Jacobians along a trajectory. * The Lyapunov vectors for a periodic orbit are the Floquet vectors of this orbit. Numerical method If the dynamical system is differentiable and the Lyapunov vectors exist, they can be found by forward and backward iterations of the linearized system along a trajectory. Let x_{n+1}=M_{t_n\\\\to t_{n+1}}(x_n) map the system with state vector x_n at time t_n to the state x_{n+1} at time t_{n+1}. The linearization of this map, i.e. the Jacobian matrix ~J_n describes the change of an infinitesimal perturbation h_n. That is : M_{t_n\\\\to t_{n+1}}(x_n + h_n) \\\\approx M_{t_n\\\\to t_{n+1}}(x_n) + J_n h_n = x_{n+1} + h_{n+1} Starting with an identity matrix Q_0=\\\\mathbb{I}~ the iterations : Q_{n+1}R_{n+1} = J_n Q_n where Q_{n+1}R_{n+1} is given by the Gram-Schmidt QR decomposition of J_n Q_n, will asymptotically converge to matrices that depend only on the points x_n of a trajectory but not on the initial choice of Q_0. The rows of the orthogonal matrices Q_n define a local orthogonal reference frame at each point and the first k rows span the same space as the Lyapunov vectors corresponding to the k largest Lyapunov exponents. The upper triangular matrices R_n describe the change of an infinitesimal perturbation from one local orthogonal frame to the next. The diagonal entries r^{(n)}_{kk} of R_n are local growth factors in the directions of the Lyapunov vectors. The Lyapunov exponents are given by the average growth rates : \\\\lambda_k = \\\\lim_{m\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{t_{n+m}-t_n} \\\\sum_{l=1}^m \\\\log r^{(n+l)}_{kk} and by virtue of stretching, rotating and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization the Lyapunov exponents are ordered as \\\\lambda_1 \\\\ge \\\\lambda_2 \\\\ge \\\\dots \\\\ge \\\\lambda_d. When iterated forward in time a random vector contained in the space spanned by the first k columns of Q_n will almost surely asymptotically grow with the largest Lyapunov exponent and align with the corresponding Lyapunov vector. In particular, the first column of Q_n will point in the direction of the Lyapunov vector with the largest Lyapunov exponent if n is large enough. When iterated backward in time a random vector contained in the space spanned by the first k columns of Q_{n+m} will almost surely, asymptotically align with the Lyapunov vector corresponding to the kth largest Lyapunov exponent, if n and m are sufficiently large. Defining c_n = Q_n^{T} h_n we find c_{n-1} = R_n^{-1} c_n. Choosing the first k entries of c_{n+m} randomly and the other entries zero, and iterating this vector back in time, the vector Q_n c_n aligns almost surely with the Lyapunov vector v^{(k)}(x_n) corresponding to the kth largest Lyapunov exponent if m and n are sufficiently large. Since the iterations will exponentially blow up or shrink a vector it can be re-normalized at any iteration point without changing the direction.

It lies along National Road 54, north-west by road from Loikaw. Running through the city center is a rail line connecting Loikaw to Kalaw, two major tourist towns in the area. Demographics Pinlaung is primarily home to Pa'O and Shan ethnic groups. Tourism Tourists who visit the town of Pinlaung may visit Mway Daw Pagoda, the Nam Hoo Kyaung Tike Temple, and an authentic traditional craft market. Twenty minutes from the city center is another popular destination with tourists, Loi Maung Taung Pagoda. This stupa sits at the highest peak in the region, Loi Maung Taung. Another, lesser-known, mountain outside of the city center is Wingabar Mountain. This historic mountain is located 3.5 miles (5.7 kilometers) from Pinlaung in the village of Taung Hti Bwar and features a full-length cave, called Yar Za Cave or Hti Bwar Cave. Economics Girl in Pa'O traditional dress on a potato farm in Pinlaung, Pinlaung Township, Shan State, Myanmar (Pa'O Self-Administered Zone) Traditionally, farmers from the Pinlaung area grew subsistence crops such as cheroot leaves, maize, and beans. When the opium trade took off in the 1900s, poppy was featured as a major cash crop in the area. However, in recent years, there have been efforts to focus on other saleable crops such as coffee and tea. Now, Pinlaung is the premier tea-growing town in Myanmar, with the Assam tea being the most predominant cultivar grown. Furthermore, cabbage, cauliflower, potato, corn, and sesame grow in abundance due to the favorable climate conditions. Before 2010, accessing Pinlaung was a difficult task. Merchants from Naypyidaw,southern, and western Myanmar who wanted trade with the highland farmers and ethnic tribes in Pinlaung were required to traverse the dangerous winding roads of Elephant Mountain (Sin Taung) and cross the Paung Laung River by boat. Then, Myanmar's former government contracted P.T.Waagner-Biro Indonesia together with Supreme Group of Companies to construct an expansive steel truss suspension bridge to span the river. The bridge, known as the Leinli Bridge, would become the highest of its kind in Myanmar. The bridge was opened on November 5, 2010, at a cost of 3.476 million in foreign currency and an additional 14,500 million kyats. Climate Pinlaung has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb).

Wyer. It uses the bar-lines found in conventional musical scores to indicate durational periods during which performers, who may include actors, singers, dancers, poets as well as musicians, are given instructions, which may include conventional musical scoring or improvisational guidelines (see: musical improvisation). The system allows large and sometimes disparate groups to improvise together coherently, or to combine improvisation with scored music or with other media. It has been used to get orchestras, including the Orchestra of the Swan (see below), to improvise effectively and in educational projects, to combine student musicians with professionals, such as with Welsh National Opera and to combine other media such as dance and poetry with musical improvisation in a structured form, such as with Miro Dance Theatre, Philadelphia. The flexibility of the system has allowed for the combination of musicians from very different backgrounds, as well as disparate ensembles with players of very different standards. Works generally combine improvisation with conventional scoring and move frequently from one system to the other. The synchronisation using 'clock-time' as a basis has also enabled works made up of players who are spatially separated such as with Four Bridges which was performed simultaneously in Britain, Germany, America and India, it allows for works which alter the conventional relationship of the composer with the musician by involving the performer directly into the creative process.  Beginnings - The Simultaneity Project  In 2004 Wyer began creating Simultaneity works: works that made recordings at the same time in different locations. The first recordings took place around Columbus Circle, New York ‚Äì Wyer mapped out a circumference that passed through the Time Warner building and around the periphery of Columbus Circle itself and, with the help of a team of volunteer staff from WNYC radio, made a series of simultaneous recordings that, when played back across multiple speakers, gave what he described as a ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs ear view‚Äô of the location ‚Äì the experience of being at all points simultaneously; cars, subway trains and people moved from speaker to speaker, featuring the endless rotation of revolving doors that interfaced the very contrasting sonic landscape of the interior of the Time Warner Building with the bustling Manhattan streets outside. This led to Simultaneity recordings that were not made in the same location: in December 2004, with volunteers primarily from CEC Canada‚Äôs online forum, a recording was made simultaneously in countries around the world: volunteers were asked to record exactly the same twenty minutes of their environment wherever they were in the world, regardless of time-zone, but to include something that marked the hour changing. Volunteers recorded dawn choruses (Australia), tolling bells (Australia), railway station announcements (New Zealand), clocks in a clock shop (San Francisco), ambient sound in Police Square (Manhattan), evening traffic (Berlin), the backstage at English National Opera (London) late night rains (Tunis) late night chatter (Mumbai), the sounds of the jungle (Laos), dogs barking (northern Alaska). Resulting in a complex array of sounds that coalesced into a moment of intensity as the hour struck and then dissipated back to the disparate ambient environments.  Time structured mapping  In his search to incorporate the philosophy of Simultaneity within western musical systems, Wyer returned to a frequent inspiration; birdsong; struck by the endless combinations and re-combinations of the songs of the dawn chorus he began considering ways to create systems that would enable simultaneous solos that combined in musically intelligent, coherent ways - that necessarily moved away from the western convention of counting a beat for each bar. In 2005 Wyer made his first Time Structured Maps using the same basic scores as might be used for an orchestra but where each bar-line represented a period of 30 seconds rather than a count and each ‚Äòbar‚Äô consisted of a set of instructions for how to improvise during that time period, which might be very specific or left ambiguous. The result was a system that enabled musicians from all backgrounds to play together, and to incorporate other forms such as dance, speech etc. within a score. The first significant work for the system was for the Orchestra of the Swan with a Time Structured Map (TSM) based work called Traveller, There Are No Paths, Paths Are Made By Walking created in the summer of 2005. A second, much more ambitious work, Four Bridges, was performed in November 2005, it combined the ideas of Simultaneity with the Time Structured Mapping system: the Orchestra of the Swan played from the score in England while pianist Burkhard Finke in Frankfurt, microtonal vocal specialist Toby Twining in Boston and Indian Classical singer Anand Thakore in Mumbai performed simultaneously from the same score, without hearing each other ‚Äì each performance was recorded and later combined into a work for 8 speakers, which was later broadcast on WNYC New Sounds. In 2009, Time Structured Mapping was used for the creation of the one-hour Insomnia Poems for BBC Radio 3 (Jazz On 3) BBC Radio 3 Jazz On 3. which combined post-beat poet Steve Dalachinsky with a five-piece band consisting of soprano, Evelyne Beech, electronics and processing, Mike Cross, clarinets and saxes, Chris Cundy, bass, Robert Perry and Pete M Wyer on guitar, piano with found sounds and manipulations ‚Äì each performing with a synchronized stopwatch. The piece was popularly received, retaining the energy and spontaneity of improvisation within the dynamic and tonal structure of a conventionally scored piece. Further development, funded by the Arts Council Of England, enabled workshops which in turn led to new works using the system: Welsh National Opera Welsh National Opera. used it for a series of educational works alongside their 2010 UK tour, the Orchestra of the Swan also using TSM scores for Four Sonnets, a twenty-minute work created in July 2010 which combined improvisation within the orchestra with text fragments submitted according to the score from members of the public and Listening To The Sky', a one hour work for chamber group with sound design, which used a TSM score to combine orchestra performance with sounds created according to the Time Structured Map.

It was the most radical school in the country, the first at which black men were just as welcome as whites. \\"Oneida was the seed of Lane Theological Seminary, Western Reserve College, Oberlin and Knox colleges.\\" The Oneida Institute was located near Utica, in the village of Whitesboro, New York, town of Whitestown, Oneida County, New York. It was founded in 1827 by George Washington Gale as the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry. His former teacher (in the Addison County Grammar School, Middlebury, Vermont, 1807‚Äì1808) John Frost, now a Presbyterian minister in Whitesboro with a wealthy wife ‚Äî daughter of Thomas Ruggles Gold, ‚Äî was the primary partner in setting up the Institute. They raised $20,000, a significant part of which was from the philanthropist and abolitionist brothers Arthur and Lewis Tappan; Arthur had helped various western institutions, to the extent of tens of thousands of dollars, \\"but his favorite among them was Oneida Institute\\". With this they bought land and began construction of the buildings. The Institute occupied \\"more than bordered by Main Street and the Mohawk River and by Ellis and Ablett Avenues in Whitesboro village.\\" The first student movement in the country, the Lane Rebels, began at Oneida. A contingent of about 24, with an acknowledged leader (Theodore Dwight Weld), left Oneida for Lane and then, more publicly, soon left Lane for Oberlin. Oneida's first president, Gale, founded Knox Manual Labor Institute, later Knox College, in Galesburg, Illinois. Oneida hired its second president, Beriah Green, from Oberlin's competitor in northeast Ohio, Western Reserve College. All of this is very much linked to the explosively emerging topic of abolitionism. The first president: George Washington Gale The Institute opened in May 1827 with 2 instructors, Gale and Peletiah Rawson, the latter a Hamilton College graduate and engineer that had worked on the just-completed Erie Canal. There were initially 20 students, including most of the 7 that had been working in exchange for instruction on Gale's farm in Western, New York, a pilot project. Theodore Weld, who would become the leader of the students, was among them. Enrollment soon grew to 100, and by 1830, 500 applicants were turned away for lack of space. It was chartered in 1829 as the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry. Through Frost, it was \\"intimately connected\\" with the Presbyterian church of Whitesboro. Oneida was the first and leading American example of the manual labor college, which Gale thought he had originated, although there were earlier examples. His goal was to supplement study with the physical and spiritual or psychological benefits of exercise; for the time this was an innovative and informed position. By \\"unit[ing] classical education with agricultural, horticultural, and mechanical labor,\\" Gale was also trying to make education more affordable. \\"Students worked on the farm, or in the carpenter, trunk and harness-making shops\\"; a printing shop was added later. The first year, floods destroyed the crops, but the second year, students \\"Religious fervor was kept at a white heat. Studies were interrupted to hold protracted revival meetings.\\" Gale replaced the study of Latin and Classical Greek with Hebrew and Biblical Greek. The charismatic, influential Christian revivalist Charles Finney had been a student of Gale prior to Oneida, and Gale sought at Oneida to train students \\"as emissaries of the new revivalism\\". \\"The result was a large crop of crusaders and reformers, who were later turned loose to fulminate against drink, slavery, Sabbath breaking, [and] irreligion, some of whom became famous in their proseletyzing fields.\\" Gale \\"lacked the qualities of a leader\\". In the summer of 1833 a debate on colonization led to the formation of a colonization and an anti-slavery society. Student dissatisfaction led to a mass walk-out in 1832, with about 24 students leaving for Lane, then Oberlin. Gale soon desired to be replaced; he went to Illinois, where he began Galesburg, Illinois, and the Knox Manual Labor College, which in 1857 became Knox College. Gale left the Institute with \\"fiscal problems\\", saddled with \\"numerous financial obligations\\". The second and last president: Beriah Green After a search, the trustees settled on abolitionist firebrand Beriah Green, who started in 1833, and \\"for whom Gale had nothing but scorn\\". The school was dominated by Green's personality and was known as \\"President Green's school\\". =Curriculum= Green \\"revamped Oneida's curriculum by giving greater attention to the study of ethics or moral philosophy than was the case during Gale's tenure, or indeed at most American colleges in the 1830s.\\" He replaced the study of Latin and classical Greek with Hebrew and New Testament Greek. In 1836 (another source says 1838), in the \\"juvenile department\\", William Whipple Warren studied arithmetic, English grammar, geography, and \\"the Greek of Matthew's gospel\\". In 1843, a letter seeking funds gives the \\"Course of Study\\" as \\"Greek, Hebrew, arithmetic, bookkeeping, algebra, anatomy, physiology, geometry, natural philosophy [studying nature, forerunner of science], natural theology, evidences of Christianity, political economy, science of government, exercises in declamation and composition.\\" For admittance to the school, Green stated: =Abolitionism; admitting Black students= The curriculum was in line with Green's goal of training abolitionist activists, which he believed was what Christianity mandated. Abolitionism was a \\"sacred vocation\\". The Institute under Green was \\"an abolition college\\", \\"a hotbed of anti-slavery activity,\\" \\"abolitionist to the core, more so than any other American college.\\" Oneida and Whitestown Anti- Slavery Societies were soon formed, declaring that slavery was not just an evil, it was a crime and a sin. Green accepted the job on two conditions: that he be allowed to preach \\"immediatism\\", the immediate emancipation of slaves, and that it be allowed to admit African-American students. These were agreed to. Prior to Green, there had not been any Black students at Oneida; so far as is known, none had applied. In 1833, allowing African-American students into educational institutions alongside whites was controversial at best, and aroused bitter, even violent opposition. (Even schools for black students only could be the object of violence.) While there had been one African-American graduate each from Amherst, Bowdoin, and Middlebury, these were exceptional cases. The Noyes Academy in New Hampshire was destroyed in 1835 after it admitted African-American students, making it a \\"nigger school\\"; farmers with ninety yoke of oxen dragged the Academy building to a corner of the Common, leaving it \\"shattered, mutilated, inwardly beyond reparation almost.\\" Four of its students then enrolled at Oneida. The city of New Haven in 1831 unexpectedly and decisively prevented the setting up of \\"a new college for the instruction of colored youth\\", of which there was none in United States. (See Simeon Jocelyn.) In New York, the American Colonization Society would not allow even a lecture series for blacks on history. The Canterbury Female Boarding School, in Canterbury, Connecticut, was forced to close after it admitted one African-American girl in 1832, and the school for \\"young ladies and little misses of color\\" which replaced it was met with such escalating violence from the townspeople that director Prudence Crandall was forced to close it out of concern for the students' safety. New-York Central College, called a \\"nigger college\\", was forced to close in part because of local hostility to education of African Americans, and even more so to African- American professors. Oneida was itself called a \\"nigger school\\". A month before Green's arrival in August 1832, 35 students formed an antislavery society on immediatist principles, the first in New York State. 34 students formed a colonization society; colonization was not in favor of full emancipation, and thought the best place for free blacks was \\"back to Africa\\", e.g. Liberia. In his inaugural address, Green called for \\"immediate, unconditional, and uncompensated emancipation\\". Compensated emancipation meant that owners of released slaves would be compensated for the loss of their \\"property\\", as they were, in part, when the District of Columbia's slaves were emancipated in 1862. In this environment Oneida admitted African-American students, the first college in the country to admit them without restrictions. According to alumnus Alexander Crummell, there was \\"perfect equality\\" between the black and white students. There were generally 10‚Äì14 \\"colored students\\". In 1840, \\"including Indian blood\\", there were 20. =Finances= When Green became President, the Institute was in debt. American abolitionists, including Gerrit Smith, pledged $65,000 () towards the support of the Institute, although because of the Panic of 1837 not all were able to fulfill their pledges. The Panic left the Institute $9,000 in debt. =Enrollment= Before 1840, there were an average of 100 students. After incurring the large debt, which Charles Stuart called \\"embarassments\\", \\"in 1841 the instructors relinquished nearly all of their salaries\\", and enrollment was cut to 25; the following year, 50‚Äì75. Just before closure, counting the President there were four professors, \\"and an able financier\\". \\"[T]he education societies withdrew their aid from its students, because its course of study substituted Hebrew for Latin, and it was called an Institute, not an Academy, College, or Theological School! And the charges that have been sung among the pro-slavery influences of church and state around it, on the 'nigger school' cannot well be numbered.\\" According to Sernett, the Presbyterian Education Society and the American Education Society \\"struck Oneida Institute from its list of approved schools\\" in 1834. Another source says this was in 1839. In 1836, the New York Senate passed a resolution \\"directing the Committee on Literature [schools] to inquire into the propriety of denying the Oneida Institute all participation in the Benefits of the Literature Fund.\\" This was because it was \\"regarded as the hot-bed of sedition, [and] that Beriah Green, the principal, had been active and successful in propagating the doctrines of abolitionism.\\" The Legislature took no action after more than 150 people met to protest and to demand academic freedom. During 1833‚Äì1834 Frost's employment is specified as \\"Agent, Oneida Institute\\". By 1835 Frost had left Whitesboro for a pulpit in Elmira (which he helped make an Underground Railroad center). His replacement, David Ogden, was not an abolitionist. This led to a withdrawal from the Whitesboro Presbyterian Church of \\"seventy-one communicant members, including most of the elders\\", to form a new Congregational church under Green's direction. As a result, \\"Green and his school [were left] with fewer and fewer friends\\"; he could no longer turn to churches for funding. The Oneida Institute ceased operations in 1843. One factor was the New York Anti-Slavery Society's failure to pay the institute $2000 for the printing costs of their paper Friend of Man, but even if it had, there was no way to make the Institute financially viable. According to Dana Bigelow, \\"Green left the institution a wreck\\". He identifies the causes of its failure as three: first, the manual labor scheme; \\"unskilled labor was found to be unprofitable\\". (The $1000 mentioned above did not cover costs.) Second, replacing the classics with the Bible; \\"this did much to disconnect the institution with the general theory and habit of culture in the country and to stamp it with a certain reputation of singularity which could not fail to be in many ways disastrous.\\" Finally, the treating of black and white students equally, and its \\"iconoclastic zeal for the overthrow of social institutions and interests\\", led to \\"much popular odium\\". \\"Oneida was the seed of Lane Theological Seminary [ 1830], Western Reserve University [1826], Oberlin [1833] and Knox College [1837].\\" Through the Whitestown Seminary it is also a predecessor of Bates College (1855). A graduate, William G. Allen, became the second African- American professor in the country at nearby New-York Central College, which also admitted African-American students and was also short-lived. =The \\"Lane Rebels\\"= Theodore Dwight Weld, who had studied at Oneida from 1827 to 1830, was dissatisfied with Gale's leadership. He led a 1833 exodus of \\"Oneida boys...disenchanted with Gale's leadership and the lack of regular theological courses\\"; they rafted down the French and Allegheny rivers to Cincinnati, and constituted 24 of the 40 members of the Lane Seminary's first theological class. Whitestown Seminary Whitestown Seminary, New York. Hand-colored. The four young trees in the above illustration have grown. To satisfy debts its facilities were sold to the Free Will Baptists, who created the Whitestown Seminary in 1844. A condition of the sale was that the new seminary admit students of \\"all colors\\". Several Oneida Institute students enrolled. Whitestown Seminary merged with the Cobb Divinity School to form the Free Will Baptist Bible School, which moved to the New Hampton Institute in 1854 before moving to Bates College in 1870 and eventually merging the school's religion department. A predecessor was the school of H. H. Kellog, in Clinton. Elizabeth, \\"lady principal\\", daughter of Robert Everett, two of whose brothers attended the Oneida Institute, married John Jay Butler. Students Green's policy was to accept any qualified student that applied. As a result, student Grinnell described the student body as \\"a motley company\\", consisting of: =Alumni of the Oneida Institute= White students Listed in bold are those students who, under the influence of Theodore D.

As films can affect the public with their great popularity and their vivid audio-visual effect, it has such influence that alarms the government to place strict regulations which the films must follow in order to be viewed by the public. This control on the film industry and filmmakers resulted in film censorship. The censorship often changed depends on the government's attitude toward the social structure and films. Thus, the filmmakers could not criticize the government in any aspect, instead, they could only promote and support the government. Consequently, the filmmakers were not allowed to freely express their creativity as well as their ideas and thoughts, and these restrictions lead to the decline of the film industry. There are 2 major time periods where film censorship strongly impacted on the growth of the film industry in South Korea, namely, the period during Colonial Korea which was under Japanese Rule (Japanese occupation) and the period when the film industry were under heavily surveillance from the new military regime. Film censorship in Colonial Korea under Japanese rule Film was introduced to Korea during the Chosun dynasty (1897‚Äì1910) and it and quickly became a popular media. The beginning of the Japanese occupation saw the introduction of censorship laws specifically meant to protect the image of the Japanese empire. And also, films that deterred war related objective or praised America were prohibited. Laws introduced in this period included the Motion Picture Censorship Regulation and the Chosun Motion Picture Law. The Motion Picture Censorship Regulation includes: # All foreign and domestic films needed for approval before screened # Japanese police must attend at the time of screenings The Chosun Motion Picture Law includes: 1) Requirement to obtain license in the film industry 2) Prior restraint of films 3) Punishment for infractions of the law The major reason for establishing such laws were to strengthen control of the public since such media were excellent vehicles to influence its viewers. They required filmmakers not to harm the image of the Japanese Empire nor praise their enemy in order to prevent any form of doubt on the Japanese dominance. They closed down several Korean film production companies and banned some of films that were disadvantageous to the Japanese Empire. Major films influenced by censorship: * Bloody Horse (1928) directed by Hong Kae-myung * A Ferry Boat that No One Owns (Imjaeobtneun naleutbae) (1932) directed by Lee Kyu-hwan Film censorship under the new military regime Film censorship had a tremendous impact on the South Korean film industry during the years between 1973 and 1992. Consequently, Korean movies experienced its biggest hindrance which is now known to be the depression period. During this period, film censorship was strongly enforced under the military regime by Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo Hwan. They both realized that media was the most influential channel used at the time that affected how people viewed the government. Prior to 1987, the government enacted the First Motion Picture Law to take control of the film industry. This law did not allow the industry to freely produce the movie if the contents were not met to their criteria. President Park Chung Hee established the Motion Picture Promotion Corporation (MPPC) to support the film industry. However, Park's main purpose was to safeguard antigovernment issues played in the movie more so than supporting the film industry. Elements of MPPC: 1) License system 2) Import quotas to set a limitation on how many films to be produced 3) Strong censorship. The filmmakers could only depict the positive side rather than negative side of Korean society, thus, the movies were not expressed the way they wanted which lead to poor results. The filmmakers continuously pushed the government to amend their censorship laws in order to promote freedom of expression, but the attempts were futile due to unyielding political influence and this was the main contribution to decline of South Korea's film industry.  Past  The history of Korean movies has lasted for over a hundred years, since the very first movie was played; but it hasn't ever been free from government censorship. In 1907, the inspector general made the security law, which stated that anything that is performed in public can be regulated and controlled by the government. And when Korea was under Japanese rule, censorship was more strongly regulated than ever before. The Governor-General of Korea made an activity regulation committee in 1920 and performance regulation rules in 1922. In the movie ‚ÄòGeneral's Son,‚Äô there is the scene of Japanese police sitting right next to the stage and arresting anyone who shows signs of propagandas to the public. Many movies were censored at this period of time. ‚ÄúAcross the Tumen River‚Äù could be released after deletion of some scenes and changes of the name of the movie to ‚ÄúTo Find Love.‚Äù ‚ÄúBen-Hur‚Äù had been issued because the silent-firm narrator encouraged national consciousness. In 1960, after the April Revolution, the national movie ethic committee was founded which was the very first public organization that evaluated movies without government watch. As a result, ‚ÄúAimless Bullet‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Coachman‚Äù that were about national consciousness could be played in the theatre. After the 5.16 military coup, a military government emerged and amended the constitution. The amendment stated that for public morals and social ethics, the government can censor movies or entertainment. After the amendment, ‚Äú Aimless bullet‚Äù was shut down at the theatre because one line in the movie says ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs go‚Äô which they stated meant ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the north.‚Äù During that time period, the anti-communism law allowed for the Central Intelligence Agency to arrest people, which they then used to arrest Man-hee lee, director of ‚ÄúSeven Women Prisoners ‚Äù. They stated that he described the North Korean Army as good and cool. They also released him under the condition that he had to make an anti-communism movie, which is why he made ‚ÄúSoldier Without Service Number‚Äù They arrested him again because he had cast a good looking guy for North Korean army. During this period of time, all the movies that were made also had to pass scenario censorship and after the movies were made. There was the other censorship, so all the movies had to pass two censorships from government. More than 80 percent of movies had to be revised before even filming the movie. For example, the movie ‚ÄòFool‚Äôs March‚Äô had many parts of the script had to be deleted even before the film was made. This led to a half hour of the film being deleted. After South Korea opened the Olympics in 1988, it became possible to import the movies about communism and the censorship level for eroticism was loosened; but not many things had been changed. In September 1996, 10 minutes of the opening movie Crash from David Cronenberg was deleted, which led to great shame at the international movie festival. One month later, The Constitutional Court ruled that the censorship was unconstitutional. Following that rule, the movie laws had to be changed, and the Korea Media Rating Board was founded. They also made an additional rating level which was over R rating. It is reserved for movies that cannot be shown in regular movie theatres and can only be shown in designated unrated theaters which do not even exist in Korea. This means that movie makers have to delete the scenes in order for their films to receive an R rating. Even though the Korea Movie Rating Board does not have the power to regulate the scenes in the movies; they can imply that the movie makers need to censor the movies in order for the film to be shown.  Present  In recent years, sexual scenes have been a major issue that pits filmmakers against Media Rating Board. Pubic hair and male or female genitalia is disallowed on the screen, unless they are digitally blurred. In rare cases extreme violence, obscene language, or certain portrayals of drug use may also become an issue. South Korea has 5 different levels of rating systems; G, PG-12, PG-15, R-18 and Restricted Rate. These are ruled by the Presidential Decree. The first movie that was rated reservation rate was ‚ÄòYellow Hair.‚Äô The fact that this movie got the reservation rate made more people watch this movie than usual. This movie was rejected in early 1999 before being rated an 18+ rate on its second application, after a sex scene between two women and one man was partially cut and digitally altered. The movie ‚ÄòLies‚Äô sued the Movie Rating Board for reservation rating to the Constitutional Court and the Court ruled that the reservation rate was unconstitutional. They changed from the reservation rate to Restricted Rate. It didn't make any difference than reservation rate because the Board made restricted rate movie theatres afterward; they all went to bankrupt or shut down. So basically the movies that received an R-rating lost their place to be shown. The movie ‚ÄúI Saw the Devil (2010)‚Äù could be shown at the theatre after deletion of one and half minutes of the movie. The 2014 film, The Interview was banned in South Korea because it depicts of criticizing and killing of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Although it was available in black markets, in 2015, a North Korean defector sent unlicensed copies of the film via a helium balloon into the DMZ.

After the abdication of D. Pedro I of Brazil (Pedro IV of Portugal) and his return to Europe where he played a decisive role in the Portuguese Civil War (1828-1834), the movement in Pernambuco, a conservative and absolutist, aimed at the renewal of D. Pedro I to the throne. Portrait of Pedro I.  History  The movement emerged among the major Portuguese merchants of Recife, who controlled the trade of the city and province, and since the country's independence, were much harassed by the population. Gathered around the Masonic Lodge \\"Column of the Throne and Altar.\\" On April 14, 1832, promoted the rise of a military battalion in Recife, under the leadership of Lt. Col. Jos√© Francisco Martins and Major Jos√© Gabriel de Morais Meyer. On the 15th, clashes started in the streets that continued for nearly a week. After three days of fighting, the President of the Province of Pernambuco, Manuel de Carvalho P√£es de Andrade, with the help of students from the School of law of Olinda, managed to isolate the rebels in a suburb of Recife and in the Forte de S√£o Jo√£o Batista do Brum. The main leaders, however, managed to escape and were to join their allies in the interior. Within the province, unrest led to the War of Cabanos or Cabanada, revolution that gripped much of Pernambuco and Alagoas 1832 to 1835. They were led by Lt. Col. Dominic Lawrence Torres Galindo, Vicente Ferreira de Paula (who led a group of rebels coming from Alagoas, in the context of repression of Cabanada), Caetano Alves and others. Students of law of Olinda attended a convocation and strengthened government forces. Between May and June 1832, there were riots Ant√¥nio Tim√≥teo de Andrade, in Panelas de Miranda, in rural Pernambuco, and Jo√£o Batista de Ara√∫jo, on the beach in Barra Grande, now the county town of Maragogi in Alagoas. On October 26, 1832, provincial troops killed Ant√¥nio Tim√≥teo de Andrade at the stronghold of Feij√£o, while Almirante Tamandar√© was arrested at his home on the beach in Barra Grande, and Jo√£o Batista de Ara√∫jo. Between November 1832 and January 1834, the movement's leadership passed into the popular forces, and the general commander Vincente de Paula the supreme leader of the Cabanos, unifying the insurgent leadership and seeking the support of blacks Papa-M√©is, who lived in the woods . He began his attacks on the sugar mills to free the slaves. For a short time he had the support of the cariri villages of Jacu√≠pe, Fulni√¥s of √Åguas Belas, Palmeira dos √çndios, Garanhuns and Escalas. The fight continued even after the death of D. Pedro I, on September 24, 1834. The loyalist forces under the command of Colonel Joaquim Jos√© Luis de Souza, same in number more than 6,000 men, could not dominate the rebels by force. Thus, faced with this impasse, the colonel turned to mediation by the then Bishop of Pernambuco, D. Jo√£o da Purifica√ß√£o Marques Perdig√£o. This then went to the interior of the Province, to meet with Vincente de Paula, head of the rebels and persuaded him to make peace, which was signed in November 1835.

In metrology (the science of measurement), a standard (or etalon) is an object, system, or experiment that bears a defined relationship to a unit of measurement of a physical quantity.Phillip Ostwald,Jairo Mu√±oz, Manufacturing Processes and Systems (9th Edition)John Wiley & Sons, 1997 p. 616 Standards are the fundamental reference for a system of weights and measures, against which all other measuring devices are compared. Historical standards for length, volume, and mass were defined by many different authorities, which resulted in confusion and inaccuracy of measurements. Modern measurements are defined in relationship to internationally standardized reference objects, which are used under carefully controlled laboratory conditions to define the units of length, mass, electrical potential, and other physical quantities. Hierarchy of standards Standard units for length would be embedded in the cornerstones of churches or important public buildings, so that all people trading in an area could agree on the units. There is a three-level hierarchy of physical measurement standards. At the top of the tree are the master standards ‚Äì these are known as primary standards. Primary standards are made to the highest metrological quality and are the definitive definition or realization of their unit of measure. Historically, units of measure were generally defined with reference to unique artifacts which were the legal basis of units of measure. A continuing trend in metrology is to eliminate as many as possible of the artifact standards and instead define practical units of measure in terms of fundamental physical constants, as demonstrated by standardized technique. One advantage of elimination of artifact standards is that inter-comparison of artifacts is no longer required. Another advantage would be that the loss or damage of the artifact standards would not disrupt the system of measures. The next quality standard in the hierarchy is known as a secondary standard. Secondary standards are calibrated with reference to a primary standard. The third level of standard, a standard which is periodically calibrated against a secondary standard, is known as a working standard. Working standards are used for the calibration of commercial and industrial measurement equipment. Primary standards A set of gauge blocks are used as a working standard to check the calibration of measurement tools such as micrometers. An example of a primary standard was the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK) which was the master kilogram and the primary mass standard for the International System of Units (SI). The IPK is a one kilogram mass of a platinum-iridium alloy maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in S√®vres, France. Another example is the unit of electrical potential, the volt. Formerly it was defined in terms of standard cell electrochemical batteries, which limited the stability and precision of the definition. Currently the volt is defined in terms of the output of a Josephson junction, which bears a direct relationship to fundamental physical constants. In contrast, the reference standard for the metre is no longer defined by a physical object (as the former international prototype of the metre (IPM) or originally the m√®tre des Archives). In 1983, the standard metre was redefined as the distance light travels in a vacuum during 1/ of a second. Secondary reference standards Secondary reference standards are very close approximations of primary reference standards. For example, major national measuring laboratories such as the US's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will hold several \\"national standard\\" kilograms, which are periodically calibrated against the IPK and each other. Working standards A machine shop will have physical working standards (gauge blocks for example) that are used for checking its measuring instruments. Working standards and certified reference materials used in commerce and industry have a traceable relationship to the secondary and primary standards. Working standards are expected to deteriorate, and are no longer considered traceable to a national standard after a time period or use count expires. Laboratory standards National organizations provide calibration and private industrial laboratories with items, processes and/or certification so they can provide certified traceability to national standards. (In the United States, NIST operates the NVLAP program.) These laboratory standards are kept in controlled conditions to maintain their precision, and used as a reference for calibration and creating working standards. Sometimes they are (incorrectly) called \\"secondary standards\\" because of their high quality and reference suitability.

Voet is regarded as one of the best and most fashionable portrait painters of the Late Baroque.Jacob Ferdinand Voet, Portrait of Diane-Gabrielle Damas de Thianges Mancini, at Jean Moust Life Portrait of a Gentleman with a Lace Collar Few details about Voet's early life, training and career have been preserved. Voet was born in Antwerp as the son of the painter Elias Voet. He was one of the fifteen children; his older brother Carlo moved to Amsterdam and married in 1661 a daughter of the wealthy Joan Coymans and Sophia Trip.http://www.uncius.be/biblio/PDFS/VS89.pdf Jacob left his native Antwerp and travelled to Rome where he resided from 1663 to 1680. Voet became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome. Voet drew a picture in charcoal of all the members of the Bentvueghels on the white-washed wall of an inn in Rome that was a popular meeting place of this group. The picture was treasured enough to be spared whenever the walls were repainted.Johan van Bunnik biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 In Rome Voet's skills as a portrait painter were much in demand at the Papal court and by the Roman aristocracy, including the prominent Colonna and Odescalchi families.Il Museo di Roma racconta la citt√†. Guida breve. Catalogo della mostra, Museo di Roma, Gangemi Editore spa, p. 33 He was patronised by Christina, Queen of Sweden, who was then resident in Rome. He painted her portrait as well as that of her friend, Cardinal Azzolino.Jacob Ferdinand Voet (1639‚Äì1689) at the National Portrait Gallery Englishmen and other Europeans visiting Rome on their Grand Tour also commissioned portraits from Voet. In 1671‚Äì1672 Voet received a commission from Cardinal Chigi to paint portraits of young woman who were prominent in Roman society. He created a first series of 37 portraits of the most enchanting women of Rome ('Galleria delle Belle') between 1672 and 1678 for Cardinal Chigi's dining room in his palace in Ariccia (in the Alban hills outside Rome). He later copied and even enlarged the series for other Roman and Italian noble families. This started a rage for portraits of young women in Rome and abroad.Renata Ago, Gusto for Things: A History of Objects in Seventeenth-Century Rome, University of Chicago Press, 22 Apr 2013, p. 152 Clelia Cesarini Colonna, Duchess of Sonnino, as Cleopatra In Rome Voet lived with the painter-engraver Cornelis Bloemaert. He was banned from the city by Pope Innocent XI who was scandalized by Voet's portraits of women portrayed with unseemly d√©collet√©. He left Rome and is recorded in Milan in 1680. He was in Florence in 1681 where he worked for the Medici family.Jacob Ferdinand Voet at the online Encyclopaedia of the Prado Museum Subsequently, he resided in Turin from 1682 to 1684. He returned to Antwerp in 1684. According to the 18th century biographer Arnold Houbraken, Voet set out on his return journey to Antwerp from Turin together with the Dutch painter Jan van Bunnik, whom he had already met in Rome in the company of Cornelis Bloemaert. From Turin they set out for Lyons, where they met the painters Adriaen van der Cabel, Pieter van Bloemen, and Gillis Wenix. They then started out for Paris in the company of a third painter, Jacob van Bunnik who was Jan van Bunnik's brother. Voet was likely back in Antwerp in 1684. He left his hometown for Paris at some time between 1684 and 1686, was appointed as court painter and died there in 1689, living on Quai de Gu√©n√©gaud. In Paris he became portrait painter to political and military personalities such as Michel Le Tellier, Fran√ßois-Michel le Tellier and Marquis of Humi√®res. Jacques d'Agar was probably his pupil.D. Br√™me. \\"Agar, Jacques d'.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 December 2014 Work Jacob Ferdinand Voet was a specialist portrait painter. The early Dutch biographer Houbraken noted that Voet painted history paintings and landscapes, but that it was through his royal, ecclesiastical and class portraits that he secured his success. Only portrait paintings and not a single history or landscape painting are currently attributed to him. The 9th Duke of Medinaceli Voet specialized in half-length portraits, in which all attention is concentrated on the subject, who emerges from a neutral, dark background. Voet's subjects usually have a reflective expression and very striking, memorable eyes, always large and evocative.Portrait of Hortense Mancini, Duchesse Mazarin, c.1670; Circle of Jacob Ferdinand Voet at Roy Precious - Antiques & Fine Art He concentrated on decorative elements such as the hair and clothing of the characters. His paintings appear to have been executed with an effortless accuracy and a fluid ease. He was also noted as a painter of miniature portraits. It is likely that the works of the portrait painters Carlo Maratta (1625‚Äì1713) and Pierre Mignard (1612‚Äì1695) who were active in Rome at the same time as Voet inspired the comparable elegance of his style, which he combined with the Flemish attention to detail.Portrait of a Gentleman with Lace Collar in the Wakefield Art Gallery Portrait of a lady, traditionally identified as a member of the Colonna family Voet painted a few portraits in a genre that was popular in Flanders at the time: the portrait in garland paintings. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hendrick van Balen, Frans Francken the Younger, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. They typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter.Ursula H√§rting, Review of Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image Close collaboration between artists with different specialities was also a common practice in Rome. There are two portrait paintings attributed to Voet that use the portrait in a garland device. They are portraits of women, one in a garland of flowers, the other in a garland of fruit. The Portrait of a lady, traditionally identified as a member of the Colonna family was originally in the Colonna collection and as a result it is believed it depicts a member of the Colonna family (Auctioned at Christie's on 29 October 2015 in London, lot 99). As in other garland paintings, the garland can be seen as carrying various symbolic connotations. The flowers allude to the sitter's beauty and youth, which are in full bloom. A branch of lilies, depicted in the upper right, refers to her chastity.Jacob Ferdinand Voet (Antwerp 1639‚Äì1689 Paris) and attributed to Mario Nuzzi, called Mario dei Fiori (Rome 1603‚Äì1673), Portrait of a lady, traditionally identified as a member of the Colonna family, small half-length, in a green dress with a white chemise, surrounded by a garland of flowers at Christie's Voet's works were widely disseminated through copies by the Roman painter Pietro Veglia and engravings by the Flemish engraver Albertus Clouwet. The Roman publisher Giovanni Giacomo Rossi included Voet's portraits of Cardinals in the publication Effigies Cardinalium nunc viventum.

Assmann (July 1862 - 19 October 1920) was a record setting balloonist. Biography He was born in 1862 in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1910 he ascended to 4,000 feet and traveled 206 miles. On 17 October 1910, William Assman and Lieutenant Leopold Vogt, of the German Army, took off in the hydrogen-filled \\"Harburg III\\", from St. Louis, Missouri, one of ten balloons in the James Gordon Bennett International Balloon Race. At 6:10 pm, 18 October, they crossed into Canada; by 9:00 pm they opted to land as their ballast was getting low, but were over the waters of Georgian Bay, and thus continued onward. Two hours later, in the pitch black of night ‚Äî having traveled 850 miles from St. Louis, at speeds upwards of 60 miles per hour -- Assman and Vogt, having used up all but 2 ¬Ω sacks of ballast, decided they had no alternative but to put down. They were over Lake Nipissing, Ontario, at 18,000 feet. Lt. Vogt later described to newspaper reporters pulling a valve, and the \\"Harburg III\\" plummeting in a ‚Äúterminal velocity descent‚Äù. As the aeronauts were about to be smashed to death on Gull Island, the wind cast their balloon into the lake. Both men were momentarily knocked unconscious by the impact. William Assman‚Äôs left arm was broken, and his right hand badly sprained, an artery in the wrist cut. Despite his injuries the men were forced to swim to nearby Gull Island, where they tied the balloon to a tree. For two hours they shouted for assistance, but were far enough out in the lake (which is deep in the Canadian wilderness) that they got no response. After an all-night stay on the island, soaked and cold from their episode in the lake, Assman bleeding profusely from his cut, the aeronauts were rescued around 6:00 am by two local Native Indians passing by in a canoe. The men were paddled 10 miles to the tiny hamlet of Nipissing Village, south of the railway town of North Bay, Ontario. Assman's injuries were attended to by a local doctor. The \\"Harburg III\\" was towed to shore, and transported with its crew to New York by train. A number of the balloon‚Äôs instruments were lost, though it‚Äôs unknown if they fell in the lake or were pilfered as souvenirs. The flight of William Assman and Lt. Vogt and their subsequent crash made headlines around the world. They placed fifth in the race.St. Louis Despatch newspaper articles, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 October 1910New York Times articles, 20 and 21 October 1910 In 1911 he took part in the Kansas City national balloon race in an elimination competition. He died on 19 October 1920.

The formula for the simple Dietz return is as follows: :R=\\\\frac{B - A - C}{A +C/2} where : R is the portfolio rate of return, : A is the beginning market value, : B is the ending market value, and : C is the net external inflow during the period (flows out of the portfolio are negative and flows into the portfolio are positive). It is based on the assumption that all external flows occur at the half-way point in time within the evaluation period (or are spread evenly across the period, and so the flows occur on average at the middle of the period).  Fees  To measure returns net of fees, allow the value of the portfolio to be reduced by the amount of the fees. To calculate returns gross of fees, compensate for them by treating them as an external flow, and exclude accrued fees from valuations, i.e. do not reduce the portfolio market value by the fee amount accrued.  Discussion  # The simple Dietz method is a variation upon the simple rate of return, which assumes that external flows occur either at the beginning or at the end of the period. The simple Dietz method is somewhat more computationally tractable than the internal rate of return (IRR) method. # A refinement of the simple Dietz method is the modified Dietz method, which takes available information on the actual timing of external flows into consideration. # Like the modified Dietz method, the simple Dietz method is based on the assumption of a simple rate of return principle, unlike the internal rate of return method, which applies a compounding principle. # Also like the modified Dietz method, it is a money-weighted returns method (as opposed to a time-weighted returns method). In particular, if the simple Dietz returns on two portfolios over the same period are R_1 and R_2, then the simple Dietz return on the combined portfolio containing the two portfolios is the weighted average of the simple Dietz return on the two individual portfolios: R = w_1 \\\\times R_1 + w_2 \\\\times R_2. The weights w_1 and w_2 are given by: w_i = \\\\frac{A_i +\\\\frac{C_i}{2}}{A_1 + A_2 +\\\\frac{C_1+C_2}{2}}.  Derivation  The method is named after Peter O. Dietz. According to his book Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance, :\\"The method selected to measure return on investment is similar to the one described by Hilary L. Seal in Trust and Estate magazine. This measure is used by most insurance companies and by the SEC in compiling return on investment in its Pension Bulletins. The basis of this measure is to find a rate of return by dividing income by one- half the beginning investment plus one-half the ending investment, minus one- half the investment income. Thus where A equals beginning investment, B equals ending investment, and I equals income, return R is equivalent to ::R = I \\\\div {1/2} (A + B - I) :For the purpose of measuring pension fund investment performance, income should be defined to include ordinary income plus realized and unrealized gains and losses.\\" :\\"The investment base to be used is market value as opposed to book value. There are several reasons for this choice: First, market value represents the true economic value which is available to the investment manager at any point in time, whereas book value is arbitrary. Book value depends on the timing of investments, that is, book value will be high or low depending on when investments were made. Second, an investment manager who realizes capital gains will increase his investment base as opposed to a manager who lets his gains ride, even though the funds have the same economic value. Such action would result in an artificially lower return for the fund realizing gains and reinvesting if book value were used.\\" Using M_1 and M_2 for beginning and ending market value respectively, he then uses the following relation: :M_2 = {M_1} + C + I to transform :R = I \\\\div {1/2} ({M_1} + {M_2} - I) into :R=\\\\frac{{M_2} - {M_1} - C}{{1/2}({M_1} + {M_2} - {M_2} + {M_1} + C)} hence :R=\\\\frac{{M_2} - {M_1} - C}{{M_1} + C/2} He goes on to rearrange this into: :{M_2} = {M_1} + C + {RM_1} + RC/2 This formula :\\"reveals that the market value at the end of any period must be equal to the beginning market value plus net contributions plus the rate of return earned of the assets in the fund at the beginning of the period and the return earned on one-half of the contributions. This assumes contributions are received midway through each investment period, and alternately, that half the contributions are received at the beginning of the period, and half at the end of the period.\\"  See also  * Internal rate of return * Modified Dietz method * Rate of return Further reading * MEASURING INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE  References  Category:Finance theories Category:Investment Category:Mathematical finance ","title":"Simple Dietz method"},{"id":"29527579","text":"Coram Children's Legal Centre (CCLC) is a UK charity founded in 1981 that works to promote children's rights both in the UK and abroad.

Biography John was a member of the Petraliphas family, which was of Italo- Norman origin. According to the hagiography of his daughter, Theodora of Arta, John was married to a woman called Helena, from an unspecified noble house of Constantinople, and after being raised to the very high rank of sebastokrator, was dispatched by Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185‚Äì1195 and 1203‚Äì1204) to govern Thessaly and Macedonia.. Nevertheless, in 1195, he was among the leading nobles who conspired and overthrew Isaac II and installed Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195‚Äì1203) in his place. After 1204, when Constantinople fell to the Fourth Crusade, he supported the ruler of Epirus Theodore Komnenos Doukas, to whom his sister Maria was married. He died probably sometime between 1224 and 1230.. Some authors (Donald Nicol and Demetrios Polemis) have equated him with another John Petraliphas, who was a megas chartoularios in the employ of the Empire of Nicaea circa 1237, but this identification is most likely false. Family From his marriage, John had several children. The hagiography records several sons, but only one son and two daughters are known by name:.. *Theodore Petraliphas, he married a daughter of Demetrios Tornikes, one of the leading ministers of John III Vatatzes of Nicaea (r. 1221‚Äì1254). Theodore defected to Nicaea in 1252/1253, only to defect back to Epirus a short while later.. *Theodora, she was wed as a child to Michael II Komnenos Doukas (r. 1231‚Äì1266/68), and was later canonized as Saint Theodora of Arta.. *Maria, she married a member of the Sphrantzes family and later widowed. The parakoimomenos Gabriel Sphrantzes may have been her son. It is also possible that she is the unidentified Petraliphaina reported by George Akropolites to have married Alexios the Slav, a cousin of Boril of Bulgaria and vassal of the Latin emperor Henry of Flanders..
