References  Category:Mountain ranges of Lassen County, California Category:Mountain ranges of Northern California ","title":"Skedaddle Mountains"},{"id":"20860135","text":"Carabane, also known as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme south-west of Senegal, in the mouth of the Casamance River. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a shoal and alluvium to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the mangrove trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of Ziguinchor Region, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a dry season and a wet season. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are mangos and oranges. Although the nearby Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have been closed for years because of the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals. The earliest known inhabitants of the island were the Jola, the ethnic group which is still the most populous on the island. The Portuguese were active in the region from the 16th century onwards; however, they did not linger on \\"Mosquito Island\\", the mosquitoes and black flies convincing them to establish their trading post in the town of Ziguinchor instead in 1645. On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of Kagnout in return for an annual payment of 196 francs. A series of treaties between the French and the leaders of the local peoples ensued; however, the inhabitants of Carabane did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them, resulting in lootings and abductions among French rice farmers by the Karoninka people. In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with S√©dhiou in 1886. Since , the population of the island has gradually declined for a variety of reasons including periods of drought, the Casamance Conflict and, more recently, the sinking of the ferry Joola in 2002. Much of the village's ability to trade and receive tourists was lost until 2014, when MV Aline Sitoe Diatta resumed ferry services to the island. Although Carabane was once a regional capital, the village has since become so politically isolated from the rest of the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies. The testimonies of explorers and colonial administrators demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and palm wine production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role in the lives of the population. Palm oil and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003. Toponymy The etymology of Carabane remains unclear. It could be connected to the Wolof word karaban√©, which means \\"who speaks a lot,\\" or possibly the Portuguese words casa and acaba, which mean \\"house\\" and \\"finish,\\" respectively. According to this hypothesis, the name means the place \\"where the houses are finished,\\" a possible allusion to the fact that this village was the first French capital in Basse Casamance. Thomas (July 1956), p. 79. According to other sources, the name comes from karam akam, which means \\"the other side of the river.\\" These uncertainties are augmented by the instability of the spelling: Karabane with an initial K suggests a Jola or Wolof origin, while Carabane with a C would suggest a Latin derivation, most probably through Portuguese or French.More rarely, one may find the spelling Karaban (notably in English and German sources) or Karabanne (particularly in Spanish and Portuguese sources). Although most of Carabane is covered in mangroves, its coconut trees and sandy beaches attract tourists. GeographyLocation= The shortest route to Carabane from the mainland is a half-hour motorized pirogue trip from Elinkine. With a total area of , Carabane is the last major island in the mouth of the Casamance River in south-west Senegal. It is situated 12¬∞ 32' N latitude and 16¬∞ 43' W longitude and is, by way of Elinkine, nearly away from Ziguinchor, the capital of the region of the same name, and a little over from Dakar, the country's capital. \\"Il faut s'armer de patience pour rejoindre l'√Æle de Carabane\\" is a common French phrase which means \\"One must have patience to reach the island of Carabane\\". While this adage continues to hold true, it was even more appropriate in the 19th century when, according to one traveller, a 26-hour boat trip from Rufisque (near Dakar) to Carabane was deemed fairly short, and was credited to a favourable wind. Benoist (2008), p. 212. Despite the seemingly close proximity to its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; S√©n√©gal et Gambie (2004), pp. 201-204. the trip once took an hour and a half by canoe. Benoist (2008), p. 254. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated. =Geology= Saltwater streams cut across the shoal. A recent geological formation, Brosselard-Faidherbe (1982), p. 10. Carabane consists of a shoal and alluvium. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils in the region are generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. Bertrand-Bocand√© (May-June 1849), p. 298. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of Mlomp and Seleki. Thomas (1958), p. 121. In this flat and marshy area, the branches and roots of mangrove trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus. Bertrand-Bocand√© (May-June 1849), p. 299. These tangles help retain soil,Greenway et al. (2002), p. 508. a process which expands the island where the power of tidal race would normally have the opposite effect.Endgeln (1952), p. 315. Rising just over , the southern portion of the island is partially flooded during the rainy season and totally submerged every few years. Saint-Martin (1989), pp. 126-27. At low tide, mudflats are exposed so that boats with keels are forced to dock a considerable distance from the island. When arriving at Carabane, the Joola had to stop about north of the village in of water. Because of their lack of clay, the island's inhabitants build their houses by wrapping straw around wooden frames. The coastal erosion and salinization affecting the west of Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, the site of the building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. Bertrand-Bocand√© (May-June 1849), p. 302. During the dry season the river has a tide-dominated delta, with tidewater reaching 200 km upstream, while it is being concentrated 50% by evaporation. Using wells, freshwater is available at a reasonable depth for irrigation and domestic purposes. Until the installation of a pump in 2006, however, drinking water had to be sent by boat from Elinkine. =Climate= The tropical climate of Basse Casamance cycles between a dry season and a wet season, which usually starts in June and ends in October. Bergen and Manga (1999), pp. 13-14. Because of the proximity to the ocean, the humidity of the air remains above 40% and contributes to the abundance of vegetation. With the trade winds from the Azores High, the island enjoys a pleasant climate year-round. In the north to north-east, these winds are cool and always wet. Sagna (2007), pp. 66-67. Their presence is appreciated by kitesurfers. Agricultural activities, including rice cultivation, depend entirely on rainfall. \\"Wah u≈ãejutumu, emit elaatut\\" is a Jola proverb which means \\"If a project will not be completed, it will be because the rain did not fall.\\" Diatta (1998), pp. 52-53. The invocation of fetishes when there is no rain is part of traditional animist rituals. In recent decades, there has been a general decline in rainfall, which threatens rice production, increases soil salinity, and contributes to the degradation of the mangroves. In May and June, air temperature is around . In January and February, the coldest months, it is around . Temperatures of below are quite rare. In September, the temperature of surface seawater is . =Flora= Mangroves are pervasive on the island. At one time, the island was considered an arid location, where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce. Marche (1879), p. 54. In what has become a tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious to attract the attention of the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator Emmanuel Bertrand- Bocand√© submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island. Bertrand-Bocand√© (May-June 1849), pp. 398-422. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.Mark (2002), p. 182. Most of Carabane is covered in mangroves, forming an impassable jungle that can only be crossed in constructed passages. Mangroves are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment, where the quantity of oxygen in the soil is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent. Marius (1976), pp. 669-691. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance. Because kapok wood is so easy to work, the trunks of kapok trees are often carved into pirogues. Tourists are not as attracted to the island for its mangroves as for the coconut trees which line its beaches, as featured on many of Carabane's postcards. Ropitault (November-December 2007), pp.23-24. These palm trees are a valued resource on the island. While not as plentiful as in other parts of Basse Casamance such as Mlomp, kapok trees are nonetheless present. Their grey wood is very light and easy to work, for which reasons it is used to construct many items, ranging from doors to dugouts. Jola canoes, which range from in length, are carved by adzes entirely out of one tree each, unlike the traditional Senegalese pirogue. Berghen and Manga (1999), p. 120. As for fruit trees, mangos and oranges are the most populous. Prickly pears, flamboyants, and colourful bougainvilleas brighten the scenery of hotels and camps on the island. Various organizations have contributed to the deforestation of the island. =Fauna= A variety of bird species, such as the little bee-eater, may be viewed among the mangroves on the island. The wide variety of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytes) and yellow- fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).Barlow et al. (1997). Page 3 gives an overview of the birds typical of the coastal and riverine habitats, and the ranges of the listed birds are found under their species' accounts. Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island. Bottlenose dolphins are plentiful in the Casamance River. The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets, although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835. Beslier (1935), p. 111. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. Roche (2000), p. 181. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds. On an island called Ilha dos Mosquitos (Portuguese for \\"Mosquito Island\\"), Negocios externos (1887), p. 90. the natives and their visitors continue to protect themselves with mosquito nets and Shea butter. They must also protect themselves from other, smaller insects which are no less troublesome: black flies (Simulium). Petit Fut√© S√©n√©gal (2008-2009), p. 266. HistoryFirst inhabitants= Animism in Carabane: inhabitants cursing a fetish because their prayers have failed to make it rain (1893 engraving) The traditions of the local peoples are unanimous in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the Bainuk people and that the left bank of the mouth of the river was first populated by the Jola. Roche (2000), p. 21. Benoist (2008), p. 160. Portuguese sailors reached the west African coast in the 15th century, and in the 16th century, Portuguese traders became active in the Casamance region, mostly in search of wax, ivory, and slaves. They did not linger on \\"Mosquito Island\\", instead founding their first trading post at Ziguinchor in 1645. Roche (2000), p. 67. In the late 1820s, Roche (2000), p. 77. a mulatto trader from Gor√©e, Pierre Baudin, moved to Itou and began planting rice and producing lime by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime kilns. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.Klein (1998), p. 30. The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gor√©e were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, who was in charge of Gor√©e, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted. Roche (2000), pp. 76-77. =French colonization= On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of Kagnout at an annual cost of 196 francs. Roche (2000), p. 76. Still, another treaty made S√©dhiou the primary trading post of Casamance, and the exploitation of Carabane was left for some time in the hands of the Baudin family, first Pierre then his brother Jean. Each successively took on the title of Resident. With this official but ambiguous title, they were permitted to continue their trading operation so long as they regularly reported to France. Saint-Martin (2000), p. 126. The longest pier on the coast of Africa When Jean Baudin fell into disgrace due to a serious incident involving an English ship, he was replaced as Resident in October 1849 by Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocand√©. Roche (2000), pp. 82-83. This multilingual, enterprising businessman and entomologist from Nantes transformed \\"his\\" island, sparking a resurgence of commercial and political activity. In 1852, the population surpassed 1,000 inhabitants. A cadastral map assigned tracts of to traders and contractors. Other tracts of were allotted for housing. Provisional concessions were granted to residents of Saint-Louis and Gor√©e. Other than settlers, the island was mainly inhabited by animist Jola farmers, whose practices were disconcerting to the settlers. Coexistence was not always easy. Christianity was practiced by the Europeans and some of the residents of Gor√©e, although the island did not yet have a church. Missionaries tried but were not permitted to settle on the island. Roche (2000), p. 37. The construction of a wharf long allowed the berthing of larger vessels coming in from Casamance. A railed pier was built along the river in order to facilitate the transfer of goods. Carabane exported rice, but also cotton, considered to be of poor quality, Vallon (February-March 1862), p. 465. which was ginned in a factory built by Bertrand-Bocand√© in 1840, owned first by Maurel & Prom and then by the Casamance Company. The factory also produced almonds and crabwood (Carapa procera). Roche (2000), p. 87. Bertrand-Bocand√© became involved in local African politics during his time as Resident. When an intertribal conflict led to an armed raid of Carabane, he mediated the conflict. In 1850, the island's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock raid which precipitated further incidents the following year. In response to this conflict with the former owners of Carabane, the residents of Kagnout, Bertrand-Bocand√© convinced the governor of Senegal to send a warship to Carabane to frighten off the raiders. This single ship failed to faze the island's opponents, therefore Bertrand-Bocand√© requested a detachment of soldiers and several other ships from the governor. When these reinforcements arrived from Gor√©e, the conflict was successfully ended. A treaty was signed on March 25, establishing the sovereignty of France not only in Casamance, but also in Kagnout and Samatit. Clerq (1987). For his involvement in the conflict, Bertrand-Bocand√© was accepted into the L√©gion d'honneur and was given a land concession.Aldrich (1996), p. 37. Bertrand-Bocand√© left the island in 1857 for a leave of absence, but he abandoned his post as Resident in 1860. His tireless activity had a lasting effect on the island. Saint- Martin (1989), p. 186. The Casamance Company's first factory (1893 engraving) The Casamance Company's second factory Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them. For this reason, rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the Karoninka people. Troops led by √âmile Pinet-Laprade attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860, forcing them to submission. A period of calm ensued. While the Mandinka Muslims continued, illegally, to practice slavery and trade, non-Muslim villages tended to come together, accepting the Resident of Carabane as the arbitrator of their disagreements. Saint-Martin (1989), p. 457. In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with S√©dhiou in 1886. Its garrison of a dozen men was regularly stricken with tropical diseases such as malaria. In 1877, 527 people were counted on the island, mostly Jola, but also some Wolofs, Muslims, and a few Manjacks from Portuguese Guinea. Roche (2000), pp. 180-181. The first Catholic mission in S√©dhiou was founded in 1875 and the first baptisms were celebrated that same year in Carabane. There were 17 people baptised in total, most of whom were residents of the island. The Holy Ghost Fathers' mission in Carabane was founded in 1880 by Father Kieffer. On February 22, he settled on the island, but he served for only two years. Benoist (2008), p. 196. The staff of the colonial administration was small: the manager of a customs post with four employees, a gunner, a corporal, and six European tirailleurs. There were approximately 250 Christians in Carabane, mostly mulattos. The priest built his house out of Palmyra palm trunks. He visited nearby villages and sometimes went to S√©dhiou. The founding of the mission in Carabane was followed by others in Ziguinchor (1888), Elinkine (1891), and several nearby locations in the 20th century. In 1900, a Spiritan missionary, Father Wintz,In 1909, Father Wintz wrote a French‚ÄîJola dictionary published by the Elinkine Mission, and reedited in 1968. wrote the first catechism in the Jola language. Tom√†s i Guilera (2005), p. 305. Temporarily transferred to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although they immediately expanded the church building, it was still not large enough to accommodate all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, Magloire-D√©sir√© Barthet, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic feast day of Saint Anne in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many catechumen. Competition between the French and the Portuguese began to show itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese- operated trading posts in Cacheu and Farim asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and S√©dhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French.Barry (1998), p. 221. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was negotiated in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe. In 1901, the administrative capital of Casamance was transferred from Carabane to Ziguinchor, a status which was transferred in turn to Oussouye two years later. By 1904, Carabane had lost several of its amenities, including its customs services, which were centralized. The island's trading houses were abandoned and the number of Christians dwindled from 1,000 to 300 by 1907. Benoist (2008), p. 292 Despite the anti-clerical movement's growth in France at the time, education in Carabane continued to be administered by the Holy Ghost Fathers for the boys and by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny for the girls. A chapel also continued to be run on the island. In 1913, just before the outbreak of , Carabane suffered a fire which caused its business to decline. People gradually left the island in search of work in Ziguinchor and even Dakar. Roche (2000), p. 322. In December 1915, Marcel de Coppet, administrator of Ziguinchor, visited the island in order to recruit tirailleurs. Six inhabitants of the island accepted the position: a Christian, a pagan, and four Muslims. Roche (2000), p. 328. In the aftermath of the Great War, the Roman Catholic Church encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began to wear on the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Gor√©e, Rufisque, Thi√®s, Ngazobil, Joal, Fadiouth, Foundiougne, Kaolack, Ziguinchor, Bignona and Banjul. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of Islam in the country. Benoist (2008), pp. 324-325. In taking leadership of the diocese, Archbishop Le Hunsec noted that the island of Carabane, heavily populated when trading was concentrated there, had lost its influence and now had fewer than 500 inhabitants. Benoist (2008), p. 339. He considered transferring the mission to Oussouye, which became a reality in 1927. Starting in 1937, the mission in Oussouye also performed baptisms and funerals in Carabane. In the same year, a reform school was created on the island, operating until 1953, when it was replaced by another in Nianing. Thioub (1997), pp. 73‚Äì74 A report submitted in 1938 by an educational advisor to Marcel de Coppet, Governor General of French West Africa, detailed the daily life of the prisoners in the school which housed up to 22 boys, mostly convicted for theft but also occasionally for murder. =Recent history= Carabane's population continued to decline gradually after . In 1950, the construction of a seminary was planned in Carabane, Benoist (2008), p. 410. but it was transferred to a new building in Nyassia in 1959. The Carabane mission closed its doors during the wet season of 1953, 83 years after its inception. The nuns and their interns moved to Ziguinchor. Thomas (April 1964), pp. 13-46. The sinking of the Joola (pictured) in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists. Senegal's independence was declared on August 20, 1960, and after the dissolution of the short-lived Mali Federation, Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims, they did not know the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of drought that ravaged the Sahel in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all that grew. Diatta (2008), pp. 160-161. Discontent began to spread among the people, which sometimes escalated to violence. Casamance has since experienced years of conflict which put local initiatives in jeopardy, such as nature reserves and the first network of villages. Scibilia (2003), p. 174. In 1998, in the middle of the conflict, the French commune of Bon-Encontre committed to providing Carabane with humanitarian aid, both economically and culturally. Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, a few small incidents were reported around April 2000. The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane's reputation to attract media attention. Tom√†s i Guilera (2005), p. 414. The ceasefire of 2004 brought relative peace, but in the meantime, the sinking of the Joola in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along with the threat of coastal erosion on the island, some fear the worst. Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways. Scibilia (2003), p. 40. SocietyAdministration= Oussouye Prefecture Formerly an administrative district in its own right,Between 1939 and 1944, the colonial authorities of the AOF were Vichyites and anti- Gaullists, unlike those of the AEF, especially because of the governor of Chad, F√©lix √âbou√©. even a regional capital, Carabane is now just one of 23 villages in the rural community of Diemb√©ring, of which Kabrousse, Cap Skirring, and Boucott-Diemb√©ring are the largest centres. This rural community is located in the Kabrousse Arrondissement. It is part of Oussouye Department, the smallest and least central of the three departments in Ziguinchor Region. In a country which includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council. Diop (2006), pp. 119-121. After consultation, the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect and approved by the Minister of the Interior. Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including law enforcement, tax collection, and keeping of vital records in the village. While this administrative structure was decreed by a government anxious to deal with interlocutors, such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance. Berghen and Manga (1999), pp. 21-22. Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy.Gregg and Trillo (2003), p. 246 It has no leader with genuine permanent authority. Instead, there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made. According to Italian anthropologist Paolo Palmeri, Palmeri (1995), pp. 53-55. the leader of the village has very little power in reality, as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration. He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions. In a society where politics are inextricably linked to religion, the real holders of power are the fetish priests. Palmeri (1995), pp. 57-59. The very notion of a village is almost inappropriate in this context: it might be more appropriately considered a clan or an aggregation of kinship. Other specialists, such as Christian Sina Diatta, compare Jola communities to those of mound-building termites, in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable. Diatta (1996), p. 20. =Population= An akonting is a Jola chordophone. In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major ethnic groups in Senegal by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Diouf (1998), p. 201. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance,Linares (2007), p. 5. but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, Lebous, and Serers (including Niominka fishermen). Diouf (1998), p. 74. Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gor√©e at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from Guinea (the Susu people) and the other from Guinea-Bissau, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: Ghanaians, Guineans, and Gambians. Petit Fut√© S√©n√©gal (2008-2009), p. 211. The indigenous population was originally animist, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, Foucher (2002), p. 376. the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Diouf (1998), p. 117. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim. Tom√†s i Guilera (2005), p. 322. =Education and health= The kindergarten was founded in 1988. Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. Benoist (2008), p. 253. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Diouf (1998), p. 184. The primary school hosts six classes. Carabane has a new primary school, √âcole Fran√ßois Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year. In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school. As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor. It provides vaccinations, family planning consultations, and prenatal information. A maternity hospital was founded in 1991 which is decorated with a fresco by Malang Badji, one of the most famous artists in the region. The Ph.D. thesis published in 2003, La part de l'autre: une aventure humaine en terre Diola, meaning \\"Part of the Other: A Human Adventure in Jola Territory,\\" describes the health challenge present on the island in a more general context. Petit (2003), p. 239. In particular, the location of the island does not allow easy access to serious or urgent medical assistance. There is a pirogue-ambulance for the transportation of people off the island in the case of medical emergencies. Economy The testimonies of explorers and colonial administrators demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and palm wine production for centuries. Thomas (1958), pp. 79-90. The island experienced a decline in the 20th century, when Ziguinchor emerged as the regional capital, and more recently because of the negative economic consequences resulting from the Casamance Conflict and the Joola tragedy. =Transportation and energy= From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's position at the mouth of the river was an undeniable asset. In the 20th and 21st centuries, in terms of trade and tourism issues, this location is more of a disadvantage because it effectively separates the island from the rest of the country. In order to arrive at Carabane from most locations in Senegal, travellers must cross The Gambia at either Banjul or Farafenni. solar-powered street lights. While a direct route by sea has not been available since the sinking of the Joola, the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some national roads connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to Kaolack. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and the river), the former running through Nioro du Rip to Farafenni, and the latter crossing the river to Banjul. The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7 p.m. and 10 a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant demining operations. Alternatively, it is possible to travel by plane to the airport in Ziguinchor or Cap Skirring, or to travel by boat to one of these locations. Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward. By boat, the distance between Dakar and Carabane is , although Ziguinchor is only away. Before the launch of the Joola, other boats, mostly well-worn ones, made the connection: first Cap Skirring, then the Casamance Express, and then Island Karabane. Diouf (1998), pp. 174-175. In January 1991, a brand new ferry went into operation. Like its predecessors, it connected Dakar to Ziguinchor, stopping near Carabane where canoes could reach the island. On September 26, 2002, 180 extra passengers boarded the already overloaded ship at this stop,This figure does not take into account the passengers who boarded without a ticket. Members of the military and their families were allowed to ride free of charge. and a few hours later, the Joola sank. For security reasons, the Joola's successor, the Wilis, stopped calling at Carabane, to the great displeasure of the inhabitants. Tourists became rare after that, and from time to time, inhabitants of the island found it necessary to move to Dakar or Ziguinchor.These difficulties were presented in the French documentary Un nouveau bateau pour la Casamance, meaning \\"A New Boat for Casamance\\", as part of the Thalassa series on December 1, 2006, Web.archive.org Significant modifications to the MV Aline Sitoe Diatta, which replaced the Wilis in March 2008, were considered to allow it to stop safely at the island, and the construction of a berth was announced. Souleymane Nd√©n√© Ndiaye, who later became Prime Minister of Senegal, laid the first stone of the berth in July 2008, and the entire construction project was financed by the Senegalese government at an estimated cost of 12 billion West African CFA francs. On April 26, 2014, the MV Aline Sitoe Diatta stopped at the Carabane berth for the first time, improving transportation for locals and tourists. , the ferry stops at Carabane four times each week in the middle of its trips between Dakar and Ziguinchor. =Agriculture and aquaculture=Rice cultivation The lower part of a kayendo ends in a sharp wrought iron blade. In Basse Casamance, the rice cycle structures the lives of the population and plays a central economic and religious role. Di√©dhiou (2004), p. 339. The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance, practice a unique form of rice cultivation. Atlas du S√©n√©gal (2007), p. 121. Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first Portuguese explorers, show them to be similar to those still in use, particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed, Palmeri (1995), pp. 152. from African rice to Asian rice, a separate species. The basic tool used is the kayendo,Also spelled kajandu, kajendo, kadiendo, or kadiandou a kind of wooden spade or shovel ranging from , surrounded by a sharp wrought iron blade and attached to a very long, straight, cylindrical neck. The two parts are connected by strips of torn Palmyra palm leaves. The main part is manufactured from a very hard wood measuring in length. The kayendo is mainly used to plough rice fields, but is also used for other purposes, such as excavation and construction. Berghen and Manga (1999), pp. 54-56. Men perform the clearing and ploughing while the women take care of the sowing, replanting, and weeding as well as the harvesting between October and January. An even checkerboard plot model dominates the green landscape during the rainy season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ only in terms of soil type and location. Berghen and Manga (1999), pp. 56-75. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested at the end of the rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil. Levees are used to protect the rice paddy fields from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice cultivation has been threatened since the late 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, even though they continue to support their community. Foucher (2002), pp. 389-390. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation. Palm oil and palm wine Among the agricultural activities practised during the dry season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women. Palmeri (1995), pp. 178-179. Oil palm fruit clusters are integral to the local cuisine. Equipment for harvesting palm wine traditionally includes the calabash; however, this natural container has mostly been replaced by synthetic bottles. Palm wine (called or in the Jola language) is an alcoholic drink derived from the natural fermentation of palm sap, so is not strictly a wine, which is produced by the fermentation of grapes. The recent partial Islamization of the region has not challenged its consumption. Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men. Supported by a strap, the harvester climbs the tree, cuts the bud, and holds out a funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated calabash or, more recently, a bottle. The alcohol content of palm wine develops throughout the day. The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis, and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to fetishes. Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city. Many Jola proverbs attest the popularity of the drink, such as , which means \\"With palm wine, one never stands up,\\" or , which means \\"Sit down, don't spill the palm wine.\\" Datta (1998), pp. 396-398. Aquaculture The island's proximity to the river and the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment. Cormier-Salem (July-August 1985), pp. 448-454. The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance, Cormier-Salem (1989), pp. 91-107. which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite C√¥te and Sine- Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers. Mangrove oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees. Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler crabs and shrimp, among the mangroves also occupy a significant place in the local economy. While a large number of shrimp species inhabit the Senegambian area, a single family exists in Casamance: Penaeidae. Southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis) are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed the extent to which the shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over- salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people. Grouped into cooperatives,An example of a cooperative run by women: women play a leading role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and processing shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently. Cormier (1985), pp. 267-273. =Tourism= Kitesurfing is a common tourist activity in Carabane. The Republic of Senegal placed an emphasis on tourism early in its history. The results were promising, and developing the industry further became a priority in the country's 4th Economic and Social Plan (1973-1977). Scibilia (2003), p. 17. Casamance subsequently became the main tourist destination in the country. Already having been described in the 19th century by Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe as a kind of Brazil in Africa, Carabane seemed well-placed to attract visitors in search of exoticism as well as vacationers seeking sandy beaches and kite surfing. At the same time, national and even international controversy threatened the industry from the beginning. Those who opposed tourism in Senegal described it as a new form of colonialism while supporters saw it as a panacea that would cure the country of underdevelopment. Schelecten (1988), p. 442. The idea of alternative tourism was discussed. Several towns in Basse Casamance, including Carabane, were selected to test an integrated agritourism managed by the villagers themselves. In the early 1970s, the agritourism promoter Christian Saglio, a young French sociologist who later became the director of the Leopold Sedar Senghor French Institute in Dakar, believed in Carabane's potential. He stated that he wanted to make the island the \\"Gor√©e of Casamance\\", using it as a hub for other camps. Saglio suggested the restoration of old buildings and canopy beds. Scibilia (2003), p. 41. The Catholic mission house built in 1880 has since been turned into a hotel. Despite his fervour, Saglio's negotiations with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. Scibilia (2003), p. 35. The project was eventually abandoned, and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.The camps were set up in Elinkine, Enampore, Ba√Øla, Thionck Essyl, Coubalan, Affiniam, Ab√©n√©, Oussouye and Palmarin. While Carabane's tourism sector has suffered because it has not taken part in the network of villages, tourists have avoided travelling to Casamance in general because of the civil unrest. The signing of a ceasefire in 2004 allowed tourism to resume, but not to the extent it had reached before the conflict. Tour operators continue to advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers' exotic dreams come to life, Ropitault (November-December 2007), pp. 16-25. but this type of discovery tourism is not as popular as traditional beach-related tourism. Thus, visitors from France, Spain, and Italy often combine tours of the cases √° impluvium in Enampore or Mlomp with a few days of relaxation in Carabane. The area is also very conducive to the interests of fishing enthusiasts. Along the beach, small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes at prices lower than those in Cap Skirring or Saly. Badji Malang, a local painter, potter, sculptor, and poet, has created a camp in the area. Although remaining separate from the local tourism network, Carabane has demonstrated its support for social solidarity and holism by joining GENSEN (Global Ecovillage Network Senegal), a network of Senegalese ecovillages. =Historic sites= The interior of the church The grave of Captain Protet who was buried standing up The plaque on Captain Protet's grave (died in 1836) Remnants of the former colonial presence (photo taken in 2008) Carabane has many historic sites, such as the Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since been turned into a hotel, a Brittany-style church building which is no longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing up in front of the sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste L√©opold Protet, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque. Near the beach are ruins of buildings, pontoons, and wells, with a large tree in the center. A huge piece of metal in its midst bears the inscription CEO Forrester & Co. Vauxhall Foundry. 18 Liverpool S3. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003. An application for Carabane to become a World Heritage Site was filed with UNESCO on November 18, 2005. Inspired by Gor√©e's example, Carabane is attempting to pay homage to victims of slavery by starting a small museum like the House of Slaves. Like Gor√©e and Saint-Louis, Carabane places great importance on its cultural heritage. The architectural reminders of this heritage require significant restoration as they have experienced considerable degradation. In 1964, French anthropologist Louis- Vincent Thomas posed the question of whether Carabane should be preserved, and this question continues to be relevant. The local people suggest that the entire Diogue‚ÄìNikine‚ÄìCarabane area needs saving.

Life  Angelica Pauline Amalie Gotter was born on 29 December 1786. Her parents were the playwright, Privy Councilor (\\"Geheimrat\\") and archivist Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter and Louise Gotter (n√©e Stiege). Her mother was a close friend of Caroline Schlegel (n√©e Michaelis), while her father had been close friends with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe since his youth. Pauline Gotter had two sisters and knew Goethe and Caroline Schlegel from childhood on. In her youth she was friends with Sylvie von Ziegesar and the painter Louise Seidler. Together with her friends, she had access to Jena's most elevated intellectual circles, which at that time comprised such creative minds as Friedrich Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, the Alexander brothers and Wilhelm von Humboldt, the brothers Friedrich and August Wilhelm Schlegel, Friedrich Tieck, Clemens Brentano, Vo√ü, Paulus, Niethammer, Zacharias Werner and others. Pauline Gotter loved her mother's friends. Caroline Schlegel was an intelligent woman who had sided with the French Revolution, and as a result was nearly arrested for treason. Her daughter, who was almost the same age as Pauline Gotter, was the first love of the philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling, a rising star in Jena's intellectual world, and a passionate follower of Johann Gottlieb Fichte. When she fell sick with dysentery in 1800, he tried desperately to find some means by which to stave off her death. Pauline Gotter and her family were forced to stand by as accusations were made of Schelling and rumors were spread. \\"Schelling,\\" said Dorothea Veit, \\"had a hand in it.\\" Jena's literary magazine, the Jenaische Allgemeine Literaturzeitung, reported, \\"He cares for her 'flawlessly' and kills her 'honestly.'\\" Rumors, accusations, and gossip didn't die down, and August Wilhelm Schlegel and his wife Caroline divorced in 1803 at Goethe's behest. Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling married her two months later. They left Jena together in 1804 and moved to W√ºrzburg, where Schelling received a teaching position at the university, and Caroline Schelling stood faithfully by her new husband's side. In 1806 Pauline Gotter stayed with her friend Sylvie von Ziegesar in Karlsbad, where Goethe courted Ziegesar and dedicated some of his poems to her. Her friend Louise Seidler also enjoyed the favor of the German prince of poets, who instructed her to paint a portrait of him. Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling On 7 September 1809, Caroline Schelling (formerly Schlegel) died suddenly. Pauline Gotter and her family were very distraught at her death. They wrote letters and paid visits to Schelling in an effort to console him, but he became progressively more withdrawn and expressed growing criticism of science and of the church. This increasingly intimate correspondence lead to his engagement with Pauline Gotter. On 11 June 1812, Pauline Gotter married Friedrich Wilhelm Schelling, who was eleven years her senior, and who was elevated to the nobility and invited to join to the Academy of Science in Munich in the same year. On 17 December 1813 their first child was born. Five more followed. One of their daughters was named Caroline, in honor of Friedrich's first wife. Pauline Schelling took charge of running the house and raising the children. Her letters possessed a natural, spirited grace, though they lacked the intellectual significance of his first wife's writings. She was in this respect no substitute for Caroline in Friedrich's eyes, and he grew unpersonable and withdrew rapidly into incoherent writings on mythology and irritated responses to Hegel as he ascended to scholarly fame. Pauline Schelling died on 31 December 1854, four months after her husband.  References  *  Further reading  * * Goethe, Johann Wolfgang. Gedenkausgabe der Werke, Briefe und Gespr√§che.

It held an annual conference which was regarded as being representative of the opinion of the party's rank and file and was broadly the equivalent of a present-day party conference. Foundation The inaugural conference of the National Liberal Federation (NLF) was held in Bingley Hall, Birmingham, on 31 May 1877, with the objective of promoting Liberalism, encouraging the formation of new associations and the strengthening and democratising of existing local Liberal parties. The conference was chaired by Joseph Chamberlain and addressed by Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone. New associations quickly formed throughout the country and affiliated to the NLF which was a coordinating body rather than one which operated a central control. Purpose The task of the NLF was \\"to form new Liberal Associations based on popular representation\\". While the NLF always insisted the policies recommended by the members at its conferences were never intended to be binding on the Liberal leadership, it was obvious that the resolutions passed were a strong indication of thinking and feeling in the mass party which the leadership ignored at its peril. For example, in 1914 the NLF came out in support of women's suffrage, and H. H. Asquith (who was personally opposed to the measure) decided it should receive government support.. Birmingham \\"The Caucus\\": 1892 caricature of Francis Schnadhorst, Secretary of the National Liberal Federation 1877‚Äì93, published in Vanity Fair The NLF's early associations were with the city of Birmingham. Its structure ‚Äì which became known as the \\"Caucus\\" ‚Äì was modelled on that of the Birmingham Liberal Association, founded in 1865, which had been so effective in building a mass membership and an efficient electioneering body in the city under the political leadership of Joseph Chamberlain, and drawing on the strategic and organisational skills of William Harris (secretary 1868‚Äì73) and Francis Schnadhorst (secretary 1873‚Äì84). At the establishment of the NLF, Chamberlain was elected its president (1877‚Äì80), Harris its chairman (1877‚Äì82), Schnadhorst its salaried secretary (1877‚Äì93), and John Skirrow Wright, another Birmingham activist, its treasurer (1877‚Äì1880). Political orientation In the Liberal split over Irish Home Rule the NLF was loyal to party leader Gladstone rather than its own progenitor Joseph Chamberlain, who left the Liberal party and formed the Liberal Unionist faction and coalition with Conservatives. However, in its political orientation generally the NLF conference tended to take the Radical approach, most clearly in its support of the Newcastle Programme in 1891 (see below). Here it endorsed the extension of the Factory Acts, the introduction of universal male suffrage, an end to plural voting and the reform of the House of Lords. This brought conflict with Gladstone until his retirement from politics in 1894. However, by 1900 the role of the NLF had become merely advisory in term of policy.Barberis et al. 2001, pp. 314‚Äì15. Relationship with the Liberal Central Association (LCA)Formation of the LCA= There was always the possibility of a clash between the NLF and the Liberal Central Association (LCA), the body (first known as the Liberal Registration Association) which had been formed on 21 February 1860 by twenty Liberal MPs to promote general co-operation between MPs and organisation in the constituencies. It changed its name to the LCA in 1874 and re-modelled its structure and purpose to become the \\"central medium of communication with and between the Party throughout the whole kingdom in aid of and in connection with local organization\\". The chairman of the LCA was originally the Leader of the Liberal MPs but by the end of the 19th century it was the Liberal Chief Whip. As the 19th century wore on, the role of the LCA changed from that of a members' association to that of a Liberal Whips' Office. It put local Liberal Associations in touch with potential candidates and made grants of money to help with elections. It had no policy role but supporters of various factions within the party did try to capture the offices of the LCA from time to time, most notably in the dissensions in the party over imperialism.Douglas 1971, pp. 11‚Äì17. =Amalgamation= The likelihood of a clash between LCA and NLF was greatly reduced when the NLF moved to London in 1886 into premises at 42 Parliament Street,The Times, 5 February 1889. next door to the LCA offices which were located at 41 Parliament Street.The Times, 11 February 1892. It also helped that Francis Schnadhorst, the efficient political organiser and secretary of the NLF was also appointed secretary of the LCA. =Liberal Publications Department= The NLF produced some political literature early in its history. However, in 1887 the NLF and LCA collaborated in the establishment of the new Liberal Publications Department, and these three organisations subsequently worked closely together at the administrative heart of the party.Douglas 1971, p. 15. The Newcastle Programme After the split between the party and Chamberlain over Home Rule, and the support the NLF offered to Gladstone, the NLF began to be more fully aware of the influence it was acquiring. This culminated with the Newcastle Programme of 1891, designed to be a co-ordinated programme of policies for radical reform springing from the grass-roots of the party ‚Äì a manifesto for the next general election. 1900‚Äì1936 Organisationally the NLF was the pillar of the Liberal Party. Under the presidency of Augustine Birrell it played an important role in the Liberal landslide election victory of 1906. It was active in promoting the Free Trade campaign after 1903 and through the work of Robert Hudson helped put in place a number of local pacts with the newly founded Labour Representation Committee. During the First World War, despite the opposition of many Liberals, the NLF helped to rally recruitment to the armed forces. After 1918 the NLF began to experience some financial difficulties but was able to remain solvent under the presidencies of Sir George Lunn and J. M. Robertson.Barberis et al. 2001, pp. 314‚Äì15. They, together with secretary Robert Hudson, remained staunch supporters of H. H. Asquith and as a result Lloyd George had to keep his own National Liberal organisation in place between 1918 and 1922. When Asquith died and Lloyd George became party leader in 1926, Hudson who was by then NLF Treasurer, resigned. The NLF continued in being until 1936 when an internal review of party organisation under Lord Meston recommended its replacement with a body with a different remit, the Liberal Party Organisation.

Gandzieli (literally meaning \\"of Gandza\\") was a noble family of Dukes (Tavadi) and later of Marquesses (Aznauri) in the Kingdom of Georgia, in the period between 1083 and 1727. According to an extensive study of the surnames of Georgian nobility by Prince Vakhushti Bagrationi, Gandzieli's held the dukedom in Gandza, then Armenia currently part of Azerbaijan. Gandzielis lost their dominance over the Armenian duchy in 1727, as a consequence of the \\"lowering of the Kingdom of ArmeniaPrince Vakhushti Bagrationi\\" and moved to Principality of Ksani, Georgia. However, due to the failure to sustain power in Gandza, the Georgian monarch Vakhtang VI of Kartli lowered Gandzielis to the rank of Aznauri which was equal to that of Marquess at the time. In Ksani, Gandzielis assumed the title of the Royal Aznauri of Ksani, the highest of all the Aznauri degrees and led the court of the Principals of Ksani alongside other noble families. Gandzielis have been mentioned in the Treaty of Georgievsk as the Royal Aznauris of Ksani Principality alongside several other noble families. However, Gandzielis later moved to the Kingdom of Imereti where their surname changed to that of Gegelia. This occurred \\"due to the linguistic traditions\\" of the Imereti people as Bagrationi reported in his study.

G. Harris. The mythology of the series includes a fictional prophecy of the ancient Maya of a catastrophic event that will occur in December 2012. It follows the story of young Joshua Garcia (Josh) as he travels in the Mayan ruins following the work of his archaeologist father Andres Garcia. He is accompanied by his three friends: 15-year-old Tyler Marks, a fellow capoeira fighter; 14-year-old Ixchel, his forced wife-to-be; and his 18-year-old cousin, Benicio. The first book, Invisible City, was published in February 2008. The second, Ice Shock, was published in March 2009, the third, Zero Moment, in Feb 2010, and the fourth, Dark Parallel, in April 2011. The fifth and final book, Apocalypse Moon, was released in April 2012. InstallmentsInvisible City= Joshua Garcia, the main character of the story is a 13-year-old boy. One day, while practicing Capoeira in his martial arts class, he is asked promptly to leave for home, where he receives the news of his father's death in a plane crash in Mexico. Joshua refuses to believe this story and finds some extremely strange and baffling facts about his father's death. He comes up with his own conspiracy theory ‚Äî abduction by aliens ‚Äî after having seen UFOs in the sky. Later the investigators say that Andres (his father, an archaeologist) had been murdered by the husband of a woman, with whom he supposedly had 'affairs'. Joshua reads his dad's emails and finds out that his father was involved in the search for an ancient Maya script called the Ix codex. He sets up a blog to write about his conspiracy theories where he meets Ollie, or Olivia Dotrice (also known as TopShopPrincess) and Tyler Marks at a bookstore. He also meets his long lost sister but she is killed in a swamp. The story revolves around their investigation of Andres' murder and search for the Ix Codex and the lost cities of Ek Naab and Chechan Naab. =Ice Shock= Ice Shock is the sequel to Invisible City. Josh is back home, trying to resume his normal life and make sense of his Mayan adventures. But soon it becomes clear that being back in Oxford does not mean Josh can escape his destiny. He is even more certain now that his father's death was no accident‚Äîand he's starting to wonder if he can really trust his closest allies. There is a traitor among him; is it Tyler or Ollie? Soon after, Benicio reunites him and Ixchel. When he finds out The Sect are following him, he can not hide. On top of that Simon Madison is out for revenge. His adventures lead him to an ancient mountain where he finds out a shocking secret. That is when the real adventure begins. =Zero Moment= Zero Moment is the third book in the series. Josh is trying to learn what the Sect of Huracan is actually trying to do, Josh realises there is no turning back now. He travels to Brazil to contend in a capoeira contest with Tyler and his mother. They come across Carlos Montoyo and Ixchel and the five go on an adventure buggy ride across the desert. Just when Josh thinks everything is alright, Tyler, his mother and Ixchel are kidnapped by the Sect. After returning to Ek Naab, Josh thinks he has discovered the key to time travel. Should he use it to go back in time and save his father? Ixchel knows what he intends to do. Should she stop him? It is up to Josh to travel to the zero moment, change time and try to save his father, and potentially save the world. =Dark Parallel= The fourth in the series was released on 4 April 2011. Josh and Ixchel have travelled back in time, but it might not be so easy to get home again. They have landed in the Mayan era, when the prophecy about the world ending in 2012 was first foretold. And they cannot believe who they have found there. Clearly Josh is not the only person to have cracked the secret of time travel. But a bigger surprise awaits the pair when they return to the 21st century. It seems that the Bracelet of Itzamna has created a parallel universe where only one revival chamber exists. Nothing is quite as they remember it - and it is up to them to work out why this has happened. With scenes of wild chases and races. =Apocalypse Moon= The fifth and final book was released on April 5, 2012. After running out of ideas on how to protect the world from 2012 galactic superwave, Josh decides to use the Bracelet of Itzamna to time-jump into the future. He witnesses a complete apocalypse in a reality in which the superwave hits earth and the Sect of Huracan take over the world's governments. In order to save the world, he returns to his time and searches for the \\"moon machine\\", a device that will protect the world from the superwave. With the help of the last of the Erinsi and his friend Tyler, he manages to establish a force field around earth, that holds back the electromagnetic wave. The Descendant - Alternate Reality Game Ice Shock was launched in the UK (Mar 2009) along with The Descendant, an ARG in which another story from The Joshua Files unfolded. The Descendant included material from a dozen websites, including videos, blogs and an avatar chat site, as well a clue printed in the UK edition of Ice Shock itself. Competitions M.G Harris has organized some competitions for the books, These are Crack the Code, Crack the Code - The Second Code and Make your own fake ICE SHOCK video trailer. Neon-Sleeve Jacket The UK, French, German, Spanish, Catalan and Hungarian editions feature a much-commented-upon, highly innovative jacket design - a neon PVC removable sleeve with a die-cut 'J'. The designer is Andrew Biscombe of Scholastic Children's Books UK. Invisible City was published with a luminous orange sleeve, Ice Shock with a luminous green/yellow sleeve and Zero Moment a dark green. For book 3, Zero Moment, the neon-sleeved edition has been restricted to a limited collectible version of only 4700 in the UK, all of which were signed by M.G. Harris. Invisible City and Ice Shock have now gone through the same routine, with the neon sleeve versions no longer being made and being made collectable. They are now being published in paperback as well but still following the same colour line. Book four, Dark Parallel, was published with the neon cover being made at a normal basis, not a collectors edition. The cover is a shade of blue this time. The normal paperback version was published in September 2011 with a black cover and a red 'J' printed on the cover.https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1407111035 The last book in the series, Apocalypse Moon, which was published in April 2012 has a black PVC sleeve.

Van Mierop confirmed that they would do so and would guarantee a pre-existing duty of White to pay Pillans. However, before the bills were drawn on Van Mierop, White went insolvent. Van Mierop refused to honour the bills and argued that Pillans had not provided consideration for their guarantee since there was the rule that past consideration is not a good consideration.

It is the supremum (least upper bound) of all countable ordinals. The elements of œâ1 are the countable ordinals (including finite ordinals), of which there are uncountably many. Like any ordinal number (in von Neumann's approach), œâ1 is a well-ordered set, with set membership (\\"‚àà\\") serving as the order relation. œâ1 is a limit ordinal, i.e. there is no ordinal Œ± with Œ± + 1 = œâ1. The cardinality of the set œâ1 is the first uncountable cardinal number, ‚Ñµ1 (aleph-one). The ordinal œâ1 is thus the initial ordinal of ‚Ñµ1. Under continuum hypothesis, the cardinality of œâ1 is the same as that of \\\\mathbb{R}‚Äîthe set of real numbers. In most constructions, œâ1 and ‚Ñµ1 are considered equal as sets. To generalize: if Œ± is an arbitrary ordinal, we define œâŒ± as the initial ordinal of the cardinal ‚ÑµŒ±. The existence of œâ1 can be proven without the axiom of choice. For more, see Hartogs number.  Topological properties  Any ordinal number can be turned into a topological space by using the order topology. When viewed as a topological space, œâ1 is often written as [0,œâ1), to emphasize that it is the space consisting of all ordinals smaller than œâ1. If the axiom of countable choice holds, every increasing œâ-sequence of elements of [0,œâ1) converges to a limit in [0,œâ1). The reason is that the union (i.e., supremum) of every countable set of countable ordinals is another countable ordinal. The topological space [0,œâ1) is sequentially compact, but not compact. As a consequence, it is not metrizable. It is, however, countably compact and thus not Lindel√∂f. In terms of axioms of countability, [0,œâ1) is first-countable, but neither separable nor second-countable. The space [0, œâ1] = œâ1 + 1 is compact and not first-countable. œâ1 is used to define the long line and the Tychonoff plank‚Äîtwo important counterexamples in topology.

This phenomenon can be seen in relationships between individuals. As a result, it can be analyzed in the workplace to create a more efficient and innovative workplace. It has also become an area of social network analysis. Origin and definition of the term Most of the early work in heterophily was done in the 1960s by Everett Rogers in his book Diffusion Of Innovations. According to Rogers, \\"Heterophily, the mirror opposite of homophily, is defined as the degree to which pairs of individuals who interact are different in certain attributes\\". This is in contrast to homophily, the likelihood that individuals are to surround themselves with those they share similarities with. An example of heterophily would be to individuals from different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds becoming friends. Through his work Rogers showed that heterophilious networks were better able to spread innovations. Later, scholars such as Paul Burton have drawn connections between modern Social Network Analysis as practiced by Mark Granovetter in his theory of weak ties and the work of Georg Simmel. Burton found that Simmel's notion of \\"the stranger\\" is equivalent to Granovetter's weak tie in that both can bridge homophilious networks, turning them into one larger heterophilious network. In social and intimate relationships Heterophily is usually not a term found often by itself. Rather it is often used in conjunction with other similar terms that define attraction. Heterophily is often discussed with its opposite, homophily when analyzing how relationships form between people. Heterophily also may be mentioned in areas such as homogamy, exogamy, and endogamy. To fully understand heterophily, it is important to understand the meaning and importance of homophily. The theory of homophily states that \\"similarity breeds connection.\\" Homophily has two specific types, status homophily and value homophily. Status homophily are ascribed statuses such as race, gender, and age. Value homophily refers to shared beliefs and practices between individuals. Studies of homophily have linked attraction between individuals based on similarly shared demographics. These may include, but are not limited to: race, ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic status. In fact, according to The logic of social bias: The structural demography of heterophily by Ray Reagans, the first component is the intrinsic level of interpersonal attraction due to homophily. Individuals are more likely to form social groups based upon what they have on common. This creates strong ties within the group. Mark Granovetter defined the strength of a tie as a \\"combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy, and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie\\". However, Granovetter's article suggested that weak ties are also instrumental in building social networks. He believed that weak ties could be possibly more effective than strong ties in reaching individuals. Findings like this have been referenced when discussing heterophily. The effect and occurrence of heterophily is also analyzed in intimate relationships. In Dangerous Liaisons? Dating and Drinking Diffusion in Adolescent Peer Networks, Derek Kreager and Dana Haynie mention the effects of heteroplhily on romantic relationships. They see the removal of the barrier of gender as a departure from the homophily of peer friendships. According to Kreager and Haynie \\"exposure to new behaviors and social contexts associated with a dating partner may also correspond to higher levels of influence from that partner.\\" The terms homogamy, endogamy, and exogamy are often used when discussing intimate relationships in a sociological context. Homogamy refers to the tendency of individuals to marry others that share similarities with each other, while endogamy is the practice of marrying within a specific group. The relation between these terms and homophily is the tendency to be attracted to what is similar. Homogamy and endogamy may be a result of cultural practices or personal preference. Endogamy's antithesis, exogamy, is marriage only outside of a particular group. In the working environment The concept of heterophily has been mentioned pertaining to working environments and the relationships within them. Heterophily is especially prevalent when discussing the diffusion of innovations theory. Diffusion of Innovations was the book written by Everett Rogers where he first termed heterophily.The diffusion of innovation theory itself is used to explain how new or innovative ideas are spread throughout a system composed of individuals. Rogers saw heterophily between individuals as \\"one of the most distinctive problems in the communication\\". This is because he believed homophily to be a more beneficial agent in communication. The general reasoning for this was that people who have more in common with each other are able to communicate more comfortably with each other. Still, Rogers believed that heterophily has such an impact on the diffusion of innovation theory that he stated in his book that \\"the very nature of diffusion demands that at least some degree of heterophily be present between the two participants\\". Heterophily is also an active part of the diffusion of information process. As a result, the concept of heterophily has been studied to try to improve relationships between individuals in the workplace.

Life Quinn was born in Newark, New Jersey to Elmer and Barbara Quinn. He attended Cornell University 1969-1973 and graduated with a degree in Industrial and Labor Relations. He worked in sales and marketing for seventeen years for Procter & Gamble. Since then, he has been president of a division of the Irish Dairy Board and vice president for sales for Warner-Lambert Consumer Healthcare, CIGNA Healthcare, and Travel click. Quinn lives in Maryland. He visited Venice in 1999 and decided to write his first book when he could not find a novel set there, similar to his favorite book, The Count of Monte Cristo. The first book in the trilogy, The Lion of St. Mark, took him four years to write and publish. It begins in 1452 with the attempt to save Constantinople from Turkish siege and ends in 1472. Much of the book concerns the rivalry between two powerful patrician families, the Zianis and the Soranzos and Venice's savage war with the Ottoman Turks. His second book, The Sword of Venice, spans the years 1473-1484 and chronicles the Ferrara War that pitted Venice against virtually all of her Italian rivals. The third book, working title: Venice Stands Alone, will continue the saga beginning in 1494 with French King Charles VIII's invasion of the Italian Peninsula, opposed by a Venice-led coalition of Italian states. Both are available in hard cover and eBook formats. Quinn has recently completed his third novel, a modern-day political- action thriller entitled, The Machiavelli Letter.

It is operated by a number of rail freight operators. The design is based on the National Rail NR class but with some modifications and upgraded features. Design The C44aci was designed by UGL Rail in response to a tender issued by Pacific National, who required a locomotive to match the performance of their existing 90 class units when hauling heavy coal traffic, while still having the ability to work high speed intermodal services, with the change between applications to be simple. The existing UGL Rail Cv40-9i (NR class) locomotive design was used as a base, but with alterations including: *Higher horsepower prime mover *Smaller main alternator *Enlarged radiator size now overhangs the walkway at the number 2 end to cope with the more powerful engine *AC traction equipment allowing an increase in haulage capacity *Addition of inline refuelling fittings *Isolated cab for reduced noise and vibration *A new design of fabricated bogies *Increased use of modular construction *Revised transition curves in the underframe to reduce the probability of fatigue cracking *Various body and cab modifications *A new Graham White Electric bell from North America The NR class design had also been used as a basis for the AC traction QR National 5000 class introduced in 2005. This design did not meet the requirements for Pacific National due to the heavy axle load, acceptable on the heavily laid coal routes, but not on lines outside of the Hunter Valley. To reduce the weight, the level of fuel carried is altered: for intermodal applications the fuel level is 7,300 litres, for coal applications that permit higher axle loads the fuel level is increased to 13,500 litres, with an intermediate fuel level of 10,750 litres also available. These limits are enforced during refuelling by a float switch in the tank, the permitted level being set by a key switch with an indication displayed in the cab if the limits are breached. The provision of inline refuelling permits the topping up of the tanks in transit from a separate tank wagon behind the locomotives. The older GE Transportation FDL series engine was chosen instead of the newer GE Evolution Series engine used in the United States, due to the greater height not fitting in the restricted Australian loading gauge, and there being no legal requirement to meet stringent Tier 2 emissions standards which drove adoption of the GEVO series elsewhere. The C44aci has one inverter per traction motor, this differs from competing Downer EDi Rail locomotives that have only one inverter per bogie. A further difference between the C44aci and the competing GT46C ACe is the lack of steering bogies to improve tracking properties and reduce the rate of wheel wear, instead fixed-frame pedestal- type bogies are used where all three axles are always held parallel. Simulation work showed that three C44aci locomotives could equal the performance of 90 class units in heavy mode, while in intermodal mode could outperform the older NR class units by 20% on services, with the same sectional running times and in some areas a slight reduction in fuel consumed due to the increased adhesion resulting from AC traction. However the C44aci was outperformed by the comparable GT46C ACe locomotive produced by Downer EDi Rail in back-to-back trials performed by RailCorp on the steeply graded Cowan Bank.

It was a constituent part of the territorially discontiguous and diplomatically unrecognised Chinese Soviet Republic (CSR). Before the declaration of the CSR in November 1931, the liberated zone had been known to Communists as the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi (Xiang- E-Gan) Revolutionary Base Area (ÊπòÈÑÇËµ£Èù©ÂëΩÊ†πÊçÆÂú∞).

Embargo and menace Phonograph used by Red Army at Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Revolutionary Base Area The Right-Kuomintang (Nationalist) Government intended to destroy the Soviet by means of one of its broadly unsuccessful Encirclement campaigns. The Communist response is known as the Counter-Encirclement Campaign at the Hunan‚ÄìHubei‚ÄìJiangxi Soviet (or, since the action pre-dates the establishment of the CSR, the Counter-Encirclement Campaign at the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Revolutionary Base). The Hunan‚ÄìHubei‚ÄìJiangxi Soviet was defended by the Red 16th Army. The 16th launched a pre-emptive strike on Tongcheng, in Hubei, in December 1930, annihilating an entire regiment of the KMT army just before it could begin the first attack of the campaign. The Government forces had to withdraw temporarily to regroup. The 16th, with help of fraternal CSR Soviets, held off danger to the Hunan‚ÄìHubei‚ÄìJiangxi Soviet until May 1931. Coordinated defense As reinforcement troops from other Nationalist Government regions moved in to avenge the defeat at Tongcheng, it was determined at Red Army central command that a diversionary measure was in order. The forces of the Hunan-Jiangxi Soviet accordingly struck two positions in government-held Hunan, one directly to their west and the other to their south. The gambit foiled the Encirclement Campaign against the Hunan‚ÄìHubei‚ÄìJiangxi Soviet by depriving it of essential strength.

Its surface area covers 66,000 km2 onshore. It formed on Variscan basement which was peneplained during the Permian and then started subsiding in the early Triassic. The basement is covered in the Parentis Basin and in the Subpyrenean Basin‚Äîboth sub-basins of the main Aquitaine Basin‚Äîby 11,000 m of sediment.  Geography  The geological provinces of France, the Aquitaine Basin on the lower left hand side The Aquitaine Basin, named after the French region Aquitaine, is roughly funnel-shaped with its opening pointing towards the Atlantic Ocean. Here it meets for 330 km the straight, more or less north‚Äìsouth-trending Atlantic coastline but continues offshore to the continental slope. To the south, it is delimitated for 350 km by the west- northwest‚Äìeast-southeast trending Pyrenees. In the southeast, the basin reaches the Seuil de Naurouze (also called Seuil du Lauragais) between the Montagne Noire on its northern side and the Mouthoumet range in the south. Just west of Narbonne, the basin is overridden by Pyrenean thrusts. The northeastern boundary of the basin is formed by the arcuate basement outcrops of the Massif Central. Via the 100 km wide Seuil du Poitou in the northeast, the basin is connected to the Paris Basin. In the far north, the basin abuts the east‚Äìwest-oriented Variscan basement of the Vend√©e, the southernmost part of the Armorican Massif.  Basin structure  The Aquitaine Basin is a very asymmetric foreland basin. It reaches its deepest part of 11 km just in front of the North Pyrenean Thrust. The 2,000 m isobath follows more or less the course of the Garonne River and divides the basin into a relatively shallow northern platform, the so-called Aquitaine Plateau, and into a much deeper, tightly folded, southern region. The tabular platform in the north contains only a much reduced sedimentary succession that is gently undulating and occasionally faulted. The folding intensity in the southern region increases steadily towards the south, the structures being further complicated by superimposed salt diapirism. This somewhat simplified structural subdivision gets complicated by the Parentis Basin which extends out into the Atlantic. The Parentis Basin is situated in the Golfe de Gascogne and also reaches 11 km depth; it is a symmetrical basin oriented east‚Äìwest and comes ashore near Arcachon. This sub-basin is underlain on its far western side by oceanic crust dated at 100‚Äì95 million years BP (Cenomanian). It is bounded by dextral wrench faults (possible transform faults) and probably represents a pull-apart basin.  Stratigraphy  (Note: Permo-Triassic basins like the Brive Basin and the Gr√©signe Basin are considered to belong to the basement of the Massif Central.) Structural and sedimentological investigations of the basin have been carried out in over 70 drilled wells that encountered the Variscan basement sometimes below 6,000 m of sedimentary cover. The sedimentary evolution in the Aquitaine Basin begins in the Lower Triassic close to the North Pyrenean Thrust. From here, it slowly started spreading farther north. = Triassic = Sedimentation started in the very south of the Aquitaine Basin during the Lower Triassic with coloured sandstones and mudstones, followed during the Middle Triassic by dolomitic limestones, evaporite strata and coloured mudstones. During the Upper Triassic evaporites continued being precipitated, crowned by ophitic lava flows (dolerites and tholeiites). The evaporites were later activated as diapirs during the Pyrenean orogeny and the mudstones served as decollement horizons along which Triassic sediments were squeezed northwards to the line Arcachon‚ÄìToulouse. The sediments are typically germanotype in character, i.e. very similar to the Triassic succession in Germany. In the north of the Aquitanian plateau, only a continental Upper Triassic is preserved. In the south, the sediments are marine and show their full development. The Triassic marine transgression probably invaded the southern Aquitaine Basin from the southeast or from the south (from the Tethys) via the then still immersed Pyrenean region. The sediments indicate a restricted shallow marine environment with drying-up periods that created evaporites. The Triassic sediments can attain a maximum thickness of 1,000 m and reach as far north as the line Garonne estuary ‚Äì Brive. = Jurassic = The entirely marine Jurassic cycle can be subdivided into seven second-order sequences bounded by unconformities, three in the Lias, two in the Dogger and two in the Malm: * Hettangian-Sinemurian sequence. * Lotharingian-Carixian- Domerian sequence (Upper Sinemurian‚ÄìPliensbachian). * Toarcian-Aalenian sequence. * Bajocian‚ÄìLower Bathonian sequence. * Middle Bathonian‚ÄìCallovian sequence. * Oxfordian‚ÄìSequanian sequence (Oxfordian‚ÄìLower Kimmeridgian). * Kimmeridgian‚ÄìPortlandian sequence (Kimmeridgian-Tithonian). The complete Jurassic cycle is only preserved in the Quercy; farther south, e.g. in the Subpyrenean Basin, the cycle has many gaps.  Lias  The basal Hettangian-Sinemurian sequence is fully transgressive over basement rocks or Permo-Triassic sediments. At that time, the first open-marine sediments (yet rather poor in fossils) were being deposited in the Aquitaine Basin. The Lias Transgression, as it is also called, started to encroach on the entire Aquitaine during the Sinemurian, characterised by calcareous-dolomitic, partially oolitic sediments. Despite smaller regressions during the Pliensbachian towards the end of the Lias and at the beginning of the Dogger the sea had onlapped the basement rocks of the Massif Central and the western Vend√©e (reaching today's limits) by 30 km. On the Aquitaine Plateau in the north, an interior shelf was constructed as far south as the line La Rochelle- Angoul√™me-P√©rigueux-Figeac. On this shelf the generally detritic transgression sediments of the Hettangian normally comprise a base conglomerate, arkoses, and fairly thick layers of sand- and mud-stones rich in plant material. The rest of the Hettangian is made up of marine sediments deposited in a restricted environment (lagoonal) evolving towards a lacustrine facies (green shales, coloured marls, dolomitic limestones and platy limestones rich in dwarf fossils, and evaporitic interlayers). The sediments of the Sinemurian are again fully marine and carry a pelagic fauna (soft banded limestones and hard lithographic limestones). At the end of the Sinemurian, a sudden regression occurred, forming hardgrounds. The second sequence of the Lias again is marine-transgressive and commences during the Lotharingian/Lower Carixian. The sediments can be well dated by ammonites‚Äî(Arietites, Oxynoticeras, Deroceras, and Uptonia jamesoni). They are mainly calcareous and rich in quartz grains and pebbles of reworked Sinemurian. The Upper Carixian consists of very fossiliferous (Aegoceras capricornu) marly limestone layers interlayered with grey marls. These are followed by ammonite-bearing (Amaltheus margaritatus) and oyster-bearing (Gryphaea cymbium) marls indicating a shelf environment open to the spreading Atlantic Ocean. During the Lower Domerian, a connection to the Paris Basin is breached for the first time via the Seuil du Poitou and also to the Jurassic sea of southeastern France via the D√©troit de Rodez and the D√©troit de Carcassonne. During the Upper Domerian, another regression sets in leaving sandy limestones very rich in fossils (Pleuroceras spinatum, Pecten aequivalvis). These littoral facies rocks can change into iron-rich oolites along their margins. The sequence finishes again with hardgrounds. The third and last sequence of the Lias sets in during the Lower Toarcian without any detrital deposits at its base, the sediments being black ammonite-bearing marls (with Harpoceras falciferum and Hildoceras bifrons). Towards the end of the Toarcian and the beginning of the Aalenian, the sediments turn into sandy limestones indicating another regression. Interlayered with these sandy limestones are oyster beds, iron oolite and gypsum layers; they contain ammonites like Pleydellia aalensis and Leioceras opalinum. The sequence ends with an erosional unconformity. In the southern part of the Aquitanian basin, the evaporite deposition (including layers of anhydrite) begun in the Triassic carries on right through the Lias; it reaches a thickness of up to 500 m.  Dogger  The Dogger attains a maximum thickness of about 300 m along a north‚Äìsouth-trending zone running from Angoul√™me to Tarbes. Along this zone reefs began to grow, splitting the Aquitaine Basin into two major facies domains. Prominent reef complexes are situated east of Angoul√™me, northwest of P√©rigueux and east of Pau. The reefs are associated with calcareous oolites and mark a high-energy zone. On the shallow shelf-domain east of the reefs, neritic limestones were deposited in the north and dolomites in the south; in the Quercy, even supratidal lignite- bearing limestones were formed. In the western domain open towards the Atlantic, the pelagic sediments comprise ammonite-bearing limy marls very rich in filamentous microfossils (bryozoans). The first sequence in the Dogger (note: sequences are only distinguished in the eastern shelf-domain) starts transgressing in a restricted environment during the Bajocian with dolomite. In places, Aalenian is reworked. The Bathonian is calcareous in the northeast, whereas in the southeast it keeps its dolomitic character. The end of the sequence in the Lower Bathonian shows regressive tendencies with lignites, breccias, and lacustrine fossils in the Quercy. No ammonites are found in the eastern domain right up to the Kimmeridgian‚Äîa great handicap for correct dating purposes. The Pyrenean realm meanwhile is characterised by a long hiatus. The second sequence in the Dogger begins in the Middle Bathonian with lacustrine limestones and in places with breccia-bearing detritus. This is followed by neritic limestones precipitated in calm conditions. Yet in the south, dolomites continue to be deposited. The sequence finishes in the Callovian with littoral border-facies deposits.  Malm  The facies dividing reef-zone persists into the Malm. In the western domain, initially ammonite-bearing marls and limestones were deposited, whereas in the eastern domain the sediments are calcareous dolomites. The retreat of the Jurassic sea became noticeable during the late Tithonian with dolomites and breccias in the Adour Basin, evaporites in the Charente, extremely littoral sediments in the Quercy, lacustrine limestones in the Parentis Basin, and anhydrites in the Gers. The seaways that had opened in the Lias closed again and a single reef persisted in the P√©rigord at La Tour-Blanche. In the end, the sea withdrew south of the Garonne River. In the Lower Oxfordian, the first sequence of the Malm seems to follow the Callovian without a distinctive break. Yet cellular limestones and breccias indicate sediment reworking (this was certainly the case in the Grands Causses farther east). During the Middle and the Upper Oxfordian, marine limestones are laid down which incorporate occasional reefs. The Lower Kimmeridgian sediments are sedimented close to the shore, they bear oysters, urchins, and ripple marks. The second sequence of the Malm starts in the Upper Kimmeridgian, only in places does it show regressive traits, nevertheless the sedimentary character changes. Laid down are breccias and the sediments also show synsedimentary reworkings; periodically interbedded limestones and marls carrying lignite horizons begin to form. The sediments can be dated by the ammonites Aulacostephanus and Aspidoceras orthocera. This strongly disturbed depositional environment with a coexistence of open marine facies and muds deposited under reducing conditions in a restrictive setting seems to coincide with a first sedimentary individualisation of the Pyrenean realm. The event has received its name Virgulian from the oyster Exogyra virgula. During the Tithonian, the shrinkage of the basin became even more evident, only to end in a nearly complete withdrawal of the sea from the Aquitaine Plateau before the close of the Tithonian (the south is not affected by this). During the Tithonian, iron-bearing calcareous oolites interbedded with marls, as well as dolomite and border facies deposits develop‚Äîdated by Gravesia portlandicum. = Lower Cretaceous = In comparison with the Jurassic, the Cretaceous has less pronounced sequences. The Lower Cretaceous sediments are restricted to close to the Pyrenees. Most likely the exchange of ocean water masses was better towards the Tethyan realm than towards the Atlantic. Sedimentation increased again after a longer hiatus in the Lower Cretaceous, but only in two locales‚Äîthe Parentis Basin and the Adour Basin. Both sub-basins manifest a huge subsidence. During the Lower Cretaceous the Parentis Basin received 2,000 m of sediment and the Adour Basin 4,000 m. The remainder of the Aquitaine Basin is meanwhile subjected to strong erosion. The first deposits in the two sub-basins were littoral sediments in Wealden facies, mainly sandstones and shales. During the Barremian, marine shallow- water carbonates were precipitated, changing to detritic sediments in the northern Parentis Basin. Near Lacq, they change to lagoonal anhydrites. In the Upper Aptian, the reef-forming Urgonian facies became established in both sub- basins‚Äîfossiliferous limestones composed of algae, coralline polyps, and rudists. The Urgonian facies completely surrounds the Parentis Basin and persists into the Albian. Since the onset of the Albian, strong halokinetic movements affect the southern Aquitaine Basin and in turn profoundly influence sedimentation patterns. As a result, breccias, thick conglomerates, and turbidites are shed. In the Parentis Basin, a distinct unconformity develops. At the same time, the sediments on the Aquitaine Plateau farther north are folded into gentle wavetrains following the Hercynian strike (northwest- southeast). All these movements are correlated with the first tectonic stirrings in the Western Pyrenees. Towards the end of the Albian, the sea level is rising and the Urgonian calcareous reefs are consequently draped by muds. = Upper Cretaceous = The transgression that began in the late Albian spread rapidly northward during the Cenomanian. In the northern part of the Aquitanian Basin, the Cenomanian sea reclaimed nearly the same areas that had been occupied by the Jurassic sea; in the east, however, it only reached the line Brive-Cahors-Agen-Muret-Carcassonne. The region of the later formed North Pyrenean Thrust is a decisive facies boundary at this time: to the north, shelf sedimentation continued but to the south rapidly subsiding basins developed into which flysch sediments (and partially also wildflysch breccias) from the Pyrenean realm were shed. Near Saint-Gaudens, the flysch sediments are even accompanied by volcanic rocks‚Äîtrachytes, and ultrabasic lavas. The sedimentation in the flysch basins during the Turonian and during the Coniacian is very unsettled. The flysch sedimentation then continues right through the Upper Cretaceous, mainly interbedded sandstones and shales with some carbonaceous layers were laid down. Towards the end of the Upper Cretaceous, there are signs of the start of a regression and the sea then actually retreats before the K/T boundary. In the Subpyrenean Basin near the Petits Pyr√©n√©es, the sea lingers on till the lowermost Paleocene (Danian). In the remainder of the Aquitaine Basin, mainly pelagic limestones (chalk facies) are sedimented during the Upper Cretaceous, including the type localities for the Coniacian, Santonian, and Campanian in the Charente. At the northern edge of the basin, more differentiated coastal facies develop. In the north, the Cenomanian is made up of three sedimentary cycles (from young to old): * An upper cycle with regressive tendencies. In the northwest, sandy rudist-bearing limestones and oyster-bearing marly shales were deposited; in the northeast, very shallow marine gypsum-bearing shales and sands. * A generally deeper marine middle-cycle with marls. These sediments spread into the Quercy. In the P√©rigord, littoral facies and lignites accumulated near paleohighs. * A shallow marine lower-cycle with rudist reefs in the northwest and continent- derived lignites in the northeast. The Turonian reflects a transgressive period with the sea spreading into the Lot. At this point, the Upper Cretaceous sea had reached its highstand. This also coincides with a climatic optimum with global average sea-water temperatures around 24 ¬∞C compared to today's 13 ¬∞C. The Turonian can be subdivided into two parts: * The so-called Angoumian (named after Angoul√™me) on the top. It consists of massive, partially brecciated rudist limestones at its base followed by ocre calcareous sands. The resistant Angoumian formed extensive cliffs. * The so-called Ligerian (Latin name for the Massif Central) at the base‚Äîwavy chalky marls. Towards the end of the Turonian, the Massif Central experienced uplift which is reflected in the sediments of the northeastern Aquitaine Basin as a strong input of detritus, mainly sands in the upper part of the Angoumian. The Coniacian and the Santonian are expressed as typical chalky limestones in the north, but both stages take on a more sandy character east of P√©rigueux. The Campanian follows after a pronounced unconformity. The southern flysch basins began to expand northward. Near Pau before the onset of the flysch sedimentation, a very strong erosion removed the entire Lower Cretaceous, the entire Jurassic and sometimes even cut right down to the basement. North of Pau, the Campanian is a marly facies called Aturian. In the northern Aquitaine Basin, the sediments become more homogenised and settle out as fully marine flint-bearing calcareous micrites. During the Maastrichtian, a regression commences. After the initial deposition of bioclastic rudist-bearing limestones and the formation of some reef complexes composed of rudists and single corals, the sea level started dropping. Northern Aquitaine became emersed and the sea withdrew in stages southward to the line Arcachon- Toulouse. At the same time, the northern edge of the basin experienced another folding episode with low-amplitude folds striking northwest-southeast. = Cenozoic =Paleogene  During the Paleocene, the coastline roughly followed the line Arcachon-Toulouse. In the North Aquitaine Zone north of this line, the sediments possess continental character ‚Äì red mudstones, sands, and lacustrine limestones. The sea made a short-lived advance into this domain and left echinid-bearing limestones behind. In the Central Aquitaine Zone (northern half of the southern basin), a shelf built out to the line Audignon- Carcassonne. Farther south in the South Aquitaine Zone, deep water conditions prevailed in the west, shallowing out towards the east. The sediments in the Aturian Gulf (Golfe Aturi√©n) in the west are pelagic limestones containing globigerinids, operculinids, and alveolinids. Near the Petits Pyr√©n√©es, the sediments change into shallow-water facies rich in madreporians, echinids, and operculinids. Farther east in the Ari√®ge and in the Corbi√®res Massif, the sediments become totally continental and lacustrine. In the Lower Eocene (Ypresian), another transgressive period saw the sea advance north into the M√©doc and south of Ol√©ron; in the southeast it even reached the Montagne Noire. In the Aturian Gulf, Globorotalia-bearing marls were deposited, while farther east turritella-rich marls and limestones were formed. The newly inundated areas receive sands and limestones rich in alveolinids and nummulites. Meanwhile, iron-rich sands (in the Charente) and molasses (in the Libournais and in the Agenais) were sedimented in the continental north and northeast. The provenance area of these continental deposits up to Middle Ypresian times was mainly the Massif Central. The sea-level kept rising during the Middle Eocene (Lutetian and Bartonian). The area covered by alveolinid- and nummulite-bearing limestones increased, northward to Blaye and Saint- Palais and eastward into the Agenais. The Subpyrenean Basin deepened and was simultaneously being filled by conglomerates brought in from the east, the so- called Poudingues de Palassou. This marked the beginning of uplift in the Pyrenean orogen and a switch-over in detritus provenance from the Massif Central in the north to the Pyrenees in the south. Coalescing alluvial fans built out north into the Castrais. On the northern flank of the fans, lakes formed, precipitating lacustrine limestones. The detrital sediments with provenance from the meanwhile strongly eroded Massif Central (muds, sands, gravels) then affected only a small fringe zone in the northeast. In the P√©rigord and in the Quercy, the Sid√©rolithique accumulated‚Äîiron-rich sediments that resemble laterites indicating a subtropical climate. During the Upper Eocene (Priabonian), a regression set in. The Subpyrenean Basin became completely filled with the erosional debris of the rising Pyrenees. In the M√©doc, nummulite-bearing marls and limestones were still being laid down, but east of Bordeaux already continental molasses appeared that change farther south into gypsum-bearing formations. During the Lower Oligocene (Rupelian), a permanently marine environment persists in the south with marls and sands rich in nummulites, lamellibranchs, and echinids. The anomiid-bearing limestones of the southern M√©doc are lagoonal deposits. After a short-lived advance at the beginning of the Chattian with seastar-bearing limestones in the northern M√©doc and in the Libournais and with mammal-bearing molasses in the Agenais, the sea made a big retreat at the end of the Oligocene. This retreat was accompanied by tectonic movements creating trains of deeper-seated anticlines in the central and northern Aquitaine Basin. The debris-carrying alluvial fans issuing from the rising Pyrenees reached into the Agenais and attained their largest extent. They pushed the surrounding belt of lakes ahead of them (in northerly directions) thereby spreading lacustrine limestones well into the Quercy, onto the Causses, and even onto the Massif Central.  Neogene  Following its retreat in the southwestern Landes, the sea began transgressing towards the north and the east during the Lower Miocene (Aquitanian). Marine, littoral, and lacustrine facies interchange. During a minor regression, a huge lake formed near Condom, the Lac de Saucats, in which grey lacustrine- limestones precipitated, the so-called Calcaire gris de l'Agenais. Shortly thereafter the sea attained its highstand. It was rimmed completely by continental deposits whose thickness increased towards the southeast. For the first time, the alluvial fans along the Pyrenean front receded, the reason being increased subsidence in front of the orogen; yet they still stretched as far north as the Agenais. The retreat of the alluvial fans also continued during the Middle Miocene (Langhian and Serravallian). Consequently, the lacustrine band reached as far south as the Armagnac. The Upper Miocene (Tortonian and Messinian) witnessed a drastic withdrawal of the sea to the west. This process started first in the Bordelais and in the Bazadais, ending with a nearly complete withdrawal from the basin. In areas left behind by the sea in the Armagnac, unfossiliferous sands and muds were deposited. At the same time in the north and in the east, today's river network draining the Massif Central was already being beginning to form. During the Pliocene (Zanclean), the sea occupied merely a small strip near the Arcachon Basin south of Soustons. Sandy shales very rich in a benthic microfauna were deposited. In the rest of the Aquitaine Basin, continental sands were laid down, the so-called Sables fauves. The alluvial fans restricted their activity to the immediate vicinity of the Pyrenean mountain front and created the alluvial fans of Ger, Orignac-Cieutat, and Lannemezan. The drainage system of the Garonne already resembled more or less today's pattern, the river avoiding the Miocene gravel accumulations as much as possible and then following between Toulouse, Agen and Bordeaux a weekly subsiding graben. The progressive landfall of the Aquitaine Basin proceeded from the northeast and was coupled with an important subaerial erosion. As a consequence several peneplanations were carved out from the detrital alluvial plains: * an eocene peneplain. * an aquitanian, strongly silicified peneplain. This is very well developed in the P√©rigord, in the Agenais, and in the Quercy. * a pliocene (zanclean) peneplain, characterised by gravel-bearing clays in the Bordelais and in the Landes. On the pliocene peneplain, today's drainage system was firmly established.  Quaternary  The Venus of Brassempouy, Upper Paleolithic. The first representation of a human face. The three last Pleistocene ice ages‚ÄîMindel, Riss, and W√ºrm‚Äîare also documented in the Aquitaine Basin, mainly by different levels of river terraces. Additionally amongst glacial phenomena the following can be cited: * cave infills. These are very important for dating archeological finds. * aeolian deposits. They cover more than a third of the Aquitaine region and can be found mainly in the M√©doc and in the Landes. They were deposited during the last two cold stages of the W√ºrm glaciation. The dune belt parallel to the Atlantic shoreline formed during the Holocene. It contains Europe's largest dune, The Great Dune of Pyla. * colluvium masking hillsides and hilltops. * creeping cryoclastic debris. The development of the Gironde estuary goes back about 20,000 years into the late W√ºrm. Finally, the rich prehistoric finds and their sites in the Aquitaine Basin merit mentioning, especially in the D√©partement Dordogne.  Structural organisation and tectonics  Lower Portlandian micrite from the La Tour- Blanche anticline; east-southeast-west-northwest-oriented strike-slip fault with horizontal slickolites and a calcite-filled pull-apart. Thus the anticline was also affected by transtensional wrenching motions. Structurally the Aquitaine Basin can be divided into two provinces separated by a prominent fault zone, the so-called North Aquitaine Flexure. This fault zone extends from Arcachon to Carcassonne and represents the continuation of the continental slope onshore. The Northern Province or Aquitaine Plateau forms a typical continental shelf region with reduced sedimentation and several periods of emersion (during the entire Lower Cretaceous and during parts of the Upper Cretaceous and the Cenozoic). The basement is rarely encountered deeper than 2,000 m. Triassic and Jurassic together have an accumulated sediment thickness of 1,000‚Äì1,700 m. The Lower Cretaceous is completely missing and the Upper Cretaceous only reaches a thickness of several hundred metres. The Paleogene is, if present, very thin in the north but increases in thickness towards the south where it is overlain by thin Neogene. In the eastern section, one can discern several low-amplitude structures that are parallel to the Pyrenees farther south and strike west-northwest-east- southeast: * Quercy synform. * Tarn-et-Garonne antiform. * Castres graben structure. * Toulouse antiform. Generally the Northern Province is characterised by rather simple structures (syn- and antiforms, low-amplitude fold trains, faults) that follow hercynian, armorican and variscan strike directions. The structures were formed during several tectonic phases: * Jurassic phase. The resulting structures are mainly of synsedimentary origin and follow variscan strike directions. They profoundly influenced facies distributions and transgressive style during the Upper Cretaceous. * Late Campanian-Maastrichtian phase. This phase enhanced the structures already formed in the Jurassic phase. The following anticlinal ridges, which run more or less parallel to the northeastern basin margin and can be traced for more than 200 km, were being generated (from north to south): ** The Mareuil- Meyssac Anticline. This structure is an asymmetric anticline near Mareuil, becoming a high-offset normal fault between Terrasson and Meyssac. ** The P√©rigueux anticline. This structure can be followed from Cognac via La Tour- Blanche to P√©rigueux and Saint-Cyprien. It forms a typical anticline near La Tour-Blanche. Near Saint-Cyprien, it is mainly a normal fault. ** The Ol√©ron- Jonzac-Rib√©rac-Sauveterre-la-Lemance anticline. This structure is an anticline near Jonzac and Sauveterre. Between the anticlines are synforms near Saintes and Sarlat. * Eocene- Oligocene phase. More anticlines at a deeper level that are not detectable at the surface were created: ** Northeast-southwest-striking domal upwarps near Listrac, near Blaye and near Couqu√®ques. ** The northwest-southeast-striking upwarp of Sainte-H√©l√®ne-Carcans. ** The Bordeaux syncline. ** The east-west- striking anticline of La Teste-Villagrains-Landiras-Miramont in the Guyenne. The Southern Province is characterised by the deep Parentis and Adour sub- basins with the Mimizan high ground in between. Compared with the Northern Province its sediments show a pronounced increase in thickness (5,000‚Äì11,500 altogether). The Triassic and the Jurassic combined reach 2,000‚Äì3,000 , the Lower Cretaceous 500-1,500 m. The Upper Cretaceous can vary between 500 and 3,000 m and even the Neogene still attains a thickness of nearly 1,000 m. The tectonic movements were much more complicated in the Southern Province, having superimposed on them very strong halokinetic motions (salt diapirism). A large part of the formed structures is concealed under Plio-Quaternary detritus. The many exploration wells drilled for hydrocarbons and groundwater helped immensely in unravelling these structures. Similar to the Northern Province, the major structures are again trains of parallel anticlines whose wavelength steadily diminishes approaching the Pyrenean front. Inversely the effects of the salt movements become stronger towards the south. The anticlines were formed during the uplift of the Pyrenees during the Eocene/Oligocene. The structures were set in place by Miocene times. The following anticlines can be distinguished (from north to south): * Parentis-Bouglon-Agen. * Mimizan- Roquefort-Cr√©on-Cezans-Lavardens. * Boos-Audignan-Nogaro. * Saubrigues- Biarotte-Bastennes-Garlin. * Peyrehorade-Sainte-Suzanne-Lacq-Pau-Meilhon. Isostatic movements during the Plio-Quaternary at the northeastern edge of the Aquitaine basin lead to an uplift and rejuvenation of the peneplained basement in the Massif Central. In the Aquitaine basin itself, these movements follow already existing basement structures and entrain the tilting of some of the pliocene peneplains. This in turn has a strong effect upon the hydrographic network, for example in the drainage basins of the Garonne and Adour, the rivers' courses were changed or entirely abandoned. Tectonic movements are still at work in the Aquitaine Basin today‚Äîstrong earthquakes in the Pyrenees (with destroyed villages and churches) and somewhat milder tremors near the island of Ol√©ron keep reminding us of that fact. = Tectono-metamorphic organisation of the basement = According to geophysical explorations the Variscan basement hidden under the sediments of the Aquitaine Basin can be subdivided into several northwest-southeast-striking tectono-metamorphic zones (from north to south): * Ligero-arvernian Zone. The zone is limited on the south by the line Niort-Angoul√™me-Fumel-Montauban running parallel to the South Armorican Shear Zone farther north. It forms the polymetamorphic core region of the Variscan orogen in Europe. * South Armorican Zone. The zone is bounded on the south by the line La Rochelle-Saintes-Chalais and pinches out near Bergerac. It is composed of southward-thrust basement nappes of Devonian/Carboniferous age. * North Aquitaine Zone. Its southern boundary is identical with the South Variscan Thrust Front (and also the North Aquitaine Flexure) and follows the line Arcachon-Agen-Toulouse. It is made up of nappes of the orogen's external zone which were thrust southward during the Pennsylvanian. * Aquitaine block, also called microcontinent Aquitania. It is bounded in the south by the North Pyrenean Thrust Front and is equivalent to the Southern Province. This continental foreland block already belonged to Gondwana's northern edge. = Depths of the Mohorovicic Discontinuity = The maximum depth of the Mohorovicic Discontinuity in the Aquitanian Basin is 36 km, following more or less the path of the Garonne River. Towards the Massif Central in the northeast, the discontinuity flattens out to 30 km. The same holds for approaching the northern edge of the Pyrenees, here the discontinuity is also at 30 km depth. In the oceanic part of the Parentis Basin, it is already encountered at 20 km depth. This implies a significant stretching of the continental crust and the beginning of oceanisation. As a comparison, underneath the Central Pyrenees the continental crust is 50 km thick.  Geodynamic setting  For a better understanding of the geological successions and structures in the Aquitaine Basin, it is important to consider the greater geodynamic setting. Two geodynamic developments are of primordial importance for the basin: * The break-up of Pangaea and the opening history of the Northern Atlantic (and hence the Bay of Biscay). * The movements of the microcontinent Iberia. In the Upper Triassic (Carnian) about 230 million years ago, the supercontinent Pangaea started slowly to break up. In the Atlantic domain, the disintegration began in the area of the Central Atlantic. Already in the Lower Jurassic, the initial rifting process had given way to the marine drifting stage. In the Toarcian about 180 million years ago, the Central Atlantic was spreading and North America, South America and Africa were separating. By Callovian times, the Central Atlantic was fully marine. Spreading continued and gradually also began to affect the Northern Atlantic domain. During the Tithonian about 150 million years ago, a rift arm infiltrated along today's continental margin of northwestern France. Consequently, Iberia, so far being positioned right below the Armorican Massif (Brittany), was wedged southward. This gave the Atlantic the chance to directly reach the Aquitaine Basin for the first time. In the wake of the southward drifting Iberia during the Lower Cretaceous, the Bay of Biscay opened up. The microcontinent Iberia underwent in addition to its southward drifting motion a counterclockwise rotational movement that eventually brought it in close contact with southern France (reflected in first tectonic movements in the Pyrenees during the Albian; also documented by metamorphism in the Pyrenees dated between 108 and 93 million years ago and by the transgression of the Cenomanian sea). The final collision happened during the Eocene/Oligocene uplifting the mountain chain and subjecting it to severe erosion at the same time. The main phase of uplift ended with the close of the Aquitanian, followed mainly by isostatic movements lasting to this day. = Megasequences = By taking as a reference point the onset of rifting in the Bay of Biscay during the Tithonian the geodynamic evolution of the Aquitaine Basin can be subdivided into four megasequences (somewhat simplified): * Prerift megasequence. Triassic till Upper Jurassic. Mainly clastic sediments and carbonates followed by thick evaporites during the Triassic; shelf carbonates during the Jurassic. * Synrift megasequence. Lower Cretaceous (Tithonian till Albian). The Bay of Biscay opened and became partially underlain by oceanic crust. During the Neocomian nonmarine and shallow-marine clastics and carbonates formed, followed by thick shelf carbonates during the Aptian and Albian. The megasequence ends in the Cenomanian with inversion tectonics along preexisting tensional faults. * Postrift megasequence. Cenomanian till Paleocene. Sinistral motions of Iberia relative to France created several transtensional sub-basins (pull-apart structures). Turbidite sedimentation in the south. * Foreland basin megasequence. Eocene till recent. The collision of Iberia with France in the Eocene terminated the transtensional tectonics. The rising orogen of the Pyrenees shed flysch sediments during the Eocene and molasses during the Miocene into the foreland basin.  Resources  Oil pumping station on the √âtang de Biscarosse near Parentis-en-Born = Hydrocarbons = Amongst the many resources in the Aquitaine Basin, the hydrocarbons oil and gas are without doubt of prime importance for the French economy. Major sources are found in the following sub-basins of Lower Cretaceous age: * In the Parentis Basin. Oil is found in Parentis, Cazaux and Lavergne. The Parentis Basin contains most oil reserves of continental France. * In the Adour Basin. Gas is found in Lacq gas field, Meillon, and Saint-Marcet. With its 220 billion cubic meters of gas, the Adour Basin stocks practically all the gas reserves of France. Source/host rocks are Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) and Lower Cretaceous limestones and dolomites. Lower Aptian shales function as seals. = Groundwater aquifers = Classic groundwater aquifers are found in Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic rocks of the Bordelais. Recently a gigantic aquifer has been discovered in Eocene sands near Lussagnet‚Äîof great importance for the region Pau-Toulouse. = Other resources = Further notable resources include: * Clays and mudstones. They are the raw material for innumerable tile and brick factories (manufacture of tiles, bricks, terracotta, etc.). Horizons are found mainly in the Toarcian, in the Eocene (Lutetian), in the Oligocene, and in the Miocene (Aquitanian, Burdigalian, Langhian, and Tortonian). * Kaolinite. This is the raw material for the manufacture of china. Mainly found in residual pockets of Eocene age filling depressions and caves in Upper Cretaceous karst developments. For example, near Les Eyzies. * Peat. Pleistocene and Holocene horizons in the M√©doc (Gironde estuary). * Lignite. In the Cenomanian of the Sarladais; Upper Miocene/Pliocene deposits in the Landes are strip-mined near Arjuzanx. * Bauxite. In Jurassic karst pockets between Pech and Lavelanet. Economically not viable. * Iron. Contained within the Eocene age Sid√©rolithique, mainly in the P√©rigord and in the Quercy. Economically no longer viable. * Metals. Mainly lead-zinc mineralisations occurring in the basal Sinemurian. Found in the Charente and near Figeac, yet economically no longer viable. * Wood. Large forests in the Landes and in the Dordogne form the basis for a diversified industry (firewood for power stations and private use, charcoal, palettes, timber, furniture industry, etc.). * Fruits. Plums in the Agenais (Pruneau d'Agen). * Wine. World-famous wines like the Cognac, Bordeaux, Armagnac, Chalosse, and B√©arn are grown in the Aquitaine Basin.  Conclusions  The structural and hence sedimentary organisation in the Aquitaine Basin was ultimately influenced by two principal factors: * By structural inheritance from the Variscan basement. * By the evolution of the Pyrenean orogen. The strong northwest-southeast-striking tectono-metamorphic zonation in the basement has profoundly influenced the structural and the sedimentary evolution of the Aquitaine Basin. The same hercynian direction is also followed by the continental edge of northwestern France which formed during the evolution of the Bay of Biscay. The continental edge finds its prolongation in the superdeep Subpyrenean Basin. The system of anticlinal ridges affecting the sedimentary cover is also arranged in this direction. The prominent South Armorican Shear Zone farther north also strikes northwest- southeast, but additionally has a distinct dextral wrenching movement. Like the South Armorican Shear Zone, the anticlinal ridges too are affected by similar shearing movements and are not purely compressional in origin. Even the Paris Basin is bounded by these transtensional dextral shear zones and can hence be interpreted as an east‚Äìwest-oriented pull-apart basin. Within the context of the opening of the Bay of Biscay, the Parentis Basin can furthermore be regarded as a failed attempt of the Atlantic to wedge into the continent's interior. The reason for this is the counterclockwise rotational motion of Iberia blocked further rifting. Since the Cenomanian, the Aquitaine Basin is under the influence of the Pyrenean orogeny with its west-northwest- east-southeast-striking structural grain. The Pyrenean orogen likewise has not merely a compressional origin but also a strong, in this case, sinistral transtensional component. The Pyrenean orogen exerted a very profound influence upon the Aquitaine Basin up to this day, subjecting it not only to more or less north‚Äìsouth-directed compression but also to transtension. The effects were of a penetrative nature‚Äîtectonic repercussions of the Pyrenean orogeny can even be seen at the northeastern basin margin in the immediate vicinity of the Massif Central.

It is run jointly by Ministry of Education and the Zhejiang provincial government, the latter being the main administrative body.  Campus  library building ZSTU is in Hangzhou and has two campuses, covering a total area of 1,500 mu. History Statue of Linqi on campus The history of ZSTU dates back to the Sericultural Academy, which was founded in 1897 and was one of the earliest modern educational institutions in China. The school began to enroll undergraduate students in 1959 and graduate students in 1979. It acquired the right to confer master's degrees in 1983 and was granted the right by Ministry of Education to appraise the qualifications of teachers applying for the title of associate professor in 1993. In 1995, it started to offer PhD programs in collaboration with Zhejiang University. The same year saw the first international enrollments and the enrollment of students from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. In 1999, it began to confer master's degrees to on-the-job students who are of the equivalent education level. In 2001, it was granted the right to confer master's degrees to engineering students. In 2003 it was approved as an institution qualified to provide joint PhD programs and in 2006 it got the right to confer Doctoral degree. ZSTU now has graduate programs, undergraduate programs and adult education, the latter in the form of public education, non-governmental education and education through international cooperation. In April 1999 the institution changed its name from Zhejiang Institute of Silk Textile to Zhejiang Institute of Science and Technology. In May 2004, ZIST was renamed to Zhejiang Sci-Tech University (ZSTU).  Administration Schools and departments= No. 2 building No. 3 building ZSTU consists of 16 schools or faculties (departments): * School of Sciences * Silk Institute, College of Materials and Textiles * School of Fashion Design and Engineering * School of Information Science and Technology * Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Automation * School of Civil Engineering and Architecture * College of Life Science and Medicine * School of Art and Design * School of Economics and Management * School of Law and Politics * College of Foreign Languages * Shi Liangcai School of Journalism and Communication * School of Marxism * Qixin School * School of Continuing Education * Keyi College of Zhejiang Sci-Tech University * Department of Physical Education It owns one independent college on another campus. Two of its disciplines are regarded by the province as very important, and eight are key disciplines at provincial or ministerial level. It has one key laboratory of the Ministry of Education and two key laboratories of the Zhejiang Province. The school offers 45 undergraduate programs, of which six are provincial key programs. It confers Doctoral degree in two disciplines, Master's degrees in four first-level disciplines and 30 second-level disciplines (sub-disciplines), and it provides one joint Doctoral program and two Master's programs in engineering. The school has two pilot centers for teaching basic courses in Zhejiang Province, two provincial engineering centers, six R&D; centers and more than 40 school labs and institutes of excellence. = Students= At present, the number of full-time undergraduate and graduate students enrolled at ZSTU is 23,500; an additional 3500 students are in programs of adult education and further education.  Library  In recent years, the school's required enrollment score has been among the highest of the HELs in Zhejiang province - as has been the employment rate of its students.  Awards  ZSTU has won over 120 research awards, among which three are national ‚Äî two second awards of the National Scientific and Technological Invention Award and one second award of the National Scientific and Technological Progress Award ‚Äî and over 20 are provincial or ministerial.

It has simple, glabrous, elliptic to egg-shaped leaves, small groups of yellow flowers and egg-shaped to more or less spherical creamy-yellow fruit.  Description  Acronychia littoralis is a tree that typically grows to a height of and has a straight, grey, cylindrical trunk. The leaves are glabrous, arranged in opposite pairs, broadly elliptical to broadly egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, mostly long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are mainly arranged in leaf axils in cymes long, each flower on a pedicel long. The four sepals are wide, the four petals yellow and long and the eight stamens alternate in length. Flowering occurs from February to March and the fruit is a fleshy creamy yellow, egg-shaped to more or less spherical drupe long with four lobes separated by shallow fissures. Taxonomy Acronychia littoralis was first formally described in 1984 by Thomas Hartley and J.B. Williams in the journal Brunonia from specimens collected by J.B. Williams near Brunswick Heads in 1979. Distribution and habitat Scented acronychia grows in rainforest within of the coast between Fraser Island in Queensland and Iluka in New South Wales. Conservation status This acronchyia is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threats to the species include inappropriate use of four-wheel drive vehicles, weed invasion and salt burn at exposed sites.

Design and development By the 1960s the converted World War II- vintage types that comprised a large part of the Australian agricultural aircraft fleet were in need of replacement.\\"Sport and Business\\", Flight International, 13 January 1966, p.58 (online archive version). Retrieved: 28 December 2008 Sasin Aircraft Service of Goulburn, an operator of a de Havilland Tiger Moth modified for use as an agricultural aircraft, decided to convert de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunks for agricultural use and contracted Aerostructures at Bankstown to perform the necessary modifications.Eyre, David. \\"SASIN/AEROSTRUCTURES SA29 SPRAYMASTER\\", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft in Australia and New Zealand, p.189. Sunshine Books, Hornsby NSW, 1983. The starting point was a Mk. 10 or Mk. 21 version of the Chipmunk. The modifications included a redesigned fuselage to accommodate a 50 Imperial gallon (227 l) hopper located where the front seat was found in the original aircraft, and a completely new cockpit in the location of the original rear seat. An air-driven spray pump was mounted under the forward fuselage. The pilot sat 11 inches (28 cm) higher than in the original aircraft. A turnover truss and a new energy-absorbing seat were provided to protect the pilot from injury in a crash; and cable cutters were mounted in front of the cockpit as protection against one of the main hazards to agricultural aircraft (flying into power or telephone lines). A small dorsal fin and anti-spin strakes were fitted to the rear fuselage as well. Modifications to the wing included endplates instead of the standard wingtips, the removal of wing root leading edge extensions and drooping the trailing edges. These modifications resulted in a lower stalling speed of 38 kn at a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 2,300 lb compared to a 45 kn stalling speed at a 2,100 lb MTOW in the original aircraft. The Chipmunk's original de Havilland Gipsy Major engine was retained, but the original metal propeller was replaced with a lighter fine-pitch wooden propeller. The prototype was built using two Chipmunks; the then- Department of Civil Aviation (now the Civil Aviation Safety Authority) found problems with the fuselage modifications, which necessitated modifying a second fuselage. The prototype first flew in mid-1965 and was granted a Type Certificate and Certificate of Airworthiness on 1 September 1965; it was then damaged beyond repair in a crash at Goulburn the following day.Allen, Eric. \\"Made in Australia, Three Aussie AGplanes, Airtruk - Cropmaster - Spraymaster\\", Aero Australia magazine, No. 19, July/September 2008, p42-48. Chevron Publishing Group Pty. Ltd., Lane Cove NSW. Two more aircraft were converted, one of which crashed in 1970. The remaining Spraymaster was restored to stock Chipmunk configuration in the mid-2000s for use as a Warbird.\\"Tropical Warbird!\\", Classic Wings magazine, Issue 71 (Vol. 16, No. 3), p44.

Aerostructures proposed a more capable version with a 110-gallon (500 l) hopper, MTOW of 2,800 lb (1,270 kg), and a 210 hp Continental IO-360 engine. This was to be called the SA-29 Mk. 2. A larger aircraft with four seats and a one-ton hopper was also proposed; in the event neither design left the drawing board. Aerostructures also performed a two- seat non-agricultural conversion called the Sundowner that had many of the same modifications as the Spraymaster, and which had wingtip fuel tanks as well.Aerostructures Sundowner description page.

Facts Carter was the Governor of Fort Marlborough (now Bengkulu, Sumatra), built by the British East India Company. Carter took out an insurance policy with Boehm against the fort being taken by a foreign enemy. A witness, Captain Tryon, testified that Carter was aware that the fort was built to resist attacks from natives but would be unable to repel European enemies, and he knew the French were likely to attack. The French successfully attacked, but Boehm refused to honour the indemnifier Carter, who promptly sued. Judgment Lord Mansfield held that Mr Carter, as the proposer owed a duty of utmost good faith (uberrimae fidei) to the insurer, he was required to disclose all facts material to the risk: Lord Mansfield went on to hold that the duty was reciprocal and that if an insurer withheld material facts, the example cited being that an insured vessel had already arrived safely, the policyholder could declare the policy void and recover the premium. Lord Mansfield proceeded to qualify the duty of disclosure: Lord Mansfield found in favour of the policyholder on the grounds that the insurer knew or ought to have known that the risk existed as the political situation was public knowledge: Significance In Manifest Shipping Co Ltd v Uni-Polaris Shipping Co Ltd[2001] UKHL 1 Lord Hobhouse said, See also *HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd v Chase Manhattan Bank Rix LJ stated, \\"I am conscious that in Carter v. Boehm itself Lord Mansfield does seem to have considered that there was a difference between the concealment which the duty of good faith prohibited and mere silence (‚ÄòAliud est celare; aliud tacere‚Ä¶). As a result, non-disclosure in the insurance context in the early years was referred to as a ‚Äòconcealment‚Äô, and the doctrine has sometimes been viewed and explained as constructive fraud. However, Lord Mansfield was seeking to propound a doctrine of good faith which would extend through the law of contract, and in that respect his view did not bear fruit. Where, however, in the insurance context it put down firm roots, it came to be seen as a doctrine which went much further than the antithesis of fraud, and, as it came to be developed, ‚Äúnon-disclosure will in a substantial proportion of cases be the result of an innocent mistake.\\" *English contract law *Good faith *List of cases involving Lord Mansfield  References  Citations  Sources = * Stephen Watterson, ‚ÄòCarter v Boehm (1766)‚Äô, ch 3 in C Mitchell and P Mitchell, Landmark Cases in the Law of Contract (Hart Publishing, 2008).

Facts A wager was made on the sex of a certain individual. The individual concerned was a French national known as Monsieur le Chevalier D'Eon. D'Eon was a captain in the Dragoons and had served France in diplomatic postings firstly in Russia and later in England. He had been awarded the Cross of Saint-Louis during the reign of Louis XV in recognition of his service in the Dragoons and his diplomatic work. In the reign of Louis XV, the king established a spy service which was known as the Secret. The existence of Secret was not known to the king's ministers: It reported directly to him. During his time in England he fell out of favour with two of the king's ministers (a dispute having started over the level of his expenses), leading to his replacement by another diplomat. He continued to serve his country as a spy and therefore reported indirectly to the king. He held concerns that if he were to return to France he could have been imprisoned on the Bastille. Over time, he made comments which threw doubt on his true sex. Being well known in London, comments about his sex became the subject of talk and comment in the press. In turn this led to numerous wagering contracts being entered into. The wager in the Da Costa v Jones was not the first to have come before the courts. In an earlier case (also before Lord Mansfield) it was held, on the evidence provided by witnesses (including two doctors) to a jury that Monsieur D'Eon was female. It was not until this case that the Court (Lord Mansfield) considered the public policy issues arising from this form of wager. Judgment Lord Mansfield held the contract was ineffective, on the basis that it was not in good faith.

It was subsequently upheld by another House of Lords case, Photoproductions v Securicor, and together these two cases form the definitive statement of the common law prior to the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. Facts The case involved a two-year time charter to export coal from Europe to the USA. The ship was to make as many trips as possible, and the owners were to be paid an agreed freight rate according to the amount of cargo carried. If the laytime \\"Laytime\\" is the allowable period for the charterer to arrange loading and unloading were exceeded, the charterers were to pay demurrage of $1000 per day. Serious delays occurred because the charterers had difficulty both in getting cargo to the port, and in loading and unloading efficiently. Nevertheless, the shipowner did not cancel the contract, but allowed the charter to continue for the remainder of the two years. In all, only eight round trips were made, whereas the owners claimed that, without delays, a further six trips were feasible. The total demurrage payable amounted to only $150,000. The owners sued for damages, saying their claim should not be limited to the demurrage amount because the charterer's gross delays amounted to a fundamental breach of the contract. (To explain the financial background: from the charterer's point of view, it may have been economically more efficient to delay loading and unloading, and deliberately act in breach of breach the contract rather than to carry it out by making more voyages, because, after the contract had been made, the re-opening of the Suez Canal had led to a fall in freight rates). Judgment The owners claimed that the delays were so great as to constitute a fundamental breach of the charterparty. They argued that the $1000 per day demurrage was so derisory that the term amounted to an exclusion clause denying the shipowner appropriate compensation; and further, that the case of Karsales Ltd v Wallis meant that in the event of a fundamental breach, the law automatically denied such protection of any exclusion clauses. The House of Lords observed that since the charterparty did not prescribe a minimum number of voyages, there was no inherent breach by the charterers undertaking only 8 voyages rather than the 17 that the owners claimed were possible. Rather, if the delays meant that the charterer had exceeded laytime, then demurrage would be payable; and since the demurrage clause plainly showed that the parties had contemplated the possibility of delay, it followed that the delays did not amount to fundamental breach. (Nevertheless, the demurrage clause was in effect a limitation clause restricting the ability of the shipowner to claim actual losses). The court added that Karsales v Wallis had overstated the law, and that whether or not a fundamental breach extinguishes any protection that the defendant might rely on was a \\"question of construction\\" and NOT a \\"question of law\\". Therefore, the shipowners were entitled only to claim charterparty demurrage of $1000 per day, not full compensation for their actual loss. Commentary In his judgment, Lord Reid said of the charterparty terms, ‚ÄúIn the ordinary way the customer has no time to read them, and if he did read them he would probably not understand them. And if he did understand and object to any of them, he would generally be told he could take it or leave it. And if he then went to another supplier the result would be the same. Freedom to contract must surely imply some choice or room for bargaining.‚Äù It was plain from Lord Reid's comments that he viewed the shipowners to be the stronger contractual party, so that neither law nor equity could come to their aid once they had prescribed demurrage terms that were insufficient. In other cases before the Court of Appeal, Master of the Rolls Lord Denning had emphasised the significance of \\"inequality of bargaining power\\" in English contract law. Their Lordships distinguished the present case from \\"deviation\\" cases, such as Glynn v Margetson, Karsales v Wallis was based on Glynn v Margetson and Leduc v Ward. (Deviation occurs when a carrier departs from the agreed route or the usual route. The carrier's conduct thereby also \\"departs\\" from the purpose of the contract contemplated by the parties, with the effect that the carrier could not rely on the protection of any term limiting liability (whether the limitation provision was an express contract term, or one arising from, say, Article IV of the Hague-Visby Rules). After the Suisse Atlantique decision, there was a series of cases where the Court of Appeal patently ignored the findings of this case. One such case was Harbutt's \\"Plasticine\\" Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd.[1970] 1 QB 447 The House of Lords was less than amused, and in the Photo Productions case they emphatically reaffirmed the principles of the Suisse Atlantique.

Watson was the Amateur Athletic Union (A.A.U.) decathlon champion in 1940 and 1943. He was the first African-American to win the U.S. decathlon championship and the first African-American to be selected as the captain of any athletic team at the University of Michigan, being selected as the captain of the Michigan track team in 1939. While at Michigan, Watson won 12 individual Big Ten Conference championships, including three consecutive championships (1937‚Äì1939) in the long jump, discus and shot put. He served as a police officer for the Detroit Police Department for 25 years from the early 1940s until his retirement in 1966. Watson was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1982. Early years Watson was born in 1916 in Boley, Oklahoma. He moved with his family to Saginaw, Michigan, at age seven. He was one of the most outstanding athletes in the history of Saginaw High School. Originally, Watson intended to become a boxer and took up track as a means to improve his fitness. His biography at the Saginaw County Sports Hall of Fame describes his high school accomplishments as follows: > He was discovered in a gym class at Saginaw High School by coach Chester R. > Sackhouse, who had 50 boys high jumping a cross bar with Watson bouncing > over it with several feet to spare. Watson was called a one-man track team > at Saginaw High and also toiled in football and basketball for the Trojans. > The 6 ft. 200 pounder was known for his muscular physique and set shot put, > broad jump and high jump records while at Saginaw High. His toss of 53-10 > 3/8 in the shot put established a new state meet record ... University of Michigan After graduating from Saginaw High School, Watson enrolled in 1935 at the University of Michigan, where he competed in track under famed track coach Charles B. Hoyt. Watson's first year of competition came as a sophomore in 1937. The 1937 Big Ten Track Championship was held in Ann Arbor in the rain, and Watson won championships in the long jump, shot put and discus, and also excelled in sprints and high hurdles. Watson's effort helped Michigan to the conference championship and led to Watson's becoming known as \\"the one-man track team.\\" During Watson's three years competing on the track team, Michigan was referred to by the Associated Press as the \\"Yankees\\" of the Western Conference track, and Coach Hoyt called the 1939 team captained by Watson \\"his greatest Michigan team.\\" In his sophomore, junior and senior years, Watson dominated his events, winning Big Ten Championships in the long jump, shot put and discus three straight years from 1937-1939. In all, Watson won 12 individual championships in six track seasons (three indoor and three outdoor) competing for the University of Michigan. He also set several University of Michigan and Big Ten Conference records, including a discus record of 160-10 5/8. The Associated Press called Watson a \\"finely proportioned negro\\" and \\"the big gun to watch in Michigan's powerhouse array of talent.\\" Watson was so dominant in so many events that he became known as \\"the University of Michigan's one-man track team.\\" Watson's coach, Charles Hoyt, attributed Watson's amazing ability to \\"speed and an infinite capacity for detail.\\" Hoyt noted that Watson spent hours at a time perfecting timing and improving muscle co-ordination and noted: \\"Very few athletes display such patience and willingness to learn.\\" In Watson's senior year, his teammates elected him as the captain of the track team, making him the first African- American ever to be elected as the captain of any team in the 102-year history of the University of Michigan. Personally, press accounts described Watson as \\"quiet and unassuming, intelligent, a high-ranking student,\\" with \\"a thorough social understanding.\\" Olympic hopeful and decathlon champion As Watson concluded his collegiate career in 1939, he took a job as the private secretary to heavyweight boxing champion, Joe Louis, and began training for the 1940 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Expectations were high that Watson would be one of the United States' biggest stars in the 1940 Olympic games. In June 1939, sports columnist Charles Dunkley wrote and article predicting success for Watson in Helsinki. Dunkley wrote: > Two ambitions figure to zoom 'Big Bill' Watson, 20-year-old negro lad, > called the University of Michigan's one-man track team, to distinguished > athletic heights. Foremost is a proud desire to wear the shield of the > United States across his chest in the Olympic games in Finland a year hence. > The other is to set a new world's record in the shot put. Nothing short of a > permanent injury can keep this remarkable negro youngster from accomplishing > both, says Charles B. Hoyt, his coach. In predicting that a permanent injury was the only thing that could derail Watson's Olympic dreams, Dunkley and Hoyt failed to account for the outbreak of World War II in Europe less than three months away. During the summer of 1939, Watson toured pre-war Europe with a handpicked U.S. track team. And on August 21, 1939, less than two weeks before the German invasion of Poland, Time magazine predicted that Watson would be America's 1940 Olympic hero, even comparing him to Jesse Owens. Time's August 1939 profile of Watson stated: > In the 1936 Olympics, the No. 1 hero was Negro Jesse Owens of Cleveland ... > Last week it appeared that the 1940 Olympic hero would be another midwestern > U.

With his talent in numerous track and field events, many believed Watson could have set a new world decathlon record in the Olympics. However, the 1940 Olympic games were cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. With the Olympics canceled, the only decathlon competition held in the United States was the June 1940 A.A.U. championship held in Cleveland, Ohio. The favorites going into the 1940 A.A.U. championship were Watson and two-time defending American decathlon champion, Joe Scott, who had overcome infantile paralysis. One writer described the anticipated matchup between Watson and Scott as follows: > This time, however, Scott goes against the finest all-round athlete he has > faced in his three years of competition -- Big Bill Watson, the negro who > paced Michigan to three straight Big Ten titles. ... This is the first time > Watson has participated in the grueling test and a comparison of his and > Scott's abilities indicates the rest of the field will merely be a > supporting cast for their act. In the end, Watson outscored Scott by more than 800 points, finishing with 7,523 points in the two-day, 10-event championship. Watson was the first African-American to win the American decathlon championship and also set two new decathlon records, with a discus throw of 151 ft. 3-5/8 in., and a time of 10.8 seconds in the 100-meter dash. Watson did not compete in the 1941 A.A.U. championship, but attempted a comeback at the 1942 A.A.U. meet in Chicago. Watson won the shot put and finished in second place with a score of 6,076 points‚Äînearly 1,500 points below his 1940 score. By 1943, Watson had joined the Detroit Police Department, but took time to compete for the Detroit Police Athletic Club in the 1943 A.A.U. championship in Elizabeth, New Jersey. At the meet, the Detroit policeman easily won his second American decathlon championship. Watson compiled a 513-point lead in the first nine events and chose not to compete in the 1,500-meter run, the final event of the decathlon. He finished with 5,994 points in nine events, beating runner-up Joshua Williamson by 186 points. With World War II continuing, the 1944 Olympic games were again cancelled, and with the cancellation, Watson lost his second and final chance to compete for an Olympic gold medal in the decathlon. Watson continued training in 1944 to defend his A.A.U. decathlon championship, but a sinus attack forced him to withdraw from the competition. At the time, Detroit police officer Watson said, \\"I sure am sorry to miss the decathlon, because I think I could have won it again.\\" Later years and honors By the time the Olympic Games were resumed in 1948, Watson had given up track competition for a full-time career with the Detroit Police Department. Watson worked as a police officer for 25 years, winning eight meritorious service citations. Watson retired from the Detroit Police Department in 1966 and died at age 56 in Detroit in 1973. Waston is buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Saginaw. He was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1982 and was inducted into the inaugural class of the Saginaw County Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.http://saginawcountysports.com/Inductees/2002/Bios/Watson.html See also * University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor References Category:1916 births Category:1973 deaths Category:African-American male track and field athletes Category:Detroit Police Department officers Category:Michigan Wolverines men's track and field athletes Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:Sportspeople from Saginaw, Michigan Category:Track and field athletes from Michigan ","title":"William Watson (decathlete)"},{"id":"20860893","text":"The Summit Range is a mountain range in San Bernardino County, California.

It can give stress-strain curves up to considerably > higher strains than tensile tests.Handbook of Metallurgical Process Design, > By George E. Totten, Kiyoshi Funatani, Lin Xie, CRC Press Plane-strain compression testing is typically used for measuring mechanical properties and for exploring microstructure development in the course of thermomechanical treatment. During the test the specimen is placed between the punches and the constrain plates. When the upper punch is pushed down during the material test, the specimen is extended to horizontal directions. Friction between the tool and the specimen can be reduced by applying lubricants, such as graphite, MoS2, glass or PTFE(Teflon).Yabe, S., Terano, M., & Yoshino, M. (2014). Plane strain compression test and simple shear test of single crystal pure iron. Procedia Engineering, 81, 1342-1347. The testing essentially consists of a thin metal bar being compressed by two equally wide compressive strips, which are located of opposite sides of the thin bar. Then, over a range of increasing loads on the bar, the compressive forces lead to the thickness of the metal bar being reduced. This change of thickness is then measured sequentially after each loading, and after some mathematics a stress- strain curve can be plotted. The advantages of the Watts-Ford test are that it is convenient for testing thin sheets or strips, it is similar to a rolling process (in manufacturing analyses), frictional effects may be minimized, here is no 'barelling' as would occur in a cylindrical compression test, and the plane strain deformation eases the analysis. Stress-strain curve The stress- strain curve is the relationship between the stress (force per unit area) and strain (resulting compression/stretching, known as deformation) that a particular material displays; stress‚Äìstrain curves of various materials differ widely, and different tensile tests conducted on the same material yield different results depending upon the temperature of the specimen and the speed of the loading. When performing Watts-Ford tests, temperatures of the metal specimens will vary from 800-1100 ¬∞C and strain rates of (0.01- 10 s-1). { !Stress-strain curve } Pressure The average pressure on a unit of area of the contact surface between the punch and the specimen is expressed as: P= F/(wb), where F is force, w is the punch width, b is the specimen width.Drozd, K., Horsinka, J., KLIBER, J., ƒåERN√ù, M., OSTROUSHKO, D., & MAMUZIC, I.

Life In 1603 he was master of the 50-ton ship Grace, sent by Sir Francis Cherry on a trading and exploratory voyage. After sailing to the Kola River, they went to the northwest, intending to make \\"some further discoveries\\". On 16 August (OS) they sighted Bear Island‚Äîthe first English expedition to do so. They spent the next day exploring the coast, but returned aboard ship \\"without any profit\\". The expedition returned to London on 10 September. The following year, 1604, Bennet was sent as master of the 60-ton ship Godspeed on a trading and sealing expedition, with Thomas Welden as merchant. They left London in mid-April, and spent the following two months in Norway and Russia. They came to Bear Island early in July. They stayed at the island until 13 July, taking over a hundred walrus with fowling pieces and muskets. They spent the latter half of July and part of August at \\"Pechingo in Lapland\\" and Kola, returning to the Thames on 15 October. On their return to London they renamed Bear Island Cherry Island, in honor of Sir Francis Cherry, who \\"was at the charges of this Discoverie\\". In 1605 Bennet was again sent as master of a 60-ton ship on a voyage to Cherry Island, with Welden as merchant, again. They left London on 1 May but were captured by a Dunkirk ship on the 23rd, which, \\"tooke from us two Hogsheads of strong Beere, our Muskets, a Fowling Peece of Master Weldens, which cost three pounds sterling.\\" They arrived at Cherry Island on 2 July and four days later began hunting walrus, now killing them with both \\"shot and javelings\\". They obtained eleven tuns of oil, as well as taking their tusks. The expedition returned to London on 24 August. In 1606 Bennet was again master of the same 60-ton ship on a sealing expedition to Cherry Island, with Welden again as merchant. In 1611 he served as master of the 150-ton ship Mary Margaret, which was sent to Spitsbergen on a whaling expedition. Due to Bennet's negligence the Mary Margaret was driven ashore by ice in or near Engelskbukta. The men were forced to row and sail to Bear Island, where they found Jonas Poole, master of the Elizabeth (which was sent to accompany the Mary Margaret). References * Purchas, S. (1625).

Together with Oskar Strnad, he created the Vienna School of Architecture, and its concept of Modern houses, housing and interiors.  Life  Josef Frank was of Jewish ancestry. His parents, merchant Ignaz (Isak) Frank (October 17, 1851 - January 27, 1921 Vienna) and the Vienna-born Jenny (September 3, 1861-10 February 1941 Vienna), were originally from Heves in Hungary. He designed his parents' grave in the old Jewish section of Vienna's Central Cemetery (Group 19, Row 58, Grave No.52).All information regarding parents from the article by George Gaugusch: Genealogy of the families Feilendorf and Frank in I. Meder (ed.): Joseph Frank 1885-1967 - Eine Moderne der Unordnung, 2008 (in German) He studied architecture at the Vienna University of Technology. He then taught at the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts from 1919 to 1925. He was a founding member of the Vienna Werkbund, initiator and leader of the 1932 project Werkbundsiedlung in Vienna. In 1933, he emigrated to Sweden, where he gained citizenship in 1939. He was the most prestigious designer in the Stockholm design company Svenskt Tenn (Swedish Pewter). He remained in Sweden after 1945 despite attempts to return him to Vienna. The Vienna Circle manifesto lists three of his publications in a bibliography of closely related authors. He was also the brother of the physicist, mathematician, and philosopher Philipp Frank.  Legacy  Josef Frank dealt early on with public housing and housing estates. Contrary to most other architects of the interwar period in Vienna, he took the idea of settlement and not the creation of so-called super blocks in the municipal housing. He also rejected facade decor and clearly preferred functional forms. The Viennese architect and furniture designer Luigi Blue refers to him as one of his idols. In addition to his architectural work he created numerous designs for furniture, furnishings, fabrics, wallpaper and carpet. He has been a painter, as well. An exhibition of his textile designs is to be held from January to May 2017, at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London.

Throughout much of the 20th century, it was officially illegal but rarely were laws against abortion ever enforced. In 1995, legislation was passed which made abortion legal as long as it was done within the first 8 weeks of pregnancy and done with the consent of the pregnant woman and by a licensed medical practitioner.https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/guyana.doc Between 8 and 12 weeks from conception, abortion is only legal if the pending childbirth would result in health risks for the woman or the fetus, or if the pregnancy occurred despite the use of contraceptives. Between 12 and 16 weeks, an abortion can still be legally performed, but only if the health of the woman or fetus is in danger. After 16 weeks, it is only possible to perform an abortion in the case of severe health-related circumstances. In 2006, the Guyanese government theoretically cleared the way for public hospitals to \\"perform abortions.\\" In actuality, the public hospitals only complete abortions which have already been partially undertaken by pregnant women. They began doing so in 2008. The Guyanese government continues to look for ways to lower the number of abortions in Guyana.

Commando was a pigeon used in service with the British armed forces during the Second World War to carry crucial intelligence. The pigeon carried out more than ninety missions during the war, and received the Dickin Medal (the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross) for three particularly notable missions in 1942. The medal was later sold at an auction for ¬£9,200. Early life Commando, a red chequer bird, was bred in Haywards Heath, Sussex in the United Kingdom by Sid Moon. Moon was a pigeon fancier who had served with the Army Pigeon Service during the First World War. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Moon offered the service of his pigeons to the war effort in 1939. Commando was one of the pigeons taken into military service. Military career Pigeons were used where radio communications and had become highly dangerous. A small canister was attached to the pigeon's leg, which contained the information that was being sent. Fewer than one in eight of the pigeons were able to conclude their missions successfully. Most fell victim to the marksmen and falconers that German troops used to intercept these birds along the French coast, while others were killed through bad weather, exhaustion, or by wild birds of prey. Serving with the National Pigeon Service (NPS) during the Second World War, Commando had been given the identification code N.U.R.P.38.EGU.242. During his career, Commando made more than ninety trips into and out of German occupied France, carrying confidential messages. Messenger pigeons were carried into the war zones by British paratroopers, and released as needed with messages attached to fly home. He was noted for three particular missions carried out in 1942‚Äîone in June, another in August, and the third in September‚Äîin which he carried crucial intelligence to Britain from agents in France. This vital information included the location of German troops, industrial sites and injured British soldiers. Recognition For these three missions that Commando conducted, he received the PDSA Dickin Medal, which is considered to be the animals' medal equivalent to the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for bravery in the UK. He received the award along with Royal Blue, the King's pigeon from the Royal Lofts at Sandringham. They were both presented their awards on 12 April 1945 in London by Rear Admiral R. M. Bellairs. The citation for the award that Commando received is as follows. The medal was auctioned by Valerie Theobold, Moon's grand daughter, in 2004. It was bought by a British collector for ¬£9,200. It had been valued in a range between ¬£5,000 to ¬£7,000. Post-military life After the war, Commando enjoyed a somewhat celebrity-like status. He also participated in an exhibition of wartime homing pigeons.

He was a founder of the weekly teen pop newspaper Go-Set in 1966, NOTE: This PDF is 282 pages. which introduced Australia's first national pop record charts and featured many notable contributors before it was discontinued in 1974. He also published the more explicitly counterculture magazines Revolution, High Times and The Digger. He launched the Australian edition of Rolling Stone magazine, first as a supplement in Revolution in 1970, then as a full-fledged magazine in 1972. From 1976 to 2011, Frazer lived in the United States, where he launched, and collaborated in the launching of, numerous political publications, most notably The Hightower Lowdown. Biography Phillip Frazer was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1946 and graduated Monash University with an arts degree majoring in politics. He co- edited the student newspaper Lot's Wife in 1965 with future parliamentarian Peter Steedman. Early in 1966, Frazer, fellow Monash student Tony Schauble, and local band manager Peter Raphael launched Go-Set, a teen-oriented pop music newspaper. The magazine was soon selling more than 70,000 copies a week, with more than 25 full-time staff in offices in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. With the sole exception of the accountant, all the staff were under 30. Many went on to significant careers in journalism (Greg Quill, Vince Lovegrove), creative writing (Lily Brett, Jean Bedford, Damien Broderick), photography (Colin Beard, Grant Mudford), filmmaking (David Elfick, Bob Weis), graphic art (Ian McCausland) and television (Molly Meldrum). In 1970, Frazer used Go-Set's facilities to launch a counter- cultural monthly named Revolution, NOTE: On-line version is a 'snippet view' then negotiated with Rolling Stone owner and publisher Jann Wenner for several pages of that magazine to be included as a supplement. Frazer folded Revolution into a new magazine he called High Times in August 1971, then left Go-Set when, in February 1972, the paper's printer took a controlling interest. Later that year he launched the Australian Rolling Stone as a separate magazine, and then founded The Digger. (The Australian Rolling Stone continued publishing until 2018.) With Frazer as the common thread,The Digger was produced by a frequently changing collective‚Äîincluding Bruce Hanford, Helen Garner, Ponch Hawkes, Colin Talbot, Garrie Hutchinson, Virginia Fraser, Sandra Goldbloom, and Isabelle Rosemberg, plus Hall Greenland, Grant Evans and Michael Zerman in the Sydney office‚Äîuntil December 1975, when it folded under the weight of too little money and too many lawsuits‚Äî including a libel suit from Builders Labourers union boss Norm Gallagher, another filed by a senior South Australian police official, and an obscenity case brought by the State of Victoria for Helen Garner's article describing a sex-education class. Frazer left Australia for the United States in July, 1976. In New York, Frazer became an editor of Seven Days, a U.S. alternative newsmagazine, then worked on other U.S. political magazines including The Nation, the anti-nuclear-power organization No-Nukes, and in 1981-82 edited Ralph Nader's Multinational Monitor. In the 1990s he published the liberal Washington Spectator newsletter, and published, edited and wrote the environment newsletter News on Earth. In 1999 he founded The Hightower Lowdown with Jim Hightower. The Lowdown, with around 100,000 paying subscribers, is one of the biggest circulation political publications in the US, notable for its criticism of Bill Clinton's, George W. Bush's, Barack Obama's, and Donald Trump's administrations for being beholden to corporations and a corporatist ideology. Frazer published and co-edited the newsletter until August 2013 when he relocated to Australia where he writes for Griffith Review, the Byron Echo, dailyreview.com.au, and his blog at coorabellridge.com. In 2015 he joined a public debate on the role of the USpdat in the overthrow of the Australian Labor Party government in 1975, republishing a 1984 account of that event with updates from evidence that emerged after the death of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam and the publication of the novel \\"Amnesia\\" by Peter Carey. Personal life Frazer has a son and a daughter from a long-term relationship with New York educator and economist, Dr Cydney Pullman. His partner since 2004 is Australian author, Kate Veitch, who has published two novels Listen (2008) re-titled Without a Backward Glance in the US, and Trust (2009), as well as essays published in The Griffith Review.

The project includes a pool, the largest in a New York City residential building, as well as a quarter-acre public park on the west side of the towers. The Silver Towers were completed in June 2009. Larry Silverstein, who developed the buildings, bought the block between 42nd and 41st Streets between 11th and 12th Avenues in 1984 for $20 million. At the time, the site was vacant and zoned for single story industrial use. The block was rezoned in 1989, and One River Place, a 41-story residential high-rise on the west end opened in 2000. In 2000, Silverstein contemplated developing an office building on the east end of the block. A few years later, the site was considered as the location for a 1,500-room hotel as part of the plans to expand the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Costas Kondylis is the architect for the Silver Towers, who also designed One River Place. The original design called for a single large residential building (Two River Place) like its neighbor on the west end of the block.

Lord Wilberforce decided that the date appropriate is the date of breach, or when a contracting party could reasonably be aware of a breach. Five major principles it laid down were, #termination for breach of contract is \\"prospective\\", not \\"retrospective\\"; i.e. repudiatory breach of contract discharges both parties from future performance of their contractual obligations, but leaves their accrued rights intact (and themselves open to damages) #a claimant for specific performance does not forfeit his right to terminate the contract by accepting a defendant's repudiatory breach #when a specific performance decree is made, a court oversees performance, and it has the sole jurisdiction to determine whether that obligation can be discharged #common law damages are assessed at the date of the breach of the contract, though the court may fix another date if justice requires #the same principles for awarding common law damages applies to awarding equitable damages under s 50 Supreme Court Act 1981 Facts The 'commonplace, indeed routine'per Lord Wilberforce, [1980] AC 367, 390 facts were that Mrs Adeline Agnew twice failed to complete purchase of Michael and Renee Johnson's farm, Scheepcote Grange, Woodburn Common, Buckinghamshire. She had contracted to buy the farm on 1 November 1973 for ¬£117,000. When everything was ready in December and January 1974, she did nothing. Meanwhile, the Johnsons were in financial trouble. They were in arrears on mortgage repayments. In March 1974 they claimed specific performance of the contract, and won summary judgment in June, but the order was not drawn up until November, and so the Johnsons left it, because in the meantime, the mortgagees had won orders for possession and sale of the property. The Johnsons' lawyer advised there was no point enforcing against Agnew. The mortgagees only realised ¬£48,000, not even enough to discharge the Johnsons' mortgage debts. The Johnsons' creditors filed them into bankruptcy. This was adjourned, and the Johnsons' brought a claim against Agnew seeking the purchase price (less deposit and the ¬£48,000 realised on sale by the mortgagees), and a declaration that the contract was repudiated and to keep the deposit price. Judgment Lord Wilberforce said, On the prospective nature of a repudiatory breach, he said this.

Biography He was born on March 16, 1870, in Plano, Illinois, to George W. Haiselden and Elizabeth Dickey. George Haiselden was a painter before he disappeared from public record. Dr. Haiselden rarely mentions his father, but was extremely close to his mother. In 1893 he graduated from the University of Illinois College of Medicine. From 1893 to 1906, Haiselden served as Christian Fenger's resident at the German Hospital. In 1896 when Fenger opened the German-American Hospital, Haiselden became his assistant until Fenger's death in 1902 when Haiselden assumed the position of Chief Surgeon and Hospital president. The same year he joined Fenger at the German-American Hospital, Haiselden opened the Bethesda Industrial Home for Incurables. Little is known about this institution, but Haiselden later became an outspoken opponent of institutionalization of the mentally ill. His experience with the Illinois State Institution for the Feebleminded in Lincoln, Illinois, exposed him to the horrors of institutionalization and would later help justify his decision to let deformed infants die rather than grow up to become institutionalized themselves. Haiselden never married but did become a father to two adopted children, Dorothy Riggs and Beulah Hope Wesley, who had been abandoned at Haiselden's hospital. Early on the morning of November 12, 1915, another doctor at the German-American Hospital awakened Dr. Haiselden and informed him that patient Anna Bollinger had given birth to a baby boy with serious birth defects. Though Haiselden determined that surgery could save the infant's life, he advised the parents to take no action, convinced that their son could never lead a normal life. Five days later the baby, John Bollinger, died.Martin S. Pernick, The Black Stork: Eugenics and the Death of \\"Defective\\" Babies in American Medicine and Motion Pictures Since 1915 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 3-4. Haiselden then began a vigorous publicity campaign in defense of his decision, turning the Bollinger case into a major news story across the United States. His actions provoked passionate arguments both supporting and condemning his actions. Settlement house movement leader Jane Addams spoke out against him, while nurse and reform advocate Lillian Wald supported him. Helen Keller penned an article for The New Republic entitled \\"Physicians' juries for defective babies,\\" in which she advocated on Haiselden's behalf. \\"It is the possibility of happiness, intelligence and power that give life its sanctity,\\" she wrote, \\"and they are absent in the case of a poor, misshapen, paralyzed, unthinking creature.\\"John Gerdtz, \\"Disability and Euthanasia: The Case of Helen Keller and the Bollinger Baby,\\" http://www.uffl.org/vol16/gerdtz06.pdf While the debate raged on, the Chicago Medical Society threatened Haiselden with expulsion for his decision to allow John Bollinger to die. He was acquitted by a trial jury, but eventually thrown out of practice by the Chicago Medical Board for his lecture series on eugenics and promotion of The Black Stork. Haiselden starred as himself in The Black Stork, a 1917 silent movie that dramatized the events of the Bollinger case. Haiselden wrote the movie in conjunction with Jack Lait, a muckraking journalist. The National Board of Review of Motion Pictures almost banned the film but after surveying opinions from prominent review board members from across the country, decided to require 18 changes to The Black Stork before permitting its release. Haiselden complied with the majority of the NBRMP's requests and the board allowed its release. Because of the film's controversial content, theaters offered special male-only and female-only viewings. In 1918 it was played under the title Are You Fit to Marry? and continued to appear in theaters until as late as 1942.The Black Stork: Eugenics and the Death of \\"Defective\\" Babies in American Medicine and Motion Pictures Since 1915 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 5-6.

He also worked with London's Metropolitan Police, instigating alien registration in Britain. Biography Ignatius Pollaky by Faustin Betbeder (1874) Pollaky was born in Pressburg, Hungary (now Bratislava, Slovakia). He was exiled and came to live in Britain in 1850. In 1856 he married Julia Devonald. However she died in 1859. Two years later he married Mary Anne Hughes. They had a son and three daughters over the next nine years. In 1862 he started an early private detective agency in Britain, Pollaky's Private Inquiry Office. One of his first commissions was from Henry Sanford who asked him to spy on Confederate agents in Britain who were purchasing supplies for the American Civil War. From 1865 until 1882 his office was located at 13 Paddington Green, hence his nickname. He often advertised in the personal section of The Times offering assistance in \\"election, divorce and libel cases\\" or \\"discreet enquiries in England or abroad\\". From 1861 onwards, he also was in the habit of inserting mysterious messages in the \\"Agony\\" columns, presumably linked to cases that he was working on. In 1867 he joined the X Division of the Metropolitan Police as a special constable. He specialised in intelligence on aliens living in Britain. His experience in this area made him advocate the registration of all aliens upon arrival in Britain, something which was not done at the time. During his career his reputation grew to the point that his surname was used as a humorous remonstrance against over-eager questioning by the 1870s and in 1881 he was mentioned in the Gilbert and Sullivan work, Patience, as an example of \\"keen penetration\\". Apart from his detective work, he acted as the London correspondent for the International Criminal Police Gazette for more than 25 years. In 1882 he retired from the private investigation business and closed his office. In the same year, he inserted an advertisement on the front page of The Times stating that: 'the rumour that I am dead is not true'. After retiring from the private investigation business he moved to 33 Stanford Avenue, Brighton where he lived quietly with his wife. During his retirement he was well known for playing chess in the Public Room at the Brighton Pavilion and often wrote letters to The Times, signing them \\"Ritter von Pollaky\\". On 17 September 1914, he took the Oath of Allegiance and became a naturalised British Citizen.The London Gazette, 2 October 1914 As it happens, he had applied for British Citizenship before in 1862 but was refused. A search of National Archive records for Ignatius Pollaky will show the following: \\"Naturalization Act 1844: Applicants of doubtful character: Ignatius Pollaky, adventurer; certificate refused[...]Date range: 1 January 1862 ‚Äì 31 December 1862 Reference:HO 45/7263\\" He appears on the Electoral Registers for Paddington and St Marylebone district in 1873, 1875 and 1876. He died on 25 February 1918 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

Prior to 2006, abortion in Colombia was illegal without exceptions. Therapeutic abortion to save a mother's life was permitted between 1837 and 1936. As of 2020, abortion isn't a crime when it occurs under these three exceptions: (a) the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the life or health of the mother; (b) The existence of life-threatening fetal malformations; and (c) The pregnancy is the result of rape, non-consensual artificial insemination or incest. History The 1837 and 1936 penal legislation authorized therapeutic abortion while banning all other forms of abortion, regardless of whether the abortion consented or not. The 1890 Penal Code, in article 640, allowed for abortion when it was absolutely necessary to save the mother's life, but stated that the law did not recommend such means, which were \\"generally condemned\\" by the Catholic Church, the official religion at the time. In all other cases, a third party who attempted to abort a fetus without the woman's consent faced three to six years' imprisonment (five to ten years if the abortion was successful) or one to three years imprisonment if the woman consented (four to eight years if the abortion was successful). If a medical professional, midwife, or apothecary was found guilty of the above crimes, the sentence would be increased by six months to a year. The law also provided for reduced sentences, of 3‚Äì6 months (5‚Äì10 months if the abortion was successful), in the case of \\"honest women of good reputation\\" who received an abortion to \\"conceal their frailty\\" (aborto honoris causa). A very conservative 1922 law to reform the penal code would have eliminated therapeutic abortion and punished women who sought an abortion but maintained the aborto honoris causa, but the law never entered into force. The aborto honoris causa, a legal concept inherited from Spain and Italy, was based on the opinion that a single mother had lost her honour. The 1936 Penal Code differentiated between consented abortion (one to four years imprisonment for the woman and practitioner) and abortion not consented to (one to six years for the practitioner), maintaining provisions for a reduced sentence (reduced by a half to two thirds) or full pardon for an abortion to save one's honour or that of the mother, sister, woman, her descendants, or adopted girl. The 1980 Penal Code, in articles 343 to 345, removed the aborto honoris causa and adopted penalties and attenuating circumstances which would be largely retained by the current penal code, adopted in 2000. Decree 100 of 1980. (Penal Code) \\"ARTICLE 343. ABORTION. The woman who causes her abortion or allows another to cause it, shall be in prison for one to three years. The same sanction shall be subject to who, with the consent of the woman, performs the act provided for in the preceding paragraph. \\" =Sentence C-133 of 1994= The constitutionality of Article 343 of the 1980 Penal Code was challenged to the Constitutional Court in 1994, which ruled in favour of the article criminalizing abortion in sentence C-133 of March 17, 1994. The majority opinion of the court contended the 1991 Constitution, which recognizes life as a fundamental right (in article 11) and cites it as one of the founding principles in the constitutional preamble and article 2, recognized the \\"primacy and inviolability of life\\", excluding any possibility for abortion and allowing the legislator to penalize such acts. Furthermore, it opined that \\"the life of the unborn embodies a fundamental value, for the hope of its existence as a person, and its apparent helplessness requires special attention from the State.\\" Thus, Colombia's abortion legislation was constitutional under the State's obligation to protect the life of \\"all persons\\", which, at the time, the Court claimed \\"obviously\\" protected life during its formation and development given that these stages were condition for the viability of birth, the origin of the legal existence of a person. In addition, the Court said, if the Constitution gives couples the right to decide their number of children, this right could only be exercised prior to conception since conception creates a being which is existentially distinct from the mother. =Legal situation prior to 2006= Abortion was legally regulated by articles 122 through 124 of the Colombian Penal Code (law 599 of 2000). Article 122 of the Penal Code punished women who self-induced or consented to someone else inducing her abortion to imprisonment for a period of one to three years, increased to a term of 16 to 54 months by law 890 of 2004. Article 123 punished those who practised an abortion without the woman's consent or on a girl under fourteen years of age to a period of imprisonment of 4 to 10 years, increased to 64 to 180 months by the 2004 law. Article 124, finally, allowed for attenuating circumstances: the prescribed penalty for abortion would be reduced by three quarters when the pregnancy was the result of rape or non-consensual artificial insemination. = Legislation (2015 - current) = In November 2015, Attorney General Eduardo Montealegre announced that he would send a bill to Congress legalizing abortion on request in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The Minister of Health, Alejandro Gaviria, supports legalizing abortion but said that Montealegre's bill was not the most suitable mechanism to do so, claiming instead that the obstacles are not legal but rather disinformation and cultural factors. On March 14, 2020 the Colombian Constitutional Court issued a decision regarding a claim received against the current law which requested a complete ban on abortions. The claim argued that abortion was unconstitutional and limited the rights of the unborn. The Court ruled against banning all abortions, upholding the current requirements for the procedure. Martha Sulay Gonz√°lez's case In 2006, the case of Pereira woman Martha Sulay Gonz√°lez brought national attention to the issue of abortion in the country. Martha Sulay, already a mother of three, was diagnosed with cervical cancer while pregnant with her fourth child in 2004 (despite prior tubal ligation). Her requests for chemotherapy and radiotherapy were denied, as they would entail the termination of her pregnancy, which was illegal. Her doctors said that they decided to continue her pregnancy because, although medical literature indicated that in such cases the pregnancy should be ignored and radiotherapy started, therapeutic abortion is illegal in Colombia and they would be committing a crime. Her cancer metastasized in 2006. However, experts in medical law argued that an abortion in her case would not have been penalized, as one would not be seeking the death of the fetus but rather to save the mother's life. Court challenges Martha Sulay Gonz√°lez, supported by local and national groups, continued to demand the decriminalization of abortion in Colombia. Beginning in April 2005, several lawyers, led by M√≥nica Roa of the Women's Link Worldwide NGO, challenged the constitutionality of the abortion-related articles of the Penal Code to the Constitutional Court. The court consolidated three separate challenges into a single case. M√≥nica Roa's brief claimed that the ban on abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to the free development of her personality (libre desarrollo de la personalidad) and autonomy, because the State was preventing her from deciding freely on issues which pertained solely to her. She further suggested that the legislation was disproportional, violated a woman's right to equality (by criminalizing a medical practice only needed by women, while the denial of an abortion was a clear example of discrimination against women violating their constitutional rights to health and life). Besides article 122 of the Penal Code, Roa also challenged the phrase in article 123 which subjected those who practised abortions on minors under fourteen to a higher prison sentence, as she said it violated a young girl's constitutionally- recognized autonomy. Finally, Roa challenged the entirety of article 124, because merely initiating criminal proceedings for an abortion in the face of sexual violence was violation of a woman's dignity, freedom and autonomy. Supporting her arguments, Roa also argued that clandestine abortions threatened a woman's life and cited several opinions from international organizations and international human rights instruments (which are of constitutional value and legally binding in Colombian constitutional law). Other constitutional arguments presented in favour of decriminalization included the secularism of the State, gender equality, human dignity, the right to intimacy and the freedom of conscience. Religious opposition to abortion was particularly intense during the court challenge, particularly from the Catholic Church and Opus Dei, as well their allies in Congress. During the 2006 presidential campaign, incumbent President √Ålvaro Uribe said that he opposed abortion, but most of his rivals, including eventual second- place finisher Carlos Gaviria, a former Constitutional Court magistrate, supported abortion rights and the legal challenge to the Penal Code. The Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) opposed abortion as a family planning measure, but gave a favourable opinion to the decriminalization of abortion in certain cases. In its intervention before the Court, the Ombudsman (Defensor del Pueblo), an autonomous constitutional control organization, supported the legal challenge against the ban on abortion. Like other contributors, the Ombudsman claimed that the law was based on a retrograde view of women as \\"merely biological\\", ignoring modern constitutional provisions for gender equality. The Ministry of Social Protection primarily mentioned the public health risks associated with clandestine abortions to support its opinion that restrictive laws like those in Colombia were not efficient in any way in reducing unwanted pregnancies. The Episcopal Conference of Colombia opposed the decriminalization of abortion, arguing that the impugned articles of the Penal Code protected the life, health and integrity of the unborn but also of the mother. The Magisterium assailed modern notions of liberty where people take as their sole and indisputable reference for their own choices, \\"not the truth about good and evil, but only their subjective and changeable opinion or even their selfish and whimsical interest\\", leading to the loss of any reference to common values and to a state where everything is negotiable, \\"even the first of the fundamental rights, the right to life.\\" The Episcopal Conference argued that the \\"original and inalienable right to life\\" could not be subject to political debate, and stated that to \\"claim the right to abortion, to infanticide [...], means attributing to human freedom a perverse and evil significance: absolute power over and against others.\\" Notably, opponents of the challenge to the law brought attention to the American Convention on Human Rights, which states in article 4.1 that \\"Every person has the right to have his life respected. This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.\\" In addition to this formal intervention, the Constitutional Court received a written contribution signed by all the Archbishops in Colombia, including Pedro Rubiano Sa√©nz, Archbishop of Bogot√°, urging the Court to rule the articles constitutional. The Inspector General of Colombia, Edgardo Maya Villaz√≥n, asked the Court to decriminalize abortion in the cases of maternal health, life-threatening foetal defects and conception without the woman's consent (in legal terms, ruling article 122 conditionally constitutional). Constitutionally, the Inspector General held that the right to life must be balanced with and interpreted alongside the principle of human dignity. The Inspector General concluded that criminalizing abortion in the aforementioned cases constituted an unreasonable and disproportionate sanction, interfering with a woman's fundamental rights. Sentence C-355 of 2006 On May 10, 2006, the Constitutional Court reached a 5-3 decision which partially decriminalized abortion in Colombia under certain circumstances. The majority opinion examined several constitutional and legal issues pertaining to life and fundamental rights, including: *Life and the right to live: The Court held that the Colombian Constitution not only protected the right to life but also recognized life as a value, which implied a duty for the State to protect life. However, if the legislators are allowed to adopt appropriate measures to comply with this duty, this does not mean that all measures adopted in this sense are necessarily justified, because life does not have the character of an absolute value or right and must be weighted with other constitutional values, principles and rights. The right to life (article 11 of the Constitution) is limited to human beings, while the protection of life as a value extends to the unborn. *Life in International human rights law: The Court considered the protection of the right to life in several international human rights treaties which hold constitutional status in Colombia as part of the 'constitutional bloc'. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child explicitly state that the right to life is held by the human person. The aforementioned American Convention on Human Rights states that the right to life must be protected by life, \\"in general\\" from the moment of conception; but the Court held that this was not of an absolute nature, notably because the terms \\"in general\\" contemplates possibilities in which the law does not protect life from the moment of conception. *Women's rights in the Colombian Constitution and international law: Gender equality and women's rights were constitutionally recognized in 1991, while international human rights conventions and legal instruments have protected women's reproductive rights and recognized violence against women as one of the most serious crimes. *Limits to the legislator's powers in criminal matters: While the Colombian legislator enjoys a wide margin of freedom in determining criminal law, this power is not unlimited. Criminal legislation must respect fundamental rights, constitutional principles and the legal principles of proportionality and reasonableness. Some of the constitutional limits to the legislator's power to legislate include human dignity (which, for women, includes the right to freely determine her life), the free development of personality (libre desarrollo de la personalidad, individual autonomy) the right to health (which, for women, includes reproductive health) and international law. Concretely, the Court ruled that the total ban on abortion in Article 122 of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. While the life of the unborn is protected by the constitutional order, the Court considered that the legislator is not obligated to adopt criminal laws to protect the life of the unborn, although it also stated that such measures were not disproportionate. However, a complete ban on abortion meant the complete dominance of one legal interest (the life of the unborn) over all others, specifically the fundamental rights of the mother. The Colombian Constitution, in the Court's opinion, is characterized by the coexistence of several values, principles and rights - none of which have an absolute value against the others. Therefore, the ban on abortion was therefore unconstitutional, as it completely ignored the dignity of the mother and reduced her to \\"a mere receptacle of unborn life, lacking rights or constitutionally relevant interests meriting protection.\\" Article 124, which imposed a reduced sentence on the mother in cases of rape, was also ruled to be unconstitutional because it was disproportionate. As a result, the Court ruled that abortion should be permitted in cases where the pregnancy is the result of rape, artificial insemination without consent, incest, if the pregnancy threatens the life and health (physical and mental) of the woman and in cases of foetal malformations rendering the fetus inviable. The Court also struck down the phrase \\"or in women younger than fourteen\\" in Article 123, which subjected those who practised an abortion on a woman younger than fourteen to a longer jail sentence. Prior constitutional jurisprudence had recognized that minors had the right, depending on their maturity, to consent to medical interventions or treatments. The Court concluded by stating that it had limited itself to noting the three 'extreme scenarios' which violated the Constitution, and that nothing prevents the legislator from decriminalizing abortion in other circumstances. Current legal situation To date, the Congress has not amended the Penal Code to take into account the Constitutional Court's C-355/06 ruling. Therefore, abortion in Colombia is currently permitted in the three instances which were decriminalized by sentence C-355/06. =Rape, incest and artificial insemination without consent= Abortion is permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape, abusive sexual intercourse without consent, incest and artificial insemination or transfer of a fertilized ovum without consent. It is necessary that, in such circumstances, the offence has been duly reported to the appropriate authorities. Sentence C-355/06 explicitly barred legislators from adopting regulatory measures which would establish disproportionate burdens on women's rights, such as demanding forensic evidence of sexual penetration. =Maternal life or health= Abortion is legal in cases where the continuation of the pregnancy constitutes a danger to the mother's physical or mental health or life, subject to medical certification. The Court did not establish specific cases which would constitute threats to a mother's health or life, instead leaving such tasks to medical professionals. =Fetal malformations= Abortion is legal in cases where medically certified serious fetal malformations mean that the newborn would probably not survive. The Court did not establish specific malformations, leaving such tasks to medical professionals. =Conscientious objection= In sentence C-355/06, the Constitutional Court reiterated that juridical persons do not have the right to conscientious objection, a right only recognized to natural persons. Therefore, no clinic, hospital or other health centre may refuse to practise abortions based on conscientious objections in the aforementioned cases. A doctor who refuses to practise an abortion must nevertheless refer the woman to another doctor who may perform the abortion. In another court ruling, T-209 of 2008, the Constitutional Court emphasized that a conscientious objection can only be based on religious convictions and not personal opinions. =Other circumstances= In the absence of any change to the law, an abortion in any other circumstance remains illegal and punishable by 16 to 54 months imprisonment for both the woman and the person who performed the abortion. Barriers and obstacles to abortion Despite the decriminalization of abortion in several women's groups and the Constitutional Court have identified a number of barriers imposed on women seeking a legal abortion. These include requests for additional requirements to those set forth by sentence C-355/06, unfounded conscientious objections and medical boards unjustifiably delaying the procedure by more than 5 days (the limit estimated by the Court to respond to a woman's request). In October 2009, the Constitutional Court heard the case of a woman who was diagnosed with a severe fetal malformation that was incompatible with life, but her healthcare provider would only authorize an abortion if a judge granted a judicial order to do so (a condition not required under the law), which the judge did not grant because of conscientious objections. The court's ruling reiterated that neither institutions nor judicial authorities can refuse a woman an abortion based on conscience claims, and stated that, under the circumstances where an abortion is legal, women \\"enjoy a right to decide, free from any pressure, coercion, urging, manipulation and, in general, any sort of inadmissible intervention, to terminate a pregnancy ‚Ä¶ it is forbidden to raise any obstacles, requirements or additional barriers.\\" Statistics In October 2013, the Guttmacher Institute reported an estimated 400,400 induced abortions were performed in Colombia in 2008, of which only 322 were reported as legal procedures. These numbers are much higher than the official statistics reported by the Ministry of Health, which indicated that 15,000 abortions were performed in Colombia between 2009 and 2012. In Bogot√°, according to the District Department of Health, there were 16,947 legal abortions carried out in the city between 2006 and 2013. The most commonly cited reasons for legal abortion procedures in Bogot√° were mental health (52.8%) and physical health (27.8%). According to the Prosecutor's Office, 2,290 women were criminalized for abortion between 2005 and 2017. Of these, 502 are minors and in addition to the three girls aged 11 and 12, there are 499 between the ages of 14 and 18 who have had to answer to justice. Approximately 25.2% of women penalized for abortion in Colombia are minors.  Supreme court decision on a lawsuit  On March 2, the Constitutional Court of Colombia declared itself inhibited and incompetent to issue a ruling regarding a lawsuit against the current decree that authorizes abortion only in three specific cases and that the lives of the mother and baby are endangered. The lawsuit asked to allow abortion without restrictions. The court said it did not have enough arguments to issue the Judgment.

History The petroglyphs were created by Southern Sinagua residents between about 1150 and 1400 AD. The site was known to early American settlers, and became part of the historic V Bar V ranch around 1907. The ranch headquarters were nearby, and the ranchers protected the site from vandalism.

Beaver Creek rock art style Rock art is one type of archaeological data that can be used to identify prehistoric cultures and time periods. The Beaver Creek rock art style has been identified and formally described through studies of rock art sites in the Beaver Creek area, especially at V Bar V. The Beaver Creek style, found throughout the eastern half of the Verde Valley, is diagnostic of the Southern Sinagua culture between A.D. 1150 and 1400. About 20% of the petroglyphs are zoomorphs, including snakes, turtles, coyotes, deer and antelope. The next most common types are anthropomorphs and geometric figures, such as spirals and grids. The documentation of the V Bar V Heritage Site has provided important information for defining the characteristics of the Beaver Creek style. V Bar V is unusual in that all of the petroglyphs are of this one style, and almost all are well- spaced, without overlap or newer designs drawn over older.

History  A penal code was set in place on September 22, 1982, which penalized illegal abortions. This code is still active today. In 2005, a poll was conducted with a simple questionnaire. One of the questions asked, \\"Do you agree or disagree with abortion?\\" 89.4% of those that answered were against abortions.http://www.pop.org/00000000147/the- epidemiology-of-abortion-in-pro-life-panama According to the CIA, based upon the population as a whole, 85% of Panamanians are against abortion. Approximately four-fifths of Panama's population practices Roman Catholicism, which has as its official stance that abortion is murder.  Legality  In Panama, abortion is illegal with the exception of two circumstances: if the mother's life is endangered by the pregnancy, or if she is the victim of rape or incest. Penalties for abortion The punishment for a woman who has an illegal abortion is one to three years in prison. The punishment for a doctor or other person who performs the procedure with the woman's consent is 3 to 6 years in prison. If the procedure is done without the woman's consent, the punishment is 5 to 10 years in prison. If the woman dies as a result of the abortion, the punishment for the abortionist is 5‚Äì10 years in prison. If the woman's husband is found guilty of performing the abortion, the penalties are increased by one sixth. Access to abortion facilities The only abortions allowed to be performed are done by doctors in government-run hospitals. However they can have access to abortion in international ocean space, where they are no longer under the jurisdiction of the republic of Panama government, receiving help by NGO like Women on Waves.[9] Alternatives to abortionContraceptives= Condoms, tubal ligation, and some intrauterine devices (IUDs) are available at no cost to a woman. Other forms of contraception that require a fee, such as other IUDs and chemical drugs (like the Depo shot), are available, but the woman does not need to get a prescription to obtain them. =Family planning= In 1965, the Asociaci√≥n Paname√±a para el Planeamiento de la Familia, or (APLAFA), was founded to help women control the size of their families. A private family planning group, APLAFA has gone to great lengths not just to reduce the rate of teen pregnancy, but also to aid pregnant women with pre- and post-natal care for their unwanted pregnancies.https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/panama.doc The Panamanian government has also played a constructive role in the family planning movement. It offers services which teach couples about natural birth control methods (such as the ovulation method, the symptothermal method, and the rhythm method), as well as modern methods, which many know as \\"the pill\\", shots, patches, sterilization, and others.

He was also a magistrate and writer. Biography Xu was born in Maoyan (È¶¨Â†∞/È©¨Â†∞), Yuyao, Shaoxing Fu (Á¥πËààÂ∫ú/ÁªçÂÖ¥Â∫ú; current Yuyao, Ningbo), Zhejiang Province in 1487. His courtesy name was Yueren (Êõ∞‰ªÅ), and artist's pseudonym was Hengshan (Ê®™Â±±). In the third year of Zhengde Era (Ê≠£Âæ∑‰∏âÂπ¥; 1508), Xu joined the imperial examination and was qualified and matriculated as a governmental official. He was the mayor of Qizhou (Á•ÅÂ∑û; current Anguo, Hebei Province). Later he was transferred to Nanjing, the sub-capital of the Ming China. In Nanjing, he chronologically served in the Ministry of Military (ÂÖµÈÉ®) as a Yuanwailang (Âì°Â§ñÈÉé/ÂëòÂ§ñÈÉé) and in Ministry of Construction (Â∑•ÈÉ®) as a Langzhong (ÈÉé‰∏≠) there. In the 11th year of Zhengde Era (1516), Xu went back to hometown for mothering; and in 1517 died of illness at the age of 31. Philosophy Xu was one of the earliest student of the philosopher Wang Yangming. He was considered as a royal, important member and the second generation of the Yangming School of Mind (ÈôΩÊòéÂøÉÂ≠∏/Èò≥ÊòéÂøÉÂ≠¶). Wang Yangming proposed his thought of conscience and intuitive knowledge, but most people and Confucians during his time didn't accept it. Xu mainly contributed to the further expatiation and the consummation of Wang's philosophy in this domain, and also further developed Wang's school of philosophy. Xu recorded most of Wang's words (from both his daily living and teaching) and works, collected and recensing them, also printed and published these philosophical monographies. So Xu also played an important role in publicizing the philosophy in a popular style.

Like NOAA Corps personnel today, Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officers were eligible for the Department of Commerce awards described above, as well as awards such as the above-mentioned Colbert and Karo Medals and the awards and decorations of other uniformed services with which they served. The Coast and Geodetic Survey had no awards of its own until 1945, when the following awards ‚Äì all now obsolete but part of the heritage of the NOAA Corps ‚Äì were authorized in recognition of service during World War II, the national emergency preceding it, or its aftermath:National Archives: Federal Register: Executive Order 9590--Establishing certain awards for the Coast and Geodetic SurveyCoast and Geodetic Survey Awards of World War Two, Page 18. *80px Coast and Geodetic Survey Distinguished Service Ribbon Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who distinguished himself by outstanding conduct or service in the line of duty between 8 September 1939 and 28 April 1952. *80px Coast and Geodetic Survey Meritorious Service Ribbon Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who rendered service of a meritorious character between 8 September 1939 and 28 April 1952 but not of such an outstanding character as would warrant an award of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Distinguished Service Ribbon. *80px Coast and Geodetic Survey Good Conduct Ribbon Awarded to enlisted members of the crews of Coast and Geodetic Survey vessels for exemplary behavior, efficiency, and fidelity during service between 8 September 1939 and 28 April 1952. *80px Coast and Geodetic Survey Defense Service Ribbon Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who served at any time during the period between 8 September 1939 and 6 December 1941. *80px Coast and Geodetic Survey Atlantic War Zone Ribbon Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who served outside the continental limits of the United States in the Atlantic War Zone between 7 December 1941 and 8 November 1945. *80px Coast and Geodetic Survey Pacific War Zone Ribbon Awarded to any Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned officer or to any ship's officer or member of the crew of any Coast and Geodetic Survey ship who served outside the continental limits of the United States in the Pacific War Zone between 7 December 1941 and 2 March 1946.

She is a member of the Labor Party, and previously served in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 2005-12. She was known as Barbara Anne McCarthy until 2007, when she adopted her current name to honour her deceased mother. In 2005, McCarthy was elected to the NT Legislative Assembly for the division of Arnhem. She was re-elected unopposed in 2008, and was subsequently appointed to the ministry by Paul Henderson. She held a number of portfolios over the following four years, but lost her seat in Labor's landslide defeat at the 2012 election. McCarthy subsequently returned to the media as a presenter for NITV and SBS News. She re-entered politics as Labor's lead Senate candidate in the Northern Territory at the 2016 federal election. Background and early years Barbara McCarthy was born in Katherine, Northern Territory, the daughter of Limandabina Charlie and John McCarthy. Through her mother, she is descended from the Garrwa and Yanyuwa peoples, whose traditional lands straddle the McArthur River and the Gulf of Carpentaria. Her father, originally from Sydney, is descended from an Irishman who arrived in Australia in 1842.Sen. Malarndirri McCarthy (ALP-NT) ‚Äì Maiden Speech, australianpolitics.com; 14 September 2016; accessed 14 July 2020. McCarthy was raised with her mother in Borroloola, on the McArthur River. She boarded in Alice Springs and at St Scholastica's College, Sydney, where she was school captain in 1988. McCarthy is a former Australian Broadcasting Corporation newsreader and journalist who began her cadetship in 1989 and worked across Australia as a news and current affairs television and radio reporter. In 1993, after a trial run at presenting the late news from Sydney, she was appointed as weeknight newsreader for ABC News in Darwin. She co- established Borroloola's first community radio station, B102.9FM-The Voice of the Gulf, in 1998, with assistance from the ABC, and also set up the Lijakarda Cultural Festivals & Media, Arts & Training Centre for Yanyuwa, Kudanji, Garrawa & Mara people from Borroloola. CareerEarly political career= In 2005, McCarthy was preselected as the Labor candidate in Arnhem to replace the retiring member Jack Ah Kit. Considered by many political pundits as a star recruit for Chief Minister Clare Martin and the Australian Labor Party, she received 73.9% of the two-party preferred vote, a 12.5% increase on Ah Kit's result. As a result of her election, McCarthy became one of ten women in the 25 seat assembly, considered at the time to be in the top 10 in the world in male to female ratio in a parliament. McCarthy was one of five indigenous candidates elected, properly reflecting the population ratio of indigenous people in the Territory. Her first term was highlighted by crossing the floor, with two other ALP members, to vote against the government's decision to divert the McArthur River to allow more mining developments, on spiritually cultural and environmental grounds, in her home country of Borroloola. In August 2007 on the sudden death of her mother, who had been a strong advocate for the Borroloola people's struggle for land rights, linguistic and cultural parity, and who despaired at the river diversion, McCarthy added her Yanyuwa name of Malarndirri, out of cultural respect for her mother. She was re- elected unopposed in the 2008 election. Immediately following her re-election, McCarthy was promoted to the ministry and from August 2008- November 2009 was the Minister for Children and Families, Child Protection, Statehood, Women's Policy, Senior Territorians, Young Territorians and the Minister Assisting the Chief Minister on Multicultural Affairs. In December 2009, a Cabinet re- shuffle took place as a result of a Labor Cabinet Minister leaving the NT Labor Government and was not replaced in the Cabinet. McCarthy's portfolios then doubled and she was tasked to implement major reforms in the areas of Local Government, Regional Economic Development & Indigenous Development, while keeping the Women's & Statehood portfolio, Tourism was also added to her brief. At the 2012 election McCarthy was defeated by Country Liberal Party challenger Larissa Lee amid Labor's collapse in the remote portions of the Territory. =Interim years= McCarthy won the 2013 Journalism Story of the Year Deadly Award for her story on two Noongar brothers, the Thorne Brothers, who were in Saudi Arabia. Shayden Thorne had been arrested on terrorism charges in Riyadh, while his brother Junaid was in hiding after protesting his brother's innocence. Both Shayden and Junaid returned to their families in Perth. McCarthy also was a member of the NITV team's Walkleys nomination in 2014 for the Innocence Betrayed documentary based on the Bowraville murders ongoing investigation. In 2013 she received two Walkley nominations for her story on Mercedes-Benz that filmed its advertisement on Wave Rock in Western Australia, a place of deep cultural significance to Aboriginal custodians. The General Manager of Mercedes-Benz flew to Wave Rock to personally apologise to custodians. McCarthy was a journalist and presenter at SBS/NITV News and presented NITV News Week in Review on SBS1 2.30pm on Fridays and on NITV on the weekend. In addition she worked part-time at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview and assisted the development of the First Nations' Unit program and taught a cross cultural program at the Catholic school. =Federal politics= Following the resignation of Nova Peris, McCarthy was invited by Labor to nominate as a candidate for the Senate at the 2016 federal election, representing the Northern Territory. She was subsequently endorsed as the Labor candidate despite not being enrolled to vote in the Northern Territory. McCarthy went on to win a Senate seat at the 2 July 2016 federal election bringing a much higher primary vote and a swing of nearly seven percent to the Australian Labor Party. Family McCarthy has two adult sons.

There is not a clear statistic for Venezuela-specific abortion rates, possibly due to a great majority of the abortions that occur going undocumented. The punishment for a woman who has an abortion for any other reason is a prison sentence lasting anywhere between six months and two years. While the punishment for a doctor or any person who performs the procedure is between one and three years, harsher penalties may apply if the pregnant woman dies as a result of the procedure.https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/venezuela.doc There has been debate over this topic for several years, among other issues pertaining to reproductive health, particularly in the Catholic church. The current status of abortion in Venezuela is exacerbated by the economic crisis fueled by a lack of access to healthcare. Despite limited financial means due to the crisis, some groups are advocating for abortion rights. Terminology Any surgical or medicinal method of termination of a pregnancy can be classified as an induced abortion. A clandestine abortion is one that is not performed under proper medical care or safe conditions. Since abortion is illegal in Venezuela, a clandestine procedure is often the only choice that a woman has in terminating an unwanted pregnancy, unless she is faced with certain conditions. Venezuela's policy on abortion follows the \\"indications model,\\" meaning that it is permissible only when the pregnancy is a threat to the health of the pregnant woman, it is a result of rape, or the fetus cannot live outside of the womb. Venezuelan Penal Code The Venezuelan Penal code outlines regulations for having/administering an abortion procedure. Article 340 of the Penal Code states that \\"a women who intentionally aborts, using means employed by herself or by a third party with their consent, shall be punished with prison for six months to two years. Article 433 offers an exception: \\"a person carrying out an abortion will not incur any penalty if it is an indispensable measure to save the life of the mother.\\" History Attitudes toward abortion policies have changed as different political leaders have assumed power in Venezuela. The economic crisis in Venezuela has served as another influence on policy Some groups are combating policies to fight for abortion rights. =Hugo Chavez= Hugo Chavez intended to minimize the gap between the rich and poor and give Venezuelans a better life. This, along with his intent to reform the Constitution, implies that he was in favor of abortion rights, though it was not explicitly said. In Venezuela, the discovery of oil provided an economic boom lasting a period from World War 1 to the 1980s. This period of prosperity was ended by an oil crisis in 1973, which led to a great amount of debt that continued into Chavez's presidency and topped 120 billion in 2011. During the Trienio Adeco period (1945-1948), Venezuela was under democratic rule by several presidents, until Hugo Chavez won Venezuela's presidential election in 1998. Chavez ruled Venezuela as a Bolivarian government starting in 1999, one that followed a left-wing socialist movement that advocated mainly for financial equity, democracy, and anti-corrupt government. He formed the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 2007, as well as many other programs that catered to the poor, such as the ‚ÄúBolivarian Missions‚Äù to provide universal healthcare coverage under 'Chavezcare' and increase educational opportunities for the poor. Among his policies were plans to amend the Venezuelan constitution to decriminalize abortion. While he was relatively well-liked by the poor in Venezuela, he also received some opposition. The Venezuelan National Strike of 2002-2003 started as an attempt to remove Chavez from office. As a result, the country's oil company Petr√≥leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) lost money, and since the economy largely depends on the oil industry, the nation's GDP fell significantly. Despite this and other strikes against him, Chavez remained in office until he was too ill to run as president. =Nicolas Maduro= As of yet, Maduro has not mentioned plans to amend to Constitution in favor of abortion rights. After Chavez's presidency, Nicolas Maduro took over after what some call a rigged election. He continued to implement the socialist policies that Chavez started, though some argue he rules as a dictator. In 2013, Venezuela's currency lost value due to shortages in essentials such as staple foods and toiletries. Since then, Venezuela has been in an economic crisis, where inflation has reached an all-time high. Maduro issued a state of emergency in 2016, allowing Venezuelans to cross Colombian borders for greater access to necessities, though for those in compromising situations this is not a possibility. Maduro was re-elected to office in 2018, though some continue to deem it an illegitimate election. There have been U.S. sanctions placed on oil export, preventing foreign entities from purchasing oil stock; this hurt Venezuela's economy because oil makes up so much of its GDP, which only aggravated the crisis. =Economic crisis= The economic crisis In Venezuela has led to a decrease in access to contraceptives, and has caused many women to resort to sterilization and abortion as a family planning method. Since 2013, the crisis has left Venezuelans with a grim outlook on healthcare, as 90 percent of all citizens live in poverty. Medicine is at a massive shortage, with over 80% of medicinal access restricted by the crisis. Access to contraceptives Along with healthcare, particularly affected are Venezuelans‚Äô access to contraceptives. Since contraceptives are not considered an ‚Äúessential medicine,‚Äù they are at an even greater shortage than non- contraceptive medications. The few contraceptives available are subject to high inflation rates. For instance, a three-pack of condoms can cost several weeks‚Äô worth of minimum wage pay, and a box of birth control pills can cost almost a year's worth of pay at the same rate, making them virtually unaffordable for citizens. Sterilization and abortion For most, the high prices of contraceptives force them to resort to abstinence or sterilization. Though the sterilization procedure is expensive, some would rather pay over caring for children they cannot afford. This is done in lieu of later clandestine abortions. The Intercept reports that some of the women who opt for sterilization are as young as 14 years old. Social activism thumb\\"Fetuses go to paradise, legalize abortion.\\" This art is advocating for abortion rights in Argentina as Venezuela continues to face a lack of abortion rights. During his presidency, Hugo Chavez operated Venezuela under a socialist economy, which was meant to promote equality. Some groups, such as the Feminists in Free and Direct Action for Safe Abortions in Revolution, were formed during his presidency. This group, along with many others, advocates for ending dangerous clandestine abortion. Similarly, Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly (ANC), formed in July 2017, advocates for the reformation of Venezuela's constitution to include women's right to abort beyond those outlined by the ‚Äúindications model.‚Äù Other efforts to support the movement include the efforts of one group to use a telephone hotline to inform women on how to safely have an abortion. Misoprostol is a drug that can be used to induce labor and cause a medical abortion, which is any abortion done via drug. This hotline provides women with the ability to make an informed decision about proceeding with an abortion. It does not, however, change the legal status of abortion in Venezuela, nor does it provide women access to medical care. Due to abortion's legal status, Venezuelans often obtain misoprostol through the black market, which is expensive and puts the mother at risk. Catholic Church The population of Venezuela is over three- quarters Roman Catholic, making Catholic norms more prevalent in Venezuelan society than any other religion. Abortion laws are debated by those with Catholic beliefs, as some Catholics hold that ‚Äòartificial‚Äô forms of birth control (abortion, condoms, or birth control pills) do not align with the Catholic moral code, and ‚Äúthat abortion is a result of widespread immorality and ignorance.‚Äù Protests against abortion-restrictive laws have raised concern for the Catholic community; in May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI met with President Hugo Chavez to discuss his concern over the possibility that Chavez would loosen abortion laws in Venezuela. Misoprostol Misoprostol, though it is among the safer forms of clandestine abortion, can be dangerous if not taken under medical supervision. It may cause hemorrhaging and other adverse effects such as infection. If left untreated, it could lead to death. It is estimated that around 6,000 women die every year in Latin America alone because of unsafe abortions. Unsafe abortions, including those done via misoprostol, contribute significantly to maternal and overall female mortality in Venezuela.

CMULHS is under the management of the Central Mindanao University‚ÄìCollege of Education as a separate department and maintains its own set of administrators. CMULHS has been used as a training ground for the College of Education's students who trains in the school as practicing high school instructors/teachers. Students who wish to enroll in CMULHS must first take and pass the 'University Laboratory High School Admission Test' or ULHSAT. CMULHS rarely accepts transferees. History Central Mindanao University Laboratory High School traces its roots from a farm school organized by the Americans. It was established in 1910 as Mailag Agricultural (Industrial) School in Colonia, Mailag, Malaybalay (now part of Valencia City), Bukidnon under Santos Cudal, the head teacher. It offered the first four grades under the elementary agriculture curriculum and produced its first graduates in 1917. By virtue id Executive Order No. 59 dated December 18, 1918, its name was changed to Bukidnon Agricultural School, and it offered the last three grades of the same curriculum with Martin Callao as its principal. In 1921, the school was transferred to Managok, Malaybalay City and was renamed Bukidnon Rural High School under Proclamation No. 30. The first batch of secondary agriculture students graduated in 1927. By virtue of Act No. 337, the name was changed to Bukidnon Agricultural High School, with the agriculture curriculum exclusive for male students only. Commonwealth Act No. 313 gave the school a new name ‚Äî Bukidnon National Agricultural School ‚Äî under Dr. Felipe Cevallos and Nicodemes Flores as superintendent and principal, respectively. This time, secondary homemaking curriculum was offered to female students with Esmeralda Collado Relis as the first girl to enroll. In 1943 to 1945, the school was closed due to World War II. After the war the school reopened. Due to the aftermath of the war, it was transferred to Musuan, Maramag, Bukindnon. On June 21, 1952, President Elpidio Quirino signed Republic Act 807 or 'Mindanao Agricultural College Charter' which installed Zosimo Montemayor as president, with its high school department headed by Narciso Pepeito. On June 19, 1965 by virtue of Republic Act 4498, Mindanao Agricultural College was granted university status and was renamed Central Mindanao University. The high school was then headed by Felixberto Roquia. In 1965 to 1966, the general academic curriculum was introduced. Ireneo Mendoza was the acting head in 1968 to 1969 and Leonardo Chua in 1969 to 1970. In 1970 to 1971, both revised curricula implemented: vocational and general academic curriculum with Leopoldo Roque as principal. In June 1987, the Vocational Agricultural Secondary Curriculum was phased out and the Science Curriculum was implemented. In 1990 to 1996, the school operated a pure science curriculum. In 1996 to 2008, the science and general secondary curriculum was again implemented, having two sets of honor students. In 2008, the school again operated a pure science curriculum. In 2012, the school adopted the K‚Äì12 education program. The last batch of the old education program (four-year high school education) graduated in 2015. Curriculum Panoramic shot of Central Mindanao University Laboratory High School from a vantage point of the school's front gate. The current CMULHS curriculum is the former Science Curriculum, for those students who passed the ULHSAT at the top percentile ranks. Formerly, the curriculum had only two sections per year level. In 2005, the administration phased out the New Secondary Curriculum (NSEC) and replaced the NSEC section with a Science Curriculum section. As of 2008, the Science Curriculum is the only remaining curriculum offered in CMULHS. The school is using a science-based curriculum, which emphasizes and deals more with Sciences (General Science, Geology, Earth Sciences, Inorganic and Bio Chemistry, Biology, Genetics, Physics, and Environmental Sciences), and Mathematics (Algebra, Consumer Mathematics, Trigonometry, Geometry, Calculus, Computer Sciences, and Statistics). { style=\\"float:right; margin:1em 1em 1em 1em; width:20em; border: 1px solid #a0a0a0; padding: 2px; bg-color=black; text-align:right;\\" - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#228B22\\" align=\\"center\\" Principals, Acting Principals, Officers-in-Charge, and Directors of CMULHS - style=\\"text- align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Felixberto Roquia, 1965 - 1968 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Ireneo Mendoza, 1968 - 1969 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Dr. Leonardo Chua, 1969 - 1970 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Leopoldo Roque, 1970 - 1973 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Dr. Leonardo Chua, 1973 - 1974 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Juan Nagtalon, 1974 - 1975 - style=\\"text-align:left; font- size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Tomasito Redoble, 1975 - 1977 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Elsie Laurente, 1977 - 1978 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Salvacion Limbo, 1978 - 1981 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Juan Busto Callejo, 1981 - 1983 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Dante Santiago, 1983 - 1985 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Wenceslao Tianero, 1985 - 1986 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Andrea Azuelo, 1986 - 1993 - style=\\"text-align:left; font- size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Anacleta Barcebal, 1993 - 1994 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Severino Cupida, 1994 - 1999 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Dr. Luzminda Gurrea, 1999 - 2008 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Virgencita Caro, 2008 - 2011 - style=\\"text-align:left; font-size:smaller;\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Dr. Denis Tan, 2011 - Present } Clubs and organizationsClubs= The following are the school clubs in CMULHS: * Enthuasiastic League of Innovative English Students (ELITES) * Nagkakaisang Organisasyong Yaring Pilipino (NOYPI) * Young Mathematician Computer Club (YMC¬≤) * Young Thinkers Science Club (YTSC) * Society of Organized and Civilized Youth (SOCY) * PE Club * Performing Arts Club (PAC) * Brilliant Young Technical Erudites (BYTES) * CMULHS Vectors Varsity =Organizations= The following are the school organizations in CMULHS: * Central Mindanao University Laboratory High School Supreme Student Council Organization (CMULHSSSCO) * The Viewer * The Horizon * Citizenship Advancement Training (CAT) * University Laboratory High School (ULHS) Band Notable peopleAlumni= * Bonar Laureto and Deorex David Navaja (Class 1999) ‚Äì competed in Germany in a scientist research contest sponsored by the World Young Researchers on Environment (WYRE) in October 2000 and emerged among the top 23 entries out of 73 entries worldwide.

Politics Hartwig began his political career as a councillor with the Shire of Monto (1961‚Äì1970) and was appointed chairman in 1964. In 1972, he was preselected for the safe National Party seat of Callide. He was elected at the 1972 election, winning re- election as a National in 1974, 1977 and 1980. In 1981, Hartwig was expelled from the National Party caucus by a vote of 33 to 2 for repeated criticism of party president Sir Robert Sparkes. He won re-election as an independent in 1983, but retired at the 1986 election. During his time as an independent, he was elected as the Chairman of the Livingstone Shire Council in a landslide. However, he only served about 11 months as chairman because of continual concerns about his ability to be effective as a shire chairman given his parliamentary duties. Hartwig was never appointed to state Cabinet but had a notable achievement in fighting successfully to have Queensland Day officially recognised. He also adopted a unique radio campaign. He put together a race- call commercial and called himself \\"Lovable Lindsay\\" who always won by a nose. After leaving Parliament he became involved with the Liberal Party for a time and contested the 1988 South-Coast by-election for the fringe right-wing Citizens Electoral Council.

Three wilderness areas are adjacent to Yosemite: the Ansel Adams Wilderness to the southeast, the Hoover Wilderness to the northeast, and the Emigrant Wilderness to the north. The park is roughly the size of the U.S. state of Rhode Island and contains thousands of lakes and ponds, of streams, of hiking trails, and of roads. Two federally designated Wild and Scenic Rivers, the Merced and the Tuolumne, begin within Yosemite's borders and flow westward through the Sierra foothills, into the Central Valley of California. Annual park visitation exceeds 3.5 million, with most visitor use concentrated in the seven-square-mile (18 km2) area of Yosemite Valley. The geography of the Yosemite area can be visualized with the clickable map, below: Rocks and erosion El Capitan Almost all of the landforms in the Yosemite area are cut from the granitic rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About 5% of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These rocks are called roof pendants because they were once the roof of the underlying granitic rock. Erosion acting upon different types of uplift- created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints is controlled by the amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures. Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, are created by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is responsible for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force over the last few million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial- cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches. Popular features Cathedral Peak Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area, but this is where most visitors arrive and stay. The Tunnel View is the first view of the Valley for many visitors and is extensively photographed. El Capitan, a prominent granite cliff that looms over Yosemite Valley, is one of the most popular rock climbing destinations in the world because of its diverse range of climbing routes in addition to its year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise , respectively, above the valley floor. The high country of Yosemite contains beautiful areas such as Tuolumne Meadows, Dana Meadows, the Clark Range, the Cathedral Range, and the Kuna Crest. The Sierra crest and the Pacific Crest Trail run through Yosemite, with peaks of red metamorphic rock, such as Mount Dana and Mount Gibbs, and granite peaks, such as Mount Conness. Mount Lyell is the highest point in the park, standing at . The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite National Park and is one of the few remaining in the Sierra Nevada today. The park has three groves of ancient giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the Tuolumne Grove (25 trees), and the Merced Grove (20 trees). This species grows larger in volume than any other and is one of the tallest and longest-lived. Water and ice Tuolumne and Merced River systems originate along the crest of the Sierra Nevada in the park and have carved river canyons deep. The Tuolumne River drains the entire northern portion of the park, an area of approximately . The Merced River begins in the park's southern peaks, primarily the Cathedral and Clark Ranges, and drains an area of approximately . U-shaped valley‚ÄîYosemite Hydrologic processes, including glaciation, flooding, and fluvial geomorphic response, have been fundamental in creating landforms in the park. The park also contains approximately 3,200 lakes (greater than 100 m2), two reservoirs, and of streams, all of which help form these two large watersheds. Wetlands in Yosemite occur in valley bottoms throughout the park, and are often hydrologically linked to nearby lakes and rivers through seasonal flooding and groundwater movement. Meadow habitats, distributed at elevations from in the park, are generally wetlands, as are the riparian habitats found on the banks of Yosemite's numerous streams and rivers. Bridalveil Fall flows from a U-shaped hanging valley that was created by a tributary glacier. Yosemite is famous for its high concentration of waterfalls in a small area. Numerous sheer drops, glacial steps and hanging valleys in the park provide many places for waterfalls to exist, especially during April, May, and June (the snowmelt season). Located in Yosemite Valley, the Yosemite Falls is the highest in North America at . Also in Yosemite Valley is the much lower volume Ribbon Falls, which has the highest single vertical drop, . Perhaps the most prominent of the Yosemite Valley waterfalls is Bridalveil Fall, which is the waterfall seen from the Tunnel View viewpoint at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel. Wapama Falls in Hetch Hetchy Valley is another notable waterfall. Hundreds of ephemeral waterfalls also exist in the park. Vernal Fall All glaciers in the park are relatively small glaciers that occupy areas that are in almost permanent shade, such as north- and northeast- facing cirques. Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in Yosemite (the Palisades Glaciers are the largest in the Sierra Nevada) and covers . None of the Yosemite glaciers are a remnant of the much, much larger Ice Age alpine glaciers responsible for sculpting the Yosemite landscape. Instead, they were formed during one of the neoglacial episodes that have occurred since the thawing of the Ice Age (such as the Little Ice Age). Climate change has reduced the number and size of glaciers around the world. Many Yosemite glaciers, including Merced Glacier, which was discovered by John Muir in 1871 and bolstered his glacial origins theory of the Yosemite area, have disappeared and most of the others have lost up to 75% of their surface area. Climate Yosemite in autumn Yosemite has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa), meaning most precipitation falls during the mild winter, and the other seasons are nearly dry (less than 3% of precipitation falls during the long, hot summers). Because of orographic lift, precipitation increases with elevation up to where it slowly decreases to the crest. Precipitation amounts vary from at elevation to at . Snow does not typically persist on the ground until November in the high country. It accumulates all winter and into March or early April. Mean daily temperatures range from to at Tuolumne Meadows at . At the Wawona Entrance (elevation ), mean daily temperature ranges from . At the lower elevations below , temperatures are hotter; the mean daily high temperature at Yosemite Valley (elevation ) varies from . At elevations above , the hot, dry summer temperatures are moderated by frequent summer thunderstorms, along with snow that can persist into July. The combination of dry vegetation, low relative humidity, and thunderstorms results in frequent lightning-caused fires as well. At the park headquarters, with an elevation of , January averages , while July averages , though in summer the nights are much cooler than the hot days. There are an average of 39.5 days with highs of or higher and an average of 97.9 nights with freezing temperatures. Freezing temperatures have been recorded in every month of the year. The record high temperature was on July 20, 1915, while the record low temperature was on January 2, 1924 and on January 21, 1937. Average annual precipitation is nearly , falling on 65 days. The wettest year was 1983 with and the driest year was 1976 with . The most precipitation in one month was in December 1955 and the most in one day was on December 23, 1955. Average annual snowfall is . The snowiest year was 1967 with . The most snow in one month was in January 1993.

As with government agencies, courts generally defer to the broad discretion HOAs enjoy in discharging their duties.Lamden v. La Jolla Clubdominium Homeowners Assn. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 249 The HOA is also allowed to charge regular fees to homeowners within the development (comparable to taxes). These are used for functions like paying for security guards (including, for gated communities, the operation of a gatehouse) and maintaining common areas like corridors, walkways, parking, landscaping, swimming pools, fitness centers, tennis courts, and so on. The HOA can levy fines or sue homeowners for damages and/or injunctive relief to enforce the HOA's rules and CC&Rs.; Background There were two major historical trends during the 1970s that led to the enactment of Davis-Stirling. First, there was a transition away from the single-family detached home, which had been the dominant residential development paradigm for much of the state's history. California developers traditionally focused solely on building and selling single-family detached homes as fast as possible to make a quick buck. They did not concern themselves with building public amenities like parks. They assumed that city governments would tax new residents to build such things. By the 1970s, developers had mostly run out of good land for such low-density developments and began to focus on building higher-density developments, often on marginal land that had been previously overlooked because it had been considered to be too rugged or too distant from urban downtowns. To make these developments profitable while complying with local density restrictions (which usually measured density in terms of average numbers across an entire development), they would often build high-density structures on one parcel, such as a condo complex, a cluster of townhouses, or a line of patio homes (all of which required less sprawling infrastructure than the equivalent number of single-family detached homes it would take to house the same number of people). They would simultaneously set aside an adjacent parcel to be either left undeveloped as open space or to be developed into a recreational area like a park to benefit and serve the residents of the development. Therefore, developers needed to find a way to ensure that the inhabited parcels benefiting from the adjacent recreational areas would take care of them. Second, the enactment of Proposition 13 by California voters in 1978 severely limited the ability of local governments to raise property taxes. This made local governments increasingly reluctant to approve new residential developments, since they were now uncertain about their ability to provide adequate public services to new residents based on current and future projected revenues. Before approving new developments, local governments began to force developers to privatize all kinds of services which had been traditionally regarded as public goods: street maintenance, street landscaping, sewer service, lighting, security, fire protection, recreational centers, parks, and the like. Developers were compelled to create homeowners' associations which would extract fees and assessments from homeowners to pay for such services. (Local governments also began to impose user fees and special assessments on real property for services and public improvements in lieu of higher taxes, which was then curtailed by the 1996 enactment of Proposition 218, the \\"Right to Vote on Taxes Act\\".) During the early 1980s, the resulting HOA boom revealed the severe limitations of the California laws then applicable to common interest developments. Many HOAs ran into difficulties because they were poorly planned and were only weakly regulated (if at all) by the Condominium Act of 1963. In the fall of 1984, the California State Assembly convened a Select Assembly Committee to address the crisis. This Committee had four broad objectives in drafting the bill that became the Davis-Stirling Act: (1) consolidate existing statutory provisions; (2) standardize the laws governing common interest developments across the board and make exceptions only as needed for specific types of developments; (3) validate existing practices; and (4) resolve various problems with HOA operations.

He claimed to be the largest independent gun dealer in the United States,\\"As Expiration Looms, Gun Ban's Effect Is Debated\\", The New York Times, September 10, 2004. and his store has been called the largest public display of firearms in America.\\"To protest killings, owner of gun shop burns assault rifles\\", Post Tribune (IN), October 31, 1993. For a while, he operated multiple 24-hour stores in the Indianapolis area. On October 8, 1997, Davis' Greenwood, Indiana, store was robbed, and an employee shot and killed. Soon after the incident, he closed all his stores except for the Lafayette Road flagship store, which reduced its business hours. On September 17, 2012, a customer visiting the store to utilize its indoor shooting range intentionally shot a store employee twice. The employee immediately returned fire, killing his attacker. Davis was named among the top five dealers who sell guns to criminals by the U.S. Department of Justice, ranked at #4. He said that the problem was not with his selling the guns, which requires FBI screening, but with those who purchase them and privately resell them, which he describes as a major loophole in the gun control laws. Some area residents feel that Davis catered to a less-than-upstanding clientele, largely profiting from inflated prices for people that have been described as dubious. Davis was a vocal proponent of the Brady Bill. He later called the bill largely ineffective because of its wording, which does not ban guns by type or firing capacity, but rather by specific technical attributes.\\"High Demand for Assault Weapons\\", Indianapolis Star, 19 August 2004. Davis was locally known for his late night television commercials. Indianapolis Magazine voted them as the worst Indianapolis-based commercials in 1984 and 1985. He traditionally ended them with his slogan, \\"I don't want to make any money. I just love to sell guns, heh-heh-heh.\\" Davis was interviewed by NPR's Michele Norris on All Things Considered to discuss the sunset of the Brady Bill.

Stanley Plesent, a graduate of Columbia Law school, served as General Counsel to the United States Information Agency during the Kennedy Administration In the media Squadron Ellenoff achieved national notoriety in late 1980s with the Wedtech scandal in which a firm client, defense contractor the Wedtech Corporation and many of its officers, were indicted for securities fraud, racketeering and influence peddling when it was discovered that the company was not in fact minority-owned as it had consistently claimed in order to qualify for no-bid contracts with the Department of Defense under a Small Business Administration program. Squadron Ellenoff attorneys were called as witnesses and named partner Howard Squadron claimed to have only \\"vague\\" knowledge of the scheme to conceal Wedtech's true (non-minority) owners.Howard French, ' Members of Prominent Law Firm Tell of Ending Their Wedtech Ties,' New York Times, July 8, 1988. Another attorney admitted being aware of the plan in which the Puerto Rican executive would purchase the shares of the company to then default on the payments, leaving control in the hands of non-minority executives, though senior partners at Squadron Ellenoff claimed to have no knowledge of this plan.Howard French, ' Lawyer Admits Default Scheme Was Discussed,' New York Times, July 13, 1988. The firm is also known to have advised Rupert Murdoch on his many media acquisitions that would form the empire known as News Corp, including the New York Post. Merger Upon merging with Hogan & Hartson in 2001, several lawyers of Squadron Ellenoff's litigation department were faced with a conflict of interest that would have precluded them from representing their clients from within the Hogan & Hartson partnership.

Its principal use is as a dye, but it has also been investigated for anticancer and microbial uses.  Preparation  Morindone is obtained from the root bark of M. tinctoria or related species in two stages. In the first step, small roots of immature plants are boiled in alcohol to obtain morindin, a yellowish substance which can also be used in dyeing. Further heating brings about hydrolysis of two glucose monomers through sublimation, leaving intensely red crystals. M. tinctoria is extensively grown in India for commercial production. Moridin content in the roots peaks in two to three years and drops off considerably after that; some attempts have been made to speed up production using tissue cultures. Use as a dye Morindone requires a mordant, and the color obtained varies depending on the substance used. Aluminum mordants give a red color, while iron and chromium produce duskier shades. The traditional mordant used in Java, jirak bark (Symplocos fasciculata), is rich in aluminum salts. Compared to modern dyestuffs, morindone is not as fast or as stable. Since it can be readily cultivated, however, interest in it remains high. Recent research has examined cell culture as a means of increasing yields.

Joshua Loth Liebman (1907‚Äì1948) was an American rabbi and best-selling author, best known for the book Peace of Mind, which spent more than a year at #1 on the New York Times Best Seller list. Born in Hamilton, Ohio, Liebman graduated from the University of Cincinnati when he was 19 years old. He went on to be ordained and also earned a doctorate in Hebrew letters from Hebrew Union College. From 1934 to 1939, Liebman served as rabbi of K.A.M. Temple in Chicago, Illinois. In 1939, Liebman became the rabbi of Temple Israel, a Reform synagogue in Boston, Massachusetts. A sermon Liebman gave at Temple Israel, titled \\"The Road to Inner Serenity\\", was published as a pamphlet by one of his friends, bookstore owner Richard Fuller, who passed it on to publisher Richard L. Simon of Simon & Schuster. Simon & Schuster then arranged to publish Liebman's self- help book titled Peace of Mind, issued in 1946, which sought to reconcile religion and psychiatry. Liebman had himself previously undergone psychoanalysis. In Peace of Mind, Liebman \\"addressed himself to the individual whose personal grief and anxiety, unassuageable by social betterment alone, required an inner peace that psychology and religion, working together, could provide.\\" Peace of Mind became one of the year's best-selling books. Reaching #1 on the New York Times nonfiction best-sellers list on October 27, 1946, Peace of Mind held the top position on the list for a total of 58 (non- consecutive) weeks, and spent more than three straight years on the list. (In 1949, Roman Catholic Bishop Fulton J. Sheen responded to Liebman's assertions by publishing a book of his own entitled Peace of Soul.) In September 1947, the rabbi and his wife Fan took in a teenager, Leila Bornstein, a Polish-born survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Leila's parents and two younger sisters perished in the camp. The rabbi and his wife had been childless for the past 19 years and would later adopt Leila. A brief article on the family was featured in The Ladies' Home Journal in January 1948. While Peace of Mind was still on the best-sellers list, Liebman died at age 41 on June 9, 1948.

While played using improvised rules more closely resembling soccer and rugby than modern gridiron football, it is traditionally considered the inaugural college football season. The 1869 season consisted of only two games, both between Rutgers and Princeton. The first was played on November 6 at Rutgers' campus, and the second was played on November 13 at Princeton's campus. Both games were won by the home team. The first college football national championship was awarded retroactively to the two teams. Princeton was named the champion by the Billingsley Report and the National Championship Foundation, while college football research historian Parke H. Davis named Rutgers and Princeton co-champions. Various other ratings and retrospectives have rated the teams differently. The two games were played with rules very different from what is currently understood as American football, and also played under home field rules that differed from each other. However, in both games, there was no running with the ball, each team included 25 players, and the ball was perfectly spherical. First intercollegiate football game played Modern folklore places the very first game of College football as a contest between teams from Rutgers College and the College of New Jersey, commonly known as Princeton College.http://www.historyoffootball.net/ Rutgers won the game by a score of 6-4. This game in reality was more reminiscent of \\"soccer\\" than \\"football\\" as known today, where each team fields eleven men, the ball could be advanced by picking it up and carrying it, and play is stopped by physically knocking down the ball-carrier. The first such game of college football in the United States in this format was played between Tufts and Harvard Colleges on June 4, 1875. Rematch A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton rules. One of the biggest differences in rules was the awarding of a \\"free kick\\" to any player that caught the ball on the fly. This rule seriously affected the speed advantage of Rutgers that had allowed them to win the first contest. Princeton won the second game by a score of 8 to 0. Aftermath The two schools had originally scheduled to meet three times in 1869, but the third 1869 game never took place, reportedly because of the officials at both programs who complained about more emphasis being put on the contests rather than academics and studying.\\"Rutgers - The Birthplace of College Football: The First Intercollegiate Game - November 6, 1869\\" at scarletknights.com, published by the Rutgers University Athletic Department.

Due to each team winning one game, the inaugural football season ended with Princeton and Rutgers each tied at 1-1, and therefore each received a partial share of the 1869 college football national championship awarded retroactively.

Background  Qi Kang was born in 740, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Ding Prefecture (, in modern Baoding, Hebei).New Book of Tang, vol. 128 and claimed ancestry from the royal Jiang house of the Spring and Autumn period state Qi.New Book of Tang, vol. 75 His grandfather Qi Huan () was a well-known commandery governor during Emperor Xuanzong's reign, although his father Qi Ao () was described to have served in an insignificant position.Old Book of Tang, vol. 136 . In Qi Kang's youth, the Anshi Rebellion swept over the northern parts of the Tang empire, and he took his mother and fled to Kuaiji (present-day Shaoxing in Zhejiang), where he spent his time studying. It was said that he was good at writing, particularly when it came to reports on various matters.  During Emperor Daizong's reign  During the Dali era (766-779) of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, Zhang Yi the prefect of Shou Prefecture (, in modern Lu'an, Anhui) invited Qi Kang to serve as an assistant.Zhang served as prefect of Shou Prefecture between 777 and 779, so the event must have occurred during that time. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 125 . It was said that Qi was capable administratively and literarily, and Zhang respected him.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  Early in the Jianzhong era (780-783) of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Daizong, Zhang Yi became the governor of Jiangxi Circuit (, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), and Qi Kang followed him and continued to serve on his staff. After Zhang later served a stint as chancellor and was made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang Circuit (, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) in 782, he invited Qi to serve on his staff again. It was said that most of the military tactics that Zhang used at the time were suggested by Qi. In fall 783, when a mutiny at the capital Chang'an forced Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), as Fengtian was a small city, Emperor Dezong considered further heading to Fengxiang. Meanwhile, Zhang, hearing of the mutiny and of Emperor Dezong's considering visiting Fengxiang, began undertaking preparations for the emperor's arrival. Qi Kang and fellow staff member Qi Ying pointed out that one of the military officers, Li Chulin (), was previously a subordinate of the mutiny leader Zhu Ci and would be difficult to control. Zhang thus issued an order that Li report to Long Prefecture (, in modern Baoji). Li, giving excuses, did not report immediately, and Zhang, concentrating on welcoming the emperor, never followed up on whether Li left for Long Prefecture. That night, Li and his associates mutinied and attacked Zhang's headquarters. Zhang and two of his sons climbed over the city walls and tried to flee, but were captured by the mutineers and killed. Qi Kang and Qi Ying both fled to Fengtian, and Emperor Dezong made Qi Kang an imperial censor with the title Shiyushi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. After the rebellions were quashed in 784 and Emperor Dezong returned to Chang'an, the treasury was drained, and a major part of the empire was laid waste. At that time, the official Yuan Xiu (), who was in charge of the state salt and iron monopolies, believed that Qi Kang was capable and recommended him as Cangbu Langzhong (), a supervisorial official at the ministry of census (), to be in charge of the salt monopoly in the Yangtze River-Huai River region. Qi was also soon made the deputy director of the supplies, in charge of supplying Chang'an with food from the Yangtze-Huai region. Soon, for minor faults that are lost to history, he was demoted to be the prefect of Chu Prefecture (ËôïÂ∑û, in modern Lishui, Zhejiang). He later served as the prefect of Su Prefecture (ËòáÂ∑û, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) before becoming the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Hunan Circuit (ÊπñÂçó, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) was well as the prefect of its capital Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan). He was later recalled to serve as imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong) and then the mayor of Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the region of the eastern capital Luoyang). He later successively served as Mishu Jian (), the director of the Palace Library and then the minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing). In 800, Qi was made Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). This made him a chancellor, replacing the recently demoted Zheng Yuqing.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235. While serving as chancellor, Qi suggested the abolition of the system where, after the ministry of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, L√¨bu) selected officials to be commissioned, the officials from the legislative bureau and the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) would reexamine the proposed list ‚Äî reasoning that after the ministry of civil service affairs had carefully selected the officials, it would be a waste of time to reexamine. This suggestion was accepted. Per the customs of the time, as the deputy minister of rites was in charge of the imperial examinations, his relatives and friends would be given a separate imperial examination; under Qi's suggestion, that examination was also abolished.

Manufactured by Pratt & Whitney Canada, its first application was in the Bell 212 and UH-1N Twin Huey helicopter family. The PT6T Twin-Pac consists of two PT6A power turbines driving a common output reduction gearbox, producing up to 2,000 hp at 6,000 rpm. The engine is designated T400 by the U.S. military. Development The U.S. military came very close to not procuring the UH-1N Twin Huey because of the PT6T.Drendel, Lou: Huey, pages 14-17. Squadron/Signal Publications, Carrollton, Texas, 1983. The purchase of the aircraft for U.S. military use was opposed by the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee at the time, Mendel Rivers. Rivers took this position because the PT6T was produced in Canada. The Canadian government had not supported U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and had opposed U.S. policies in southeast Asia, as well as accepting U.S. draft dodgers. Rivers was also concerned that procurement of the engines would result in a negative trade deficit situation with Canada. Congress only approved the purchase when it was assured that a U.S. source would be found for the PT6T engines. This source was Pratt & Whitney Engine Services in Bridgeport, West Virginia, which was established in 1971 to assemble and test new T400-WV-402 engines. As a result, the U.S. military ordered 294 Bell 212s under the designation UH-1N, with deliveries commencing in 1970.

The Militia were recruited from men living in the townships of Toronto, Trafalgar, East and West Flamborough, Nelson, Ancaster, Barton, Beverly, and Saltfleet, which mainly composed the western Wentworth.

The exhibit at the Rand School, organized by Leon Dabo in 1909 and the Exhibition of Independent Artists, organized by Robert Henri, in 1910, had fostered a desire among artists to present more personal work and exhibit irrespective of the expectations of conservative organizations like the National Academy. That year, Dabo became leader of The Pastellists.\\"Pastellists,\\" American Art Annual (1911), p. 210. A diary kept by the secretary/treasurer of the Pastellists, artist Elmer Livingston MacRae, records the activities of the young group during their first two exhibitions. The president was Leon Dabo and the Board of Control included Jerome Myers, Everett Shinn, and Juliet Thompson. Mr. Dabo engaged his lawyer and artist friend Henry Wellington Wack to draw up the papers for incorporation, which were agreed upon at a members meeting on February 15, 1911. There are no known records by MacRae or other artists of the member meetings or the later exhibitions. The first two exhibitions, were held at the Folsom Galleries and according to the MacRae diaries, met with good reviews and high attendance.

Leon Dabo, Flowers in a Green Vase, pastelBy 1915 the American Art Annual listed the Pastellists as \\"Inactive.\\" It is notable that several of the members of the Pastellists were the same activist artists that exhibited in the initial, non-juried MacDowell Club shows, again organized by Robert Henri. Many of these more radical artists came together to create the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, the group that mounted the infamous Armory Show of 1913. An account states that one evening after a successful day at the second Pastellist exhibition, a few of the artists began to discuss forming a larger organization of artists, that would include not only easel painter but sculptors as well. The new organization was to exist for the express purpose of mounting large scale exhibitions, using the same progressive ideas of the Pastellists and the MacDowell exhibits, creating shows that would rival the more conservative juried exhibitions of the National Academy. Like the American Painters and Sculptors, the Pastellists may not have been in existence very long but the impact they had on the American art scene, reached far into the future. Pastel Pastel is an art medium in the form of a stick, consisting of pure powdered pigment and a binder. The pigments used in pastels are the same as those used to produce all colored art media, including oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.Mayer, Ralph. The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques.

These laws are very different from those in the United States, and have been in place for approximately 90 years. An abortion is one of the most common surgical procedures in Trinidad and Tobago, and most occur during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  Laws  Trinidad and Tobago was an island nation under British rule until 1962. Consequently, many of their statutes replicate those in the UK, including the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861 which states abortion is illegal. The UK case of Rex v. Bourne of 1938 is highly influential, even to this day, in Trinidad and Tobago abortion laws. Dr. Bourne was tried under the Offences Against the Person Act for administering an abortion to a 15 year old that had been raped by a group of soldiers. In this case, the prosecution's duty was to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the operation was not performed in good faith for the well-being of the girl. The judge ruled that it was Bourne's responsibility as a doctor to terminate the pregnancy if, on reasonable grounds and with adequate knowledge, he was of the persuasion that the end result of the pregnancy would lead to deterioration of the girl's physical and/or mental health. Thereafter, Bourne was acquitted. (5) In the island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, the Offences Against the Person Act of April 3, 1925 stated that abortions are illegal. Abortion is only permitted if it will: * Save the life of the woman * Preserve physical and/or mental health Permission to abort is not permitted for * Rape or incest * Fetal impairment * Economic or Social reasons * Available upon request The punishment for a woman who has an abortion is four years in prison, and the punishment for a doctor or other person who performs the procedure is the same. Aiding in the process of finding someone to perform an abortion or other preliminary steps is also illegal, and subject to a two-year prison sentence.  Unsafe abortions and impacts  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an unsafe abortion is \\"a procedure for terminating an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimal medical standards or both\\". Unsafe abortions in Trinidad & Tobago have led to increased rates of maternal morbidity and hospital visits. In Trinidad and Tobago the maternal mortality rate (MMR) is 55 per 100,000 live births. Although the law states that abortion is allowed to save a woman's mental health, the law does not give a clear definition of what mental health issues are covered under this law. Therefore, it can be difficult for health practitioners, lawyers, and midwives to judge when the law should be followed as far as mental health is concerned. For this very reason, many doctors are hesitant to perform abortions, and costs are very high. Women who can afford expensive but safe abortions at private practices and hospitals are the only ones who remain unaffected. The lack of safe resources has forced women who are either young or poor to seek out cheaper, life-threatening methods to terminate unwanted pregnancies, where they eventually end up in the hospital. A well-known drug known as Cytotec, or Misoprostol is used to conduct unsafe, but cheap abortions. This is a widespread issue that is so common that the majority, if not all public hospitals have an entire ward set aside for women suffering from unsafe abortion complications. The complications that stem from underground abortions cost a whopping 1 million TT dollars per month. Treatment includes surgery, blood transfusions, medications, and overnight stays (20). Unsafe abortions can lead to sepsis, hemorrhage, cervical complications, or uterine perforations, with the most historically common problems in emergency rooms being sepsis and hemorrhage. The women that do not seek out medical attention have issues with infertility, pelvic problems including pelvic inflammatory disease and chronic pelvic pain.  Current views  Although abortion is not permitted, other methods of contraceptives such as oral contraceptives, condoms, and tubal ligation are widely used and accepted. It appears that over the counter contraceptives have also become popular since the 90s. Today, oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and male and female condoms are available for free at public health institutions. The Trinidadian government is connected to the Catholic Church, and many laws are based on Christian commandments. The Billings Ovulation Method of Natural Fertility Regulation has stated they operate under the Catholic Church's Archdiocesan Family Life Commission. The Catholic Church, and therefore the government believe sexual intercourse serves only the purpose of connecting marriage and/or conceiving babies. An alternative solution to legalizing all abortions known as the Billings Ovulation Method has been proposed from the church alongside the Billings Ovulation Method of Natural Fertility Regulation. This method suggests women should observe symptoms in her body that indicate whether she is fertile or infertile, and this will determine whether or not the couple should engage or abstain in sexual activities. Advocates for Safe Parenthood: Improving Reproductive Equity (ASPIRE) is a non-profit organization in Trinidad and Tobago that advocate for abortion law reform, better sexual education in schools, and contraceptive delivery services. They were the first organization to consistently strive to fight the government's views and laws on abortion rights and established in 1999.They have participated in conducting studies on women's health records concerning abortion, created model policies and laws, public media campaigns, and surveys over the past decade.  Related issues  The United Nations reports that there has been a decline in the 90s of contraceptive usage due to access and supply limitations. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago also think that fertility and population rates are too high.

Franz-Ludwig's mother, two older brothers, and younger sister Valerie, as well as other relatives, were arrested under Nazi Sippenhaft (blood guilt) laws. He was educated at the Schule Schloss Salem and then qualified as a lawyer after passing his staatsexamen. Political career In 1994, in connection with the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 20 July plot, he demanded that communists, who had fought in the Red Army in the National Committee for a Free Germany should not be honored together with his father. According to Stauffenberg, Communists desired to replace the Nazi Party with another single-party dictatorship. This demand gained many prominent supporters, including then-Federal Defence Minister Volker R√ºhe.

Early life Arlington was born Mary Deubler in New Orleans to German parents.Trivia on Prostitution Biography of Madam Josie Arlington. Trivia Library (February 14, 1914). Retrieved May 4, 2012. Although shrewd, Arlington was known to be short- tempered and violent. She began working as a prostitute in 1881, supporting her family on her earnings, and opened a brothel at 172 Customhouse Street prior to the murder of her brother Peter Deubler in November 1890. At that point, Miss Mary Deubler was also using the surname of Mrs. Phillip Lobrano for professional purposes. She had been with Lobrano since the age of 16 when he had offered her protection. Mr. Lobrano and Peter Deubler had a drunken verbal altercation, and Peter had followed Lobrano from a bar to the Custom street premises. While the witness accounts were disputed for years, Phillip Lobrano claims he shot Peter Deubler in the face in front of his sister Josie in self-defense. Peter died December 9, 1890 ten days after being shot. Phillip Lobrano was acquitted after a second trial on March 31, 1892. In the meantime Josie had cut all business and romantic dealings with Lobrano, and had sought to become more respectable. Josie's decisions helped her business- wise. In the four or five years from her brother's death, she had shed her former reputation. She had taken a new paramour, John Thomas \\"Tom\\" Brady who was a clerk in the City Treasurers office. She and Brady had visited the Arlington Hotel in Hot Springs, Arkansas and she witnessed first hand a luxurious lifestyle and resolved to emulate it back at her brothel. She changed the name to the \\"Chateau Lobrano d'Arlington\\" and began to hire foreign girls to increase the appeal to upscale customers. At this point, she began making business deals with Tom Anderson who operated a nearby restaurant which he renamed the Arlington. Anderson caught wind of Alderman Story's ordinance to create a regulated prostitution district before most did, and he and Josie acquired choice properties on Basin Street near the entrance to the future Storyville area. Storyville era In 1898, when Storyville was established, Arlington moved her operations to a four-story frame mansion at 225 North Basin Street. The house, now demolished, can be easily identified by its distinctive onion-domed cupola. Its renovation reportedly cost $5,000. The establishment, formally named Chateau Lobrano d'Arlington but locally known as The Arlington, was known for its opulence. As an expensive \\"$5.00 House\\", it offered about ten or twelve girls at any time, as well as a live sex 'circus' that could be viewed for an extra fee.storyville madams, history, the district, cheap, \\"cribs\\", rooms, low-priced, prostitutes, tricks, expensive houses, elegant mansions, Basin Street, Storyville, city alderman, Sidney Story, city alderman Sidney Story.

The Arlington was damaged in a fire in 1905. The madam and her girls were taken in temporarily by Tom Anderson, a saloon keeper and friend/lover of Arlington. Anderson's establishment gained the nickname 'The Arlington Annex' as a result. Arlington closed the business in 1909 and retired. Many of her assets were bought by Tom Anderson. Death and burial Arlington died in 1914 and was buried at Metairie Cemetery, in a tomb designed by Albert Weiblen. The grave features a bronze female figure which has been said to leave its post at the door of the monument and walk around the other graves. The mausoleum quickly became a tourist attraction, which left Arlington's family mortified. The body was later moved to another location within the same cemetery. The monument still stands, and deceased members of the Morales family are now held within it. The bronze female figure is thought to symbolize a virginal girl being turned away from the Arlington door, following Arlington's claim in life that no woman's innocence was taken on the grounds of her establishment.

The Yulong starts in Northern Yangshuo County near Litang and runs for over through small villages of the Yulong River Valley, including Litang, Chaolong, Yima and Gaotian town, before emptying into the Li around the town of Ping Le. The Yulong is a shallow river of around maximum depth and an average of across. As it is not located near any industrial areas, it is clean enough for swimming, though some brownish surface foam is visible in eddys, probably the result of phosphate runoff from local villages. Unlike the busy Li River, it has no motorized boat traffic and relies completely on bamboo rafts to ferry passengers downriver. This has become a popular tourist activity, with passengers beginning their journey at the Yulong Bridge, a 400-year-old stone bridge. As the local government has improved local roads through the Yulong River Valley, biking has also become a popular tourist activity, as there are many quaint villages along the river, some offering bed and breakfast accommodation. The Yulong is prone to sudden flooding, which is one of the reasons why there are not more places to stay close by. Local people have built breakwaters (weirs) every kilometer or so to allow their animals to cross the river, though many have fallen into disrepair. During the dry season (November‚ÄìMarch), it is possible for people to walk across some of these weirs; otherwise it is necessary to hire local people to ferry passengers across for about RMB 10 per person. The Yulong River Valley is very fertile, and its low-lying terrain is excellent for rice fields. In recent years, farmers have planted more cash crops such as pomelos, tangerines and mandarin oranges, which bring in more income than rice. The valley is still agricultural, with few services or businesses outside of the small villages. The valley is accessible from the main Yangshuo highway through the village of Yi Ma, north at the Yulong Bridge and south at the Gong Nong Bridge.

Over the course of three days, heavy rains fell in the region, swelling Sunset Lake and other local interconnected waterways. At the time, there were two earthen dams holding the water back at Sunset Lake and Mary Elmer Lake. Eventually the pressure was too much and the dams gave way sending a torrent of water down the Cohansey River as well as tributaries connected to the Lakes. The wall of water surged down through the banks of the Cohansey, emptying the lakes and the Raceway and flowing into and through downtown Bridgeton, which straddles the river. All the bridges that connected the east and west sides of the town were destroyed. Also damaged was Tumbling Dam Park, where the dam that held the water of Sunset Lake was located.  Aftermath  In the aftermath of the flood, residents had no way of crossing the Cohansey River from one side of the town to the other. To go around the River meant a detour. The citizens were given short term relief when a Troop of Sea Scouts (associated with the Boy Scouts of America) used a donated lifeboat to set up a temporary ferry service by stringing a rope across the River and pulling the boat back and forth. Later, the United States Army Corps of Engineers came in and set up a temporary pontoon bridge. In the photographs taken at the time, the pontoon bridge appears to be very flimsy. In fact it was very stable, and one could drive a car across it. Due to the surge of water during the flood, much debris was deposited in the Cohansey River, making navigation of the waterway dangerous. The city hired a hard-hat diver to help in the removal of the debris. This is where Art Mckee, the \\"Father of Underwater treasure hunting\\" got his start.  Story  In the Bridgeton area, among the most remembered of our worst brushes with Mother Nature is undoubtedly the flood of 1934. At the time, showers had been predicted, but no one was prepared for the cloudburst that crippled Bridgeton and racked up more than $1 million in damage. (or over $17,000,000.00 in 2013) Seven inches of rain fell within a four-hour time span, setting off a chain reaction of disasters. Lightning destroyed the Dividing Creek Town Hall. Thousands of dollars of stock was damaged in Laurel Street stores and two Bridgeton dams were washed away. Four 75-foot oyster schooners, torn from moorings, smashed into the Commerce Street Bridge, tearing it in half. The Broad Street Bridge sank three feet and was condemned. Flood waters battered the Bridgeton Water Works and stopped the pumps. This created a water shortage, causing Owens- Illinois Glass Co., Ritter, Laning, Pritchard, Martin Dye and other plants to shut down. More than 2,500 people were out of work. About 60 U.S. Army engineers, called down from Fort Dix, helped build pontoon bridges to relieve the traffic congestion. They were assisted by 150 men taken from the unemployment roles by the Emergency Relief Administration. In the meantime, enterprising youngsters made more than $85 by rowing people across the river at 5 cents a trip. The nickel fare aboard the S.S. Ferry saved thousands of people a 21-mile detour by means of the nearest upstream route. By the late 1930s, a permanent bridge of cantilever construction had been built on Broad Street. It still serves travelers today.

Coupat spent over six months in jail before being released on bail; he was held for a significantly longer period than other members of the Tarnac Nine because French police believed him to be the leader of the group, which they described as an Anarchist cell. Since the time of the 2008 arrests, the legal case against Coupat and the other members of the Tarnac Nine had weakened.

Coupat and his girlfriend Yildune L√©vy came to the attention of the FBI after protesting outside an army recruitment centre in New York City, which was later the target of a bomb attack, having crossed the border from Canada illegally. The Bureau flagged the pair up to their French counterparts, who began investigating the group. The TGV sabotage affair On the night of 7‚Äì8 November 2008, Coupat and L√©vy went for a car ride and played cat-and-mouse with police cars following them.

The only son of Daniel Hill, he attended Marlborough College where his interest in natural history was encouraged by the classical master and entomologist, Edward Meyrick. Hill went on to King's College, Cambridge, where he came under the influence of Marshall Ward and Walter Gardiner, acquiring an MA and DSc. His numerous field trips started with the expedition of the English geographer, William Bisiker FRGS, to Iceland in 1900.Danish Geographic Journal ‚Äì Hveradalir in Kerlingarfj√∂ll, Iceland (1936) This was followed by exploration of the Andes in Bolivia and Peru in 1903, sparking an interest in cushion plants which was to last throughout his life, and the Caribbean in 1911. In 1907 he joined Kew as Assistant Director under Sir David Prain, and started contributing to the floras of Africa and India. In 1922 he succeeded Prain as Director. With grants from the Empire Marketing Board, Hill was able to send botanists all over the world, himself visiting Australia, New Zealand, Malaya, Rhodesia, East Africa, India, Cyrenaica and the West Indies. His interests were not confined to taxonomy, but extended to Economic Botany, of which he was an enthusiastic proponent, and all the other activities of Kew. He managed a large number of changes in the Gardens, despite having to operate in the post-war austerity climate. Some of his greatest successes were in building, renovating, and extending glasshouses, being responsible for the new Rhododendron House in 1925‚Äì26, an improved Economic House in 1930 and the South African Succulent House in 1936.Kew History He was elected an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of New Zealand during his 1928 visit, returning to London to lecture the Linnaean Society in 1929 on natural hybrids in New Zealand.

It began production in 1986 and was released in theaters in 1988 shortly after Class of Nuke 'Em High was done making its rounds at the box office. Plot After a commercial airline crashes on an uncharted island, the surviving passengers, a multi-cultural cross-section of the US population, notice armed uniformed people of various countries apparently looking for survivors. When one of passengers surrenders herself, she's brutally shot. It becomes evident that the island is a terrorist infiltration camp. When passenger Parker, a tough, slightly unstable Nam vet, manages to kill one of the attackers, he and the fellow passenger, everyman Taylor, lead the other survivors to a safe haven, only to have part of their number captured. Brought to a training base, the captured are forced to watch a neo-Nazi horrifically murder an air steward and a priest. The remaining passengers gather what weapons they can find and make a rough attempt at storming the camp in hopes of recovering their lost friends. At the camp, a musician's girlfriend is shot and killed by an obese terrorist wielding an AK-47 assault rifle. The bandleader, Sean, attacks and loses a fight with the Nazi, and the rocker's female bandmate is taken away to be attacked and raped by \\"Se√±or Sida\\" (Mr. AIDS), leader of the AIDS brigade who hope to begin a US AIDS epidemic. Meanwhile, an attractive African- American woman is taken to the brains of the operation, a pair of twins conjoined at the head. Parker and Taylor lead the remaining passengers in a surprise attack on the terrorists' hideout. Sida is dispatched by his victim via a crossbow bolt in the scrotum. Having been transformed by her experience, the African-American lady hunts down the Twins and violently hacks them apart with a machete. She then goes after a terrorist who tried to have his way with her and stuffs a grenade in his mouth. Realizing the terrorists' are prepared to invade America, the remaining survivors are motivated to take steps in attacking the terrorists' main headquarters the next morning. Later that night, the formerly hostile Taylor and Lydia share an intimate moment. The men prepare to storm the camp but refuse to let the women go with them so they don't put their lives at risk. Hardwick, a depressed widower, volunteers to drive a truck full of explosives into a cargo boat hauling the terrorists into the US. Hardwick however is shot down, ruining their plan. The Americans do their best, eliminating mass numbers of the enemy. Running out of ammo the group awaits their last moments when the females ride in and help kill off the terrorists. A timid, morbidly obese passenger named Cooney musters his courage and decides to fill Hardwick's role. He fights his way through the terrorists blocking his way until he gets to the truck. Just as the boat is taking off, Cooney drives the truck off a ramp into the boat, destroying it. The unlikely heroes mourn the loss of Cooney, until he appears unharmed, having ditched the truck at the last minute.

Troma's Wars budget was $3 million, making it Troma's most expensive film to date. Release The film premiered at the Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival in October 1988 before receiving a limited release on December 9, 1988 in New York City. The film was initially rejected by the MPAA as too violent to even receive an R rating, so several scenes were cut from to the film, including the entire AIDS subplot. Despite this, the film was rejected a second time leading to even heavier cuts. According to Lloyd Kaufman, Richard Heffner, the president of the MPAA at the time, told Michael Herz over the phone that the film was ‚Äúno fucking good‚Äù.The Village Voice - Troma‚Äôs Lloyd Kaufman: ‚ÄúI Hope the MPAA Burns in Hell‚Äù =Critical reception= A review from Comeuppance Reviews gives the film three stars, stating \\"Troma's War puts a spin on the wilderness shoot-em-ups we‚Äôve become so used to, and we welcome it.\\" Horrornews.net notes in their positive review: \\"A must-see for fans of trash cinema.\\" Home media An \\"Unrated Director's Cut\\", with a runtime of 104 minutes, was released on DVD on January 26, 2010 and was released on Blu-ray on August 18, 2015.

Historic Hotels of Texas , Texas A&M; University Press: College Station, Texas, 2007. pp 65-67. Tarpon Inn, Port Aransas, Texas (postcard, circa 1911-1924) In 1923, James M. Ellis bought the property. In 1925, he built the structure that still stands today. He retained the barracks style as a homage to the original 1886 Tarpon Inn. To strengthen the building against future hurricanes, dozens of pine poles were sunk into 16 to 20 feet of concrete. The long poles extend up through the attic and the roof is anchored to these poles. When the new building opened, the old smaller building became the hotel's dining room. After World War II, tarpon began to disappear from this section of the Texas coast. The Inn was sold in 1970 by the Ellis family after Hurricane Celia damaged the inn and the surrounding cities. The Inn was repaired and reopened by a new owner in 1975 and has again become a popular place for fishermen as well as tourists and business travelers. The main lobby of the Tarpon Inn is adorned with over 7000 tarpon scales, each signed by the angler who landed the fish. The most famous scale is the one signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who fished off the Texas Coast in 1937, even though he did not actually stay at the Inn. Notable guests at the Inn include Clyde Beatty, Douglas Corrigan, Jesse Jones, Hedy Lamarr, Aimee Semple McPherson and Edward Teller.

It was released on September 29, 2009 by HarperCollins and Bloomsbury Publishing. She went on a book promotion tour for Syren as well as a contest to promote it further. The story continues from the previous release Queste and deals with Septimus going to pick up his friends from a distant land. While coming back they are trapped in an island and there they learn of an evil plan to destroy their homeland, The Castle. The rest of the story deals with how Septimus and his friends save their home and destroy the evil coming their way. Development Angie Sage had compared book five to Robinson Crusoe with \\"tentacles-- lots of them\\". Commenting on the book, she says: > I've planned the ending, and I'm already just drawing everything in, so with > number seven, I can pretty much think what's going to happen. But on the > other hand, there's always the unknown. I write in the character's shoes, so > I'm never entirely sure what they're going to do. Synopsis This story picks up where Queste ended. Jenna, Nicko, Snorri, Ullr and Beetle are in the small harbor known as the Trading Post, where Jenna encounters her father, Milo Banda, who persuades them to spend the night on his ship. Back in The Castle, Septimus gets a promotion to Senior Apprentice by Marcia Overstrand, for being the only apprentice wizard to complete the Queste. This enables him to head off on an adventure of his own. His escapade begins as he plans a simple flight on board his dragon, Spit Fyre, to retrieve his friends from the Trading Post. Around this time, Aunt Zelda sends Wolf Boy from the Marram Marshes. She is giving him a challenging test for becoming the first male Keeper. As soon as Wolf Boy leaves, Zelda retrieves a SafeCharm, which appears to be a tiny, pear-shaped gold bottle. She needs to deliver it to Septimus, however, by the time she arrives he has already left. Due to an unfortunate mix-up, the SafeCharm falls into the hands of Merrin Meredith who stole it believing it to be a rare perfume. When he takes the top off to sniff it, a jinnie comes out of it. \\"Jim Knee\\" as he is called by Merrin, sets off on his own adventure. Meanwhile, Wolf Boy bumps into Simon Heap in the Port; he was looking for his fiancee Lucy Gringe who had been missing. Wolf Boy approaches the House of the Port Witch Coven. There he reads Zelda's letter which tells him to feed a creature called Grim and cut-off its tentacle tip. The Port Witch takes him inside her kitchen and wakes the Grim, which is a giant octopus. The witches bring forth a captive Lucy to feed to the Grim. Under the pretense of feeding Lucy to the Grim, Wolf Boy and Lucy escape from the coven. They are chased by a senior witch, Linda, but they escape by riding straight into a leaving ship. While flying towards the Trading Post, Septimus sees a bunch of seven islands on the sea and hears a voice calling him. Ignoring the voice, Septimus continues his journey and reaches Milo's ship The Cerys. There Milo shows Jenna a big trunk which is full of tiny lead tubes and which he declares to be brought specially for Jenna's safety. Jenna, getting tired of Milo's hospitality decides to leave the ship and fly off home with Septimus and Beetle on Spit Fyre. But while flying home, they get caught in a raging storm. They try to find the Cattrokk Light, a lighthouse in the middle of the ocean, and fall onto a nearby island when Spit Fyre's tail gets struck by lightning. Septimus tries his best to cure the tail with Physik but his attempts fail. He is also perplexed by a voice calling his name continuously. One day Septimus sees a girl approaching him. The girl introduces herself as Syrah Syara; Septimus remembers meeting her when he went back in time 500 years, during the events from Physik. She fled from The Castle during the Queste and hid on the island. Syrah heals Spit Fyre's tail and reveals that she is under a terrible enchantment by the resident evil ghost of the island known as Syren. The Syren, a singing ghost who attracts sailors by her voice and leads them to their doom by possessing them, stays in a tower atop the hills of the island. Syrah takes Septimus there to show him an opened ice- tunnel latch beneath the island; she mentions that danger is approaching the Castle. Before Septimus can close the ice-tunnel, the Syren takes hold of Syrah while Septimus flees. Meanwhile, Marcia goes to the Manuscriptorium vaults and finds that the ice tunnel latches, which pass from The Castle to the Seven Isles of Syren, through Cattrokk Light to the House of Foryx, are opened. Suspecting that the evil ghost Tertius Fume may be behind this, she returns to the Wizard Tower to find Zelda who informs Marcia about Septimus' danger. Together they find the jinnie and lock him in a sealed chamber in the Wizard Tower and devises a plan to help Septimus. Lucy and Wolf Boy continue their journey aboard the ship whose captain is a pirate. They reach Cattrokk light and there, the pirate's henchmen throw the lighthouse guard overboard. Lucy and Wolf Boy hide from them in one of the rooms of the Lighthouse. Surprisingly, they find that the lighthouse guard, Miarr, who is half-cat half-human, is still alive because cats have nine lives. The ship's captain and his henchmen take the light from the lighthouse and transport it to the island where Jenna and Beetle reside, and they see them coming. Miarr then leads Lucy and Wolf Boy to an underwater machine which allows them to approach the island unseen. The Cerys travels towards The Castle under Nicko's steering. However, near Cattrokk Light, Nicko hears the Syren's song and believing mistakenly that the light on the island is coming from the lighthouse, he sails the ship onto the rocks. The pirate ship's captain and his henchmen then ambush Cerys' passengers, but Septimus and the others are able to lock them in the hold and save them all on board. The captain and his henchmen open the trunk, which contains thousands of bottles of jinnie and release them. To their horror, Septimus and the others find that the jinnie warriors come on board and address Tertius Fume as their master; he is on the island directing them towards the Syren tower ice tunnel. Meanwhile, under Marcia's order, Septimus' jinnie finds him. Septimus and Beetle come to the conclusion that since Jim Knee was in a golden bottle, he has the power to overcome the warrior jinnie because gold is purer than lead. Septimus orders Jim Knee to go and freeze one of the warriors so that all the others will be simultaneously frozen. The front line of warriors had already reached through the ice-tunnel to the Wizard Tower, where just as they are about to kill Marcia under Fume's supervision, Jim Knee freezes the last jinnie; hence freezing all the other jinnie warriors. Marcia triumphs and informs a surprised Fume that she will see to it that his ghost is eradicated forever. Septimus and the others rejoice and Lucy and Wolf Boy help Miarr to put back the light atop Cattrokk. Septimus also orders Jim Knee to go and capture the Syren and force it into a small sealed bottle; hence Syrah is saved from her terrible enchantment. However, learning that more than 500 years have been passed since she arrived there and that Julius Pike is long dead, Syrah enters a magical coma because of the combined effects of her recent dis-enchantment and the stress and sadness of this news. The whole company returns to The Castle, where Marcia, Sarah and Silas Heap and Aunt Zelda meet them. Reception Critical reception for the book was mostly positive, with Nannette Morges from the Wilton Villager commended the maturity of the characters.

Early life Ren√©-Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet was born in Saint-Malo, into the Magon family, wealthy Breton shipbuilders. In 1978, he earned his MBA from HEC Paris. He moved to New York City in 1982. Career In New York, Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet was head of Interfinance, a brokerage firm, before becoming chairman and CEO of Cr√©dit Lyonnais Securities USA in 1987. He also contributed to the founding of Apollo Management, financial management firm established by financier Leon Black. Later, he founded Access International Advisors, a research analyst investment agency which specialized in managing hedged and structured investment portfolios that involve commercial physical and biological research.archive.org copy of Access International Advisors websiteAccess International Advisors profile, Manta.com.

Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet's family had done business with many of these aristocrats and their ancestors for almost 300 years. Its funds enlisted intermediaries with links to some of Europe's high society to garner clients. The FBI and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) do not believe Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet was involved personally in the US$50 billion fraudulent financial Ponzi scheme which Madoff was arrested for masterminding, on 11 December 2008. Bloomberg News reported on 2 January 2009 that the AIA funds had increased aggregate exposure to Madoff from 30% to 75% of a total US$3 billion assets in 2008, for a US$2.25 billion exposure. It also identified Philippe Junot, former husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco, and Prince Michael of Yugoslavia, as partner and investor-relations executive, respectively, in the firm; and Liliane Bettencourt, the world's wealthiest woman at the time (d. ‚Å†2017), the 86-year-old daughter of L'Or√©al founder Eug√®ne Schueller, as an early investor.Katz, Alan, \\"Madoff Investor's Suicide Was an 'Act of Honor' Brother Says\\", Bloomberg News, 2 January 2009.

According to The New York Times, Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet's older brother Bertrand said his brother was connected to Madoff by Thierry's partner in AIA, Patrick Littaye, another French banker, and that Thierry had not known Madoff personally. \\"He had a true concept of capitalism\\", Bertrand Magon de La Villehuchet, 74, said of his brother, quoted in the Times. \\"He felt responsible and he felt guilty. Today, in the financial world, there is no responsibility; no one wants to shoulder the blame.\\" Bloomberg reported Bertrand had invested 20% of his assets in an AIA/Madoff fund and also reported Ren√©-Thierry had founded Access in 1994 with Littaye. The two had met at Paribas in 1970. In February 2009, Littaye denied having heard of whistleblower Harry Markopolos' accusations against Madoff in the years before the scandal broke, and said Madoff was \\"of course\\" exempted from the usual handwriting analysis (graphology) which was among the due diligence efforts AIA made with its outside fund managers.Zuckerman, Gregory, and David Gauthier-Villars, \\"A Lonely Lament From a Whistle-Blower\\", The Wall Street Journal.

The tall building at the centre are the port's administration offices and the Western Australian Maritime Museum is to the right. Victoria Quay HMS Renown at \\"A\\" Shed, Victoria Quay, May 1927 Fremantle Harbour is Western Australia's largest and busiest general cargo port and an important historical site. The inner harbour handles a large volume of sea containers, vehicle imports and livestock exports, cruise shipping and naval visits, and operates 24 hours a day. It is located adjacent to the city of Fremantle, in the Perth Metropolitan Region. Fremantle consists of the Inner Harbour, which is situated on the mouth of the Swan River; the Outer Harbour, which is 20 km south at Kwinana in Cockburn Sound and handles bulk cargo ports, grain, petroleum, liquefied petroleum gas, alumina, mineral sands, fertilisers, sulphur and other bulk commodities; and Gage Roads which is the anchorage between Rottnest Island and the mainland. The Inner Harbour includes northern and southern wharves named North Quay and Victoria Quay respectively. All of this area is managed by the Fremantle Port Authority, a government trading enterprise, under the registered business name Fremantle Ports. History Fremantle's port role began immediately the Swan River Colony was founded in 1829, but the entrance to the Swan River estuary was blocked by a rocky bar, which made the mouth of the river virtually impassable for seagoing vessels. The first steamship to enter the port was HMS Driver on 4 December 1845. Long Jetty was the primary port facility until the harbour was opened in 1897 Fremantle shipping was served by the Long Jetty that extended into the open sea, where Bathers Beach is today. Cargo was offloaded onto the jetty and then taken down Cliff Street in Fremantle's West End. It was loaded onto barges that sailed up the river on the westerly sea breeze and back to Fremantle on easterly winds. Later it was transported by rail. Sailors disliked the Long Jetty: in 1892 Captain D.B. Shaw of the American barque Saranac described it as \\"terrible\\": > \\"... entered and fought against putting the vessel alongside jetty to > discharge. It is a terrible place. No place to put a vessel. No shelter > whatever. All the ships have to lay and discharge at the wharf or pay > lighterage.... It is blowing a gale from the SW ... and takes all our time > to hold her.... She had done considerable damage to herself.... It is > certainly the worst place I or anyone else ever saw. No place to send a ship > of this size.... Any man who would come or send a ship a second time is a > damned ass.\\" =Alternatives= British marine engineer John Coode advised John Forrest an outer harbour near Rous Head, or one that would stretch south from Arthur's Head, could be built. Coode ruled out building a port in the river mouth as he believed it would continually silt up due to lateral sand drift. In 1887 the Fremantle Chamber of Commerce pushed hard for the southern scheme to be chosen, but the Colony could not raise the half-million pounds which were estimated what such an initiative would cost. By 1891 Forrest was examining another proposal: an offshore facility at Owen Anchorage south of Fremantle. But by then Charles Yelverton O'Connor had been appointed the Colony's Engineer-in-Chief, and decided the best option was an inner harbour built in the mouth of the Swan River. The discovery of gold in Western Australia meant a working port was urgently needed, Parliament finally accepted O'Connor's plan after much political haggling, the capital was raised in London and preliminary work commenced late in 1892. =Harbour development= The first stage of the harbour works began with a ceremony in which the Governor's wife, Lady Robinson, tilted the first truck load of rubble for the North Mole. Blasting and dredging the rocky bar created a channel, dredging deepened the river basin, and two moles were built to protect the harbour entrance. Land was reclaimed so quays and warehouses could be built. The inner harbour was opened on 4 May 1897 when the steamer Sultan drawing just one foot of water with Lady Forrest at the wheel was the first ship to enter the partly built port. > \\"While the harbour has been deepened, and facilities extended and modernised > over the years, the basic structure of the Inner Harbour remains essentially > unchanged to this day, testament to the boldness, brilliance and foresight > of its designer.\\" There are two lighthouses on either side of the entrance to the harbour, the green-coloured South Mole Lighthouse, in operation since 1903, and the red- painted North Mole Lighthouse, which commenced operation in 1906, located at the end of the westernmost point of the harbour. =Mail packets= As the port neared completion, Forrest lobbied the British to have Fremantle as the port of call for the Mail Packets. Victoria and New South Wales fought for the retention of Albany as the Mail Packet port, as they were fearful they would lose business. Forrest threatened Western Australia may stay out of the proposed federation of Australian colonies unless they agreed. On 3 August 1900, Forrest won when the Postmaster-General in London informed the Post Master-General in Perth that Fremantle would be substituted for Albany as the port of call for Mail Packets. Ten days later the Orient Steam Navigation Company's RMS Ormuz, homeward bound from Sydney to London, was the first British mail carrier to enter and berth in Fremantle Harbour. In 1901 Fremantle surpassed Albany for the first time in total tonnage of ships and the following year in the number of ships when it cleared 410 ships (1,045,170 tons) to Albany's 248 ships (540,910 tons). =Rail link= The railway from the harbour was constructed in the 1880s, and continued to be developed with railway workshops (later moved to Midland Junction), railway sheds, railway marshalling yards, locomotive depots, and in 1907 Fremantle railway station was opened. =Defences and wartime role= with United States Navy submarines at Fremantle in March 1942 During World War II, the harbour accommodated scores of Allied naval vessels on active service. Battleships, troop transports, hospital ships and support vessels, including many passenger ships, were seconded into the war effort. Visitors to Fremantle during the conflict included passenger liners and converted troop carriers RMS Queen Elizabeth and RMS Queen Mary. Because of their size neither was able to take up an inner harbour berth, and instead anchored in Gage Roads. Other well- known ships to visit included the RMS Strathaird, RMS Strathnaver, RMS Orion and RMS Otranto. In 1940 boom defences were installed in the harbour as a security measure and anti-aircraft installations were built. By January 1941 an anti-submarine indicator loop was installed between Swanbourne and Rottnest to warn of any ships passing over it. Outer harbour defences included an anti- submarine net spanning 9370 metres of seabed from Woodman Point to Garden Island along Parmelia Bank, as well as another indicator loop 183 metres further north. Following the losses of battleships HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse on 10 December 1941 and the fall of Singapore in March 1942, many ships sought refuge at Fremantle; at times 30 were at anchor in Gage Roads. > \\"In the inner harbour, it was ... a common sight to see up to as many as > four vessels of substantial size lying in tier, and it was due solely to the > circumstances forced upon the port and the prevailing weather conditions > that such a state of affairs could be permitted.

The first United States submarines arrived at Fremantle in 1942, the US Navy built a submarine repair facility on North Quay the next year, and until 1945 the port accommodated more than 170 submarines from the U.S., British and Dutch navies. The slipway on the south side of the entrance to the harbour where the Western Australian Maritime Museum is now located was also an important part of the wartime role of the harbour.Sherriff, Jacqui.(2002) Fremantle South Slipway : a vital World War II defence facility. Fremantle studies, No.2 (2002), p.106-119, http://henrietta.liswa.wa.gov.au/record=b2078343~S2 =Container Terminal= On 28 March 1969, the first container ship to arrive in Australia, the Encounter Bay from the United Kingdom docked at Fremantle's new container terminal. The terminal itself was officially opened the following day by WA Premier Sir David Brand. The expansion scheme began in 1965 as the Up-River Extensions Scheme, and included new berths at the container terminal. The ship would then proceed to Sydney to unload and uplift more containers before proceeding to Melbourne. By 1970, Fremantle Port had moved 50,000 containers. Victoria Quay C. Y. O'Connor statue at the entrance to Fremantle Port A statue honouring C. Y. O'Connor was erected on Victoria Quay on 23 June 1911. It now stands near the entrance to the Fremantle Ports administration building on Cliff Street. During a waterside clash between police and workers on Bloody Sunday, 4 May 1919, lumper Tom Edwards was struck on the head with a police baton. He died three days later, leaving a wife and three children.Wikisource:The Fremantle Wharf Crisis of 1919 A memorial fountain by Pietro Porcelli was erected in Edwards' memory that year, and was moved to Fremantle's Kings Square in 1968. The Fremantle Passenger Terminal was constructed in time for the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. North Quay North Quay is the portion of Fremantle Harbour on the northern banks of the Swan River, built in the late 1890s this area is now primarily used for container shipping. On the western edges is Rous Head a smaller harbour used for vessel maintenance which also includes one of several Rottnest Island ferry terminals. Gage Roads Gage Roads serve as a shipping lane and anchorage for sea traffic heading towards the port of Fremantle. The area is the most northern of one of four coastal basins formed from the flooding of a depression between Pleistocene aeolianite ridges running north‚Äìsouth, and the subsequent deposition of east‚Äìwest Holocene banks. The seabed of Gage Roads is covered by seagrass. Port Authority limits - Inner and Outer Harbour The limits of the Inner and Outer Harbour go north beyond Gage Roads and Rottnest to a line west of Trigg, and south into most of Cockburn Sound. The outer harbour has a deep water channel north of Gage Roads, and some seven named channels south.http://www.fremantleports.com.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/Navigating%20Fremantle%20Waterways%20Guidelines.PDF Navigating Fremantle Waterways Fremantle Ports PDF * Success Channel * Parmelia Channel * Woodman Channel * Jervoise Channel * Medina Channel * Callista Channel * Stirling Channel Cockburn Sound Cockburn Sound is an inlet that extends from the south of the mouth of the Swan River for about 25 km to Cape Peron near Rockingham. The total area of the sound is about 100 km¬≤. It is bounded on the east by the mainland suburbs of Cockburn and Kwinana, on the west by Garden Island and Carnac Island, and includes several rocky outcrops and reefs. Fremantle Outer Harbour The Fremantle Outer Harbour consist of, from north to south, the Alcoa Jetty, the Kwinana Bulk Terminal, the BP Oil Refinery Jetty, the Kwinana Bulk Jetty and the CBH Grain Jetty. Of these, the Kwinana Bulk Terminal and the Kwinana Bulk Jetty are operated by Fremantle Ports and serve for the import and export of bulk cargoes and liquids, among them iron ore, coal, cement clink, gypsum, liquefied natural gas, petroleum and fertiliser. The other three facilities are privately operated. The Outer Harbour deepwater bulk facilities in at Kwinana were first developed in 1955, to service the Kwinana industrial area, and saw rapid expansion in the 1960s and 1970s. Signalling equipment South Mole light In 1928 the Signal Station at Fremantle was moved from Arthur Head to a site on Cantonment Hill. This building was replaced in 1956 by a new structure, whose functions were superseded in 1964 by the opening of a signal station on the new Port Authority administration building, which was opened by Premier David Brand on 5 March. =South Mole= Built in the 1890s from the southern point of the Swan River mouth is a breakwater to ensure a safe anchorage for vessels in the Inner Harbour. A light house was added in 1903 initially shining a white it conflicted with the Woodman point light house, leading to the South Mole light to change to a green beacon. =North Mole= Built in the 1890s the North Mole was extended almost immediately after completion and on a number of occasions since, the most recent being in the late 1980s, to allow for the addition of an entrance into the Rous Head harbour that was being constructed. Situated on the western end of the mole is a light house initially this shone with green light but was changed to red after it became necessary to alter the white light on the south mole to green.

He is only the second Coast Guard member in Minnesota or on Lake Superior to be killed in service to his country, the other being Edgar Culbertson in Duluth, Minnesota. Brubaker and his newlywed had just moved to Grand Marais, Minnesota after being transferred to Station North Superior earlier that year. The Brubakers were expecting their first child in just a few months. Previously, Brubaker had served on board the USCGC Bramble (WLB-392) and Devils Island Light Station since joining the service in 1964. At approximately 1900 hours on July 11, Brubaker got into the station small boat and started out through the Grand Marais harbor. His wife recalled that he had seen some logs blocking the channel ‚Äì a common occurrence, and decided to try to clear this obstruction. As he neared the break wall, alone in the boat, the boat was sent straight up into the air after it presumably struck one of these logs. Brubaker was thrown from the small boat and struck his head on either the boat or a log as he fell into the water. He was knocked unconscious and drowned. A friend of his had witnessed this from a nearby pier and swam out to try to save Brubaker but was unable to find him below the surface. A Grand Marais resident looked out his window and noticed the Coast Guard boat circling uncontrollably without anyone in the craft and called the Cook County Sheriff's Office, who responded. The boat was stopped by rescuers and the local sheriff dive team went to work right away searching for Brubaker, he was found the next morning. Keith Brubaker was laid to rest in Troy, Michigan with full military honors.

Hyde is noted for her pertinacity. Despite in late 1855 partially winning her case through the New South Wales courts, Mary appealed and three years later in early 1859 won fully after taking her case as far as the Privy Council in England, the final court of appeal then available to a British subject living in the Colony of New South Wales. In 1859, in the 70-year-old Colony of New South Wales, her court case, although largely ignored by historians, was nevertheless an achievement: women did not have the vote; and Hyde lived in a male-dominated society governed by British law where women had little power. Married women had no power at all,Caroline Norton's 1855 pamphlet: A Letter to the Queen on Lord Chancellor Cranworth's Marriage and Divorce Bill 1\\\\. a married woman has no legal existence whether or not she is living with her husband; 2\\\\. her property is his property; 3\\\\. she cannot make a will, the law gives what she has to her husband despite her wishes or his behavior; 4\\\\. she may not keep her earnings; 5\\\\. he may sue for restitution of conjugal rights and thus force her, as if a slave to return to his home; 6\\\\. she is not allowed to defend herself in divorce; 7\\\\. she cannot divorce him since the House of Lords in effect will not grant a divorce to her; 8\\\\. she cannot sue for libel; 9\\\\. she cannot sign a lease or transact business; 10\\\\. she cannot claim support from her husband, his only obligation is to make sure she doesn't land in the parish poorhouse if he has means; 11\\\\. she cannot bind her husband to any agreement. In short, as her husband, he has the right to all that is hers; as his wife she has no right to anything that is his. Property Rights of Women in Nineteenth-Century England and Mary was only able to sue as being a widow she was no longer married.A married woman could not sue or be sued unless her husband was also a party to the suit. The legal status of married women prevented them from unilaterally participating in the civil legal system. Property Rights of Women in Nineteenth-Century England Having experienced life as a woman in Victorian society, single, married and widowed, Mary became concerned with what today would be called a feminist issue. She stipulated in her will that any bequests made to her daughters and granddaughters were to be given to them in their own right and that their husbands should not have any say. She attempted to give her daughters and granddaughters control over their own inheritances. The law of the day overrode her stated wishes. Remembering that colonies in Australia were largely governed by English law, prior to the English 1887 Married Woman's Property Act (which was a rallying point for many first-wave feminists in the late nineteenth century, and was only passed after years of intense political lobbying by dedicated women) a married woman could own no property, and was the chattel of her husband. Any property that she had owned as a single woman, or that she inherited as a married woman whether in goods, money, or land, passed into the ownership of her husband.Married Woman's Property Act 1887 Life Hyde was born in Halesowen, Worcestershire, England in 1779, the eldest child of Edward Hyde and Sarah Blunn. Mary also had a younger brother John who was born two years later. After being transported to Sydney as a teenage convict, Mary became the unmarried partner of Captain John Black (1778‚Äì1802) the privateer (state-sanctioned pirate), whaler, ship's captain, navigator and master mariner who named King Island; and later the wife of Simeon Lord (1771‚Äì1840) a wealthy entrepreneurial emancipist merchant and magistrate. =Convict= In November 1795, at the age of 16, Mary was accused of stealing items of clothing from Francis Deakin, her employer, including 1 black silk cloak, 1 muslin shawl, 1 cotton gown, 1 dimity petticoat, 2 pair of cotton stockings and 1 pair of scissors. On 21 March 1796, at the age of 17, Mary, who also used her mother‚Äôs name as an alias, was sentenced at the Warwickshire Assizes to seven years' transportation to New South Wales for theft. She was not transported until 1798. On 18 July 1798 Mary arrived in Sydney, one of 95 female convicts on board the Britannia, a whaling ship that had also previously brought convicts to Sydney in May 1797. Females were in short supply in the colony, and competition for the newly arrived female convicts on that day was described by David Collins in An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales as like a cattle auction. The lot of the women who arrived that day was to be a servant or a ‚Äúwife‚Äù to a stranger, or a hut-keeper for convict males at Parramatta for those who would not go with one man.Letter from Stephen Hutchinson to John Foyle of 5 September 1798. As Mary stayed in Sydney, it can only be assumed that she was initially chosen by one of the men in the ‚Äúcattle auction‚Äù on board the deck of the Britannia II. =Relationship with John Black= In August 1798, when they were both 19 years old, Mary met John Black, a ship's officer who had survived the mutiny on the Lady Shore in 1797, and who that month had arrived in Sydney on board the Indispensable. Mary came under John‚Äôs ‚Äúprotection‚Äù and fell pregnant almost immediately, and they went on to have two children. Mary, however, was often \\"keeping the home fires burning\\" as John was away for months at a time either whaling or otherwise working his trade as a ship's captain. The longest time that Mary got to spend with Black was from 11 January 1801 to 1 January 1802, when he entered into the liquor trade and established a shop on his leased land. On 31 May 1799, Mary gave birth at home to her first child, John Henry Black (1799‚Äì1867). Home since March had been on land leased from the government by John Black, near what is now De Mestre PlaceNamed De Mestre Place because of its later association with Mary's son-in-law Prosper De Mestre. in Sydney, on the eastern side of George Street, between Hunter Street and Martin Place. Three days after the birth Black again sailed, and Mary was left to care for her newborn alone until he next returned. John Black's business saw him sailing in and out of the port of Sydney, and their child was not baptised until he was three months old. In 1800 it was recorded that ‚Äò‚ÄôMary Hide(sic) and her son were off the‚Äô‚Äô (government) ‚Äò‚Äôstores‚Äô‚Äô. This was because Mary \\"living on the lease of Mr. Black; and owing 7 sheep, 4 pigs and 3 goats\\" had been able to meet a level of self-sufficiency, something the government greatly encouraged in an effort to cut costs. On 7 September 1801, Governor Philip Gidley King granted Mary Hyde an Absolute Pardon, eighteen months before her sentence would have expired. Back in January 1801, when John Black had returned to Sydney from one of his long voyages, Mary Hyde became pregnant with their second child. Mary Ann Black was born at home on 1 October 1801.It has been suggested that John and Mary might have married about this time, but no record of this marriage has been found, she is shown as Mary Hide (sic) on the 1811 muster, and she married as Mary Hyde in 1814. On 1 January 1802, after being home for nearly 12 months, Black sailed for Bombay (now Mumbai) and then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in the Fly. Mary was left at home as the sole parent of two children under the age of three, and one only 3 months old. Then in about May 1802, on the return voyage from Kolkata, John Black's ship was lost at sea with all hands. News did not reach Sydney until 12 months later, in May 1803, that Black's ship was missing, but Black's death was not confirmed until April 1804. Mary was not left completely destitute when Black sailed in January 1802. She had the house and shop on the land leased in Black's name, and what remained of the money and supplies that Black had left behind before he had sailed. =Relationship with Simeon Lord= About 1805 Hyde began a new relationship with a business associate of her late partner. He was the former convict, and one of early Sydney's great characters, businessman Simeon Lord, who in addition to becoming a magistrate also happened to be one of the most litigious men in the colony. Simeon Lord knew both Mary and her previous partner through trading dealings involving Black‚Äôs ships whose goods had been stored in his warehouse. Simeon Lord became step- father to Mary's two children. Simeon also brought into the relationship a nearly teenage adopted daughter, the orphan of two convicts who had died before she was 4 years old. In 1806 Lord's adopted daughter married one of his business partners when she was no more than 14 years old. Also in 1806 Mary's first child to Lord was born. Mary and Simeon went on to have 8 children of their own over the next 15 years. With investments in Lord's name, they also became one of the richest couples in the Colony of New South Wales, with only six Sydney residents having greater landholdings. In 1807 Mary sent her daughter, Mary Ann, to England with Simeon Lord's adopted daughter Joanna and her husband Francis Williams, to be placed into the care of the child's grandfather, Reverend John Black. In February 1807 the then five-year-old left on board Lord's ship the Commerce, but the ship returned to Sydney in April 1807 after picking up shipwrecked men, and sustaining damage in a storm. In July 1807 her daughter was baptised at St Philip's Church, Sydney.Parish records of St Philips Church Sydney Then in November 1807 her daughter began the voyage to England for a second time aboard another of Lord's ships, the Sydney Cove. Young Mary Ann Black did not return to Australia until 1814 after her grandfather's death.Shipping records for Sydney Cove Mary Hyde married her partner Simeon Lord on 27 October 1814 at St Philip's Church, Sydney. Their fifth child was only one week old. A witness to the wedding was William Charles Wentworth, the son of magistrate and family friend D'arcy Wentworth.An unverifiable story handed down in the Lord family is that Mary and Simeon only married in 1814 as their newly born child was to be baptised in the new font gifted by Simeon Lord (and Mary) to the Church. However, the Clergyman suggested that they could not have the child baptised unless they were married, a service which was performed, it is said with no fanfare and a degree of secrecy. Convict Trades In the 1820s the family moved from their ‚Äòcity‚Äô home in Macquarie Place, Sydney, to their ‚Äòcountry‚Äô home in Botany, nearer to the site of their factory. =Widow= When her husband Simeon Lord died in 1840, Mary had a mourning brooch made containing her husband's woven hair in a gold setting with a border of half-pearls. Simeon, the legal holder of the couple's wealth, had died an ‚Äúimmensely wealthy man‚Äù. Under the terms of the will, Mary, a woman, was made executor of the estate. Lord's estate was divided between his wife and 8 children, the youngest of whom was 18. Mary became one of the wealthiest women in the colony. Hyde then lived about another 24 years as a widow, and continued to reside in the family home until her death. After her husband's death, in addition to managing large livestock and landholdings, Mary continued the manufacturing business in the factory at Botany. She employed many local people in the milling and dressing of cloth, and in the making of hats, stockings, leather, shoes, candles and harnesses, until the business had to be closed due to the flooding of part of her Botany property and the loss of the stream which drove the mill. Beginning in 1855, in litigation worthy of her late husband,Her late husband Simeon Lord had been immensely litigious, and his affairs took up a large percentage of the early appeals from the Colony of New South Wales to the Privy Council in England. The records of the Privy Council indicate that his opponents may have had good grounds for arguing that he used the Privy Council as a means of warding off his creditors rather than in a genuine attempt to test the legality of judgments against him. - Characters. Division of Law Macquarie University NSW - +20‚Ä¶ remembering the forgotten By E.V.(Tim) Crampton Mary sued the Commissioners of the City of Sydney. In July 1855, by notification in the Government Gazette of Colonial Act of the 17 Vic, No. 33, entitled \\"An Act for supplying the City of Sydney, and portions of the Suburbs thereof, with Water\\", approximately were resumed for a reserve for a water supply for Sydney. The land resumed including land owned by Mary on which stood her woollen mill. Compensation was offered, but the amount offered was disputed as unreasonable. Under the Colonial Act, questions of disputed compensation are tried in the form of an action brought against the Commissioners. In order to gain reasonable compensation for this resumption the then 76-year-old Mary took the Commissioners of the City of Sydney to the Supreme Court of New South Wales. \\"For thirty one and a half acres, with a mill, a dwelling-house, some outbuildings, and water privileges, Mrs. Mary Lord claimed ¬£30,000.\\" In December 1855, in the third and last action taken by residents whose land had been resumed, she partially won her case. The two cases that were heard before Mary's case, and which had established Mary's right to compensation for the deprivation of her land, buildings, and enough water to provide the motive power to run her mill, were Darvall V. The City Commissioners that was heard by Mr. Justice Dickinson in October 1855, and Edward Lord V. The City Commissioners that was heard by Mr. Justice Dickinson in November 1855. For the loss of and buildings the jury returned a verdict for Darvall of damages of ¬£3200; and contingent damages of ¬£800 in the event of the plaintiff establishing at law his claim to the use of water. Mr. Justice Dickinson ruled that plaintiff, having no mill that was deprived of its motive power, was not entitled to damages to the use of the water, but that this could only be decided by a decision by the full court, on appeal. For the loss of and buildings and the motive power of water to his mill, the jury returned a verdict for Edward Lord of damages for ¬£11,000; and contingent damages of ¬£4,000 for the loss of water for other purposes than those of his mill, namely, for possible wool washing, and other purposes. Mr. Justice Dickinson ruled that the use of the water for possible wool washing was incompatible with the terms of the original land grant, but that this could only be decided by a decision by the full court, on appeal. Held over two days, Mary's case included the special jury of twelve travelling from the court house to Botany to view the land that had been resumed. Unquestioned was Mary's right to compensation for the deprivation of her land, buildings, and enough water to provide the motive power to run her mill. The jury assessed the damages for these at ¬£11,460. What was still in question was her right for damages for the deprivation of water for other purposes like the use of her machinery. The jury, under instructions from the judge Mr. Justice Dickinson, assessed contingent damages for the loss of additional water usage at another ¬£7,200 - but only if Mary had been entitled to the undisturbed use of the water that, previous to the resumption by the Commissioners of the City of Sydney, had been flowing from the land further upstream owned by her son Edward Lord. As in the previous cases, whether Mary had been entitled to the undisturbed use of the water was something that Mr. Justice Dickinson ruled could only be decided by a decision by the full court, on appeal.The Courier (Hobart, Tasmania) - Friday 14 December 1855 The amount of damages of ¬£11,460 awarded to Hyde were reduced after further action by the Commissioners. They did not question the amount of damages on the land and buildings that had been awarded against them, but they did question the amount of damages on the water for the motive power for the mill. The Supreme Court directed a new trial unless Mary agreed to reduce the amount of the damages that she had been awarded, to which she consented. The fight was not yet over, however, as there was still the issue of the contingent damages of ¬£7,200 to which she believed she was entitled. Showing her pertinacity, Mary appealed her case to the Privy Council in England, the final court of appeal then available to a British subject living in the Colony of New South Wales. The judgment of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the appeal of Mary Lord v. Commissioners for the City of Sydney was delivered on 12 February 1859, after Mary had turned 80 years of age. News of the verdict took over two months to reach Australia, but Mary had been awarded the final ¬£7,200 and her costs. Lord Kingsdown (Judge of the Admiralty Court), Lord Justice Knight Bruce, Sir Edward Ryan, and Sir John Taylor Coleridge had decided, despite contrary arguments from the defendants, that Mary had been entitled to the undisturbed use of the water on her land that had been resumed, and that she was entitled to the extra ¬£7,200 compensation.The Hobart Town Daily Mercury - Tuesday 24 May 1859 Her total compensation as a result of the court actions was now over ¬£15,600. Historical research would need to be done to establish if Mary has an even more important place in Australian history. Due to the prohibitive circumstances under which Australian women were living legally and socially, and that for anyone living in Australia prior to or during the Victorian era it was expensive and geographically difficult to appeal a case in England, Mary is perhaps the first, and possibly only, female and/or female convict, to have taken a legal case from New South Wales to the Privy Council. =Death= Hyde died on 1 December 1864Not 1860 as stated in some references.In the Royal Australian Historical Society Journal Vol. XXX Part 1111 1944 on the life of her husband Simeon Lord it is recorded that her tombstone had the following inscription: ‚ÄúMary Hyde, Alias Sarah Blunn, had come out by the transport Britannia under a seven-year sentence given at the Warwick Assizes in 1796‚Äù. This is an unusual inscription to have on a headstone, and cannot be confirmed. at the age of 85 in the family home of \\"Banks House\\" (named after Sir Joseph Banks) at Botany. She was the matriarch of a large, notable, Australian family, and had already settled large amounts of her estate on her children before she died. Probate of her remaining estate was granted on 24 August 1865 and was valued at ¬£11,000.According to \\"Measuring Worth\\" ¬£11,000 in 1865 is in 2007 worth ¬£6.5 million using average earnings. Measuring Worth In her will she named all her ten children, although some had predeceased her. Mary was also specifically concerned for her daughters and granddaughters. She stipulated that any bequests made to her daughters and granddaughters were to be given to them in their own right and that their husbands should not have any say. She attempted to give her daughters and granddaughters control over their own inheritances. The law of the day overrode her stated wishes. Remembering that colonies in Australia were largely governed by English law, prior to the English 1887 Married Woman's Property Act a married woman could own no property, and was the chattel of her husband. Any property that she had owned as a single woman, or that she inherited as a married woman whether in goods, money, or land, passed into the ownership of her husband.Property Rights of Women in Nineteenth Century EnglandA Woman's Place in 19th Century Victorian History Hyde's sons became well-known in public life. One of them, George William Lord (1818‚Äì1880), a pastoralist, was elected to the first New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1856, and transferred to the legislative council in 1877. He was colonial treasurer in the third Martin ministry from December 1870 to May 1872. Her eldest son to Simeon Lord, Simeon Lord Jnr. (1810‚Äì1892), was a pastoralist in Tasmania and Queensland. Another son, Francis Lord (1812‚Äì1897), was a member of parliament for many years, and a third son, Edward Lord (1814‚Äì1884), became city treasurer at Sydney and mayor of St Leonards. Her eldest son John Henry Black (1799‚Äì1867) later became the first manager of the Bank of New South Wales. One of her sons-in-law was another successful merchant in Sydney, Prosper de Mestre (1789‚Äì1844) who married her daughter Mary Ann Black (1801‚Äì1861). An ambrotype photographic portrait of Mary Hyde (Mrs Simeon Lord), in its case, and taken sometime in the period 1845‚Äì1860, is in the collection of the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney.Powerhouse Museum NotesReferences *Mary Hyde, Perth Dead Persons Society ‚Äì Convicts to Australia *The Black Family, Elizabeth Draper ‚Äì de Mestre Family Tree *Simeon Lord and Mary Hyde Black, Vicki Court ‚Äì Family Connections Category:1779 births Category:1864 deaths Category:Australian businesspeople Category:English emigrants to colonial Australia Category:People from Halesowen Category:People from Sydney Category:Women of the Victorian era Category:Australian convict women Category:British female criminals Female ","title":"Mary Hyde"},{"id":"20864101","text":"SupahPapalicious is a 2008 comedy film directed by Gilbert G.

The short-lived project featured members from Seattle-based groups Queensr√øche and Alice in Chains as well as the frontman of Detroit, Michigan- based group Sponge. Spys4Darwin began with guitarist Chris DeGarmo and drummer Sean Kinney, two friends who had both recently performed with Jerry Cantrell during his solo tour. They were soon joined by bassist Mike Inez and vocalist Vin Dombroski, and began jamming at Binge Studios, an abandoned paint factory in Seattle. The project marked DeGarmo's first creative work since departing from his long-held position in Queensr√øche in 1998.

He volunteered to act as security while they performed despite not being able to access the studio himself. One day, Darwin told DeGarmo and Kinney that he was to embark on a trip and asked that they look after his belongings.

According to DeGarmo, regarding the band's approach to microfish: :\\"It was really just us getting together, us recording, us taking it into mix with friends, and us releasing it directly to those people that are interested in it, with kind of very little fanfare... This was about us trying to make the recording as we could in our studio and make a nice package that was more about bein' proud of somethin' that we put out as opposed to whether or not it competes with Creed.\\" =Reception= Critic Malcolm Dome of Classic Rock gave the album a positive review, calling it \\"pretty seamless and thoroughly entertaining\\": :\\"Don't expect a sound that's a hybrid of their alma matas; Spys4Darwin have their own ideas. A familiar blend that encompasses contemporary American rock (think Matchbox Twenty, Train etc) that then takes a left-field twist to pick up traces of bands like Faith No More and Pearl Jam. Infused with sensible melodies and clear-cut arrangements, it's classic rock for a modern audience. :The best track of the six on this minialbum is undoubtedly 'Dashboard Jesus (Follow)', a masterpiece with dense atmospherics, a spiky attitude and a nice sense of the epic, although the rest of the material hardly slouches in comparison. :Which all goes to suggest that 'Spys4Darwin' isn't just a collection of stars idling away their time, but a bona fide band with a future.\\" =Track listing=Post-Spys4Darwin In 2002, the members of Spys4Darwin had begun to move on to different projects.

Biography Smith was born in Dublin on 3 June 1843 which was then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. His father was Dr Aquilla Smith, well known in medical and numismatic circles in Dublin and London. He passed the Indian Civil Services exam in 1871 and was appointed to what would become the United Provinces in India.

Although this evidence of his residence in Rome around this time has been questioned, a number of his pictures depict scenes in and around Rome which would indicate a visit to the city at some point.

In 1642 Wijck returned to the northern Netherlands, where he became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke.Thomas Wijck at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In 1660 he was appointed Dean of the Haarlem Guild. He went to England about the time of the Restoration and was much employed. He was followed there by his son and pupil Jan Wyck, who remained in Britain for the rest of his career and played an important role in the development of English sporting painting. Thomas Wyck was also the teacher of the Haarlem painter Jan van der Vaart, who later also immigrated to England. He died in Haarlem in August 1677. Pieter Mulier II was a follower of his style. Work The Alchemist by Thomas Wijck He excelled in Italianate paintings of shipping and seaports, populated with many figures, very frequently odd characters such as alchemists and misers. His style resembles that of the loose group of Dutch and Flemish genre painters working in Rome who are called the 'Bamboccianti' and were influenced by the genre paintings of Pieter van Laar. He also painted fairs, public markets, and the interiors of chemists‚Äô laboratories. Thomas Wijck's painting of an alchemist is said to have influenced Joseph Wright of Derby's similar picture. Both pictures contain similar vaulting, a confusion of objects and an assistant who is singled out by the light. Thomas Wijck painted a View of London before the fire, and another of the north bank of the Thames, from Southwark, exhibiting the mansions of the nobility in the Strand. He also painted the ‚ÄúFire of London‚Äù more than once.

It has been protected under Denominaci√≥n de Origen (DO) legislation since 1994, prior to which it was traditionally known as Pic√≥n de Tresviso and Queso Pic√≥n de Bejes. The designated area centers in the Li√©bana valley and production is restricted to the municipalities of Potes, Pesaguero, Cabez√≥n de Li√©bana, Camale√±o, Cillorigo de Li√©bana, Pe√±arrubia, Tresviso and Vega de Li√©bana. Production A mixture of cow's, sheep's and goat's milk is used in its production (although not necessarily from Bejes or Tresviso). The curd is created using a precise dose of rennet and cut into hazelnut-sized pieces, which are then drained and allowed to dry. The curd pieces are placed loosely in the mould, allowing sufficient air to circulate and initiate the growth of penicillium spores. The cheese is then salted and left for an initial drying and curing period of between 12 and 18 days, at a temperature between . Although much of the process thus far may take place in modern industrial units, DO regulations stipulate that final maturity be achieved by further curing in a natural limestone cave, typical of the geology of the Li√©bana region, for a minimum of two months.Piƒáon-Bejes-Tresviso (dead link) Maturation in this cool, high-humidity environment develops the particular taste and brevibacterium-infested crust typical of many blue cheeses.

The flesh is smooth, white, and compact, with streaks and patches of teal-coloured veins and a powerful, slightly spicy flavour.

Background Born and raised in Iran, educated in Italy and Pakistan, and now living in Canada, he began debating with people in the 1990s. What bothered him, he tells The Jerusalem Post, was not the penchant for jihad and intolerance that certain fanatical Muslims displayed, but the foundation for such ills in the Koran and core Islamic texts. The Jerusalem Post writes, \\"Sina, who runs Faith Freedom International ‚Äì an Internet forum dedicated to debunking Islam ‚Äì considers himself 'probably the biggest anti-Islam person alive.' His latest book is titled, Understanding Muhammad: A Psychobiography of Allah's Prophet. In it, Sina suggests that Muhammad suffered from a series of mental disorders, including narcissistic personality disorder, temporal lobe epilepsy and obsessive compulsive disorder. 'These disorders,' he says, 'can explain the phenomenon known as Islam... which is nothing but one man's insanity.'\\" Although he was an atheist in his initial years of activism, in his Twitter profile, Ali Sina describes himself as a \\"Christian, writer, anti Islam, anti UN, vegan, conservative and pro Israel.\\" On reforming Islam Sina says that extremism in all religions can be eradicated if certain people are quieted, or if the followers are encouraged to embrace the universalist elements of their faith ‚Äì but without addressing the extremism inherent in the religion's texts. \\"People ask whether Islam can undergo a reformation like the one that Christianity underwent. That's a poor parallel,\\" he says. \\"In Christianity, it wasn't the religion that needed to be reformed, but the church; what Jesus preached was good.\\" On the other hand, Sina continues, \\"In Islam, it's the religion that is not good.\\" \\"With violent conquest and contempt for non-believers central to the tenets of the faith,\\" Sina argues, \\"attempts to forge a moderate form of Islam are doomed... The only way to reform Islam is to throw away the Koran; 90 percent of it should be thrown away. You also have to throw away the history of Islam, and you have to completely disregard the Sira ‚Äì the Arabic term used for the various biographies of Muhammad, from which historical information about his life and the early period of Islam is derived.\\" Arguing that Islam cannot be reformed, Sina says, \\"This is the way to fight evil. I do not want to kill the enemy. I want to win them as friends and allies. That is the real victory. In this way, we win because we eliminate our enemy, and our enemy wins by eliminating his ignorance and hate. That is why I believe in my cause. That is why I think I am an instrument of peace.\\" While disagreeing with Sina for saying Islam is not a religion but a political ideology, David P. Goldman, writing in the Asia Times as Spengler, compares that claim to Immanuel Kant's claim that Judaism is not a religion but a set of laws and rejects both. Spengler continues, \\"Ali Sina and other Muslim secularizers are just as wrong. I shall argue that Islam is both a religion and a political ideology. Religion is what makes Islamic political ideology so dangerous.\\" He adds, \\"Ali Sina is wrong: Islamic expansionism arises from religious motives, that is, a holy rage against the encroachment of death upon traditional society. In the form of Islam, the West confronts a challenge quite different from communism.\\" A Biopic about Muhammad On 25 September 2012, the Los Angeles Times announced Ali Sina is working on a biopic of Muhammad. The movie will cost a total of 10 million dollars and he hopes to start filming in 2013. \\"Sina began contemplating a biopic about Muhammad a decade ago,\\" wrote the Los Angeles Times \\"but stepped up his effort in the last two years as technological advances made it feasible to circumvent government censors and wary exhibitors. \\"We can bypass theatres completely and sell the movie online with a profit to a large number of people, especially Muslims,\\" Sina said. \\"They can download it and watch it even if they are living in Karachi or Mecca or Medina.\\" His viewpoints have been described as Islamophobic for maligning the Prophet Muhammad.

Before being elected to Portland's City Council in 2008, Fritz was a neighborhood activist and seven- year member of the Portland Planning Commission. She was also the first candidate to win public financing under Portland's Clean Elections system in 2006, though she lost to incumbent Dan Saltzman in the first round of that year's election. She was elected to City Council in the November 2008 election. She succeeded Commissioner Sam Adams, who vacated the seat to run for mayor. Early life and education Fritz was born in England and grew up in Leeds, West Yorkshire. After graduating from the University of Cambridge, where she earned a bachelor's and a master's degree in Biological Sciences. She moved to the United States in 1979, where she attended nursing school in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and then moved to Rochester, New York. She relocated to Portland in 1986. Career Upon moving to Portland from New York, Fritz began working at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) as an inpatient nurse in the hospital's psychiatry department. In 1996, she was appointed to the city's Planning Commission, and served on the Commission until 2003. In 1999, Fritz was noted as a Planning Commission member who valued an emerging online list for contributing to the discourse on planning in the city. =City council= Fritz at a meeting of the City Commission In 2008, Fritz became the first non-incumbent to successfully run under Portland's public financing system. She took the most votes in the May primary election (43%) in a field of six candidates, and faced second-place finisher Charles Lewis (13%) in a November runoff election. Fritz and Lewis were among the candidates who each qualified for $150,000 in public financing by collecting over 1,000 five- dollar contributions, and pledging to accept no other campaign contributions. Each received an additional $200,000 for the runoff election. Fritz defeated Lewis with 70% of the vote in the runoff. Fritz was also the first candidate to qualify for public funds under the program, in her first race, when she challenged incumbent Dan Saltzman in the 2006 election. In the 2008 race, her decisive victory in the primary enabled her to reach out to new classes of constituents; she was noted for expanding her appeal from neighborhood activists to the business community, and placing a strong emphasis on fiscal responsibility. She has been an advocate of the system since that first race, and wrote in support of it after winning the 2008 election. Voters overturned it via referendum in 2010. Fritz credits the Public Campaign Finance system for allowing her the independence that led to saving Portland ratepayers $500 million by changing policy choices in the Portland Water Bureau in 2009. In June 2013, a shuffling of bureaus among the commissioners by new Mayor Charlie Hales saw Fritz assigned the Parks Bureau and the Bureau of Development Services, in place of her previous assignments. Fritz won re-election in 2016. Personal life Fritz's husband, Steve, whom she married in 1982, died in a car crash in September 2014.

Originally built in 1887 to supply water to Newcastle and the lower Hunter Valley, it has since been restored and preserved and is part of Maitland City Council's Walka Recreation and Wildlife Reserve. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. HistoryWaterworks= The Newcastle Borough Council established a Water Committee to try to improve water supply to residents of the inner city area in February 1875 after a very dry period. In 1876, George Lloyd, the local representative in the Parliament of New South Wales raised the matter of government help to finance the construction of a water supply for Newcastle. To the surprise of many, other parliamentarians supported the motion. In 1877 Sir Henry Parkes sent noted British hydraulic engineer William Clark to advise on possible water sources for the Lower Hunter towns. Clark had been brought to NSW to advise on Sydney's water supply and drainage problems. Clark's report recommended Walka as the site for a water works which would supply 37 000 people at the estimated cost of 170 000 pounds. The citizens of Newcastle were pleased with the scheme and its cost and quickly approved the plan. They sent a deputation to Parliament on 5 December 1877 with strong encouragement from John Robertson, the Colonial Secretary. Construction of a water supply was imminent. However, a new government came to power before the end of the year. Another deputation was sent to Sydney, but James Farnell and his government preferred to give preference to the construction of a second water supply in Sydney At the end of 1878 a new government took over and a third deputation was sent to Parliament. By May 1879 the necessary surveys and cost estimates had been sufficiently advanced to allow the ordering of machinery and iron pipes but the government refused to bow to pressure from the Hunter region to sanction full expenditure. In 1881 the first steps were taken and the Newcastle and Buttai reservoirs were constructed. Land was resumed for the Walka works in June that year. The Public Works Department called for tenders to construct the Walka reservoir and associated works in December 1882 and contracts were signed in April 1883. At least four contracting firms were involved, Messrs. T. Smith and M.Burley, George Blunt, James Russell and James Watt and Company. Smith and Burley were responsible for the tunnel which drew water from the river to the pumping station. George Blunt built the reservoir, filter beds and settling and clear water tanks and James Watt and Company of Birmingham supplied and erected the three pumping stations installed at Walka in 1886. James Russell completed the construction of the engine and boiler house although there is dispute as to whether Russell won the contract originally. It is argued that M. Parkhill, a relatively unknown contractor, was given the contract in 1885 but became insolvent, leaving the opportunity for Russell to take over. Boilers at the Water Works The design for the complex was undertaken by notable English engineer Sir William Clark and was a major engineering project for the area at the time. Water was pumped from the Hunter River to a reservoir along a brick tunnel approximately in diameter and below ground. At full operation, it had three pumping engines (150 hp each and with a flywheel weighing 36 tonnes), two horizontal compound pumps and a triple expansion surface condensing pump engine. Water would be pumped from the river at Oakhampton up to the Walka reservoir (still visible as the Walka lake today), then pumped onwards to another reservoir away at Buttai; where it was \\"gravitationally distributed\\". The waterworks served as the sole water supply of the Lower Hunter towns from 1887 until 1929 when it was superseded by the Tarro Pumping Station. Industrial development and an increasing population in the period resulted in a growth in demand for water and the need for considerable development and modification at the site. In 1892 the pumps were improved and a third pump was attached to the No.3 beam engine. This was also the year that the Hunter District Water Supply and Sewerage Board took over the works. In 1896-7 a second pipe was constructed between the Hunter River and the waterworks. In 1900 Newcastle was consuming double the water it had consumed in 1892. The implementation of the waterworks scheme for drinking and washing made possible the provision of sewerage systems to the towns. This improved the health of the community by reducing the likelihood of disease and improving the cleanliness of the population and their urban environment. Severe droughts in 1902 and 1905-6 produced supply problems and demonstrated that the Hunter River was no longer an adequate water source for the region. In 1908 the number of filter beds was increased from four to six and by 1910 it had become necessary at times to operate three beam pumping engines simultaneously. In 1913 more equipment was installed and a further four rapid water filters were installed in 1916. At peak operation the waterworks produced 3843 megalitres (in 1915). As the population of the area continued to increase, other sources of supply were developed ‚Äì namely Chichester Dam near Dungog. From 1923 to 1940 the waterworks were used as a backup water supply only. In 1925 the complex was put on standby and with the onset of the Great Depression and the completion of Tarro pumping station at Tarro, the plant was shut down as an economy measure in 1931. After the Second World War in 1949 all the plant and machinery was sold for scrap, fetching ¬£2,500. =Power Station= Two years later, in 1951, the site was reopened as a temporary coal power station by the Electricity Commission to overcome post-war electricity shortages. What was described as a \\"package power plant\\" was bought from General Electric and imported from America. The plant was shipped out in pieces, then taken to the site by rail (to Maitland station) and a specially made truck. GE engineers also came out to assemble the plant.George, P p2 It began producing electricity in 1953. Three boilers ran on coal, and another ran on oil, though later this became a coal/oil combination. Two rail lines were built to the power station from the North Coast railway line.George, P p9 Using Walka as a power station was controversial. Initially the power station suffered from sinking foundations ‚Äì leading to the temporary sacking of 120 workers, until it was agreed that the sinking was a result of recent rain.George, P p5 During construction, the workforce went on strike after a boilermaker union member was sacked for \\"misconduct\\" towards his foreman.George, P p7 This was eventually resolved, but in December 1953 the power station suffered another setback when one of its oil storage tanks collapsed in gale-force winds. The station was also unpopular with local vegetable growers, who complained about the amount of soot the station was producing. The powerplant was decommissioned in 1976 and dismantled in 1978. =Recreation and Wildlife Reserve= Not until 1984 were there definite attempts to reopen the site. At this time a Trust was formed, aiming to open the site and restore the Waterworks complex. The complex had been classified by the National Trust in 1976. Today the area is open as a free public reserve, with barbecues, picnics areas, a playground, walking trails and a 7 1/4 inch gauge miniature railway that operates passenger rides each Sunday. The reservoir and surrounding plant life make it a unique environment for birds and animals in the area. Key characteristics Information board at Walka Water Works * Main pump house with distinctive chimney, ornate brickwork and Victorian Italianate architecture * Large sandstone water reservoir * Settling tanks and filter beds to purify water * Miniature Railway  Description  The Walka Water Works site's curtilage is roughly diamond shaped, including a hillside zone, footslopes to a U shaped reservoir or dam, with the industrial complex of the water treatment works to the reservoir's north-west. The group of buildings known as the Walka Waterworks are located within site boundaries north west of the dam. The buildings and structures of the complex are generally constructed of load bearing brickwork, with trussed roof structures to the main engine houses, and roofed with corrugated iron. = Main Pump House = Pump house and smoke stack, 2008 2 storey polychrome brick structure with walls up to 1 metre thick. It contains a basement approximately 10 metres deep. Six cast iron columns built to support the first floor remain but all other original features have been replaced or obscured by a raised floor, office partitions and a stairway constructed in the 1950s. The first floor retains sufficient fixtures to demonstrate its previous operations. Original sections of flooring remain as do cast iron cross beams, shoes, joists, decorative grills, timber floor joists and the pilaster which carried the overhaul beam crane. A large sandstone block is located within the wall above and below each pair of joists. The original colour scheme is still visible. = Boiler Room = Attached to the northern end of the main pump house. The roof is double hipped and clad in corrugated iron and has been subject to modifications. Surviving features include the steam header access hole in the southern wall, column capitals, the flue, the access door to the engine room and an unusual configuration of windows beneath relieving arches in the brickwork. = Chimney = Polychrome brick standing 36 metres tall. Square base translating through an octagonal section to become a tapering cylinder, terminating in finely corbelled brickwork. A flue leads to the chimney from the centre of the western wall of the boiler room. = Eastern Extension to Pumphouse = Built in 1893 as an office. The original 9 pane windows have been replaced by 6 pane windows. An extremely unsympathetic entrance and set of stairs have been inserted in the southern wall. Internal amenities installed during the 1950s by the Electricity Commission and plumbing fittings remain. = Western Pumphouse = Built in 1913, the building abuts the main pumphouse, its form and detail successfully reflecting the original building. The pump house required the bricking in of openings to the main pump house and removal or relocation of the original window joinery. The existing 9 pane windows on the western side of the building are probably the only remaining original windows of the complex. The internal brickwork is rendered and painted but along its eastern side it retains the profile of the exterior of the main pump house. The roof trusses of riveted steel are exposed. The southern wall is constructed of timber and corrugated iron to enable further expansion. = Workshop = A small single storey building north of, and separate from, the original boiler room. Four cast iron chutes penetrate the northern wall. This wall is a retaining wall built against an embankment which defines the northern boundary of the pumping station complex. This wall is angled with a buttressed base and weepholes. Concrete steps adjacent to the east lead to the road above. The building contains fire bricks for use in the Electricity Commission boilers. = Boiler Room Addition = A lean to roof and western wall of corrugated iron over a timber frame erected between the workshop and boiler room in 1913. = Settling Tank = large rectangular tank (220' x 115' x 10') located north west of the pump house complex. The walls are sandstock brick covered with cement render. The floor is concrete. The tank has not been filled and remains largely intact. Several of its associated artefacts and components, including a vertical iron inlet pipe on the eastern side, an outlet and overflow pipes on the southern side and height gauge and ladder remain. A steep, centrally located set of concrete steps lead south down an embankment to the filter beds. = Filter Beds = Seven beds were constructed in 3 stages. Beds 1-4 were laid out in a grid fashion around a north/south pipe. All were built of sandstone blocks. Beds 2 and 4 have been damaged by the erection of concrete bases for cooling towers associated with the s power station. Beds 1 and 3 have been uncovered and probably remain substantially intact. Beds 5 and 6 are of different construction, having been added in 1908. They feature off-form concrete walls with pre-cast concrete cappings. Bed 7 was built in 1913 in a similar design to the 1908 beds and is in reasonable condition. The filtration layers of sand, gravel and brick may remain in silt within beds 1,3,5,6 & 7. ;Clearwater tank Of brick construction and located below the filter beds. The brick piers of the rim show evidence of the roof line but iron supports for the roof have been removed. The western side features gate piers with brick caps. The intake, outlet and overflow pipes associated with this tank remain in situ. = Reservoir = The reservoir edges follow the natural land contours on the northern and western sides and are bounded by an earthen embankment made from material excavated during the construction of the tanks, filter beds and pumping station on the southern and eastern ends. Its internal face is lined with Ravensfield sandstone blocks. A brick byewash(4m x 2m) is located at the southern west extremity of the reservoir. It has an arched, buttressed brick face covered with concrete render. The byewash contains a large valve which could be opened to lower or drain the water in the reservoir. A circular brick structure with an iron trap door is centrally located on the reservoir's north bank and a small valve house is present about 30m from the eastern wall. A discharge cooling tunnel runs parallel with the northern bank. = Chief Engineer's Residence = 9 room brick cottage. Substantial footings and rubble, a tennis court and an approach road flanked by introduced trees remain. = Second Engineer's Cottage = Footings of the second engineer's 6 room brick cottage remain. = Natural features = An isolated stand of an endangered ecological community, Lower Hunter Spotted Gum-Ironbark Forest, has survived in the area because the small catchment around the constructed reservoir lake was bordered for historical civic purposes some 150 years ago and has remained relatively secure in tenure and management since. (spotted gum is Corymbia maculata: ironbark is one of several species of Eucalyptus). The bush component acts as an island and a stepping stone for fauna within the (largely cleared) Hunter Valley. It has some 300 species of bird recorded on this site alone. Four threatened bird species have been recorded here: Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus)(endangered); black bittern (Ixobrychus flavicollis)(vulnerable); blue-billed duck (Oxyura australis)(vulnerable) and freckled duck (Stictonetta naevosa)(vulnerable). 18 other threatened fauna species including three more bird species, have been recorded within a 10 km radius of Walka Water Works since January 2000, although their specific presence at Walka has not been determined.Maitland City Council, 2015 = Miscellaneous features = An extensive system of concrete paved roads, paths and kerbing installed by the Electricity Commission in the 1950s. Remnants of the planting scheme installed at the site by the Electricity Commission. A sparse scatter of plantings from the original period of operation, including an avenue of trees near the Chief Engineer's residence. A substantial railway formation, including cuttings and embankments, runs from the site of the power station along the northern edge of the reservoir and connects to the North Coast railway main line at the western end of the site. Some sections of the railway track remain in situ. A vehicle track follows the railway line. A cast iron pipe network and a steel pipe network remain. The steel steps and concrete footings for the fuel air pump house can be seen at the edge of the rail track below filter bed 7.Godden & Associates, 1986: 7-29 = Modifications and dates = * 1892 - a 3rd pump attached to No.3 beam engine * 1893 - eastern extension to main pump house * 1908 - filter beds 5 & 6 built * 1913 - ** western pumphouse built ** boiler room addition between workshop and boiler room ** pump shed built (now gone - n.d) ** filter bed 7 built ** Babcock and Wilcox boilers, steam economiser, feed pumps and accessories and a vertical triple expansion 3 plunger pump engine added * 1949 - concrete floor installed in western pumphouse after water pumping machinery removed. * 1950s - Electricity Commission installs amenities in eastern pump house extension and makes alterations to pump house * 1975 - Second Engineer's cottage demolishedGodden & Assoc 1986: 7-29Turner 1986: 15  Heritage listing  Walka Water Works, West Maitland NSW Walka Water Works is one of the largest and most intact 19th century industrial complexes in the Hunter Valley. The surviving water treatment features at the site constitute the most comprehensive set in NSW and clearly illustrate water filtration and reticulation processes and the major developments which occurred during the late 19th and early 20th century. The pump house, chimney and boiler house are elegant finely executed polychrome brick structures in a traditional configuration which are located within an attractive landscape. The entire complex, including reservoir and tanks, is an important cultural landmark.Godden & Assoc 1986: 30 Walka Water Works was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Establishment of the complex was a major political and engineering achievement, finally providing a permanent supply of clean water to Newcastle residents. Changes and developments at the complex document the growth of the demand for water. An expectation of further expansion is evidenced in the temporary nature of the southern wall of the pump house west annex. The construction, expansion and demise of the waterworks were vital stages in the establishment and growth of the Hunter Valley Waterboard. The ultimate demise of the site as a water treatment plant and its subsequent development (and demise) as a power station documents significant periods of growth and change in the community. William Clark, a prominent hydraulics engineer and a number of other noteworthy individuals were closely associated with the complexes design, construction and expansion.Godden & Assoc 1986: 30-31 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The entire site has been largely unmarred by the construction of any other unsympathetic developments. The reservoir catchment continues to provide a pleasant rural curtilage to the complex. The pumphouse, chimney and boiler house are finely executed polychrome brick structures which feature a degree of uniformity in materials, form and scale that is typical of many 19th century public buildings. The combination of elegant polychrome brick buildings, filter beds, tanks and reservoir with the nearby topography creates an element of considerable cultural interest and beauty within an already attractive landscape.Godden & Assoc 1986: 31 The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The complex is an outstanding resource for the interpretation of the importance of 19th century industrial processes. For many years it has been a cultural landmark to the people of Maitland and the Hunter Valley.Godden & Assoc 1986: 32 The site is the centrepiece of the most important advance in public health in the history of the Hunter Valley, improving health and cleanliness of the population and their urban environment. Furthermore, without a water supply many secondary industries which provided employment in the Newcastle area could not have been established.Turner 1986: 16 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The complex is the only complete set of 19th century water filtration equipment extant in NSW and illustrates water treatment filtration processes. The configuration and substantial remains of all major components of the complex, including evident remains of machinery locations and ancillary structures, such as pipes, enable the processes carried out to be clearly understood. The largely intact set of Victorian structures typify the building associations of a 19th-century technology. The evolution of the complex over time provides evidence of the development of steam technology from beam engines to reciprocating engines.Godden & Assoc 1986: 31-32 The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The intact nature of the site makes it an excellent representation of water filtering and reticulation processes of the period.

Branching off from the Gippsland line at Warragul station, it was built to service the timber industry in the upper Latrobe River area, transporting timber as well as providing a general goods and passenger service to townships in the area. The final section of the line between Neerim South and Noojee traversed increasingly hilly terrain and featured a number of large timber trestle bridges. Extensively and repeatedly damaged by bushfires over the years, the line was closed in the 1950s and dismantled. The last remaining large trestle bridge on the line has been preserved and has become a popular local tourist attraction. History Only a few years after the opening of the Gippsland mainline to Sale, townships along the upper reaches of the Latrobe River began to petition for a branch line to be built to service the area and by 1885 a route had been approved by Parliament from Warragul via Buln Buln. There was some dispute regarding the route, with a deputation meeting the Minister for Railways in 1888 to request the line be built from Longwarry rather than Warragul, following the Tarago River along an easier alignment and providing a shorter route to Melbourne. The Premier, Duncan Gillies, advised that the route could not be changed, and the line opened in sections with Warragul to Rokeby opened on 12 May 1890, and Rokeby to Neerim South on 18 March 1892.Fiddian (1997), p. 163.Fiddian (1997), p. 164. Before the year was out, representations were being made to extend the line from Neerim South to Neerim proper. However, the line progressed no further as the Railways Standing Committee found that traffic on the proposed extension would not justify the ¬£19,000 ($38,000) expenditure. Options for a more cheaply built extension, including the possibility of it being built as a narrow gauge railway were to be considered. With the opening up of Crown lands in the Noojee and Fumina districts in the early 20th century, areas with poor rail and road transport, there was a renewed push for the railway to be completed. Extension of the line to Noojee via Neerim and Nayook had commenced by 1915, and on 27 March 1917 the long extension was opened from Neerim South to Nayook,Fiddian (1997), p. 165. climbing from an elevation of to . Construction continued on the final section into Noojee, over which the line descended , and it was opened on 26 April 1919.Fiddian (1997), p. 166. There was considerable optimism for the future prospects for the railway. The Argus newspaper reported that in addition to timber traffic paying its way, the line, which extended \\"into a most picturesque part of Gippsland\\", would soon develop a profitable tourist traffic. However, even as the railway was being officially opened, the roads that would ultimately lead to its closure were already on the way. John Mackey, the Speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly and member for West Gippsland, announced during the opening ceremony that the Country Roads Board had made funds available for the building of roads into the region and was now awaiting contractors willing to undertake the construction works. With the completion of the railway into Noojee, timber production in the area boomed. More than 200 kilometres of narrow gauge tramways were built to link the surrounding mills to the railway terminus. At least 28 timber mills were in operation between 1919 and 1926, when bushfires swept through the region and destroyed the township. =Infrastructure= The broad gauge line was built to Victorian Railways \\"light lines\\" standard with 60 lb/yd (30 kg/m) rail. The ruling gradient was 1 in 40 between Warragul and Neerim South, and 1 in 30 between Neerim South and Noojee. As of 1923, it featured three turntables along its length: a table at Neerim South, and tables at Nayook and Noojee. Passenger trains were permitted to travel at speeds of up to , while goods trains were restricted to =Services= Victorian Railways K class locomotive, circa 1922 The line saw the use of Victorian Railways V class 2-8-0, K class 2-8-0 and N class 2-8-2 steam locomotives. Passenger services were relatively slow, as was the case for many branch lines where a mixed goods and passenger train service was provided. Victorian Railways passenger timetable of 1928 shows a travel time from Melbourne to Noojee of approximately six hours for the journey from Flinders Street station, which included lengthy stops at Warragul and Neerim South. Although by 1930 services into Noojee had only been running for just over ten years, Victorian Railways, faced with mounting losses that would result in a record ¬£1 million deficit, announced the closure of the daily passenger rail service from 30 June 1930. It was replaced by twice-daily road motor services, with a journey time reduced by two hours, and additional services were available for market days on Thursdays. Use of the railway line was reduced to the three goods trains per week needed to clear goods traffic. =Bushfire damage= With much of the line traversing dense eucalyptus forests, the line and the towns it served were at high risk of bushfire damage. In February 1926, the town of Noojee (including the railway station) and much of the line from Nayook was destroyed in the Black Sunday bushfires. The line was closed for repairs until 17 May 1926, with a road motor service being provided in the interim. The town was again razed by fire in the Black Friday bushfires of Friday 13 January 1939, along with three of the large trestle bridges on the railway line between Nayook and Noojee. Of the ¬£20,000 damage caused to Victorian Railways by the 1939 fires, the Noojee trestle was the most serious loss, with repairs taking several months. =Closure= The lightly trafficked line was closed beyond Nayook on 27 March 1954.Fiddian (1997), p. 170. The section was last used when residents travelled by train to Warragul on 3 March 1954 to see Queen Elizabeth II during her first visit to Australia. The remaining section between Nayook and Warragul was closed in 1958.Fiddian (1997), p. 171. Preservation Preserved Noojee trestle bridge, December 2009 After closure, the tracks and station buildings along the line were dismantled and many sections of the right of way were sold off. The Buln Buln Shire Council purchased the No. 7 Noojee trestle bridge from Victorian Railways for the nominal sum of ¬£1 ($2). This historic eighteen-span structure, long and high, was one of three rebuilt in 1939 after the original structures were razed by the Black Friday bushfires. Architecturally significant as the tallest surviving timber trestle bridge in Victoria and a unique and intact example of trestle bridge construction, it is now registered with the National Trust of Australia. Approximately of the rail formation around the Noojee Trestle Bridge has been converted into the Noojee Trestle Bridge Rail Trail. Further south towards Warragul, approximately of the formation has been converted into the Rokeby to Crossover Rail Trail. In April 2012, the Noojee and District Historical Society were successful in a bid to relocate J class steam locomotive J550 from Warragul to Noojee for eventual restoration. The bid for the locomotive was part of a project to create an historical park in Noojee, featuring a restored rail line from Noojee railway station to the trestle bridge. On 24 March 2013, J550 was moved by road to Noojee and placed on a section of track at the site of the former railway station. Map of the Noojee Trestle Bridge Rail Trail.

This designation is restricted only to the Marine Expeditionary Units‚Äîas per \\"Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable\\", or \\"MEU(SOC)\\", and is unique to the Marine Corps and is NOT associated with the common special operations although considered special operational forces capable these units do not fall under the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)‚Äîor by any other military branches of the United States‚Äîand its primarily and strictly limited to the United States Marine Corps and Navy. MSST conduct Visit, Board, Search and Seizure on Over the Horizon Boats The theory behind the MEU(SOC) is to provide a continuous and perpetual projection of Naval forces that are able to respond to any type of crisis, to provide any forms of security and military presence to any given region within 24‚Äì72 hours anywhere in the world. Such crises may range from natural disasters to civil or national discord, or total invasion of forces into a hostile area. The term \\"special operations\\" in the Non-SOF context, therefore, refers to special taskings of limited duration in support of a combat commander. These operations include: * Amphibious raids * Non-combatant evacuation operations (NEO) * Security operations * Tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel (TRAP) * Direct action * Humanitarian/civic assistance Therefore, \\"the primary objective of the MEU(SOC)...is to provide the theater CINC's with an effective means of dealing with the uncertainties of future threats, providing a forward deployed unit that is inherently balanced, sustainable, flexible, responsive, expandable and credible.\\" Special operations capable (SOC) Marine expeditionary units Each Marine expeditionary force (MEF) has MEUs. When specifically trained and operationally qualified to perform special operational duties, they are then known as a Marine expeditionary units (special operations capable), or MEU (SOC); designed under the battle plans of combined maritime-based ground and air elements that make up a MAGTF. =Conventional operations= A four-man fireteam of Marines simulates infiltrating a beachhead to gain information about the enemy and its adjacent beaches to help forecast a 'ship-to-shore' landing operation from 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company, II Marine Expeditionary Force Beyond those conventional missions assigned to a MEU, the specialized units within the Marine Corps's special operations capable community are able to perform the following capabilities assigned:MAGTF Warfighting Center Concept Publication 8-1 (WCCP 8-1): Operational Concept for Marine Expeditionary Units (Special Operations Capable); September 1990. *Battle area ingress/egress: enter and exit a battle area. *Locate and fix the enemy: involves finding and identifying enemy forces, maintaining surveillance once located, assessing the capabilities and intentions, and reporting those findings. *Engage the enemy: engage, destroy, or capture the enemy in a rural or urban setting, in hostile environments, with minimized/controlled collateral damage. *Rapid staff planning: the capability to rapidly plan and be prepared to commence execution of operations within six (6) hours of receipt of the warning order/alert order. Commencement of operations is signified by the launch of forces by air and/or surface means. This may range from the insertion of reconnaissance and surveillance assets in support of the mission to the actual launch of an assault force. Rapid staff planning is a key to MEU(SOC)s overall operational success. *Joint force interoperability: the MEU will normally be committed in conjunction with joint or combined task force (J/CTF) operations. Joint/combined force interoperability is a shared responsibility of the force commander and subordinate elements. Interoperability depends on compatible C4I equipment and standardized procedures while embracing common terminology and techniques. The objective is a thorough understanding of mutual command and control procedures, capabilities, and limitations developed through continual participation in joint and combined exercises. *Amphibious raids: conduct amphibious raids via air and/or surface means from extended ranges in order to inflict loss or damage upon opposing forces, create diversions, capture and/or evacuate individuals and material by swift incursion into an objective area followed by a planned withdrawal. The amphibious raid is the primary operational focus for the forward-operating MEU(SOC)s. *Limited-objective attacks: assaults based on limited force. *Non-combatant evacuation operations (NEO): conduct NEO by evacuating and protecting noncombatants in either a permissive or non- permissive environment. This capability includes the requirement to provide a security force, evacuation control center, recovery force, medical support, and transportation of evacuees. *Show of force operations: engage in show of force operations, to include amphibious demonstrations, presence of forces, or flyovers in support of U.S. interests. *Reinforcement operations: reinforce U.S. (or designated Allied/friendly) forces by helicopter and/or surface means. This includes the capability to conduct relief-in-place or a passage of lines. *Maritime security operations: conduct security operations to protect U.S. (or designated Allied/ friendly nation) property and noncombatants in maritime areas. Forward-operating MEU(SOC)s will be capable of establishing an integrated local security perimeter, screening for explosive devices, and providing personal protection to designated individuals. *Mobile training teams (MTT): provide training to assigned individuals, groups, or units. *Civil‚Äìmilitary operations ‚Äì Humanitarian/civil assistance in disaster relief: provide services such as medical and dental care, minor construction repair to civilian facilities, temporary assistance to local government, and assistance to counter the devastation caused by a manmade or natural disaster. *Tactical deception operations: design and implement tactical deception operations plans in order to deceive the enemy through electronic means, feints, demonstrations, and ruses which cause the enemy to react or fail to react in a manner which assists in the accomplishment of the overall mission. *Fire support control: control and coordinate naval surface fire, air support and ground fire support coordination measures for U.S. or designated Allied/friendly forces. *Counter-intelligence operations: conduct counterintelligence and human intelligence operations that protect the MEU(SOC) against espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and subversion by developing and providing information the commander can use to undertake countermeasures to protect his resources. *Initial terminal guidance (ITG): establish and operate navigational, signal, and/or electronic devices for guiding helicopter and surface waves from a designated point to a landing zone or beach. *Electronic warfare/signals intelligence: conduct tactical SIGINT, limited ground bases EW, and communications security (COMSEC) monitoring and analysis in direct support of the MAGTF. This is accomplished by employing organic collection and direction finding (DF) equipment as well as through connectivity to national and theater SIGINT/EW assets. *Military operations in urban terrain (MOUT): conduct military operations in a built-up area. =MEU- special operations= The Marine Corps does not deploy traditional special operations forces (SOF); the Marine Corps's special operations contribution, the Marine Raider Regiment, is directed by the United States Special Operations Command. Therefore, forward-operating MEU(SOC)s receive enhanced training and are specially equipped and organized to provide selected maritime special purpose capabilities complementary and in support of combat commanders. In addition to the conventional capabilities noted above, MEU(SOC)s will, upon deployment, possess the following skills and capabilities:Marine Corps Order 3120.9B, Policy for Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), (Wash., DC: HQMC, 2001) *Close quarters battle (CQB): conduct direct action missions, employing close quarter battle combat and dynamic assault tactics and techniques. *Direct action: conduct raid, ambush, or direct assault tactics; conduct standoff attacks by fire from air, ground, or maritime platforms; and provide terminal guidance for precision- guided munitions. *Clandestine recovery operations: ability to recovery downed aviation pilots or sensitive materials behind enemy lines; conduct clandestine extraction of personnel or sensitive items from enemy-controlled areas. *Tactical recovery of aircraft, equipment and personnel (TRAP): conduct overland recovery of downed aircraft and personnel, aircraft sanitization, and provide advanced trauma-life support in a benign or hostile environment. *Specialized demolition operations: conduct specialized breaching: to employ specialized demolitions in support of other special operations. This includes an explosive entry capability to support close quarters battle/combat. *In- extremis hostage rescue (IHR): conduct recovery operations during an in- extremis situation by means of an emergency extraction of hostages and/or sensitive items from a non-permissive environment and expeditiously transport them to a designated safe haven. The IHR capability will only be employed when directed by appropriate authority and when dedicated national assets are unavailable. Emphasis is placed on isolation, containment, employment of reconnaissance assets, and preparation for turnover of the crisis site when/if national assets arriveMAGTF Special Operations Capable, Standardization Conference Paper. (Wash., D.C, HQMC: January, 1992); 1 to Encl 4. *Airfield/Ports/Other Key Facilities Seizure: secure an airfield, port, or other key facilities in order to support MAGTF missions or to receive follow- on forces. *Gas and oil platforms operations (GOPLAT): conduct seizure and/or destruction of offshore gas and oil platforms. *Maritime interdiction operations (MIO): conduct MIO in support of visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) operations during day or night on a cooperative, uncooperative, or hostile contact of interest. *Reconnaissance and Surveillance (R&S;): conduct clandestine reconnaissance and surveillance through entry into an objective area by air, surface, or subsurface means in order to perform information collection, target acquisition, and other intelligence collection tasks. Pre-deployment training program (PTP) Every 18-months, all units that are under the Marine air-ground task force's MEFs assemble the MEUs and train them individually within their units, or together in a cohesive exercise. They have one purpose, to become certified special operations capable. The Special Operations Capable Certification process is in three phases: initial, intermediate, and final. Once certified, they are under status as \\"force-in- readiness\\" for 15-months. =Initial training phase= The initial training phase is the phase that focuses on training of individual personnel and small units of the Marine Expeditionary Units. Many Marines attend courses or training schools that may require advancement or additional skills to meet the demand of their unit's quota. Training and exercises by many cooperative cross-service agencies also help set courses of instruction for the MEU's Command Elements, subordinate elements (MSE), and the Maritime Special Purpose Force. Also, staff training is included in the MEU's CE and MSE elements. Because of time constraints and limited training resources, every effort must be made to efficiently use the training time available during this phase.Marine Corps Order 3502.3A, Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) Predeployment Training Program, (Wash, DC: HQMC MCO, 2001) # Expeditionary strike group/Marine expeditionary unit (special operations capable) staff planning course # Operations and intelligence seminar # MEU command element situational training exercises (STX) # Initial training phase \\"at-sea period\\" # Special Operations Training Group (SOTG) special skills courses # Fire support coordination exercise # Interoperability and parallel training: conducted jointly with an Amphibious Squadron and Naval Special Warfare detachment =Intermediate training phase= All the training and exercises that are conducted by the Marine Expeditionary Units while either on pre-deployment, or currently deployed, under a training curriculum, or not deployed operationally are during the Intermediate Training Phase. The purpose of this phase is to build unit cohesion and leadership, and emphasis on functioning as a team. A string of exercises are begun, and a MEU utilizes this time to rehearse for the upcoming Special Operations Capable Exercise that will determine their Special Operations Capable certification. At the beginning of the intermediate training phase, an operational analysis is conducted by the MEU Commander in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the subordinate elements. This will also assist in developing the commander's guidance regarding training priorities. Once developed, the MEU Commander will provide training guidance to improve and sustain the MSE's required capabilities. # Intermediate training phase at sea period: emphasis the training of Gas/Oil Platform (GOPLAT) and Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (VBSS) training. Under unique predeployment or operational circumstances, the MEF Commander can reduce or increase the emphasis on either of the mission. Concurrence on this modification to training will be obtained from Headquarters Marine Corps Plans, Policies and Operations (PP&O;) from the appropriate Commander, Marine Corps Forces. # Long-range night raids: takes place on ground or other structures. # Maritime Special Purpose Force Interoperability Training: following the successful completion of individual and small unit special skills training conducted during the \\"Initial Training Phase\\", the purpose is to consolidate the Command and Control (C&C;), Reconnaissance and Surveillance (R&S;), Assault, Security, and Aviation Assault elements. The training is either conducted locally or off-site. It also proves a logical prerequisite for the TRUEX and opportunity to conduct basic level training with the Amphibious Squadron, Navy Special Warfare Detachment. # Training in urban environment exercise (TRUEX): The TRUEX provides the MEU's elements of the CE, ACE, CSSE, and along with the MSPF, the opportunity for training in unfamiliar built-up environments during urbanized warfare. The MEF's Special Operations Training Group (SOTG) coordinates their training with the municipal, state, and federal officials, such as the local and state police, fire departments, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to make this training as realistic as possible for Marines within the MEU. This Exercise gives the MEU the preparation for any world conflict or peacekeeping/humanitarian operations. Many local towns have participated in the events. TRUEX provides an opportunity to integrate unique individual and small unit, close quarters combat (CQC) skills in conjunction with the MEU's increased proficiency in the rapid response planning process (R2P2), and practice in enhanced urban operations. # Marine expeditionary unit exercise (MEUEX): The MEUEX is the final Intermediate Training Phase exercise that evaluates the MEU's core capabilities before commencing the final test during the Special Operations Capable Exercise, which will determine its certification for special operations. All of the MEU's subordinate units participate in the MEUEX. The primary focus of this exercise is to refine the unit standard operating procedures's and R2P2. In some cases, if possible, the MEUEX is conducted in conjunction with an at-sea period. =Final training phase= The final training phase is the culmination of all predeployment training activities. Its focus is on preparation for the Special Operations Capable Exercise, and predeployment embarkation requirements. # Pre-embarkation Maintenance Stand- Down: This is held before the last scheduled at-sea training period. It allows the MEU time to ensure all equipment is in the highest state of readiness prior to the SOCEX. # Advanced Amphibious Training: During the last scheduled at-sea training period, the Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) and MEU refine their ability to conduct amphibious operations, and conventional and selected maritime special operations capabilities. # Fleet Exercise (FLEETEX) - Supporting Arms Coordination Exercise (SACEX): This is the PHIBRON and MEU's final evaluation of its amphibious warfare, conventional, and selected maritime special operations capabilities prior to SOCEX. # Special Operations Capable Exercise (SOCEX): Final Evaluation and Certification. This is the final test that certifies the MEU to be capable for maritime special operations. It designates the MEU into MEU (Special Operations Capable), or MEU(SOC). # Pre-Overseas Movement (POM): During the POM period, the final preparations for deployment are conducted. The focus is on personnel and equipment readiness. Training and operational deficiencies noted during the SOCEX evaluation are corrected as required. # Crisis Interaction Requirements Exercise (CIREX): The CIREX is a discussion built around a crisis scenario tailored to the PHIBRON and MEU(SOC). It is conducted at Fort Bragg, NC to ensure the maximum exposure of the PHIBRON/MEU personnel to their SOF counterparts. The CIREX enhances PHIBRON and MEU(SOC) understanding of, and interoperability with, Joint Special Operations Command Task Forcess and Elements. Staff members from the PHIBRON and MEU CE and selected members of the MEUs MSEs participate in the CIREX. # Washington, D.C. Area Commanders‚Äô Briefings: During this period select members of the PHIBRON and MEU(SOC) receive briefings from senior United States Department of State, Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Headquarters Marine Corps, and Central Intelligence Agency personnel. Conducting these briefings within the Washington D.C. area ensures the highest level of participation by the organizations and external agencies involved. Other agencies or Unified Combatant Command representatives may be added at the request of the PHIBRON and MEU(SOC) commanders.

Before 2006 (i.e., the formation of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC)), the Marine Corps was the only branch of the Armed Forces that did not have any of its special warfare elements participating in the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), due to confining its special operations capabilities only for the purpose to the Fleet Marine Force.Lieutenant Colonel Giles Kyser, USMC, History as to Why The Marine Corps Did Not Participate in the Standup of SOCOM; Information Paper, (Arlington: HQMC [Code POE-30]): Rev. 5 March 2003), 2. President Ronald Reagan approved the establishment of USSOCOM in April 1987; a month later the other military branches reassigned their own respective special operations forces (SOF) units to the USSOCOM Headquarters in Tampa, Florida at MacDill Air Force Base. However, as the Marine Corps was reluctant to release control of Marine units, its specialized assets assigned to the FMF's Marine Air- Ground Task Forces remained separate and have evolved to fulfill a separate niche of tasks, specific and limited in scope, in direct support of a Marine Expeditionary Unit's commander. This evolution occurred due to the direction of Commandant of the Marine Corps General Alfred M. Gray, who announced on 5 February 1988, that in response to the current and projected realities of the world, they were changing the designations of the Marine Air-Ground Task Forces that constitute its fighting formations. The word \\"amphibious\\" was replaced by \\"expeditionary\\". The new term signified that the Marine Corps would not be limited to amphibious operations but rather would be capable of a wide spectrum of operations in littoral areas around the world, in conventional and unconventional warfare.United States Marine Corps and Special Operations: A Nineteen Year Convergence Toward a Marine Component Because of its status in expeditionary warfare, the Marine Corps fundamentally bases its combative strategy on its ground combat element‚Äîall air/ground elements are primarily organic support to the Marine infantry‚Äîarguing that strategic bombing does not win battles. Its assigned expeditionary roles assigned by the Unified Combatant Command requires it to be fully trained and functional either as a quick reaction or show of force to any place and environment around the globe within 24 hours. To become adaptive to the Fleet Marine Force protocol, it established its own specialized assets to support the Navy/Marine force commanders to suit its maritime (amphibious) light-infantry capabilities. Despite the similarities in name, the label of Special Operations Capable does not refer to the wider concept of Special Operations, such as those undertaken by the United States Special Operations Forces. The Marine Corps' special operations force is the Marine Raider Regiment, which was created in 2006. Active unitsUnited States Marine Corps Reconnaissance Battalions= Recon Battalions are the Special Operations Capable reconnaissance assets of Marine Air-Ground Task Force that provide division-level ground and amphibious reconnaissance to the Ground Combat Element within the United States Marine Corps. Including premier units such as United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance. Division reconnaissance teams are employed to observe and report on enemy activity and other information of military significance in close operations. The Military Occupational Specialty code for Reconnaissance Marine is 0321. = Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company= The Air Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, or ANGLICO, are small Marine units that provide artillery, naval gunfire, close air support for the United States Armed Forces, as well to allied foreign armed forces worldwide. The ANGLICO teams are specialized in forward observation, joint terminal attack controlling, and forward air controlling. They give the Marine Air Ground Task Force commanders a liaison capability with foreign area expertise to plan, coordinate, employ and conduct radio communications for air, sea and land support fire for joint, allied and coalition forces. They also have parachutists used to insert into the battlefield rapidly for observance support. =Chemical Biological Incident Response Force= Chemical Biological Incident Response Force The Chemical Biological Incident Response Force is a rapid response force that is capable of being deployed to a combatant commander or United States Department of State legations and installations, and, when directed by the National Command Authority, anywhere in the world that is affected by chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive (CBRNE) incidents. The force is completely self-contained and self- sufficient, and may also provide coordinating initial relief efforts, security, detection, identification, expert medical advice, and limited decontamination of personnel and equipment. This response force will respond to CBRNE incidents affecting to assist local civilian and military agencies in order to assist the on-scene commander in providing initial post incident consequence management. CBIRF consists of specially trained personnel and specialized equipment suited for operations in a wide range of contingencies. Through search and extraction, decontamination, and medical stabilization, CBIRF capabilities are intended to minimize the effects of a CBRNE incident. =MAGTF Reconnaissance= USMC Amphib Recon Marine reconnaissance are specialized teams that are proficient in special, ground and amphibious reconnaissance to collect intelligence for the commanders within the Marine Air-Ground Task Force to shape the commander's battlespace. The division recon assets conduct recon for battalions and regiments by operating ahead of the forces to scout enemy and other pertinent information. The force recon assets are reserved for the high-echelon of the force commander. Force recon also may be directed to perform direct action operations or other special assignments to the Marine Expeditionary Force. =Marine Special Operations Command= MARSOC emblem The Marine Special Operations Teams (MSOTs), are the Marine Corps's only fully committed, unconventional special operations unit that solely operate independently from the Fleet Marine Force. Their initial role is to provide the Marine Special Operation Command (MARSOC) in direct action, special reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, and foreign internal defense. It first began as MCSOCOM Detachment One and consequently was reformed into a Marine Special Operations Battalion (MSOB). Most of the experienced personnel were from the disbanded FMF's recon companies of 1st and 2nd Force Recon and from a Naval Special Warfare Group; forming the 1st and 2nd MSOB. =Maritime Special Purpose Force= The United States Marine Corps' Maritime Special Purpose Force (MSPF), are specialized sub-units of the Marine Expeditionary Units. They are deployed to give commanders low profile, two-platoon surgical emplacement in accessible littoral regions. The MSPF provides the MEU with rapid direct action capabilities, augmenting or replacing the unavailable Fleet Marine Force's recon platoons. It enables the Marine Corps's only deep recon unit, Force Recon, to continue providing FMF-level intelligence without delay. However, MSPFs can not operate independently of their parent MEU: they rely solely on the MEU for logistics, intelligence, communications, transportation, and fire support. =Special Reaction Teams= The Provost Marshal‚Äôs Special Reaction Teams (SRT) are specialized military policemen that are trained in all aspects of special weapons and tactics. They have the ability to handle special threat situations surpassing normal law enforcement capabilities, such as: isolating a crisis scene, providing proficient marksmanship support, tactically responding from an assembly area to the scene, effecting an entry, and employing clearing techniques. =Fleet Anti- terrorism Security Teams= Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Teams (FAST) are independent, worldwide deployable platoons of specially trained Marines that are prepared to defend against terrorist threats to American interests on extremely short notice. Providing limited duration expeditionary site security to vital national assets, these platoons work directly for the Fleet Admiral of 5th, 6th, and 7th Fleets, and receive tasking via the Department of State or the military Geographic Combatant Commander of the respective region. These platoons are manned by selected infantrymen, commanded by a Captain, and in addition to standard USMC infantry tasks, they are proficient in: precision weapons employment, convoy security, embarked and airfield security, low profile operations, population control measures and riot disbursal, CBRN defense, non-lethal weapons employment, embarkation and self-supporting logistics, fast roping, small arms marksmanship, machine guns and machine gun gunnery, COC operations, satellite communications, and inter-operability with host nation forces, local guard forces, joint, interagency, and allied partners. Their motto is \\"Deter, Detect, Defend\\" and they are nicknamed \\"Gunslingers\\". They are employed frequently in military operations other than war (MOOTW). Inactivated unitsAmphibious Reconnaissance Battalion= FMFPAC Amphib Recon Battalion, 1944 The Amphibious Reconnaissance Company (and later Battalion) were a small group of men that conducted preliminary D-Day amphibious reconnaissance of the planned littoral beaches occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army and Special Naval Landing Forces in the Central Pacific during World War II. They were infantry Marines highly skilled in combat swimming, topography, and hydrographic survey that provided the V Amphibious Corps, which subsequently was redesignated under the Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, vital military intelligence of Japanese enemy forces.Ray W. Stubbe, AARUGHA!: History of Specialized and Force-level Reconnaissance Activities and Units of the United States Marine Corps, 1900‚Äì1974; Fleet Marine Reference Publication 12‚Äì21 (MCB Quantico, HQMC: Historical Division, 1981) =Combined Action Program= Combined Action Program The Combined Action Program (CAP), was a unit that was assembled as a foreign internal defense during the Vietnam War. They were jointly allied with the South Vietnamese Popular Force, providing 'civil protection force' for local villages from the Viet Cong's influence of terrorism, recruiting, and taxation. Later, they were subsequently renamed the \\"Civil Action Platoons\\". The foreign relations between the two allied forces confided the villagers of in-sourcing information. It became one of the major sources of reliable intelligence from allies throughout the war. =Joint Assault Signals Company= The Joint Assault Signals Company (JASCO) were a tri-service of the Army and the Fleet Marine Force (United States Navy/Marine Corps) that provided supporting arms coordination for ground artillery, ships, and aircraft in delivering ordnance. They were highly specialized fire support coordinators for close air and naval gunfire support. =Marine Special Operations Command Detachment One= Marine Detachment One, or MarDet1 The MCSOCOM Detachment One (MarDet 1) was a pilot program to assess the value of Marine special operations forces permanently detached to the United States Special Operations Command. It was commanded by Col. Robert J. Coates, former commanding officer of 1st Force Reconnaissance Company along with Team leader Lt. Lawrence R. Gentile 1st Forecon Jump Master. Det 1 was activated on 19 June 2003 and had its headquarters at Camp Del Mar Boat Basin. It was disbanded in 2006 and succeeded by the permanent Marine Forces Special Operations Command, which is to be a 2700-person command. =Marine Corps Test Unit #1= The Marine Corps Test Unit (MCTU #1) was a battalion-sized unit that was designed to be outside the political and command boundaries of the Fleet Marine Force to test and evaluate innovative methods in maneuvering ground forces that were prone to operating in areas subject to nuclear attacks. They initially developed the techniques for the heliborne assaults that are used in the Army and Navy today. The Test Unit's infantry battalion participated in Desert Rock IV during shot 'Bee'. The reconnaissance platoon in MCTU #1 revolutionized the modern methods of parachute insertions and extractions. The Recon Platoon subsequently became the beginning of Force Reconnaissance. =Observer Group= The Observer Group (precursor to Amphibious Reconnaissance Company) was a joint Army‚ÄìMarine Corps unit that was the first in the United States and the Fleet Marine Force to be organized and trained specifically for amphibious reconnaissance.Bruce F. Meyers, Swift, Silent, and Deadly: Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance in the Pacific, 1942‚Äì1945, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2004). The Observer group experimented in the methodology and equipment in projecting \\"ship-to- shore\\" reconnaissance from the sea before the establishment of the Office of Strategic Services (the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency), the Underwater Demolition Teams, and before the United States Army Special Forces and Air Commandos.Gordon Rottman, Amphibious Operation's Intelligence, (Quantico, VA: 1948) It was also the birth of naval amphibious intelligence. =Parachute battalions= Patch of 1st Parachute Battalion, 1940‚Äì1944 The Paramarines (also known as Marine paratroopers) were specialized units that were trained to parachute into combat. The first Paramarines were trained in October 1940. The Parachute battalions have jumped into hostile territory. They lacked heavy mortar and machine gun support due to the amount of equipment they were able to carry into combat in addition to having limited manpower. They were lightly equipped for many of the missions in the Pacific campaigns during World War II. By 1944, the Parachute Battalions was disbanded, becoming another special operations unit deactivated under the Fleet Marine Force just like the Marine Raiders. =Raider battalions= Insignia of Edson's Raiders, the 1st Raider Battalion, 1942‚Äì1944 The Marine Raiders were elite units established in 1942 by the Marine Corps during World War II to conduct amphibious, light-infantry raiding missions, particularly in landing in rubber boats and operating behind the lines. \\"Edson's Raiders of 1st Marine Raiders Battalion and \\"Carlson's\\" Raiders of 2nd Marine Raiders Battalion are said to be the first United States Special Operations Forces to form and see combat. Many modern raiding methods in the Marine Corps were derived and adopted by both Carlson's and Edson's Raiders, which subsequently the division-level recon scouts continued its long use after they were disbanded in 1944. It became known as direct action (DA) mission of today. Most of the experienced Raiders, along with the Paramarines, soon filled the ranks of division recon companies. =Anti-Terrorism Battalion= The Anti- Terrorism Battalion was a specialized anti-terrorist task unit that possessed organic and supplemental capabilities in military intelligence and counter- intelligence, combat engineers, nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) teams, and advanced riflemen. On short notice, they would have deployed in response to crises during terrorist attacks. They would have also supplemented other NBC agencies as human intelligence exploitation teams (HET).

The United States Marine Corps Reconnaissance Battalions (or commonly called Marine Division Recon) are the reconnaissance assets of Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) that provide division-level ground and amphibious reconnaissance to the Ground Combat Element within the United States Marine Corps. Division reconnaissance teams are employed to observe and report on enemy activity and other information of military significance in close operations. Their capabilities are similar to those of Force Recon, but do not normally insert by parachute, and provide limited direct action, whereas Force Reconnaissance companies perform both deep reconnaissance and direct action operations. Some of these missions are shared by Marine Special Operations Teams, a subordinate part of Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC). History of MAGTF ReconnaissanceThe formation of a doctrine= At the turn of the 20th Century, amphibious reconnaissance as we know it today in the United States Fleet Marine Force (FMF), was first conceived by a Marine officer, then-Major Dion Williams,Dion Williams, Naval Reconnaissance, Instructions for the Reconnaissance of Bays, Harbors, and Adjacent Country, 1906. who formulated the first official (maritime) naval doctrine concerning intelligence gathering for planning of operations; in theaters of amphibious warfare.Naval Reconnaissance Second Edition (1917); Maj. Dion Williams, USMC Williams' doctrine outlined a wide spectrum of reconnaissance, which consisted of: *range determination *topography (configuration of the ground [cities, towns, roads, trails, railroads]) *hydrographic survey of rivers and canals *telegraph cables/lines and wireless telegraphy *resources (coal, repair facilities, land transportation, electric plants, food supplies, water supply, and hospitals) *conditions of the harbor and harbor steamers, wharves, docks, water service *the population (secret service, professions and occupations, naval and military forces) *existing defenses (location, form and description, armament, field-works, mines/mine fields, searchlights, plans and sketches, available garrisons and strength of forces, avenues of attack, adaptability of the defenses) He specified in his thesis that these Marines particularly needed to be competent in surveying, cartography, and recording observations, as well as reading previous maps and surveys of various types. Although there was very little effect in creating a formidable unit because the outset of World War I and the Gallipoli Operations due to the lack of Marine Corp personnel by the Isolationism of 1920-1930s. Also drawbacks concurred while most of the Marine forces were engaged in conflicts of China and Nicaragua. After World War I, three significant aspects of the second edition of Williams' Naval Reconnaissance included: #discussion of additional capabilities of observation from airplanes and submarines #promulgation of the book under authority of the Secretary of the Navy instead of under the auspices of the President of the Naval War College #emphasis on information acquisition for long-term planning. It was this latter emphasis on obtaining information long before hostilities that was perhaps of greatest significance. Rather than obtaining information solely for military operations in progress, Williams now enunciated a more comprehensive mission. The earliest activities in amphibious reconnaissance was largely limited in surveying of ports, uncharted islands and adjacent beaches or coastlines. Most of these duties were billeted by senior Naval Intelligence Officers that were prerequisites in topography, hydrography, impermanent construction of fortification with the means of rapid encampment and mobilization of troops to operate in their area.FMFRP 12-20, Naval Reconnaissance,(4 January 1989), Reprint of BGen William's naval doctrine of 1906. However, another Marine intel officer and amphibious reconnaissance war prophet, Earl H. Ellis, put most of William's concept to effect years later.Maj. Earl Ellis, http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/ref/AdvBaseOps/index.html After fighting in the trenches in WWI, in 1921, Ellis submitted a request to Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) for special intelligence duty in South America and the Pacific, in which he foresaw the built-up of Japanese naval forces that eventually led to the events of World War II; the Director of Naval Intelligence diligently accepted. It was during his special duty that introduced the most profound accounts of Ellis's intelligence reports. He submitted a 30,000 page Top Secret documentOperations Plan 712, Advance Base Operations in Micronesia (28 Jan 21); HisDiv, HQMC, Archives 9558, Box 4, Folder 712 ^ \\"Ellis\\" File, Advanced Base Defense During the Present War, HisDiv, HQMC concerning his detail discussion of local sea, air and the climate, various land terrain types, the native population and economic conditions. He discussed his reports on strategically seizing key islands as forward- operating bases for project naval forces effectively into the area. His time- tables, mobilization projections, and predictions of manpower necessary to seize certain targets. His maritime intelligence reports became paramount years later for the United States maritime forces, during the Pacific campaigns of World War II. =Testing the doctrine= In the 1920s and 1930s, the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) first tested Williams' conceptual methods of reconnaissance in the fourth series of the Fleet Landing Exercises (FLEX) in the Caribbean; for evaluation in establishing a naval reconnaissance doctrine for the Marine Corps. By 7 December 1933, the Fleet Marine Force was formed at HQMC in Quantico, VA, combining the roles of the Navy and Marine Corps into an integrated maritime (naval) assault force. Shortly after, a new naval doctrine, the Fleet Training Publication 167FTP 167, Landing Operations Doctrine, Office of Naval Operations, Division of Fleet Training, United States Navy, 1938 was created to ensure long-term purposes. Although the subsequent tests encompassed more broadly in combined amphibious/ground reconnaissance efforts, its aerial reconnaissance elements cannot be overlooked since aircraft were both tested for direct combat support and reconnaissance. The aviation reconnaissance assets did not see further scrutiny until the outset of the Korean War. Before World War II, the first radars were developed for anti-aircraft purposes. These were soon followed by fire control radars for ships and coastal artillery batteries. However, it wasn't until decades later that improvements to technology proved that radar systems were capable of locating artillery guns. =Patrons of the doctrine=From 'sea-to-shore' The Marine Corps established its first specialized ground/amphibious reconnaissance unit, the \\"Observer Group\\", in 1941, which was formed for the upcoming secretive mission in North Africa (in preparation for Operation Torch)‚Äîunder the command of Captain James L. Jones Sr. The unit was composed of skilled and highly proficient swimmers from the Army, Navy, and the Marine Corps. Momentarily, the Observer Group was ordered to be decommissioned, but not completely dissolved; the Marine unit was re- institutionalized as the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company. The remaining Army and Navy counterparts formed the \\"Scouts and Raiders\\" and continued its deployment to North Africa as planned.Bruce F. Meyers, Swift, Silent, and Deadly: Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance in the Pacific, 1942-1945, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2004). The Scouts and Raiders are the predecessor to the Navy Combat Demolition Units (NCDU), which subsequently became the Underwater Demolition Teams‚Äîthe patrons of the prestigious Navy SEALs. Preliminary‚ÄîGround operations The Amphibious Reconnaissance Company (still under command of Capt. James Jones) was directed to report to the joint-Navy and Army's Amphibious Corps, Pacific Fleet (ACPF). The United States Navy controlled many joint units of the Army and the Marine Corps. These units represented the sum total of the amphibious forces of the United States, with the exception of small units of the Fleet Marine Force, which had been trained for amphibious raids. The Amphib Recon Company was tasked to provide preliminary reconnaissance for the force commander of the ACPF. Marine Amphib Recon \\"Jack\\" patch By 1943, the Army ceded their role of amphibious assaults to the Navy and Marine Corps. Subsequently, the Marine subordinate units of the ACPF were re-designated under the full command of the Marine Corps's V Amphibious Corps (VAC)‚Äîand the Amphibious Reconnaissance Company shifted alongside under its new command. In the next following years, the Company increased in manpower and the brevity of upcoming missions, forcing it to be re-designated to full battalion-strength with two active reconnaissance companies; becoming the \\"Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion\\". To include, VAC shifted its command under the Fleet Marine Force. Prior to the arrival of Marines in this area of the Pacific War, the Australians had already established a network of deep reconnaissance agents known as the Australian Coastwatchers. They operated not only on coasts, but deep in jungles as well. Initially, some Marines became part of the unit.E. A. Feldt, \\"Coastwatching in World War II,\\" (U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings: September 1961) 87:9; pgs 72‚Äî79. Although, the force commanders of the VAC weren't the only ones to see the true value of ground and amphibious reconnaissance. The subordinate units of the Marine division and regiments resorted to their own avenues of reconnaissance methods. The I Marine Amphibious Corps (I MAC) and III Marine Amphibious Corps (III MAC) approached its reconnaissance assets more differently than the V Amphibious Corps's (VAC) Reconnaissance platoons. The amphibious reconnaissance platoons of VAC were more associated to preliminary and amphibious reconnaissance, whereas the division and regimental commanders equated their decision-making process using terrestrial reconnaissance. Reconnaissance-in-force operations In 1941, Lieutenant Colonel William \\"Wild Bill\\" Whaling, the executive officer of 5th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, established visualized and perceived the use for specialized missions encompassing reconnaissance at the division-level, which would be conducted above the normal infantry battalion-level in scouting and patrolling.Bruce F. Meyers, Swift, Silent, and Deadly: Marine Amphibious Reconnaissance in the Pacific, 1942-1945, (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2004). He recommended to General Alexander Vandegrift the need of a special \\"Scout and Sniper unit\\" for the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal. Soon after, each of the three rifle companies that were used during the Guadalcanal campaign were tasked in sending one their best field craft Marines to devise the scout-sniper unit, with each regiment containing a Scout and Sniper Platoon, within the regimental headquarters and service company. Momentarily, the regiments requested their scouts to be heavily reinforced with tanks for rapid mobility and increased firepower, to allow their scouting parties to determine a hasty, yet accurate account of their enemies potential and strengths‚Äîusing a technique known as reconnaissance-in-force (RIF). RIF elicits determination of strength by offensively provoking the enemy for a reaction. The close of World War II discontinued the use of amphibious reconnaissance, and momentarily the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion dismantled; all amphibious reconnaissance subsidiaries were under the direct control of the only-remaining division-level reconnaissance assets‚Äîending force-level reconnaissance. Close-distant operations The \\"Scout (Tank) and Sniper\\" companies later formed the Division Recon Battalions and Scout Sniper Platoons of today. By early-1980s, the Light Armored Reconnaissance units were formed to provide mechanized reconnaissance-in-force for infantry regiments. The responsibilities of the LAR battalions resemble those of the Scout (Tank) companies of World War II. It wasn't until the highlight of the Korean War that foresaw the re-establishment of force-level reconnaissance; however, only 2nd Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion was created (1st Amphib Recon Bn remained inactive-only to be used as for training new amphibious reconnaissance candidates) in support of the Marine task force commanders' effort in pushing the Socialist Chinese forces north, from South Korea. Deep operations The Korean War introduced the new concept of using rotary-wing aircraft to the Marine Corps in combat employment for logistics and rapid troop transport. During the mid-1950s, a recon test platoon from the Marine Corps Test Unit#1 experimented in various parachute insertions for deeper reconnaissance and pathfinding. In 1957, the command staff of the Recon Platoon, MCTU#1 relinquished the command of 1st Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion and formed the 1st Force Reconnaissance Company. When the Force Recon companies were established, they allowed the Fleet Marine Force commanders to obtain information quicker than the slower, processed intelligence that was provided by the division recon platoons, which went through each of the battalion's, regiment's, and division's intelligence sections before reaching the force level. However, like the fate of the Marine Raiders and the Paramarines of World War II, 1st and 2nd Force Reconnaissance companies were disbanded, albeit temporarily, to make way for the Fleet Marine Force's 'first' unconventional asset that was created within the new Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC). The force reconnaissance companies were replaced under the command of the Marine Division's reconnaissance battalions while maintaining deep reconnaissance and force-oriented reconnaissance under the Fleet Marine Force. MARSOC absorbs much of the unconventional operations for which Force Recon had been responsible, allowing the force recon platoons to fully exercise their initial role of providing deep and preliminary reconnaissance to the Command Element of MAGTF without interference. Signals intelligence operations By 1986, new counter-battery radars were introduced. These radars were able to locate many artillery batteries simultaneously. In latter, the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan requested for a small, counter-mortar radar, given 360 degree coverage and requiring a minimal crew, for use in forward operating bases. In another back to the future step it has also proved possible to add counter-battery software to battlefield airspace surveillance radars. MAGTF Security Operations :This section incorporates text from the United States Military access site. Security operations reduces risk to operating Marine forces from unknown avenues that may conflict in any tactical situation; it encompasses surprise attacks from the enemy, counter-intelligence, and deception in the friendly forces' capabilities and intentions. In relation, reconnaissance operations support security operations by providing information on enemy forces, capabilities and intentions, and by denying the enemy information of friendly activities through counter-reconnaissance. Through succession, security operations are usually integrated with its reconnaissance operations; in which force commanders acquire during offensive, defensive and other tactical operations. It greatly improves their decision-making process due to the collected information that is much needed to develop situational awareness and commander critical information requirements (CCIR). The CCIR are designed to feed important, time-sensitive information to the commander so he can make a decision that should dramatically affect the battlespace. The CCIR is collectively, a comprehensive list of high-prioritized information in which a force commander identifies as critical. It is much required to influence and facilitate timely information management and the decision-making process that may help dictate successful mission accomplishment. CCIR is divided into two key sub-components: \\"critical friendly force information\\" and \\"priority intelligence requirements\\". =Reconnaissance planning= Reconnaissance supports the MAGTF commander's intent and his CCIRs. While contributing to the commander's broad situational awareness and development, reconnaissance assets tailor their efforts to support the specific CCIRs indicated by the commander's intent and subsequent unit intelligence and operations planning. Simultaneously, reconnaissance forces must remain alert to any developments that may cause the commander to reassess that intent. MAGTF reconnaissance assets are best employed early to support the CCIRs and friendly course of action development and selection. When reconnaissance is initiated early in the planning cycle, planning and execution are driven by the flow of solid, timely information and intelligence. If reconnaissance is delayed, situation development will generally be more uncertain. In this case, planning and execution can either take place in an information vacuum or be driven by the search for such information. Reconnaissance assets are best employed in general support. Because of the nature of warfare, MAGTF reconnaissance units will most likely be employed in rapidly developing and fluid situations. The main effort may shift quickly from one subordinate element to another. Such situations often require modifications or complete changes in reconnaissance elements‚Äô missions. The MAGTF commander and his staff are usually the most capable of determining the best use of MAGTF reconnaissance assets at any given time, to provide the necessary support, and to integrate the results of reconnaissance information with other intelligence sources. Although placing reconnaissance assets in direct support of some subordinate element or even attaching them to specific units is occasionally appropriate, in general, such support relationships make for inefficient use of specialized reconnaissance forces. Proper planning; the institution of flexible, responsive command and control and intelligence reporting procedures and networks; and clear intelligence reporting and dissemination priorities will ensure that the products of reconnaissance are shared to the maximum benefit of all potential users. Reconnaissance requires adequate time for detailed planning and preparation. Most reconnaissance focuses on the enemy's activities and intentions to satisfy the commander's need to exploit the enemy's vulnerabilities or to attack his center of gravity. This frequently necessitates operating in and around the enemy's most critical and best defended areas. This normally requires that reconnaissance be conducted over long distances and well in advance of commencement of the operations it will support. These conditions usually dictate specialized methods of transportation, communications and information systems support, combat service support, equipment, and coordination. MAGTF Reconnaissance Assets USMC Amphib Recon logo All Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) elements uses its own unique reconnaissance capabilities; the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) utilizes aerial reconnaissance, but the Command Element (CE) and the Ground Combat Element (GCE) operate in combined amphibious/ground reconnaissance. =Command Element=Force Reconnaissance The Force Reconnaissance companies report to the Command Element of the MAGTF.Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication 1-0, \\"Marine Corps Operations,\\" (HQMC, 2001) They are used for retaining any information that are held in deep operations under conventional warfare. They are very proficient in various entry and recovery methods in heliborne and waterborne techniques to insert behind enemy lines either by High-Altitude/Low (or High) Opening parachute landings; or combatant diving in submarine surface and subsurface methods. This ensures they achieve and maintain stealth in order to avoid compromising their mission. The Fleet Marine Force's detachable force reconnaissance platoons can operate independently from the support Marine Expeditionary Units if needed, making them special operations capable in forward-operated areas. Because the division reconnaissance assets are heavily tasked in providing regiment commanders vital information; the force commander's intelligence staff are able to make the necessary preparations or changes in the future, shaping the battlespace. It is mainly due because the division-level intelligence may not be retrieved at a fast pace for adjusting the needs of the force commander. Also, force-level reconnaissance is retained under the direct control of the force commander, enabling him to send his force recon assets at his will. This may include non-reconnaissance avenues, such as direct action operations under the commander's proposal; similar methods performed by special operations forces of USSOCOM. NOTE: Both 1st and 2nd Force Reconnaissance companies were deactivated in c. 2006. Two platoons from [1st Force Reconnaissance Company] and [2nd Force Recon Company] were moved to 1st and 2nd Reconnaissance Battalions respectively to create a Deep Reconnaissance Company. The deep reconnaissance companies in 1st and 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion were redesignated as Force Reconnaissance Company, I MEF, Force Reconnaissance Company, II MEF and Force Reconnaissance Company, III MEF in 2008, within the 1st, 2nd and 3d Marine Division Reconnaissance Battalions to maintain deep reconnaissance and direct action raid capabilities within I MEF, II MEF and III MEF Radio Battalion The Radio Reconnaissance Platoons provides ground-based signals intelligence, electronic warfare, communications security monitoring, and special intelligence communications capability to support MAGTF operations. It plans and coordinates the employment of its subordinate elements, to include radio reconnaissance elements beyond the Forward Edge of Battle Area and mobile electronic warfare support system in light armored vehicles. It is the focal point for MAGTF ground-based signals intelligence operations. Remote sensors and imagery interpretation The intelligence battalion provides remote sensor, imagery interpretation, and geospatial [topographic] intelligence (GEOINT) support to MAGTF operations. In addition to the sensor control and management platoon (SCAMP), the force imagery interpretation unit, and the topographic platoon, the intelligence company establishes and mans the MAGTF's surveillance and reconnaissance center. It plans, executes, and monitors MAGTF reconnaissance operations. Counterintelligence and human intelligence The intelligence battalion provides human intelligence (HUMINT), counterintelligence (CI), and interrogator-translator support to MAGTF operations. This support can include screening and interrogation/debriefing of prisoners of war and persons of intelligence interest; conduct of CI force protection source operations; conduct of CI surveys and investigations; preparation of CI estimates and plans; translation of documents; and limited exploitation of captured material. In addition to the specialized CI and interrogator-translator platoons, the company employs task-organized HUMINT Exploitation Teams (HET) in direct support of MAGTF subordinate elements. The HET combine CI specialists and interrogator-translators in one element, thereby providing a unique and comprehensive range of CI/HUMINT services. The U.S. Army is also deriving their own version of HETs, these teams will derive most of their doctrine from the Marine version with a few changes. =Ground Combat Element= The Ground Combat Element (GCE) has substantial organic reconnaissance support assets. Any units in contact with the enemy, especially patrols, are among the most reliable sources of information. Division Reconnaissance The Marine Corps's Division Reconnaissance conduct reconnaissance in close operations to gather enemy intelligence at the division staff-level. The mission of division reconnaissance is to provide immediate tactical reconnaissance and surveillance (R&S;) to the GCE of MAGTF, whether it be amphibious or ground reconnaissance. Division recon, like force reconnaissance, is employed to observe and report on enemy activity and other information of military significance. In current theaters of operation they rely mostly on rapid mobilization via motor transport, traversing ahead of major Marine forces for intelligence contingency for division, regimental, or battalion commanders. Division reconnaissance mainly do not operate in deep operations, they support the Marine (infantry) regiments by providing and ground reconnaissance to Marine division [or regimental and battalion] commanders within the MAGTF's subordinate MEU; in contrast to force recon who supports the force commanders of the Fleet Marine Force and its subordinate MEF in deep reconnaissance and direct action missions. Counterbattery Radar Counterbattery Radar (CBR) platoons are located within the headquarters battery of the artillery regiment. The CBR Platoon's primary mission is to locate enemy rocket, mortar, and artillery weapons and process all acquired enemy locations in a timely manner for counter-fire and intelligence purposes. Secondary missions that can be assigned by the supported artillery unit are adjusting or registering artillery. They are normally employed as a unit and controlled by the regimental artillery commander. The CBR platoon commander coordinates the employment of radars operating under regimental control. Information on enemy order of battle and locations derived from counter-battery radar detections are reported to the Ground Combat Element and the Command Element of MAGTF. Light Armored Reconnaissance The division Light Armored Reconnaissance battalions provides the Ground Combat Element with its light armored reconnaissance capability by operating in forward areas or along the flanks of Marine ground forces. Initially, they are usually used to provide early warning of contact by hostile forces, acting as the 'mechanized' reconnaissance-in-force, but they are capable of a wide variety of missions due to their inherent mobility and organic firepower; such as quick reaction forces, and counter-insurgency support. Scout-Sniper and Surveillance, Target, and Acquisition Scout Sniper Platoons are organic collection support assets to each infantry battalion. They are highly skilled in marksmanship, reconnaissance and surveillance, and target acquisition. Every Marine Scout Sniper can deliver long-range precision fire on selected targets from concealed positions. Although the platoon can be employed in support of a myriad of tactical missions in defensive and offensive operations, they are primarily employed to provide timely surveillance and tactical data and coordinate supporting arms and close air support. The Scout Sniper Platoon provides the infantry battalion with extended area observation. The Scout Sniper may be attached to the division and FMF reconnaissance companies. =Aviation Combat Element= The capability of the ACE to observe the battlefield and report in near-real time gives the MAGTF commander a multidimensional capability that should be used at every opportunity. Aviation combat units can view the entire AO in depth, providing early indications and warning and reconnaissance information that can be essential to the success of the MAGTF. Each ACE aircraft (rotary- or fixed-wing), can conduct visual observation of terrain and enemy forces that it may fly over. Given the combined arms capability of the MAGTF, these aircraft can engage enemy targets immediately or direct other supporting arms against the enemy forces. The ACE manages the following reconnaissance systems. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs provide day-night, real-time imagery reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition. Its unique capabilities can also be used to support real-time target engagement, assisting in the control of fires/supporting arms and maneuver. The UAV provides high quality video imagery for artillery or naval gunfire adjustment, battle damage assessment, and reconnaissance over land or sea. It is capable of both day and night operations using TV or forward-looking infrared cameras. UAV squadrons are under the ADCON of the ACE. The MAGTF commander retains OPCON because of the limited number of UAV assets and the critical reconnaissance capabilities they provide to the entire force. Mission tasking is exercised through the surveillance and reconnaissance center. Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System The F/A-18D can be equipped with the advanced tactical airborne reconnaissance system and the Radar Upgrade Phase II with synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The advanced tactical airborne reconnaissance system is a real-time digital package providing day/night, all- weather imagery capability. The imagery collected provides sufficient detail and accuracy to permit delivery of appropriate air and ground weapons, assist with battle damage assessment, and provide tactical commanders with detailed information about the enemy's weapons, units, and disposition. Imagery resulting from collection can be digitally disseminated to the force imagery interpretation unit tactical exploitation group for exploitation, printing, and dissemination. Electronic reconnaissance and warfare Aerial electronic reconnaissance and electronic warfare is conducted using EA-6B aircraft. EA-6B aircraft also process and disseminate information from digital tape recordings obtained during electronic warfare missions to update and maintain enemy electronic order of battle information. The sensors are passive systems that require threat emitters to be active to collect. =Combat Service Support Element= As the CSSE is often in more direct contact with the indigenous population, it can collect HUMINT unavailable to the other MAGTF elements. For example, medical battalion personnel can often provide information on health conditions and their potential impact on operations. The CSSE is limited in its reconnaissance capabilities, having no dedicated reconnaissance capabilities. However, it can conduct road and route reconnaissance with its convoys, and military police. Combat engineers are excellent sources of information. These engineer units often conduct Engineer reconnaissance of an area and can provide detailed reporting on lines of communications; i.e., roads, rivers, railroad lines, bridges, and obstacles to maneuver. Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsman The Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsmen are Navy combat medics, active members of a division or force recon platoons, that are trained in every aspect in the Marine Corps reconnaissance community. They provide advanced life support skills to casualties that are associated in underwater diving and parachute injuries, and hazards of the maritime and amphibious environments. The independent duty corpsmen (IDC) are assigned to the independently operated FMF Reconnaissance (Force Recon) companies, as the Special Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsmen (SARCs). National and theater assets The MAGTF can draw on the full range of national, theater, joint, other service, and allied reconnaissance assets. When made available, these capabilities will be fully integrated into MAGTF reconnaissance operations; e.g., Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS), Navy SEALS or Army signals intelligence aircraft. During forcible entry operations, the MAGTF integrates its amphibious reconnaissance capabilities with national, theater, and special operating forces. The Marine Corps component will support the MAGTF by monitoring the status of MAGTF reconnaissance requests to national and theater entities. The component coordinates the provision of Marine intelligence liaison to the joint task force and other component intelligence elements to satisfy the MAGTF's requirements. Some MAGTF reconnaissance assets, such as the radio battalion and the CI/HUMINT company, will usually have direct connectivity with appropriate external agencies to coordinate tasking or support.

They produced Silk 700S two-stroke motorcycles until 1979. Problems with spare parts and rising costs led to the company ceasing manufacture. History Silk was founded in the late 1960s by George Silk, a Scott motorcycle enthusiast who worked for Derbyshire Scott specialist Tom Ward. George Silk developed a racing motorcycle by fitting a Scott engine into a Spondon frame. Following some success with a Silk Special at the Barbon Hill Climb in 1970, Silk began planning a road-going prototype with his business partner Maurice Patey. They set up Silk Engineering and began providing a spares and repair service for Scott motorcycle owners. They also offered a range of modifications to improve the reliability and performance of Scotts, as well as improving the lubrication and gas flow. Silk exhibited the prototype at the Racing and Sporting Motorcycle Show in London in 1971. Orders exceeded his capability to produce them but he hand-built 21 Silk-Scott Specials between 1971 and 1975. The supply of Scott engines was limited, therefore customers were asked to find their own. Matt Holder, who had bought the rights to the Scott engines, disputed the use of the Scott trademark and prevented Silk from making Scott engines under licence, forcing Silk to develop his own. A new two stroke engine was developed by David Midgelow (from Rolls-Royce engineering) and George Silk, and they had assistance from two-stroke expert Gordon Blair of Queen's University, Belfast, who optimised the porting with the aid of specialist computer programs. The Silk 700S SILK 700S The Silk 700S was launched in 1975 and featured the new engine in a steel tubular frame made by Spondon Engineering of Derbyshire, who also made the forks, yokes, disc/drum brakes and rotors. Priced at ¬£1,355 it was the most expensive production motorcycle of the time. The 700S continued to be developed at the Darley Abbey works in Derbyshire, along with the SPR Production Racing version. Production was slow, with just two motorcycles a week coming off the production line. Customers could select from five colour schemes ‚Äì British Racing Green, metallic blue or green, black with gold coachlines or plain red. There was also a Scott special edition in purple and cream ‚Äì and a special scheme similar to Silk Cut cigarettes, which were popular at the time. The engine had no water pump, using instead a thermo-syphon cooling system. Coolant in the cylinder jackets absorbed engine heat and rose convectively via a rubber tube to the radiator. The cooled liquid was denser and sank through another tube to the base of the cylinders. (The thermo-syphon system was used in early cars and static engines, but became insufficient as power outputs increased. However, the system worked well enough in the Scott engine). The final drive chain was fully enclosed, with the upper and lower runs being encased in \\"telescopic\\" rubber gaiters. The Silk Engineering company was taken over by the Kendal-based Furmanite International Group in 1976 who continued production of the Silk 700S and in 1977 it was upgraded to the 700S Mk2, which Silk called the Sabre. Improvements from the Mk 1 included finned cylinder barrels, a redesigned seat, instruments and rear light nacelle. Porting and timing revisions plus a higher compression boosted power to a more respectable 48 hp, but the price continued to rise. In 1978 the 100th Silk motorcycle was produced and production continued until December 1979 when Silk realised they were losing ¬£200 with every motorcycle sold. Silk 500 The last Silk motorcycle ever built was Clive Worrall's 500 cc model based on a prototype that was never produced. It was used as a competition prize for Classic Bike magazine. Silk 350 The Silk 350 was a two-stroke Trials prototype that was developed but never made it into production.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 892. The Department of Defense reports that he was born on 14 March 1969, in Omaron, Tunisia. He is a Tunisian-born German, working in the restaurant industry, when he was captured by unknown Iranian authorities and handed over to the CIA after traveling to Pakistan in 1999 to study with the Jamaat al-Tablighi missionary group.Worthington, Andy. The Guantanamo Files, 2007 He was held in a Black site as a ghost prisoner, before being transferred to Guantanamo. According to a report on the CIA's use of torture prepared by the Senate Intelligence Committee, al Hami was one of the CIA's captives who interrogators tortured without first getting authorization. Background Al Hami is an Arab, who lived for several years in Europe, before traveling to Afghanistan. He acknowledged that he had lived and traveled in Europe using forged identity documents, and had, at times, supported himself by selling illegal drugs. As tensions between the USA and Iran have grown in recent years it is forgotten that Iran was an early tacit ally of the United States, transferring approximately a dozen suspects, including al Hami, to US custody. Iran captured him in January 2002. When the Supreme Court ruled, in 2004, in Rasul v. Bush, that the Bush administration did, after all, have to provide captives an opportunity to learn why they were being held, two of the three unclassified allegations offered as justifications for his detention focused around his attendance at the Khalden training camp in December 2000. According to the allegations, Khalden was an al Qaeda training camp. Khalden however, predates al Qaeda by over a decade, and is reported to have remained independent until the Taliban shut it down to accommodate Osama bin Laden, who was jealous of camps that he regarded as his rivals. Al Hami acknowledged, in his testimony before his Combatant Status Review Tribunal, that he had confessed to attending the Khalden camp in December 2000‚Äîbut claimed he only acknowledged attending this camp because he was being tortured. Al Hami has a writ of habeas corpus and two protective orders filed on his behalf. One protective order requires the government giving his lawyers thirty days notice of any plans to transfer him, because Kessler agreed he had a reasonable fear of torture, if he were to be repatriated to Tunisia. The other protective order requires the government to preserve any remaining evidence that he had been subjected to torture or abuse. Combatant Status Review Initially the Bush administration asserted they could withhold the protections of the Geneva Conventions from captives in the \\"War on Terror\\", while critics argued the Conventions obligated the United States to conduct competent tribunals to determine the status of prisoners. mirror Subsequently, the US Department of Defense instituted Combatant Status Review Tribunals, to determine whether the captives met the new definition of an \\"enemy combatant\\". From July 2004 through March 2005, a CSRT was convened to make a determination whether each captive had been correctly classified as an \\"enemy combatant\\".OARDEC, Index to Transcripts of Detainee Testimony and Documents Submitted by Detainees at Combatant Status Review Tribunals Held at Guantanamo Between July 2004 and March 2005, September 4, 2007 These hearings would allow Guantanamo detainees to challenge their ‚Äúenemy combatant‚Äù status and ultimately their detention. On 3 March 2006, in response to a court order from Jed Rakoff, the Department of Defense published a three-page summarized transcript from his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. Al Hami chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.Summarized transcripts (.pdf), from Rafiq Bin Bashir Bin Jalud Al Hami's Combatant Status Review Tribunal - pages 20-22 Most detainees' transcripts contain a reading of the allegations against them. Al Hami's transcript does not. Unlike most detainee's transcripts, al Hami's recorder only recorded summaries of his answers. The questions put to him were not recorded. The transcript shows al Hami was captured while carrying a false Italian passport with a Pakistani visa and 200DM. He is suspected of having been a member of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, attending Khalden in December 2000 for training on the AK-47 and SKS, as well as heavy artillery and anti-aircraft weapons, but currently denies it. = Administrative Review Board = Detainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them \\"enemy combatants\\" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention. =First annual Administrative Review Board hearing in 2005= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for his first annual Administrative Review Board on 25 January 2005. The two page memo listed ten \\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\\" and six \\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\\". The following primary factors favor continued detention The following primary factors favor release or transfer Transcript Al Hami chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing. =Second annual Administrative Review Board hearing in 2006= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for his second annual Administrative Review Board on 27 January 2006. The four page memo listed twenty-seven \\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\\" and eleven \\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\\". =Third annual Administrative Review Board hearing in 2007= A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for his third annual Administrative Review Board on 12 February 2007. The four page memo listed twenty-seven \\"primary factors favor[ing] continued detention\\" and eleven \\"primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer\\". Medical records On 16 March 2007, the Department of Defense published records of al Hami's weight. His in-process weight (7 February 2003) was 155 lbs. As of 2 December 2006, his weight was 173 lbs. Habeas corpus petition A habeas corpus petition, Alhami v. Bush, was filed on behalf of al Hami and at least one other captive, in early 2005, before US District Court Judge Gladys Kessler. In September 2007, the Department of Defense published the unclassified dossiers arising from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 179 captives. Al Hami's dossier was not published with the others. On 10 June 2006, the Department of Defense reported that three captives died in custody. The Department of Defense stated the three men committed suicide. Camp authorities called the deaths \\"an act of asymmetric warfare\\", and suspected plans had been coordinated by the captive's attorneys‚Äîso they seized all the captives' documents, including the captives' copies of their habeas documents. Since the habeas documents were privileged lawyer-client communication the Department of Justice was compelled to file documents about the document seizures. Al Hami's privileged attorney-client communications were among those seized.

Galician, mainly Polish, peasants killed ca. 1000 noblemen and destroyed ca. 500 manors in 1846. He represented his village in an extended conflict with its unjust lord and was arrested and lashed several times. During the 1846 rebellion, instigated by Vienna, Szela became the leader of the Galician peasants, destroyed a number of manors, and killed, among others, the family of his lord, though he is reported to have saved the children. Szela tried to organize an all-Galician peasant uprising, with the main slogan of corvee refusal. The rebellious villages were pacified by the Austrian Army. After pacification of the rebellious villages by the Austrian Army, Szela was briefly arrested, and then resettled to Bukovina, where he was given a land grant by the Austrian government in Bukovina. He is also said to have received a medal from the Austrian government, an event reported as fact by Magosci et al. but played down as only a \\"Polish rumor\\" by Wolff. Szela was portrayed sympathetically by Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, a Czech-born Austrian writer who had serfs before 1848, in her short story ‚ÄúJakob Szela‚Äù in Dorf- und Schlossgeschichten (1883). The massacre of the gentry in 1846 was the historical memory that haunted Stanis≈Çaw Wyspia≈Ñski's play The Wedding.

The population in 2011 was 4,068,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 16.90 km¬≤.√Åreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e pa√≠s History Archaeological remnants dating back to the Roman era presuppose a minor community within the territory of Sangalhos. The pre-Roman peoples of the region of the Vouga was already a mixture of races and cultures from the northern Europe and Mediterranean, but principally of Celtic or Turduli. The origin of its name sangalhos, which refers to a unit of measure, as hypothesized by Joaquim de Silveira, came from the cult of S√£o Galo (Sanctus Gallus). The author placed the origin of its parish in the 7th century, during the Visigothic period. During the Roman era, the area was part of the Roman civitas Talabriga (Marnel, Lamas do Vouga). The first documents that refer to Sangalhos date back to 957 A.D., and progress until the founding of the Portuguese Kingdom. In 1064, with the conquest of Coimbra, the lands of the Bairrada were liberated from the Moors. The hamlet of Sangalhos, appropriated by Count Sesnando, first and illustrious governor of Coimbra, was donated to the Church (and Hospital) of Mirleos, founded in the city of Mondego. But, by 1220-1221, during the administrative inquiries, Sangalhos and its parish Church of S√£o Vicente, had already passed into the hands of the Crown. During this era, the parish consisted of two metropoles: its seat, Sangalhos do Pa√ßo (et alio Sancto Galios), and Sangalhos da Igreja (Sancto Galios), in addition to the localities of Saima, S√°, Casal da Rua and Avel√£s de Caminho The great monasteries of Lorv√£o, Vacari√ßa, and Santa Clara de Coimbra dominated the activities in the region of the Bairrada. Santa Clara de Coimbra, founded by nun Mor Dias at the beginning of the 14th century, in who the patronage and lands of Sangalhos was entrusted after 1338. The first years were turbulent for the nun, who although a nun in the Order of the Holy Cross, was not supported by royal and Crusader donations. The intervention of Queen Elizabeth of Aragon, assisted resolving these disputes, and provided the authorization to build a new monastery in the name of Santa Clara and Santa Isabel. In the 12th and 13th century, Sangalhos was one of the principal towns in the region, along with Horta (Tamengos), Recard√£es and √ìis da Ribeira. It was selected by Afonso Henriques to be a test area for the use of the alqueire unit of measure in the distribution and productivity of lands. The alqueire, equivalent to Roman (8.733 litres), was adopted by the King around 1179, the same year that forals were bestowed on Coimbra, Santar√©m and Lisbon. In the archbishopric of Vouga and bishopric of Oporto, the Henriquino alqueire began to be referred to as the Sangalhos, sangalh√™s or sangalho. It was only in the 16th century, that this unit of measure fell into disuse, during King Manuel I of Portugal's reforms (although the reference continued to be used by many rural farmers). In 1320, the church of S√£o Vicente de Sangalhos was the most active church in the Bairrada and Baixo Vouga region. Until the Middle Ages it was the municipal seat of its own territory (its foral was officially conferred in 1514 by King Manuel I of Portugal, during the King's administrative reorganization), although Avel√£s do Caminho continued be a religious dependency of Sangalhos until the 19th century. By 1338, the land in Sangalhos was donated to the monastery of Santa Clara de Coimbra. This institution, which possessed the land during the next 500 years, was the primary motivator for settlement. As a result, Amoreira da G√¢ndara, Fogueira, Paraimo and S√£o Jo√£o, all mentioned in the Manuelino foral, were increasingly active hamlets. As a component of the larger Archdiocese of Vouga, it was ruled by the Bishop of Coimbra, until it was later incorporated into Diocese of Aveiro (1774). By 1623, the monastery of Santa Clara de Coimbra received rents from 300 families and individuals working those lands; an area that included 2000 ha of semi- forested lands. By 1720, those rents had been significant enough to allow the construction of new chapel to the church through only one year's rents. When Sangalhos reverted to a civil parish in the 16th century, it was incorporated into the burgh of Vouga, that also pertained to the municipality of Marnel, thus integrating Sangalhos into the comarca of Aveiro. Sangelhos became a regional military outpost, whose territory included many of the local parishes of the modern municipalities of Anadia, Oliveira do Bairro and √Ågueda. Divided in four companies, it was one of the more extensive military Captaincies of the region. After the Liberal Wars (1820‚Äì1835), the donation to the monastery of Santa Clara de Coimbra was annulled and the municipalities of Sangalhos and Avel√£s do Caminho (which became an independent parish within Anadia) became extinct. Similarly, the military Captaincy of Sangalhos was discontinued and Sangalhos became integrated into the municipality of Oliveira do Bairro, later S√£o Louren√ßo do Bairro and, finally (1853), within the municipality of Anadia. As such, although geographically close to the neighboring city of Oliveira do Bairro, the parish was integrated into Anadia. By 1928, Amoreira da G√¢ndara separated from Sangalhos to form a new parish. Although the parish lost much of its politico-administrative importance, Sangalhos until the 20th century, prospered. Its inhabitants built many prosperous businesses that influenced the growth and development of the community, including pioneering bicycle production in Portugal and ceramics industry. Consequently, Sangalhos returned to the status of town in 1985 (Decrete-Law 65/85, 25 September). Geography Sangalhos is situated along a summit that overlooks the valley of the C√©rtima River, an area of ample vistas and vegetation that extends to the south towards Bu√ßaco and east towards the summit of Caramulo (Caramulinho), known by locals as the Cesto Poceiro. Its central urban area is located 7.5 kilometres from the municipal seat of Anadia, and 24 kilometres southwest of the district capital (Aveiro). It is surrounded by the municipality and parish of Oliveira do Bairro, as well as Aguada de Baixo (in the municipality of √Ågueda), and its municipal neighbors Amoreira da G√¢ndara, Mogofores, Ancas, Avel√£s de Cima, Avel√£s de Caminho, Paredes do Bairro, Arcos and S√£o Louren√ßo do Bairro in the municipality of Anadia. The parish contains the settlements Fogueira, Pa√ßo, Paraimo, P√≥voa do Castelo, P√≥voa do Mato, P√≥voa do Salgueiro, Porto Lobo, Ribeiro, S√°, S√£o Jo√£o da Azenha, Sangalhos, Vidoeiro and Vila.

Description A Gemella species was first described as Neisseria hemolysans in 1938. It was reclassified as a new genus in 1960 when strains were found to be distinct enough from Neisseria to require a new genus. The name was suggested based on the organism being a diplococcus and gemellus is the diminutive of geminus, which is Latin for twin. They are facultatively anaerobic and give negative reactions to both oxidase and catalase tests. They are obligately fermentative, producing either a mixture of acetic and lactic acids or an equimolar molar mixture of acetic acid and CO2. For example, G. haemolysans ferments glucose forming a mixture of acetic and lactic acids in the absence of oxygen, whereas when oxygen is present, it forms acetic acid and CO2. Clinical importance Gemella bacteria are primarily found in the mucous membranes of humans and other animals, particularly in the oral cavity and upper digestive tract. Gemella haemolysans has been found to be involved in pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis patients. As of the year 2000 it had been reported in 15 cases of human endocarditis, mainly in men with underlying valvular disease and/or poor dentition or dental manipulation. Most cases were treated with a combination of penicillin and gentamicin with a favorable outcome.

History The E14 munition was developed by the United States for use in its offensive biological warfare arsenal as an anti-crop weapon. After the Korean War U.S. interest in large-scale entomological warfare increased. The E14 was one of two sub-munitions used in large-scale testing aimed at learning the feasibility and result of an air-dropped insect attack. In September 1954, at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, the E14 was again used in a series of tests known as \\"Operation Big Itch\\". During Big Itch, uninfected rat fleasThe rat flea is a known vector for bubonic plague. See: Trivedi, \\"Xenopsylla cheopis\\". (Xenopsylla cheopis) were loaded into the E14 and air-dropped over the proving ground. The E14 used cardboard and sponge inserts to hold the fleas inside the cardboard container. With the sponge inserts in place, the E14 could hold about 100,000 fleas. Eighty cardboard inserts, or \\"loop tubes\\", could be carried in the E14 as well. The munition could hold 80 loop tubes, each one capable of holding 3,000 fleas.

The weapons were designed to release their payload of biological agent, be it a vector or anti-crop agent, at above the ground, after it was released from the cluster munition.Kirby, Reid. \\"Using the flea as weapon\\", (Web version via findarticles.com), Army Chemical Review, July 2005, accessed December 28, 2008.

Life Born to a merchant family, Saminsky received a broad education in the arts, sciences and languages. He studied music at the Odessa conservatoire from 1903‚Äì1905, and then went to Moscow where he studied mathematics and philosophy as well as music. Expelled for his participation in the student protests of 1905, he went to St.Petersburg where he studied with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Anatoly Lyadov and Nikolai Tcherepnin. While still a student he became a founder member, with Mikhail Gnesin and others, of the 'Society for Jewish Folk Music'. He wrote music for the Society and helped organise its earliest publication. He continued an active member, even though from 1911 to 1918 he lived in Tiflis, where he also interested himself in Georgian and Armenian music, and from 1917 to 1918 he was head of the Conservatoire. During this period he also wrote an opera Tsar Yulian (Emperor Julian) (which he later destroyed), and researched Jewish music of the Caucasian region. He was particularly interested in styles of cantillation (nigun). In 1919 Saminsky left the Soviet Union and travelled to France and England, where he gave recitals of Russian and Jewish music, and led a ballet season at the Duke of York's Theatre in London, where he married the English poet Lillian Morgan. In December 1920 he left to settle in the United States, where he was active as a composer, conductor and organiser of musical events. In 1922 he became a board member of the International Composers Guild. From 1924 he was music director of the Temple Emanu-El Synagogue in New York City. For the synagogue he composed music for the Sabbath and Holiday services, also commissioning work from other Jewish composers including Joseph Achron and Isidor Freed. Saminsky's major compositions include the 'First and Second Hebrew Song Cycles' opp. 12 and 13 (written in 1914, published New York, 1922, text in Yiddish), songs, choral works and piano pieces. Saminsky wrote numerous books on Jewish music, contemporary music and conducting.

Background The issue of continuity and change in post conquest England is a topic of significant debate in scholarship. By 1086, there were very few Englishmen among the 200 or so major landowners recorded in the Domesday Book. Normans, Flemings, Bretons and others had settled on the estates of dead, dispossessed or outlawed English nobility.O'Brien, God's Peace, pp. 8-9. Contemporary chroniclers were divided, with Henry of Huntingdon writing that the English people had been \\"delivered [up] for destruction by the violent and cunning Norman people\\", while William of Poitiers lauded the Norman victory at the Battle of Hastings and said the slaughter of the English had been just punishment for Harold Godwinson \\"perjury\\".O'Brien, God's Peace, pp. 15-18. The Leges Edwardi served the purpose of legitimizing the legacy of William the Conquerors rule and distancing the 12th-century ruling class of England from their violent origins as conquerors. The treatise is believed to have been written sometime between 1130 and 1135, towards the end of Henry I reign. Historians believe the treatise intended to recast Norman institutions as having Anglo-Saxon origins.Constable, the Law, p. 80. The work's authority lay in its claim that the author had recorded the laws and customs that were spoken to William the Conqueror in 1070, four years after the Battle of Hastings by \\"English nobles who were wise men and learned in their law\\". The apocryphal account claims that William yielded to English demands to live under the English laws of Edward the Confessor or the laga Edwardi.O‚ÄôBrien, God‚Äôs Peace, p. 3. The value of the treatise stems more from its influence on postconquest perceptions of Norman rule than the historicity of the author's claims about the treatise's origin. The laga Edwardi is not a single law code, but rather is a descriptive term meaning the laws and customs of England that were observed prior to the Norman conquest. English bishops like Dunstan and Wulfstan wrote the laws of Edgar, √Üthelred the Unready and Cnut. Most of these preconquest law codes, including Instituta Cnuti, have only survived in postconquest Church compilations the earliest of which is the Textus Roffensis, dated to around 1123. William's purported acceptance of the laga Edwardi symbolized the continuity from Edward the Confessor's reign to his own, perhaps seeking to minimize the disruption caused by the conquest in 1066.O'Brien, God's Peace, pp. 22-27. Leges Edwardi Prior to the 17th century the Leges Edwardi Confessoris had several titles variously attributing the treatise to Edward or William. It is one of the four major treatises on the laga Edwardi. The others are the Willelmi articuli decem, Leis Willelme, and Leges Henrici Primi.O'Brien, God's Peace, pp. 28-29. The Leges Edwardi is not directly based upon any known sources of preconquest laws, instead borrowing at times from a Frankish text. In the absence of evidence, scholars have debated the extent to which the earlier Danelaw may have influenced the Leges Edwardi. The treatise itself claimed that the origins of the murder fine could be traced back to Cnut. This fine was imposed on the entire vill or hundred whenever a Norman was found slain. The Leges Edwardi says the practice was first introduced by Cnut to protect the Danes from the English. This claim was accepted by the 13th century legal writer Bracton.Coyne, Presentment, p. 286. Felix Liebermann has argued that the assertion of Danish origins was an invention intended to shift the blame for the fine to the previous Danish rulers, but other scholars have disputed this.Yntema, Lex Murdrorum, p. 153. The primary concerns of the text lay with the king's peace and the peace of the Holy Church, especially in the North Midlands and Yorkshire region bordering on the Danelaw. Although the emphasis is on common law, the same text shows that there were regional differences. : :\\"[12] There are many types of the king's peace; one is given by his hand, which the English call kinges hand salde grid; [12a] another [is given] on the day on which he is first crowned ‚Äî this one lasts for eight days; at Christmas eight days and eight days at Easter and eight days at Pentecost; [12b] another is given by his writ; [12c] another which the four roads have, that is Watling Street, Fosse Way, Iknield Way, and Ermine Street, of which two extend for the length of the kingdom, the others across the width.\\" O'Brien (ed. and tr.), God's Peace. Other points of interest include references to the wapentake, the reeve of the riding, Peter's Pence, murder fines (murdrum), consciousness about England's Saxon heritage, and the legal position of Jews in England. The most recent editor, Bruce O'Brien, has speculated that the popularity of the treatise may have been due to its portrayal of \\"a Norman king interested in preserving and maintaining\\" the native laws of the English nobility.O'Brien, God's Peace, p. 3. The Leges Edwardi argues that what the work offers instead are \\"apparently original observations of and comments on the English law of the author's day.\\"O'Brien, God's Peace, p. 29. The primary concerns of the text lay with the king's peace and the peace of the Holy Church, especially in the North Midlands and Yorkshire region bordering on the Danelaw. Although the emphasis is on common law, the same text shows that there were regional differences. Influence Aided by the Confessor's legendary reputation as a lawgiver, the compilation enjoyed considerable interest in medieval England. The text is found in a large number of manuscripts. Four recensions have been distinguished, two of which are revisions with additional material being grafted on to the core of the text. A version of the Leges Edwardi Confessoris was known to Henry de Bracton and to the barons and jurists responsible for Magna Carta. NotesReferences *Constable, Marianne.

Football career  Brownrigg began his career as a trainee with Hereford United, making his d√©but during the 1994‚Äì95 season. In March 1995, after just eight league games for the Bulls, he was transferred to Norwich City for a fee of ¬£100,000. He spent part of the following season on loan to Kettering Town and in August 1997 moved to Rotherham United having failed to make a first team appearance for Norwich, despite being an unused sub in the Premier League game against Arsenal at Highbury on 1 April 1995. After being on the bench against Cambridge Utd during Rotherham United's opening game of the 1997‚Äì98 season, Brownrigg was attacked by a man with a hammer and suffered severe facial injuries. Due to his injuries Brownrigg missed a large portion of the season which hindered his opportunities at Rotherham. He joined Stalybridge Celtic on loan in March 1998 and was released by Rotherham at the end of the season. Brownrigg then joined Yeovil Town, but left for personal reasons and by November 1998 was again playing for Stalybridge Celtic. It was reported that Brownrigg would be signing for Tamworth that December, but this did not transpire so he, instead, signed for Stocksbridge Park Steels. In July 1999, Brownrigg signed for Kidderminster Harriers and helped them to the Football Conference title, and with it promotion to the Football League. On 21 July 2000 Brownrigg was transferred to Scottish side Greenock Morton, costing ¬£26,500. It later transpired that Morton was in turmoil off the field, with claims that they had failed to pay Kidderminster the fee for Brownrigg. By October 2000, Brownrigg was staying away from Morton claiming that the club also owed him money. The result was that Brownrigg played just three first team games before leaving in March 2001, joining Hartlepool United, although he was released in May 2001 having failed to break into the Hartlepool side. He was linked with a return to Kidderminster, but in June 2001 joined Northwich Victoria. He subsequently moved to Hednesford Town later that year and moved to Gainsborough Trinity in June 2002. He was released in September 2002 and joined Wakefield & Emley. He had a trial with Worksop Town in the 2003 close season and also had a trial with Oxford United in November the same year. He joined Maltby Main, but left to join Ossett Albion. He then rejoined Maltby Main in January 2004 and signed for Conference side Scarborough in March 2004, but decided to leave the club the following month and rejoined Maltby Main for the final promotion push at the end of the season. He subsequently joined Hallam in 2005,but left to join Buxton in the same year. He was virtually ever-present the following season when the Bucks won the NCEL Premier League title, and was extremely popular with the supporters at the Silverlands who adapted the 'Arthur Brownlow' song of Stockport County in his honour. He left Buxton in July 2006 because of travelling difficulties and the fact that he was about to embark on a Sports degree at University. He joined Sheffield FC in the close season of 2006. During that season, Brownrigg played a starring role in Sheffield's promotion from the NCEL Premier League, making it back to back promotions from the NCEL Premier League for him. At the end the season Brownrigg left Sheffield, and rejoined Hallam in November 2007. In December 2008, he moved from Hallam to Staveley MW. In September 2009, Brownrigg left Staveley Miners Welfare to rejoin Hallam. In March 2010, Brownrigg re-signed for Ossett Albion in the Northern Premier League for the purpose of fitness for a proposed move to Worksop Town FC. Andy signed for Worksop Town in the NPL Premier Division, after playing three games for Ossett. At the beginning of the 2010‚Äì11 season Brownrigg signed for AFC Emley in the Northern Counties East League Division 1.  Personal life  On 16 June 2008 Brownrigg was admitted to Sporting Chance, a recovery clinic set up by former England International Tony Adams MBE for sportsmen and women. During his time in the clinic Brownrigg was treated for addictive-related problems. Subsequently, on 11 June 2008, and thanks to a successful period of rehabilitation, Brownrigg returned home to Sheffield where, to this day, he remains in recovery.  Education and research  On 16 July 2009, Brownrigg graduated with a First Class Honours Degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology at The University of Huddersfield. In recognition of his achievements and research area, the University offered Brownrigg a PhD Scholarship in 2009. Brownrigg's research interests lie within the area of transition, with a specific focus on the experiences of professional footballers' during sporting exit/career transition. In October 2012, Brownrigg's research gained recognition by The British Psychological Society when his work was published in the Qualitative Methods in Psychology, 'Sports and Performance' Bulletin.

A native of New York, he was raised in The Dalles, Oregon, where he was a prominent businessman and mayor. A Republican, he served as Oregon Secretary of State during The Great Depression and later in the Oregon State Senate. Early life Peter Stadelman was born in Hempstead, New York, on October 29, 1871, to an Austrian immigrant and native New Yorker.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 230. His father, Joseph, immigrated to the United States in 1869, where he married Mary Rath. He was raised near The Dalles along the Columbia River at the family's farm, which once belonged to the Catholic Mission. Stadelman received his education at the public schools in The Dalles before starting work as a paper delivery boy for The Oregonian, and then as an assistant at the local post office. In 1893, Stadelman began working in the ice and fruit business, which led him to start his own company in 1898, the Stadelman Fruit and Ice Company. He was married in 1904 to Mary Kelly Hicks, and they would have two sons, Wilbur and George Peter. Stadelman purchased the family farm with his brother in 1907 from their father.

The Maxim-Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company was the result of a takeover by Hiram Maxim of Thorsten Nordenfelt's Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company in 1888.

History The company produced a range of light artillery, machine guns and ammunition. It was the subject of one of history's most famous court cases in 1894, Nordenfelt v Maxim, Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Co, in which Nordenfelt successfully claimed that the takeover condition preventing him from competing with Maxim for 25 years \\"in any way\\" was an unreasonable restraint of trade, but failed to overturn the main condition preventing Nordenfelt from competing with Maxim in the guns and ammunition trade for 25 years. The company competed against the Armstrong subsidiary Elswick Ordnance Company's range of armaments, which included Hotchkiss guns made under licence. The company became part of the Barrow Shipbuilding Company, which was taken over by Vickers, Sons and Company in 1897 to form Vickers, Sons & Maxim. This gave Vickers a complete naval shipbuilding, engineering and armaments capability, an advantage Armstrongs had held for many years, and eventually allowed Vickers to take over Armstrongs. During the Second Boer War, the British used Maxim machine guns, and the Boers used a modified Maxim, a belt-fed, water-cooled machine gun that fired explosive one-pound rounds (smokeless ammunition) at 450 rounds per minute; it became known as the \\"Pom Pom\\".http://www.smallarmsreview.com/display.article.cfm?idarticles=2490, SOUTH AFRICA‚ÄôS NATIONAL MUSEUM OF MILITARY HISTORY See also *Second Boer War *Boer Commando ReferencesExternal links *NSW Law Reform Commission.

Last appearance - Alex Huber (German) Character's background Florian is the youngest child of Arno Brandner (Konrad Krauss). His mother is Arno's first wife, Iris (Regina Nowack), who dies tragically in 1996, after she ended her marriage with Arno and left the family. In the beginning, sixteen-year-old Florian is in love with Anna Konrad (Alexandra Schalaudek), a girl from his school. But their love faces tragedy after tragedy. Anna's father Fritz (Joe Bausch) gets murdered and the prime suspect becomes Florian's older brother Jan (Andreas Brucker), who worked for Fritz in his fitness center until he got fired, short time before Fritz was murdered. For some time, Florian seems to be the only one who believes that Jan is innocent. Meanwhile, Anna's mother Hannelore (Brigitte Walbrun) wants to forbid her daughter to see Florian any longer. Somehow Florian convinces Anna to believe him that Jan is not guilty of Fritz' murder and they try to find out what really happened. Hannelore realizes several times that Anna is still seeing Florian and they fight more and more over Anna's relationship to him, which soon builds a wall between mother and daughter. Florian's suspicions for the true murderer of Fritz go so far that he suspects Hannelore. Fritz had many affairs in the last years and Hannelore's marriage with him seemed to be lost before he died. But when Florian gets contacted by Jan, who is on the flight since the police is looking for him, has another suspect: his best friend Oliver Kopp (then played by Hendrik Duryn), who is also the boyfriend of Jan and Florian's sister Susanne (Claudia Scarpatetti). Anna helps Florian to find evidence against Oliver. The find themselves surprised, when they find out that Fritz doped his athletes, without letting them know. Oliver found out about Fritz' dark secret. Because Fritz doped him too, he was able to blackmail Oliver to shut his mouth. When the two were arguing, Oliver dug him and Fritz fall so hard that he died. Florian warns Susanne to stay away from Oliver, but she already is in danger, when Oliver confesses to her and takes her hostage to flee from the police. Florian can rescue his sister by interfering. He is happy when Jan finally can return home. But after all this drama, his relationship to Anna suffers when Hannelore can't forgive Florian that he thought she was the one who killed Fritz and that he even convinced Anna. She tries to destroy the relationship again. Florian and Anna fight more often, which leads Florian into sleeping with another girl, when he got drunk on a party. Anna sees them together in bed the next morning and breaks up with Florian. Meanwhile, Renate, the girl he slept with, develops feelings for Florian. She soon turns out to be a stalker, when she makes Florian expensive gifts and won't stay away from him - even after he already told her that he wants to get back with Anna. Because of Renate's games and she telling everyone that Florian loves only her, Anna believes Florian is the one that plays a game and plays both women. But in the end, Anna sees that Florian is telling the truth, when he paints a graffiti on the school wall. Renate wants revenge and feels humiliated in front of the entire school. She beats herself up and goes to Hannelore, trying to convince her that it was Florian. Hannelore believes her and threatens Florian that she would go to the police, if he finally doesn't stay away from Anna. When even Arno and Iris don't believe Florian's story of Renate, Anna and he decide to run away - right before his parents find out the truth. Years later, Florian is married to Isabell Mohr (Tanja Wenzel) and has a daughter, Carolin, which he legally accepted as his. He and his little family live together in Milan. They were last mentioned by Florian's father Arno in 2008, saying that Florian and Isabell still happy.

Yanagi was discovered by conceptual photographer Yasumasa Morimura, who noticed some of her work while borrowing her house as a set for a separate project. Biography Miwa Yanagi was born in 1967 in Kobe, Japan. She completed her postgraduate course work at the Kyoto City University of Arts.Yanagi, Miwa. \\"Miwa Yanagi\\", Yanagi's website. April 2009. She is known mainly as a photographer and video artist. She creates an elaborate,and often costly staged event using female models ranging in different ages. After the picture or video is taken, the image may be altered with computer graphics.Bergquist, Karin. \\"Yanagi Miwa\\", culturebase.net. 21 July 2003. April 2009. Her artworks examines self-images and stereotypes of Japanese women in contemporary Japanese society. Yanagi was influenced by a teacher in high school who was passionate for his artwork. She decided to go into art at Kyoto City University of Arts. After graduating from Kyoto City University of Arts, she began working as a teacher where she began to realize that she was not individualized but rather forced to play an ordinary role of a woman teacher. Her big break came when she was nominated to be in an exhibition in Germany in 1996 at the Kunsthalle in Frankfurt. It was here that her works were exhibited along with artists like Cindy Sherman and Jeff Wall. The international exposure to a commercial art market gave her major advantage over other Japanese artists. Because of the lack of a contemporary art market in Japan and her success in Germany in 1996 she decided to display her work overseas.Wakasa, Mako. \\"Miwa Yanagi\\" Journal of Contemporary Art. April 2009. Yanagi currently works and lives in Kyoto, Japan.  Artwork Elevator Girls= Yanagi's best known body of works is her first, Elevator Girls. With it, she focuses on themes of everyday life, self-identity, architecture, and employment in the world of girls who operate the elevators of Japanese department stores. Elevator Girls first started as performance piece early in her career. It was to represent and reflect on what Yanagi was going through at this time. The performance was about a young girl who works in a narrow box, who has to repeat the same task over and over again, day after day. The later photographs of Elevator Girls show women dressed similarly and who often show very little emotion. The switch from performance art to photography was because Yanagi wanted complete control in what was going on. These young models are all physically similar in body composition. The way they are posed shows that they are restricted on what they can do and where they can go, much as restrictions are placed on women culturally. In the photos the elevator girls stare at architectural design or consumer goods. The staring represents society's obsession with consumer goods. These standardized young women in her artwork series symbolized the capitalistic and patriarchal society of Japan and how the roles of women in the workforce of Japan is suppressed and idealized to serve and obey their male-dominated society. =My Grandmothers= My Grandmothers was next. The series focuses on how young girls from between 14 and 20 years old perceive and what they thought their life would be like in 50 years. If she liked the answer and felt inspired to work with it the interview was later photographed with models, some of whom came from the Elevator Girls series.The models for Yanagi's work come from different sources. She has an address in the magazine Ry≈´k≈ç Ts≈´shin, where her works are usually published. She also gets help from friends and gets emails from people who want to be part of her work, mainly from people who attended the lectures Yanagi has given at different universities. (Wakasa). During the interview process she eliminates those who seem to lack any real life experience. She believes that younger people restrict what they can do. When the age restriction is released, women are freer to express their wishes and desires. The more restricted a young girl feels today closely relates to the degree of freedom she will feel 50 years from now. After the interview is accepted, drawings are made. Then Yanagi photographs the scene she has imagined and put on paper. The photograph is then altered on a computer, to merge the girl's idea and Yanagi's surreal dream. The results show emotions ranging from sad to funny. A girl named Mie imagines that in 50 years she will be lonely, looking around a field of empty landscapes during a time of a cataclysm. One named Yuka believes she will be living somewhere on the U.S. coast without a care in the world and with a playboy for a lover. Along with each photo comes a verse based on the interviews and the photos. =Fairy Tales= In Yanagi's third popular series, Fairy Tales, she focuses on stories in which the main characters are usually simultaneously both old and young and deals with the relationships between the two ages. The stories are based on fairy tales told by the Brothers Grimm, which are often more gruesome and horrible than the watered-down versions told to children. The gruesome quality appealed to Yanagi and helped her show the difference between youth and old age. She first released the series in 2005 at the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art and Ohara Museum of Art. They are presented as large black-and-white photos. Yanagi abandons her computer here for more traditional methods. She also uses models who are not Japanese. Young mixed-raced girls are given wigs, makeup, and latex masks to look like old, witch-like, hags. What is left is a strange unresolved combination of an old woman with youthful limbs and appendages, confusing the distinction between old and young. For example, in the 2005 Snow White, a young girl can be seen looking into the mirror, but instead of a beautiful young lady looking back at her, she sees an old unattractive old lady. In a second example, Gretel, a young girl can be seen gnawing on the finger of an unseen witch. This leaves the viewer wondering which is the captor.Conti, Andrew. \\"Miwa Yanagi\\", Metropolis, April 2009. This series is the complete opposite of Elevator Girls, where the models are shown as pretty, have little emotion and are similar. =Video= In the video Suna Onna (i.e. \\"sand woman\\", 2005) Yanagi shows the relationship between a child and her grandmother. The grandmother tells the granddaughter of her meeting with a sand woman as a child. It is meant to be a tale of transformation and the supernatural world. In other videos she shows uniformed women who change their surroundings with a wave of their hand. =Performances= Although known more for photography and video, Yanagi also did performance pieces before she switched to photography. The main subject was what she was going through as a young woman in Japan. Elevator Girls was originally a performance piece. Yanagi also did another performance piece in which she hired someone who was to show contemporary art in a museum to visitors as a real guide would. Yanagi gave them a script on what to say and at what points during the tour that they were supposed to perform certain gestures. The guide was totally believable in this performance, wearing the same uniform as regular tour guides and speaking in the same manner. People seemed more interested in the tour guide than the actual art work. Some people even left the museum after the guide finished speaking. In Yanagi's view the performance is about the feeling of pleasure and the experience. It was more about the performance by the guide than actual artwork in the museum. Yanagi's current subjects are the lives of women and how they are perceived in the modern world. Here she looks on how women are treated and viewed by society and also how women culturally view themselves. In 2013, Zero Hour: Tokyo Rose's Last Tape was performed at the Japan Society in New York. Zero Hour deals with the story of Iva Toguri D'Aquino, a Japanese-American DJ for a propagandist radio program who was arrested upon return to the US in 1950 and wrongly found guilty of treason. Employing interpretive dance, projected images and traditional dialogue, Yanagi says Zero Hour \\"explores the role of media in the context of theatre\\". Exhibitions In 1993 Yanagi held her first solo exhibition, and since 1996 her work has been exhibited in both solo and group shows throughout Europe and the United States.\\"Miwa Yanagi \\" (Japan Pavilion, the 53rd Venice Biennale 2009), the Japan Foundation. 2008.

La Nativit√© du Seigneur (The Nativity of the Lord or The Birth of the Saviour) is a work for organ, written by the French composer Olivier Messiaen in 1935. La Nativit√© du Seigneur is a testament to Messiaen's Christian faith, being divided into nine \\"meditations\\" inspired by the birth of Jesus. In volume one, Messiaen outlines his inspirations, both theological, instrumental and compositional. As the composer notes in his preface, he sought \\"the emotion and sincerity first\\".Messiaen, Olivier, La Nativit√© du Seigneur, Volume One (Paris: Ludec, 1936). The work was written by the composer at the age of 27 years during the summer of 1935 while he was in residence at Grenoble near the French Alps. Messiaen wrote that in addition to theology, the movements were inspired by the mountains, as well as the stained glass windows in medieval cathedrals. The work was premiered on 27 February 1936 on the organ of La Trinit√©, Paris, shared among three players: Jean-Yves Daniel-Lesur (1‚Äì3), Jean Langlais (4‚Äì6), and Jean-Jacques Grunenwald (7‚Äì9). Movements The work is in nine movements, each depicting an image or concept from the birth of Jesus. In publication, the work is divided over four books. #La vierge et l'enfant (The Virgin and Child) #Les bergers (The Shepherds) #Desseins √©ternels (Eternal designs) #Le verbe (The Word) #Les enfants de Dieu (The Children of God) #Les anges (The Angels) #J√©sus accepte la souffrance (Jesus accepts suffering) #Les mages (The Magi) #Dieu parmi nous (God Among Us) The work is one of the earliest to feature elements that were to become key to Messiaen's later compositions, such as the extensive use of the composer's own modes of limited transposition, as well as influence from birdsong, and the meters and rhythms of Ancient Greek and traditional Indian music. In 1967, Richard Franko Goldman wrote, \\"One is, indeed, tempted to say that the work is a masterpiece, and one of the great organ works of all time. It is certainly monumental and impressive, original and memorable, with or without the theoretical and mystical explanation the composer himself gives out.\\"Goldman, Richard Franko, \\"Review: Simon Preston's recording of La Nativit√© du Seigneur\\" in The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 53, No. 2 (April 1967), pp. 290-293.

It is situated at the Tarnol pass ( or Margalla Pass) of the Margalla Hills close to the twin cities of Rawalpindi‚ÄìIslamabad en route to the historical town of Taxila. The granite obelisk, approximately tall, stands on a rocky prominence overlooking the Grand Trunk Road connecting Islamabad with Peshawar. There is also a small memorial fountain at the base of the hillock on which the Memorial/Obelisk stands. About Nicholson Nicholson was born on 11 December 1822 in Lisburn, Ireland, the eldest son of Dr Alexander Jaffray Nicholson and Clara Hogg.Charles Allen, Soldier-Sahibs: The Men who made the North-West Frontier, London: Abacus/Time Warner Books UK, 2002 ed, various references between pp. 2-328. He studied at The Royal School Dungannon, a public mixed school, located in Dungannon, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. Nicholson joined the army of the British East India Company in 1839. Soon after arriving in India, he fought his first combat action in the first Afghan War (1839‚Äì42). After Afghan War, he was appointed Political Officer in Kashmir and then District Commissioner in the Sangar Area of Sindh. He fought bravely during the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845‚Äì46), during which he was wounded in an attack on the Margalla Pass, where the Obelisk in his memory now stands. He distinguished himself again in the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848‚Äì49). Legacy John Nicholson became the Victorian \\"Hero of Delhi\\" and inspired several books, ballads and generations of young boys to join the army. He is referenced in numerous literary works, including Rudyard Kipling's Kim. Nicholson features in a number of novels about this period in history. He is mentioned by George MacDonald Fraser in his book Flashman in the Great Game. He also appears as one of the main characters in James Leasor's novel about the Indian Mutiny, Follow the Drum, describing his death in some detail. He is also featured in James Leasor's history of the siege, 'The Red Fort'. A famous biography was also written about him by Lionel J Trotter (1897) and he comes in for conspicuous mention in the book Soldier-Sahibs:The Men who made the North-West Frontier (2001) by British author Charles Allen. Nicholson also served as Deputy Commissioner of Bannu (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) from 1852-1854. For his bravery and services towards British government, a tablet in a church at Bannu carries the following caption: ‚ÄúGifted in mind and body, he was as brilliant in government as in arms. The snows of Ghazni attest his youthful fortitude; the songs of the Punjab his manly deeds; the peace of this frontier his strong rule. The enemies of his country know how terrible he was in battle, and we his friends have to recall how gentle, generous, and true he was.‚Äù See also * Muhammad Hayat Khan Sources * Edwardes, Michael (1969), Bound to Exile, Praeger, p. pp100 * Leasor, James (2011) [1956], The Red Fort, London: W.

Deputy Speaker After the June 2010 general elections Deireragea was elected Deputy Speaker of Parliament. In this role he deputizes for the Speaker of Parliament. Thus far in his term the office of speaker has fallen vacant twice, during which time Deireragea became Acting Speaker. The first period was the longest, July 9 until November 1, 2010. This period of vacancy was caused by the removal of Aloysius Amwano from office and was drawn out by deadlock over who should be speaker. Finally Ludwig Scotty was elected, ending Deireragea's acting speakership. The second period was brief, from April 18 until April 25, 2013, between the resignation of Speaker Scotty and the election of Godfrey Thoma.

T√©llez was an active participant in her parish during her adolescence and was part of several faith-related organizations until her desire for the religious life led her to establish an order dedicated to both the care of the poor and ill and the education of children. Her order's foundation was first mired in a lack of membership though the number increased as houses were established and their works grew. Her beatification was held on 21 March 2004. Life Matilde T√©llez Robles was born on 30 May 1841 in Robledillo de la Vera as the second of four children to F√©lix Tell√©z i Gomez Basilea Robles i Ruiz; she was baptized on 31 May. Her parents decided later in 1851 that all would relocate to B√©jar in Salamanca where her parents enrolled her in a private school. But as an adolescent she felt called to commit her entire life to the worship and the service of God to which she encountered the strong opposition of her father who wanted her to get married; he even tried to control her religious practices. T√©llez found the support that she needed in the association of the Hijas de Mar√≠a. T√©llez spent her time at home in silent reflection when she was not occupied with caring for the sick and the poor. But she also felt called to found a religious order that was dedicated to Eucharistic Adoration and caring for those who needed help the most. In this she found the support of both her father (who relented to her desires) and her spiritual director Manuel de la Oliva. T√©llez acquired a house for the point of housing herself and eight members of Hijas de Mar√≠a who had committed themselves to joining her in this endeavor. But on 19 March 1875 - the chosen time for the occupation of the house and beginning the work of the group - just one member besides T√©llez showed up: Mar√≠a Briz (c. 1852-1885). Briz spent the remainder of her life as the companion to T√©llez who was determined to proceed with the foundation of the new order and the two assumed the habit for the first time on 20 January 1878. The pair worked with orphaned children (she opened a school for them) but also with the poor and the sick. More women joined the two at a slow pace and the need for larger lodgings came once the group had risen to six members. Soon a new house was found in Don Benito where the group moved in March 1879 and where T√©llez opened a school and novitiate for new candidates. Her order received diocesan approval on 19 March 1884 from the Bishop of Plasencia Pedro Casas i Souto which allowed for her and some other sisters to make their religious vows on the following 29 June. But tragic circumstances in 1885 saw a cholera outbreak claim Briz. In 1889 a new house was opened in C√°ceres while other houses were later opened in Trujillo and Almendralejo as well as in Los Santos de Maimona. T√©llez died at the motherhouse in Don Benito on 17 December 1902 after suffering from a stroke on 15 December. In 2005 her order had 261 religious in 41 houses in nations such as Mexico and Portugal. Her order received the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius XI on 12 May 1930 while Pope Pius XII granted pontifical approval to their work on 6 May 1941. Beatification The process for her beatification opened on 15 December 1977 under Pope Paul VI after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled the late religious as a Servant of God while the cognitional process for collecting documentation took place in Plasencia from 10 November 1979 to 26 April 1980. The C.C.S. later validated this process after receiving the documents on 13 November 1992 and then received the Positio dossier from cause officials in 1994. Historians approved the dossier on 22 February 1994 as did the theologians on 4 December 2001 and the C.C.S. on 15 January 2002. On 23 April 2002 she was named as Venerable after Pope John Paul II confirmed that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. One miracle was required for her to be beatified. One such case was investigated and received C.C.S. validation on 5 February 2000 before medical experts approved the miraculous circumstances of the healing on 14 November 2002. Theologians also approved it on 4 February 2003 as being a miracle attributed to the late nun while the C.C.S. confirmed the findings of the two previous panels on 8 April 2003. John Paul II approved this miracle on 12 April 2003 and beatified the late nun on 21 March 2004 in Saint Peter's Square. The current postulator for the cause is Fr. Antonio S√°ez de Alb√©niz.

Though the U.S. military intended to procure 6,000 E86s, the program was halted in the first half of the 1950s. History The E86 cluster bomb was developed as a biological weapon by the United States Army Chemical Corps and the United States Air Force beginning in October 1951.Whitby, Simon M. Biological Warfare Against Crops, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2002, pp. 167-69, (). The Ralph M. Parsons Company was contracted to produce the E86 in October 1952. In 1953 procurement began for 6,000 E86 cluster bombs, with their production expected no earlier than 1958. When U.S. military munition requirements were reviewed in the first half of the 1950s, production and further development of the E86 was halted. The E86 cluster bomb supplanted technologies such as the E77 balloon bomb.Wheelis, Mark, et al. Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945, (Google Books), Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 218, (). Specifications The E86 was similar to the M115 biological bomb, except it was larger. While the M115 weighed , the E86 was a weapon. Regardless, operationally, the E86 was similar to the M115. It was designed as an anti-crop weapon; the U.S. biological weapons program produced three anti crop agents, wheat and rye stem rust and rice blast.Zilinskas, Raymond A. Biological Warfare: Modern Offense and Defense, (Google Books), Lynne Rienner Publishers, Boulder, Colorado: 2000, p. 68, (). The weapon was in a steel case and intended to be dropped from the exterior of an aircraft such as the B-47 or B-52. Sub-munitions included the E14 munition; the sub- munition was originally intended as anti-crop weapons as well, but was later altered and used in testing as the U.S. pursued an entomological warfare program.Kirby, Reid. \\"Using the flea as weapon \\", Army Chemical Review, July 2005, accessed December 28, 2008.

The son of a parliamentarian, Dabwido was originally elected to the Meneng Constituency in the Parliament of Nauru at the 2004 elections. Having served as Minister for Telecommunications in Marcus Stephen's government from 2009, Dabwido joined the Nauruan opposition faction in November 2011 after Stephen's resignation, and, having passed a motion of no confidence against interim president Freddie Pitcher, was elected president four days later. In his role as president, Dabwido functioned as chairman of the Cabinet of Nauru, and held various portfolios in the Nauruan government. Weightlifting career Prior to entering politics, Dabwido was a weightlifter. He was the national champion of Nauru in weightlifting in 1995 and 1996. He also represented Nauru internationally winning a silver medal for his country at the 1995 Samoa Games and competed at the 1995 World Weightlifting Championships in the super heavyweight category. Political career The second son of former parliamentarian Audi Dabwido, Dabwido worked in public insurance before entering politics. He was a founding member of the Naoero Amo party, and was elected to the Parliament of Nauru at the 2004 elections, defeating Nimrod Botelanga to win the seat of Meneng. Re-elected at the 2007 and 2008 elections, he became a member of the parliamentary faction supporting President Marcus Stephen, and was made Minister for Telecommunications in Stephen's government in 2009 where he presided over the introduction of mobile phones to Nauru. Again re-elected at the 2010 elections, Dabwido joined the opposition faction in November 2011 when Stephen resigned as president to be succeeded by Freddie Pitcher. =President of Nauru= After a motion of no confidence against Pitcher, Dabwido was elected president by the parliament, with nine votes supporting his nomination and eight votes opposing.The changing faces of Nauru's leadership crisis ‚Äì Brisbane Times online.

Dabwido's first major international meeting as president was at the 2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, as a representative of the Pacific Islands grouping of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). In his speech during the opening plenary, he evaluated the potential problems faced by islands in the Pacific Ocean resulting from rising sea levels. Reiterating the SIDS objective for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent further global climate change, Dabwido called for the development of a legally binding protocol alongside the Kyoto Protocol, with reference to \\"mitigation actions for developing countries\\" and the Bali Action Plan. He supported the re-opening of the Australian-tax-payer- funded asylum seeker processing centre in Nauru, which is supported by the opposition Liberal Party of Australia but opposed by the governing Australian Labor Party.Coalition welcomes Nauruan president's commitment to processing centre ‚Äì Liberal Party of Australia.

On behalf of Nauru, Dabwido made his first address to the United Nations General Assembly during the general debate of its sixty-seventh session, in September 2012. During his speech, he urged the UN to address climate change more directly, as well as criticising the ineffectiveness of multilateralism. Dabwido did not stand for re-election, and was replaced by Baron Waqa after the 2013 parliamentary elections. Post-presidency After his presidency, Dabwido returned to the parliament and became part of the opposition and alleged the Nauru government of corruption and abuse of power while the government has accused him and other opposition parliamentarians of spreading \\"lies about the country\\" as a response with speaking with journalists based outside Nauru. In 2015, Dabwido and others held anti-government protests in front of the parliament and they were charged with rioting. The accused including Dabwido became involved in a court case known as \\"Nauru 19\\" and Dabwido was cleared of any wrongdoing in 2018 by the Supreme Court of Nauru. In May 2018, Dabwido was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the Republic of Nauru Hospital. Dabwido left for Australia to undergo treatment for his condition and also seek political asylum, claiming that the Nauru government was preventing him from leaving Nauru for treatment overseas. The Nauru government has denied the claim, saying Dabwido was immediately accepted for fully funded overseas treatment for his condition. In Australia, Dabwido rescinded his support for the Australian- funded asylum seeker processing center in Nauru and expressed his desire to have the facility cease operations; he also voiced support for the Medevac Bill. Personal life Dabwido was in a domestic partnership with a woman named Luci. They had been in a relationship for at least eight years. The two became engaged when Dabwido proposed to Luci in the hospital where he was diagnosed with cancer. The two participated in a commitment ceremony in Sydney in 2019. Illness and death In 2018, Dabwido was diagnosed with throat cancer. He died from the disease on 8 May 2019, aged 46.

The only nearby base to retain its own newspaper was Yokota Air Base. Origins The first issue, Vol. I no. 1, appeared on 30 June 1961, replacing Tachikawa's paper The Marauder and other separate base papers. The appearance of the Kanto Plainsman coincided with the activation of the 6100th Support Wing at Tachikawa. The free paper was an official Air Force publication that contained no advertisements and ranged from 12 to 20 pages per issue. Content A typical issue consisted of articles on significant and minor local events, individual and unit awards, ceremonies, sports, birth announcements and event schedules, as well as general Air Force information and stories. Most articles were accompanied by photographs. The paper was entirely in English with a target audience of Air Force personnel and dependents stationed in Japan, and like all Air Force newspapers was intended as key source of command information. A Japanese-language version of the paper was published for Japanese nationals working at the above-mentioned American Air Force facilities. The End of the Kanto Plainsman The final issue of Kanto Plainsman, Vol. X No. 16, was published on 24 April 1970. On that date it was merged with the Yokota Air Base newspaper The Afterburner, which was renamed the Fuji Flyer. The demise of Kanto Plainsman occurred soon after flying operations ceased at Tachikawa and the Air Force began its Kanto Plain Consolidation Program. MSgt George E. O'Brien was the Kanto Plainsman's editor for the final issues.

Getax had just sought, unsuccessfully, to propose a loan to the Stephen government, with contractual clauses enabling it (the company) to take over Nauru's phosphate industry in the event that the government defaulted in repaying.

On 6 July, opposition MP Rykers Solomon joined the government, potentially giving it the numbers to re-elect Stephen, or to elect a new president from within its ranks. As Speaker, however, Amwano refused to allow the election for president (by MPs) to be held. Amwano was dismissed by Stephen the following day, but refused to relinquish his post. In a short parliamentary session held on 9 July, Deputy Speaker Landon Deireragea announced that he had assumed the Speaker's position in Amwano's place. In October, the Nauruan government accused Getax of having paid significant sums of money to opposition MPs, and of having funded the opposition's election campaign. The Australian Federal Police investigated the allegations that Getax had bribed Nauruan MPs \\"to influence the political regime in Nauru in order to increase their stake in the country's phosphate\\".

It is also an Ecclesiastical parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cork and Ross. The parish lies between the towns of Enniskean and Bandon. It consist of about of land on the south side of the river Bandon - the river being its northern boundary for about . Most of the area is hilly, rising from 60 to 230 meters. The fertility of the land is varied with some fertile areas as well as barren uplands.  History  It is believed that the site at Desertserges may well have been sacred before the arrival of Christianity in Ireland. Looked at from the air the graveyard is fairly circular in shape, which is often an indication of pre-Christian antiquity. The early Christians often adopted sites that were already sacred. The name of the parish comes from a hermit, named Serges who made his home somewhere in the parish. The Irish word \\"D√≠seart Seargus\\" literally means \\"the hermitage of Serges\\". There was a Celtic Christian monastic Community at nearby Kinneigh which is believed to have been founded by St. Colman between 617 and 619 CE. It is likely that Serges was a part of that community even though he would have spent much time in solitude. Desertserges was a half day's walk away from Kinneigh through the scrub and woods that grew in this area at that time, and across the river Bandon. It is not known for certain exactly where the hermitage of Serges was ‚Äì some historians say it was a few meters east of the present church and that is probably where the original church stood. The present church (St. Mary's) was built in 1805. Prior to the 12th century, Desertserges was one of seven parishes which comprised a diocese of Kinneigh. In 1199 it was included in new diocese of Cork by papal decree. In Lewis' Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, published in 1837, Desertserges is described as containing 6,629 inhabitants.  Today  Today, Desertserges remains a rural parish. There is one primary school, Desertserges National School, with about 24 children. Agriculture remains the dominant local industry.

Projections of sea ice loss that are adjusted to take account of recent rapid Arctic shrinkage suggest that the Arctic will likely be free of summer sea ice sometime between 2059 and 2078. Various climate engineering schemes have been suggested to reduce the chance of significant and irreversible effects such as Arctic methane release. Several climate engineering proposals have been made which are specific to the Arctic. They are usually hydrological in nature, and principally centre upon measures to prevent Arctic ice loss. In addition, other solar radiation management climate engineering techniques, such as stratospheric sulfate aerosols have been proposed. These would cool the Arctic by adjusting the albedo of the atmosphere. Background The Arctic region plays an important role in the regulation of the Earth's climate. Conditions in the Arctic may suggest the existence of tipping points, including ice-albedo feedback from melting Arctic sea ice and Arctic methane release from thawing permafrost and methane clathrate. The speed of future retreat of the Arctic sea ice is contentious. The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report of 2007 states that \\"in some projections, Arctic late-summer sea ice disappears almost entirely by the latter part of the 21st century.\\" However, the ice has since undergone unexpectedly significant retreat, reaching a record low area in summer 2007 before recovering somewhat in 2008. A tipping point process could potentially commence as the Arctic region warms, if there is positive feedback with sufficient gain. Tim Lenton suggests that the retreat of sea ice is such a process, and the tipping may have started already. Climate engineering has been proposed for preventing or reversing tipping point events in the Arctic, in particular to halt the retreat of the sea ice. Preventing such ice loss is important for climate control, as the Arctic ice regulates global temperatures by virtue of its albedo, and also by restraining methane emissions from permafrost near the shoreline in the Arctic region. Additionally, the sea ice has a wider regional climatic role, and acts to maintain permafrost more generally in the region, by insulating the cold winter winds from the warm sea. Building thicker sea ice It has been proposed to actively enhance the polar ice cap by spraying or pumping water onto the top of it which would build thicker sea ice. As ice is an insulator, water on the surface of the ice tends to freeze more quickly than that below. Thickening ice by spraying seawater onto existing ice has been proposed. Sea ice is an effective thermal insulator, and thus freezing takes place much more rapidly on the top surface of the ice sheet than on the bottom. Thicker sea ice is more structurally stable, and is more resistant to melting due to its increased mass. An additional benefit of this method is that the increased salt content of the melting ice will tend to strengthen downwelling currents when the ice re- melts. Some ice in the sea is frozen seawater. Other ice comes from glaciers, which come from compacted snow, and is thus fresh water ice. If salt water ice is made on top of fresh water ice, if it melts, it may rapidly perforate the lower layers of the ice sheet. (Salt water melts at a lower temperature than fresh water does.) Some have speculated that river water could be used to thicken fresh water ice if this problem is deemed important. Stratospheric sulfate aerosols Caldeira and Wood analysed the effect of climate engineering in the Arctic using stratospheric sulfate aerosols. This technique is not specific to the Arctic region. He found that At high latitudes, there is less sunlight deflected per unit albedo change but climate system feedbacks operate more powerfully there. These two effects largely cancel each other, making the global mean temperature response per unit top-of-atmosphere albedo change relatively insensitive to latitude. Influencing ocean temperature and salinity It has been suggested that locally influencing salinity and temperature of the Arctic Ocean, by changing the ratio of Pacific and fluvial waters entering through the Bering Strait could play a key role in preserving Arctic sea ice. The purpose would be to create a relative increase of fresh water inflow from the Yukon River, while blocking (part) of the warm and saltier waters from the Pacific Ocean. Proposed geoengineering options include a dam connecting St. Lawrence Island and a threshold under the narrow part of the strait.

He played as a striker and was known for his excellent fitness, bicycle kicks, and goal- scoring abilities, especially using the rabona kick. Goal.com Childhood and early career Mewalal was born on 1 July 1926 in Daulatpur in Chitarghati Panchayat of the Gaya district (now Nawada district) in Bihar, to Sahoo Mahadeoram and Kusumi Devi. He spent his early days playing football with the seeds of a tar tree near the banks of the Khuri River, which flows through his village. In 1937 his family moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata). His father worked at Fort William, and the family resided in the Fort William and Hastings neighborhoods. Once in Calcutta, Mewalel's footballing talent was noticed by Sergeant Barnett who helped him join the Morning Star Club. Barnett would become his first coach. Known for his ability to shoot with both feet, Mewalal credited Sergeant R. Blackey for helping him learn the technique. He began playing as a right-in and was eventually urged by the club to play in the center-forward position, considering his physique and ball-shooting technique. He began playing for the Napier Club the following year. He made his name at the club after scoring an important goal in a draw against Grear Sporting Club. Club career Mewalal started his senior career in 1938 with Khiddirpore Club which was then playing in the 2nd Division of the Calcutta Football League. He came into the limelight in 1944 when he scored the winning goal for the IFA XI against India XI. In 1945 he joined the 1st Division club Aryans. It was his hat-trick for Aryans in the same year against Mohun Bagan A.C. in a Calcutta league match that impressed the then Mohun Bagan captain Sailen Manna. In 1946 he joined Mohun Bagan under Manna. In 1947 he joined the Eastern Railway Football Club. After spending eight years with them, he joined BNR Football Club. In 1958, while playing in an Inter-Railway tournament in Kharagpur, he broke his knee. This incident ended Mewalal's illustrious 20-year career. During his club career, Mewalel scored more than 150 goals in the local league. He also scored 39 goals‚Äîincluding five hat-tricks‚Äîfor BNR in the Santosh Trophy competition. Mewalal was the top scorer in the Calcutta Football League on four occasions. He achieved this feat in 1949, 1951, and 1954 for Eastern Railways and in 1958 for BNR. He also scored a record of 32 hat-tricks in local football tournaments, a record unbroken to this day. International career Playing for the Indian national team, Mewalal's first major tournament was the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Following the Olympics the team played exhibition games, winning a game against the Dutch club AFC Ajax 5‚Äì1. Mewalal emerged as the top scorer in these games. At the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi, he finished as the top scorer with four goals, with India winning the gold medal. He scored the winning goal in the 1‚Äì0 win against Iran in the final. He was also a part of the team that competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He toured several European countries in the late 1940s as part of the Indian team, and also participated in the team's tours of Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Thailand during the 1950s. Mewalel was the first player after independence to score a hat- trick for India in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Burma in the 1952 Colombo Quadrangular Tournament. Personal life Mewalal married Laxmi Devi Lal in 1944 when he was 18. They had three children together. He was admitted to a Kolkata hospital on 14 November 2008 after suffering from pneumonia. Diagnosed with a gallstone, he was again admitted on 8 December and was operated upon on 19 December, after which he was placed on a liquid diet. He died on 27 December.

He committed suicide in Dewsbury after murdering his wife. Rugby career Stadden made his d√©but for Wales against Ireland in 1884 under the captaincy of Joe Simpson in the Home Nations Championship. Stadden scored a drop goal on his d√©but and along with tries from William Norton and Tom Clapp, gave Wales their first win on Welsh soil. Stadden was not selected for the next tournament, but regained his position in 1886 playing in both matches of the series against England and Scotland. Wales lost both games, but Stadden managed to score again, this time with a try, in the opening match over England. In September 1886, Stadden, along with fellow Cardiff team-mate Angus Stuart, left Cardiff for Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, pleading that there were no employment prospects for him in Wales. Though it was later discovered that he was working for a textile company part-owned by the Dewsbury club's president. Staddens' last season at Cardiff was the year when, under the captaincy of Frank Hancock, Cardiff perfected the quick passing 'four three- quarter system'. The team won 26 of their 27 games and scored 131 tries whilst conceding only four. He continued to play for Wales and for Yorkshire. He was the first Welsh player to be bought by an English club and he evolved into a star player in Yorkshire, which was the best team in England at the time. Stadden's next two matches for Wales were against Ireland as part of the 1887 Championship, partnered with John Goulstone Lewis, and Scotland in 1888 with Cardiff team-mate Jem Evans; both were Welsh wins. Towards the end of 1888, Wales hosted their first oversea's tourists when the New Zealand Native team visited Britain. Under the captaincy of Frank Hill, Stadden partnered Charlie Thomas in a Welsh win over the MƒÅori team. Stadden's last games for Wales both came in the 1890 Home Nations Championship, the first was a loss to Scotland at the Cardiff Arms Park, the second was Wales' first ever win over England. Stadden was the Welsh hero of the match after scoring the only point of the game played in England at Dewsbury.History of Welsh Rugby Rugby Canada website Early in the second half, Stadden took a line out and motioned that he was going to throw the ball long. The Welsh and England lines both shuffled back expecting a long throw, for Stadden to bounce the ball into the ground close to his feet, regathering the ball he rushed past two defending players to score the winning try.Godwin (1984), pg 24.

The IOF-550 is an Aerosance FADEC equipped version of the same basic engine, the TSIO-550 is a dual turbocharged version and the TSIOL-550 is a liquid-cooled variant. There is no O-550 engine, which would be a carburetor-equipped variant, hence the base model is the IO-550. This engine family competes with the Lycoming IO-580 series which are also six-cylinder engines with similar power output and weight. Design and development The IO-550 family of engines was developed from the IO-520 series, with the stroke increased from 4.00 to 4.25 inches, increasing the displacement to 552 in¬≥ (9.05 l). The engine family covers a power range from to . The engines were first developed in the early 1980s and first certified on a regulatory basis of FAR 33, 1 February 1965 amendment, 33-8, 2 May 1977.

Known for her wall panels, Koral worked in a variety of media such as tiles, statuettes, plates, and also created household items. She started working on ceramics after she was diagnosed with tuberculosis, while receiving treatment at a sanatorium in Switzerland. She was a self-taught artist and her works were mostly ignored during her lifetime. Seeking to push the limits of ceramics beyond its function, she was inspired by the art of ancient civilizations of Turkey, Mexico and East Asia‚ÄîJapan in particular. Her work is commonly known to carry a mix of Western and Eastern artistic elements. Early life F√ºreya Koral was born in B√ºy√ºkada, Istanbul. Her father was Emin Pa≈üa who was a notable soldier and statesman in the Ottoman Empire. Similar to her aunts Fahrelnissa Zeid, Aliye Berger, Ay≈üe Erdem, and her uncle Cevat ≈ûakir Kabaaƒüa√ßlƒ±, Koral was keen on music, painting and literature. She studied at the Lyc√©e Notre Dame de Sion Istanbul until her final year, and then received her diploma from the Private Jewish High School in 1928. She enrolled at the Department of Philosophy at the Istanbul University Faculty of Literature in 1929. Because of her father‚Äôs illness and mandatory retirement, the financial situation of the family declined, and she quit university before graduating. In 1930, she moved to Bursa after marrying the farm owner Selahattin Karacabey. The couple divorced in 1932. She made her second marriage to Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali in 1935, who was a close friend of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. Following Atat√ºrk's passing, the couple moved back to Istanbul. She helped her older sister, artist Fahrelnissa Zeid open her first solo exhibition at her home at the Ralli Apartment Block in 1945. Immediately after the exhibition, Koral was diagnosed with tuberculosis.  Artistic practice  1947‚Äì1954 Koral began her treatment at the [tasis) Sanatorium in Switzerland, where she took painting lessons from a Polish artist. Later, she began to experiment with ceramics with the materials her aunts Fahrelnissa Zeid and Aliye Berger sent to her. In 1949, she attended a ceramics workshop in Lausanne. In 1950, she moved to Paris where her treatment resumed. In Paris, she crossed paths with the ceramics artist Georges Serr√© (1889‚Äì1956) and upon his recommendation, she began working on firing techniques at a workshop outside of Paris. She also met the art critics Jacques Lassaigne and Charles Estienne who both advised Koral to open an exhibition. zazazaa The artist opened her first solo exhibition at Galerie M.A.I. in Paris. This was followed by her first solo exhibition in Turkey at the Maya Gallery founded by Adalet Cimcoz. The exhibition featured wall ceramics inspired by the √ßini (ceramics) tradition, also other works that treated folkloric themes. She returned to Istanbul in 1953 and established one of the first private ceramic studios in Turkey at the El Irak Apartment Building that she shared with her husband. 1954‚Äì1980 After divorcing Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali, Koral moved her home and studio to the entrance floor of the ≈ûakir Pasha Apartment Building. Her studio became a meeting place for young ceramic artists in the 1950s, including Ayda Arel, Alev Eb√ºzziya Siesbye and Leyla Sayar (Akkoyunlu), as well as Bing√ºl Ba≈üarƒ±r, Candeƒüer Furtun, Binay Kaya, and Mehmet T√ºz√ºm Kƒ±zƒ±lcan. Koral's studio served as a gathering point for the important figures in arts and culture of this period, including many prominent writers such as Melih Cevdet Anday, Azra Erhat, Sabahattin Ey√ºboƒülu, Vedat G√ºnyol, Ya≈üar Kemal, Cevat ≈ûakir Kabaaƒüa√ßlƒ± and Ahmet Hamdi Tanpƒ±nar. In 1957, F√ºreya was invited to the U.S. through a Rockefeller grant, and she continued her journey to Mexico to carry out research on the Aztec and Mayan cultures. The widespread mural tradition of Mexico reinforced Koral‚Äôs belief that art should not be incarcerated in museums and paved the way for the large panels she would make for public spaces. Upon her return to Istanbul in 1958, the artist designed ceramic coffee cups for the Pavilion of Turkey at the Expo '58 Brussels World Fair. She continued her collaborations with architects, ranging from Utarit Izgi to Haluk Baysal, Melih Birsel, Abdurrahman Hancƒ±, and Sel√ßuk Mil√¢r. She created large-scale panels for the Marmara Hotel on the grounds of the Atat√ºrk Forest Farm in 1959; the Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine in 1965; Ziraat Bank, Ba≈üak Insurance building, and Istanbul Textile Traders‚Äô Market in 1966; the Anafartalar Market in 1967; and the Divan Hotel in 1968. In the 1970s, she focused on designing objects using stoneware technique, and created an exclusive series for the Istanbul Porcelain Factory in Tuzla in 1973. The same year, Koral‚Äôs works were exhibited at Yapƒ± End√ºstri Merkezi [The Building Information Centre]. 1980‚Äì1997 Koral was Chair of the Ceramicists Association founded in 1980. However the Association was shut down under martial law following the 1980 coup d'√©tat. The artist produced the series Houses‚Äîone of her best known works‚Äîbetween 1980‚Äì85. Exhibited at Macka Art Gallery in Istanbul in 1985, these works were later awarded the Sedat Simavi Visual Arts Prize. In 1990, Koral exhibited terracotta figurines titled Walking People, alongside works by forty artists who joined the exhibition With Respect to Fureya Koral on her 40th Year in Art, organized by Macka Art Gallery. The artist died in 1997. Exhibitions > \\". . . For me ceramic art, first of all is like a tool, or a book, or music. > A tool to express the world, to make my own world come alive, a tool that > makes living and sharing possible. I mean ceramics are not just decorative > items or objects of consumption.\\" (F√ºreya Koral, from her interview with > Zeynep Oral, published in Milliyet Sanat on February 15, 1993) Koral participated in exhibitions at numerous galleries and institutions, including Salon d'Octobre, Paris; the Museum of Modern Art, Mexico City; Naprstkovo Museum, Prague; and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. among others. Opened in the fall of 2017, Koral's posthumous retrospective included over 200 artworks, presented along with archival materials such as letters and photographs. Organized by K√°roly Aliotti, Nil√ºfer ≈ûa≈ümazer and Farah Aksoy, the exhibition aimed to present a comprehensive study of her work, which has been overshadowed by the artist‚Äôs gender and family‚Äôs significant background in late Ottoman history and Turkey.

One of the most successful Danish drama series in the 70s was Matador (1978), which has been repeated many times as well as being released on DVD. For many years, Danish television drama suffered from what has been dubbed the \\"Matador complex\\": every new drama series would be marketed as \\"the new Matador\\" - only to be found, by both critics and the general viewing public, not to measure up in the event. Since the late 1990s, Danish television has once again enjoyed increasing success with a large number of drama series. Often aired in primetime on Sunday evenings, they have generally drawn large audiences, received very good reviews, and several have earned international awards. DR (Denmark's national public-service broadcasting organization) won four Emmy Awards for Best international drama series between 2002 and 2009, breaking a former UK monopoly in that category, as well as a fifth Emmy in the Best international TV Movie/Mini Series category. Danish film directors as well the Danish Film Institute have warned that the growth in television drama drains the Danish film industry of talent, particularly scriptwriters. They maintain that film producers operate on market conditions while particularly DR, funded by a broadcast receiving licence fee, is able to pay better salaries. The television stations are also able to offer longer contracts and more responsibility. In 2014 the success achieved by several Danish TV drama series in gaining international attention led Aarhus University to initiate a research project entitled What makes Danish TV drama series travel?. Its main hypothesis is that \\"specific transformations and value creations are happening at all stages in the production of several Danish TV drama series\\".http://danishtvdrama.au.dk Selected series *Huset p√• Christianshavn (literally: The House in Christianshavn) is a Danish TV series consisting of 84 episodes originally broadcast between 1970 and 1977.

In 2001 Flexenclosure is made a separate division of Pharmadule Emtunga and is now a stand-alone company based in Lidk√∂ping. In December 2003, 3i acquires Pharmadule Emtunga from IDI. Pharmadule Emtunga has 600 employees and conducts operations in Emtunga, Vara, Gothenburg and Stockholm. Emtunga Offshore AB On September 1, 2007, Pharmadule Emtunga AB has established its two operating divisions into two separate companies: Pharmadule AB and Emtunga Offshore AB. In October 2008 Emtunga Offshore AB applies for a company reconstruction. Emtunga Offshore AB decided on December 17, 2008 to apply for bankruptcy. This is the result of the company‚Äôs largest customer ‚Äì MPF Corp. Ltd ‚Äì having become insolvent and not being able to fulfill its commitments to Emtunga Offshore, amounting to approximately 100,000,000 SEK. It is also the result of the global financial crisis that has led to a weaker market climate and delayed projects. Emtunga Offshore has 140 employees in Arendal, Gothenburg and Emtunga, Vara. Leirvik Emtunga AB In February 2009 Norska Leirvik MT announced the foundation of the 100% owned Company, LEIRVIK Emtunga AB. LEIRVIK Emtunga will fabricate modular steel living quarters for international customers all over the world.

Publication The Poverty of Historicism was first written as a paper which was read in 1936, then updated and published as a book in 1957.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, \\"Historical Note\\" prefacing the book It was dedicated ‚ÄúIn memory of the countless men and women of all creeds or nations or races who fell victim to the fascist and communist belief in Inexorable Laws of Historical Destiny.‚Äù Synopsis The book is a treatise on scientific method in the social sciences. Popper defines historicism as: ‚Äúan approach to the social sciences which assumes that historical prediction is their principal aim‚Ä¶‚Äù.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, p. 3 He also remarks that ‚Äú[t]he belief ‚Ä¶ that it is the task of the social sciences to lay bare the law of evolution of society in order to foretell its future‚Ä¶ might be described as the central historicist doctrine.‚ÄùK Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, pp. 105-106 He distinguishes two main strands of historicism, a ‚Äúpro-naturalistic‚Äù approach which ‚Äúfavours the application of the methods of physics‚Äù,K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, p. 2 and the ‚Äúanti- naturalistic‚Äù approach which opposes these methods. The first two parts of the book contain Popper's exposition of historicist views (both pro- and anti- naturalistic), and the second two parts contain his criticism of them. Popper concludes by contrasting the antiquity of historicism (which, for example, Plato is said to have espoused) with the claims of modernity made by its twentieth-century adherents.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 33 Popper's criticisms of historicism Popper's criticisms of the poverty of the idea of historical prediction can broadly be split into three areas: fundamental problems with the idea itself, common inconsistencies in the arguments of historicists, and the negative practical effects of implementing historicist ideas. =Fundamental problems with historicist theory= i) A description of the whole of society is impossible because the list of characteristics making up such a description would be infinite. If we cannot know the whole of the present state of mankind it follows that we cannot know the future of mankind. ‚ÄúIf we wish to study a thing, we are bound to select certain aspects of it. It is not possible for us to observe or to describe a whole piece of the world, or a whole piece of nature; in fact, not even the smallest whole piece may be so described, since all description is necessarily selective.‚Äù K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 23, p. 77 ii) Human history is a single unique event. Knowledge of the past therefore does not necessarily help one to know the future. ‚ÄúThe evolution of life on earth, or of human society, is a unique historical process‚Ä¶ Its description, however, is not a law, but only a singular historical statement.‚Äù K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 27, p. 108 Study of history may reveal trends. However, there is no guarantee that these trends will continue. In other words: they are not laws; ‚Äúa statement asserting the existence of a trend at a certain time and place would be a singular historical statement and not a universal law.‚ÄùK Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 27, p. 115 In addition, given that historians are interested in the uniqueness of past events, it may be said that future events will possess a uniqueness that cannot be known in advance.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 30 iii) Individual human action or reaction can never be predicted with certainty, therefore neither can the future: ‚Äúthe human factor is the ultimately uncertain and wayward element in social life and in all social institutions. Indeed, this is the element which ultimately cannot be completely controlled by institutions (as Spinoza first saw); for every attempt at controlling it completely must lead to tyranny; which means, to the omnipotence of the human factor ‚Äì the whims of a few men, or even one.‚ÄùK Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 32, p. 158 Popper asserts that psychology cannot lead to a complete understanding of ‚Äúthe human factor‚Äù because ‚Äú‚Äôhuman nature‚Äô varies considerably with the social institutions, and its study therefore presupposes an understanding of these institutions.‚Äù iv) A law, natural (i.e. scientific) or social, may enable us to exclude the possibility of certain events but it does not allow us to narrow down the range of possible outcomes to only one.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 29 This follows from Popper‚Äôs theory of science: a hypothesis is proposed (it does not matter how the hypothesis was derived) and is then subjected to rigorous tests which aim to disprove the hypothesis. If no tests disprove the hypothesis it may become known as a law but in fact remains simply a so-far-unfalsified hypothesis. Equally, examples of where theories are correct are useless in proving the validity of the theory. v) It is logically impossible to know the future course of history when that course depends in part on the future growth of scientific knowledge (which is unknowable in advance).K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, preface =Common inconsistencies in the arguments of historicists= i) Historicists often require the remodelling of man to become fit for the future society or hasten the arrival of this society. Given that society is composed of mankind, remaking man for a particular society can lead to any type of society. Also, a need to remodel man suggests that without this remodelling, the new society may not come about, and is therefore not inevitable.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 21 ii) Historicists are bad at imagining conditions under which an identified trend ceases. Historical generalisations may be reduced to a set of laws of higher generality (i.e. one could say that history depends upon psychology). However, in order to form predictions from these generalisations we also need specific initial conditions. To the extent that conditions change or are changing, any ‚Äòlaw‚Äô may apply differently and trends may disappear.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 28 iii) Historicism tends to mistake historical interpretations for theories. When studying history we can only examine a limited aspect of the past. In other words, we must apply a ‚Äòhistorical interpretation‚Äô. It is necessary to appreciate a plurality of valid interpretations (although some may be more fertile than others).K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 31 iv) Confusing ends with aims: historicism tends to foster the idea that the aims of society are discernible in the trends of history, or what will inevitably come to pass becomes that which should come to pass. The aims of society may be more usefully thought as a matter of choice for that society.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 22 =Negative practical effects of implementing historicist ideas= i) Unintended consequences: the implementation of historicist programs such as Marxism often means a fundamental change to society. Due to the complexity of social interaction this results in many unintended consequences (i.e. it tends not to work properly). Equally it becomes impossible to tease out the cause of any given effect so nothing is learnt from the experiment/revolution. ii) Lack of information: large scale social experiments cannot increase our knowledge of the social process because as power is centralised to enable theories to put into practice, dissent must be repressed, and so it is harder and harder to find out what people really think, and so whether the utopian experiment is working properly. This assumes that a dictator in such a position could be benevolent and not corrupted by the accumulation of power, which may be doubted.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 24 In addition, Popper rejects the notion that history cannot be subject to experimentK Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 25 and that any ‚Äòlaws of history‚Äô can only apply to a particular historical period.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, section 26 Both of these ideas are treated as typical of the anti-naturalistic historicist approaches by Popper. =The positive side to historicism= Popper concedes that historicism has an appeal as an antidote to the idea that history is shaped by the actions of ‚Äògreat men‚Äô. =Popper's alternative= As an alternative to historicism, Popper puts forward his own preference for ‚Äúpiecemeal social engineering‚Äù whereby small and reversible changes are made to society in order to be best able to learn from the changes made. The unpredictability of the future makes the effect of any larger changes random and untraceable. Small changes enable one to make limited, but testable and therefore falsifiable statements about the effect of social actions.K Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, sections 20-21 Reception When published as a book in 1957, The Poverty of Historicism was hailed by the anti-communist author Arthur Koestler as \\"probably the only book published this year which will outlive the century.\\"978-0-415-27846-1 Publisher's description of the book The libertarian theorist Tom G. Palmer has described the work as \\"brilliant\\". Popper's usage of \\"historicism\\" has been criticized as differing significantly from the normal definition of the word.See, for example, Deborah A. Redman, Economics and the Philosophy of Science, New York, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 108‚Äì9. That is, amongst historians themselves, a historicist is normally someone whose methodology is cautiously hermeneutical and exegetical, rather than predictive and speculative. This is perhaps closer to what Popper calls \\"historism\\". The Marxist philosopher Karel Kos√≠k criticizes Popper's statement that \\"All knowledge, whether intuitive or discursive must be of abstract aspects, and we can never grasp the 'concrete structure of reality itself\\". Kos√≠k refers to him as \\"a leading contemporary opponent of the philosophy of concrete totality\\", and clarifies that, \\"Totality indeed does not signify all facts. Totality signifies reality as structured dialectical whole, within which any particular fact (or any group or set of facts) can be rationally comprehended\\" as \\"the cognition of a fact or of a set of facts is the cognition of their place in the totality of reality.\\" He considers Popper's work to be a part of atomist‚Äìrationalist theories of reality. Kosik declares: \\"Opinions as to whether cognition of all facts is knowable or not are based on the rationalist‚Äìempiricist idea that cognition proceeds by the analytic‚Äìsummative method. This idea is in turn based on the atomist idea of reality as a sum of things, processes and facts\\". Kos√≠k also suggests that Popper and like-minded thinkers (including Ferdinand Gonseth of Dialectica and Friedrich Hayek on The Counter-Revolution of Science) lack an understanding of dialectical processes and how they form a totality.

As of A2DP version 1.3, the Low Complexity Subband Coding remains the default codec and its implementation is mandatory for devices supporting that profile, but vendors are free to add their own codecs to match their needs. At CES 2020 the Bluetooth SIG announced LC3 as the successor of SBC. LC3 is used in the LE Audio protocol based on the Bluetooth 5.2 Core Specification. Design SBC supports mono and stereo streams, certain sampling frequencies up to 48 kHz. The codec does not have bitrate limitations, although manufacturers usually use maximum bit rates of 342 kbit/s for mono and 345 kbit/s for stereo streams. It uses 4 or 8 subbands, an adaptive bit allocation algorithm in combination with an adaptive block PCM quantizer. Frans de Bont has based the SBC audio codec on his earlier work,F. de Bont, M.

He played for Corinthians, from 1921 to 1927, and for Ypiranga after that. Both have their headquarters in S√£o Paulo city. From 1934 on, he became a painter. He was founder of Grupo Santa Helena, together with Fulvio Pennacchi, Aldo Bonadei, Humberto Rosa, Manuel Martins, Cl√≥vis Graciano, Mario Zanini, Alfredo Volpi and Alfredo Rizzotti. Rebolo is considered as one of the most important landscape painters of Brazilian art. His work is estimated in more than 3.000 paintings, hundreds of drawings, and a set of fifty engraving images. Besides landscapes, he also had an important work with portraits and still life paintings, particularly of flowers. Nowadays, Rebolo works figure in the main Brazilian museums, in the collection catalog of cultural and governmental organizations, as well as in privately held collections all over Brazil.

Established on September 29, 1951 to protect the natural features (grasslands, marshes, creeks, lakes and forests), typical of the Humid Chaco ecoregion, the park is included in the Ramsar Convention's list of wetlands of international importance. Topography The park occupies a large plain, which was formed when a depression in Paleozoic crystalline rocks was filled with organic and inorganic sediments, thus creating a sedimentary basin. The uppermost sediment levels are of fluvial and aeolian origin. The eastern parts of the park are dominated by silts and clays, creating less permeable soils, while the western parts contain soils that are coarser and more porous. There are faults that were generated during formation of the Andes, lying parallel to the Paraguay River. While the park's territory is gently sloping down from west to east, there is very little variety in elevation. The subtle differences become important in times of heavy rains and floods, when the area becomes inundated with pools of water connected by channels forming in the most low-lying areas. Hydrography An observation platform overlooking Laguna Blanca. The Pilcomayo River, after which the park is named, is the main watercourse of the area. During the wet season, the river and its tributaries flood the nearby areas, creating large swaths of interconnected lakes and marshes, most of which are temporary. The southern end of the park contains a larger lake called Laguna Blanca, which is a habitat for many waterfowl species and a resting point for migratory bird species coming from the Northern Hemisphere. Climate The park is located in a subtropical zone with annual mean temperature of and annual mean precipitation of . Summer temperatures can exceed , but during winters, frost is not uncommon. Winters are dry, while precipitation peaks in March and November. The area is affected by frequent tornadoes. Flora For the purposes of classifying the park's types of plants, the area can be divided into 4 distinct zones. One is savanna, which is dominated by the Caranday wax palm, an unofficial emblem of the area, towering over a dense cover of herbaceous plants (especially from the genus Scirpus). Other trees include such species as Acacia caven and Prosopis nigra. Wetlands are dominated by aquatic vegetation. Floating plants include water hyacinths, Limnocharitaceae, Nymphoides and Ludwigia. Another distinct zone is adjacent to the Pilcomayo River and its former channels, which are frequently flooded. It is dominated by riparian vegetation. Figs and sweetwood trees can be found there, covered by many species of lianas, vines and epiphytes. The patchy vegetation of the higher lands, forming distinctive \\"mountain islands\\", represent the fourth zone. Quebracho trees (Schinopsis balansae and Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco) can frequently be found there. Fauna A yacare caiman on a Laguna Blanca observation platform. Higher lands are inhabited by such mammals as the gray brocket, capybara, peccary, howler monkey and puma; birds include chachalacas and rails. The maned wolf can be found in the lowlands, along with such birds as the greater rhea and seriemas. Aquatic environments are inhabited by storks, herons, roseate spoonbills and ducks. There are two caiman species: the broad-snouted caiman and the yacare caiman. The fish population includes species from the Hoplosternum that can use atmospheric air and thus tolerate droughts that frequently affect shallow water bodies in the area. The snake population is represented by species such as the yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus) and Hydrodynastes gigas, a large water snake.

In August 1671, Lord Arlington ordered Merlin, carrying the English ambassador's wife Dorothy Osborne, to pass Dutch ships anchored near Brill; as agreed by treaty, the Dutch struck their flag in salute but failed to fire white smoke, a courtesy given to warships. Dutch commander Van Ghent later explained he was doubtful as to whether the Merlin came into that category and did not want to create a precedent. Dorothy Temple Sir George Downing, English ambassador in The Hague, was ordered to demand those responsible for this 'insult' be severely punished, which the States General of the Netherlands refused. Intended to raise public support for the war, it was so obviously manufactured that it had the opposite effect. Between 1681 and 1693, Merlin was employed by Captain Greenville Collins to complete a comprehensive survey of the British coastline, published in 1693 as Great Britain's Coasting Pilot; this makes it the first British warship dedicated to marine survey work, rather than exploration. Merlin was later used by Captain Greenville Collins to produce a complete survey of the coastline of the British coast. The work was published by Freeman Collins and sold by Richard Mount of London as the Great Britain's Coasting Pilot.

Gnessin's works The Maccabeans and The Youth of Abraham earned him the nickname the \\"Jewish Glinka\\". Early life and education Gnessin was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, the son of Rabbi Fabian Osipovich Gnessin and Bella Isaevna Fletzinger.Hundert, Gershon David.

His sisters went on to found the Gnessin State Musical College (now the Gnessin Russian Academy of Music), an elite music school in Moscow in 1895. Gnessin studied from 1892 to 1899 at the Rostov Technical Institute. In 1901, he entered the St. Petersburg Conservatory where he studied under Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Alexander Glazunov and Anatoly Lyadov. In 1905 he was expelled for taking part in a student strike during the Revolution of 1905. He was reinstated the following year. In 1908 his early work Vrubel won the Glinka Prize. That same year he helped found, along with Lazare Saminsky and others, the Society for Jewish Folk Music. During this period Gnessin continued to take part in Socialist activities, teaching music to factory workers at workmen's clubs. Among Gnessin's other early works was a 'symphonic fragment' (his Op. 4), based on Shelley's poem Prometheus Unbound. But much of his work at this time, and in the future, was associated with Jewish traditional musical styles which had become increasingly popular in Russia prior to 1914.Sitsky, Larry. (1994) Music of the Repressed Russian Avant- Garde, 1900-1929, pp.217, 242-243 & 247 Westport, CT: Greenwood Press > Just prior to the Revolution, Jewish music and musicians in Russia were > experiencing a nationalist boom. Figures such as Rimsky-Korsakov and Stasov > were actively encouraging the establishment of such a school...both Tsarist > and Soviet authorities were not too happy about this development, and gave > grudging permission for the folk side of Jewish culture to be established, > rather than an openly Jewish nationalist compositional movement. > Paradoxically, the number of Jewish performers within Russian culture was > huge, and included many world-famous names.Sitsky, Larry. (1994) Music of > the Repressed Russian Avant-Garde, 1900-1929, p. 217 Westport, CT: Greenwood > Press In 1911, Gnessin traveled abroad, studying in Berlin and Paris. He then spent a year (1912-1913) studying at Vsevolod Meyerhold's studio in St. Petersburg. In 1913, Meyerhold opened a small theatrical school known as Dr. Dapertutto's Studio.Leach, Robert. (2004) Makers of Modern Theatre: An Introduction, p. 59 London: Routledge In return for a nominal fee students were provided classes in theatre history, commedia dell'arte, Scenic Movement, and practical music and speech. The latter class was taught by Gnessin. > Actors in Dr Dapertutto's Studio in St Petersburg learned 'musicality', and > the voice and speech work was incorporated into a course called 'The Musical > Interpretation of Drama', taught by the composer Mikhail Gnessin. Gnessin > included in his classes simple and complex forms of choral speech and plenty > of singing, and indeed he analysed speech as song, so that actors often sang > longer speeches for an exercise. Later that year Gnessin returned to Rostov, where he continued to teach. He remained there until 1923. Igor Stravinsky, who knew Gnessin prior to the Revolution of 1917, described him years later: > Gnessin himself was a striking character. He dressed as an Orthodox Hebrew, > but at the same time was identified with radically anti-sectarian political > and social views. I once sent him a note, after we had dined together, > saying that I was delighted by our \\"sympathetic understanding.\\" He answered > me in a surprised and slightly shocked tone saying that he was sorry but I > had been mistaken; he had felt no such sympathy. That was typical of Gnessin > and, I suppose, it explains why I remember him.Stravinsky, Igor and Craft, > Robert. (1963) Dialogues and a Diary p. 47 Garden City, NY: Doubleday After the Revolution After the Revolution, Gnessin and his music, initially, fared quite well.Sitsky, Larry. (1994) Music of the Repressed Russian Avant-Garde, 1900-1929, pp. 217-218 Westport, CT: Greenwood Press Traditional Jewish art, including music, flourished during this period, and a Jewish nationalist school of music was encouraged by the new Soviet government.Moss, Kenneth B. (2009) Jewish Renaissance in the Russian Revolution Cambridge: Harvard Press Gnessin produced several works during this period, among them: Songs from the Old Country ( 1919); The Maccabees (1921); The Youth of Abraham (1922); Song of Songs (1922); The Jewish Orchestra at the Ball of the Town Bailiff (1926); Red-Headed Motele (1926-1929); Ten Jewish Songs (1927).Sitsky, Larry. (1994) Music of the Repressed Russian Avant-Garde, 1900-1929, p. 218 Westport, CT: Greenwood Press Pursuing his interest in traditional Jewish music, Gnessin traveled to Palestine in 1914, and again, in 1921.Hirshberg, Jehoash. (1996) Music in the Jewish Community of Palestine 1880-1948: A Social History pp. 44-46 & 80-82 Oxford: Clarendon Press During the latter visit he \\"secluded himself for a few months in the wild mountain scenery of Bab al Wad,\\" where he composed the first act of his opera The Youth of Abraham.Hirshberg, Jehoash. (1996) Music in the Jewish Community of Palestine 1880-1948: A Social History p. 81 Oxford: Clarendon Press He briefly considered emigrating to Palestine, but became \\"disenchanted\\" and returned to the Soviet Union.Hirshberg, Jehoash. (1996) Music in the Jewish Community of Palestine 1880-1948: A Social History Oxford: Clarendon Press Author and music critic David Ewen wrote, in Composers Today: > There is fire and madness in this music; the rhythms rush in every > direction, like winds in a hurricane. But there is a shimmering background > to all this chaos; a poignant voice in all this outburst. One hears in this > music the strange pathos of the Hebrews. The same pathos with which Isiah > warned his beloved race of a pending and inevitable doom, the same pathos > with which Israel thinks about its long exile in unfriendly countries - that > same pathos is to be found in Gnessin's operas. His teaching career also flourished. From 1923 to 1935 Gnessin taught at the Gnessin Institute; he was simultaneously employed as Professor of Composition at the Moscow Conservatory from 1925 to 1936. In 1945 Gnessin became head of the Gnessin Institute. Later career Gnessin, like many artists of Jewish descent, faced increasing discrimination in the 1930s. > The position of Jews in the Soviet Union has always been a difficult one in > that, unlike other ethnic minorities, Jewish culture has never received > official backing, except in the 1920s...For example, the five volume History > of Music of the Peoples of the USSR gives information on very small ethnic > minorities, while the Jews, number around three million, are ignored. After > the late 1930s, mention of Jewish music disappears from Soviet reference > books altogether. It is significant that the 1932 edition of the Great > Soviet Encyclopedia devoted eight-two pages to Jews; the 1952 edition has > one page (devoted to Jews)! In the bibliography to that meager article is a > classic anti-Semitic text from Germany. Gnessin was forced to abandon both his \\"progressive tendencies\\" and his interest in music with \\"an overtly Jewish theme\\".Edmunds, Neil. (2004) Soviet Music and Society under Lenin and Stalin: The Baton and Sickle. p. 225 New York: Routledge Curzon His teaching career also suffered. While he would retain his position as titular head of the Gnessin Institute until his death, in the late 1940s, Gnessin's sister, Elena, was compelled by Communist Party stalwarts to dismiss him from his teaching duties.Tassie, Gregor. (2010) Kirill Kondrashin: His Life in Music Scarecrow Press > Apart from the Conservatoire, other educational institutions incurred > repressions; as a consequence of the anti-cosmopolitanism campaign, the > Gnessin Music Institute received commands and notices from higher bodies to > fire various members of staff, the most distinguished being the composer and > teacher Mikhail Gnessin.

She discovered the > intimidating reports and slanderous letters given against her and Mikhail > Fabianovich. Sadly, there was no other course but to release her brother > from his teaching duties so as to avoid a worse fate. Gnessin's teaching career, and the discriminatory politics of his era, also meant that his compositions were less prolific after 1935. Gnessin counted Aram Khachaturian and Russian composer Tikhon Khrennikov among his pupils.Utechin, S.V. (1961) Everyman's Concise Encyclopaedia of Russia, p. 202 London: J.M.

In Kansas, the highway is a main north‚Äìsouth route that runs through the eastern end of the state from the Oklahoma border to Missouri border. Along the way US-169 intersects several major highways including US-400 by Cherryvale, US-54 by Iola, overlaps US-59 south of Garnett, overlaps I-35 from Olathe to Merriam, and in Kansas City begins an overlap with I-70, US-24 and US-40 which it follows into Missouri. Route description US-169 enters the state at Coffeyville as a four-lane road and is a four-lane highway for about until the edge of the Coffeyville Industrial Park. A segment between Chanute and Iola is a freeway with fully controlled access with center concrete barrier, with two lanes in each direction. US-169 runs concurrently with US-59 and K-31 starting about south of Garnett and diverges northeast again immediately south of Garnett. At Osawatomie the road becomes a full freeway and runs concurrently with K-7. In southern Johnson County US-169 becomes an expressway until its junction with Interstate 35 (I-35) in Olathe. From this point to the Missouri state line, US-169 alternates between freeways and surface streets. It follows I-35 to Shawnee Mission Parkway in Overland Park, then travels east to Rainbow Boulevard. US-169 then follows surface streets to its junction with I-70 near downtown Kansas City. US-169 and I-70 enter Missouri together just after crossing the Kansas River. History In a June 30, 1980 resolution, US-169 and K-57 were realigned to run directly north‚Äìsouth through Iola. Also at this time, K-269 was first designated a state highway and ran from K-57 and US-169 north to US-54. In a September 20, 1991, resolution, it was proposed to realign K-57 and US-169 over K-269. The project was completed on October 31, 1999, and at that time, K-269 was decommissioned and became part of the new K-57 and US-169. The intersection immediately south of Garnett used to be a braided intersection with stop and yield signs; it was identified as a high crash location in 2001, and was rebuilt as a roundabout that opened in April 2006.Slide 1 The Kansas Department of Transportation is rebuilding or planning to rebuild several other rural intersections as roundabouts for increased safety.

History18th Street Expressway= The 18th Street Expressway was the result of one of four feasibility studies conducted by the Kansas Turnpike Authority to extend the turnpike by providing easy access to northeast Johnson County. It was the only one of the four studies to be followed upon, with completion of the 18th Street Expressway Bridge over the Kansas River completed in 1959. It replaced the Argentine Boulevard bridge over the river behind the modern-day BNSF railroad yard. Originally, the highway was part of the original K-58. Upon completion of the bridge, US-69 was rerouted onto the expressway from Southwest Boulevard (the section of which has since been renamed to Merriam Drive). In 1979, the K-58 designation was removed. The section of 18th Street between I-70 and the southern end of the Kansas River bridge was tolled at least as late as 1984. =Reconstruction= In early April 2020, a $21.8 million construction project to finish a four-lane expressway from Pittsburg to Kansas City began. The project will expand a section of US-69 in Crawford County to a four-lane divided expressway, from the K-47 junction north to north of Arma. The project will be completed by Koss Construction Company of Topeka and will be completed by August 2021.

CrunchBang was designed to use comparatively few system resources. Instead of a desktop environment it used a customized implementation of the Openbox window manager. Many of its preinstalled applications used the GTK+ widget toolkit. CrunchBang had its own software repository but drew the vast majority of packages from Debian's repositories. Philip Newborough announced on 6 February 2015 that he had stopped developing CrunchBang and that users would benefit from using vanilla Debian. Some Linux distributions have arisen in its place in an effort to continue its environment. Among the most significant are BunsenLabs and CrunchBang++.

The \\"Lite\\" version was effectively discontinued after the distribution on which it was based ‚Äì Ubuntu 9.04 ‚Äì reached its end-of-life and CrunchBang prepared to switch to a different base system. CrunchBang 10, made available in February 2011, was the first version based on Debian. The final version, CrunchBang 11, was made available on 6 May 2013. Each CrunchBang Linux release was given a version number as well as a code name, using a name of a Muppet Show character.

History The base was built in 1942 with the creation of RAF Hamworthy. In 1944, control of the site was handed over to the Royal Navy for use as a naval establishment. The site was known as HMS Turtle and was used for training personnel for the D-Day landings. In May 1944, the site was closed but a small number of personnel were retained for basic maintenance of the base. The site was re-opened and taken over by the Royal Marines in 1954 and became known as the Amphibious School, Royal Marines. In 1956, it was expanded and was renamed the Joint Service Amphibious Warfare Centre (JSAWC). In the early 1960s, it was renamed the Amphibious Training Unit Royal Marines (ATURM). The Technical Training Wing was moved from Eastney Barracks to Poole in 1973 and the base became known as the Royal Marines Poole. 1 Assault Group Royal Marines, which are responsible for landing craft training, was formed at the site in October 2001 but moved to RM Tamar in August 2013.

Best known as a playwright, she also writes short stories and essays and is a freelance dramaturg, director and occasional performer. She leads a parallel life as a teacher of creative writing and late-blooming academic researcher, in the Higher Education sector.  Early life  Peta graduated from Killara High School, Sydney in 1975. In 1979 she graduated from the University of New South Wales NSW with a Bachelor of Arts, and Honours in Drama, and went on to complete her Diploma of Education at the University of Sydney in 1980. She then began work as a high-school teacher of English and History, but remained involved in fringe and community theatre throughout her teaching career. In 1989 she began writing full-time. Several of her plays were subsequently published by Currency Press. Her short stories have been published by Sleepers, and Scribe. Playwright Murray's first play The Procrastinator was produced by the Griffin Theatre Company in 1981. Her best-known play, Wallflowering, was workshopped at the Australian National Playwrights' Conference in 1988, and went on to have numerous productions in Australia and overseas. Other works include Salt, Spitting Chips, an adaptation of Tim Winton‚Äôs novella Blueback, The Procedure, and The Keys to the Animal Room produced by Junction Theatre Company in South Australia.\\"AusStage Online\\" Community theatre works include This Dying Business produced by Junction Theatre Company and The Law of Large Numbers by Mainstreet Theatre company in Mount Gambier. In 2006, she wrote Room, for Playworks and the Melbourne Writers Festival. In 2010 two ‚Äòmicro-plays‚Äô featured in Finucane & Smith‚Äôs The Carnival of Mysteries at the Melbourne International Arts Festival. She has since developed and produced an epic new work for performance entitled Things That Fall Over: an (anti-)musical of a novel inside a reading of a play, with footnotes, and oratorio-as-coda. This was presented as a marathon of an extravaganza over five hours at Footscray Community Arts Centre on 1 March 2014 to mark International Women's Day. It featured a women's community choir working alongside well known artists and performers including Caroline Lee, Margaret Dobson, Liz Welch, Lisa Maza, and, as Verity in the musical coda, Swansong!!! The Musical!!! the legendary Margret RoadKnight. Music was composed by Peta Williams, choreography was by Robin Laurie and musical direction was by Jo Trevathan. In 2016 Murray made first forays into live art performance and installation-based work. She presented Litanies for the Forgetful as part of the embOLDen exhibition at Footscray Community Arts Centre, and returned the following year to perform Missa Pro Venerabilibus: A Mass for the Ageing, alongside Robin Laurie and Heather Horrocks. This project was staged as part of Melbourne Fringe Festival, and made in collaboration with scenographers Rachel Burke and Jane Murphy, with whom Murray continues to work. In 2018 she presented vigil/wake at Arts House, North Melbourne, under the banner of the Mere Mortals season. This work, first staged as part of the Melbourne International Festival project, Survival Skills for Desperate Times, continues to evolve. A tourable pop-up version was presented at the Public Health Palliative Care International Conference, in Leura, NSW. 2019 also saw Murray return to playwriting, with the premiere season of an immersive and participatory work for children, On Our Beach, created for and staged in Fremantle, Western Australia, by Spare Parts Puppet Theatre. It was directed by Philip Mitchell, designed by Cecile Williams, and featured original music by Lee Buddle.  Other activities  Peta Murray taught writing at the University of Western Australia Extension Service in the late 1980s, and spent eight weeks as Writer in the Community at Araluen Centre for Arts and Entertainment in Alice Springs in 1991. She has workers as a freelance dramaturg and director, taught playwriting at the University of Melbourne, and for RMIT University, at Melbourne's CAE, and as co-facilitator of The Blak Writers Lab for Ilbijerri Theatre. In 2010 Murray co-founded, with clinical psychologist Kerrie Noonan, the not-for-profit arts-and-health organisation The GroundSwell Project. Its focus was on challenging Australia's culture of medicalised, institutionalised death and dying, and promoting a public health approach to deliver increased agency and broader choices at end-of-life. Murray served this organisation for many years in a pro bono capacity as its Creative Director before both she and Noonan stepped away in 2019. In the early years of the organisation Murray and Noonan ran three successful iterations of The Drama Project with students and Drama Teacher Nicole Bonfield at Penrith Selective High School. In its first year its intergenerational arts-and-health project: Rain-dancing For Beginners, conducted in partnership with MND NSW won a 2010 Excellence in the Arts in Palliative Care award at the Art of Good Health and Wellbeing, Second International Arts and Health Conference, in Melbourne. The Drama Project was later the subject of a documentary by filmmaker Jordan Byron. In its early years The Groundswell Project also delivered the FilmLife in partnership with the Organ and Tissue Authority, Busting Cancer - a body casting project in Western Sydney for women, and events within the Hidden program at Sydney's Rookwood Cemetery. Murray also devised and ran workshops on Writing Loss, while Noonan's focus included research projects such as the development of the first national Australia-wide Death Literacy Index, and community programs including Ten Things To Know Before You Go. They later established an annual event, Dying to Know Day, since held in August each year. Since 2010 Murray has also completed a Diploma of Creative Industries at Victoria University, and two postgraduate degrees, a Master of Arts in playwriting through QUT, and a creative practice-based PhD through RMIT University. Her doctoral project Essayesque Dismemoir: w/rites of elder-flowering employed variations of the ‚Äòperformance essay‚Äô to devise participatory nonfiction on the embodied experience of ageing. As part of her project, awarded in 2017, she produced a triptych of new works, under the title Ware With A Translucent Body. Since 2018 Murray has held an appointment as a Vice-Chancellor's Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Media & Communication at RMIT, where she is an active member of the non/fictionLab, and one third of the research collective, The Symphony of Awkward, with Dr Stayci Taylor and Dr Kim Munro. The Symphony of Awkward conduct practice-led research in an emergent-field they call diarology. Peta's own research also concerns the use of transdisciplinary and arts-based practices as modes of inquiry and forms of cultural activism. Her current focus, within the emergent field of arts-and- health, is the use playful and material thinking to develop coherent narrative spaces to promote meaning-making, in the face of illness, grief and loss.  Awards  Her play Salt won the 2001 Louis Esson Prize for Drama in the Victorian Premier's Literary Awards. Murray has won Australian Writers' Guild awards for Spitting Chips (Theatre in Education/Community Theatre Category, 1990), The Keys to the Animal Room, (Theatre in Education/Community Theatre Category and Major Award Winner, 1994) and Blueback (Theatre for Young People, 2000). In 2003, Murray was awarded an Australian Government Centenary Medal for Services to Society and Literature.

Etymology The word was in use in the 19th century and probably earlier, meaning 'white', when referring to buffalo. An 1840 book noted that people preferred 'bulei' (white) buffalo to 'hitam' (which is the current Indonesian word for black). An 1869 Malay-Dutch dictionary notes the words 'balar', 'sabun' and 'andan' as referring to 'white people' (wit mensch) and 'albinos'. An 1894 Malay-English dictionary noted the words 'andan' and 'bulei' as referring to albinos, and 'sabun' (a word in current usage as soap) as an adjective for all-white dogs, and for albinos. The word 'balar' is given as an adjective meaning white in the context of buffalos, and also albinos. A 1948 Javanese Indonesian dictionary notes boel√©, balar and boelai as a suffix to the Javanese 'wong' or 'person', in Indonesian 'orang balar' or 'orang saboen'. Subsequent dictionaries may define 'bule' simply as albino. However, in current usage the English loanword, albino is more commonly used. Usage In spoken form, the word may be used by street vendors to attract tourists or foreigners' attention. Because some westerners find the word insulting, more cautious street vendors use the term Mister, which foreigners find more polite. As an alternative to 'bule', the adjective 'barat' (literally means west, as in Western) may be an alternative. Compare with g√ºero. As a word for foreigner, the term can have pejorative intent, and some resident Europeans find it stereotypical and offensive. Others have embraced the term, as with 'bule gila', (crazy bule), shortened to 'bugil' (the Indonesian for nude). The term 'bugil' is used by a minority of Caucasians in Indonesia who like to be perceived as eccentric.https://www.tabloidbintang.com/berita/polah/read/28341/the-bugils- sekelompok-bule-gila-ingin-bawa-pocong-go- internationalhttps://www.baliadvertiser.biz/bule_gila/  See also  * Laowai, in China * Gaijin, in Japan * Pendatang, in Malaysia * Ang mo, in Singapore and Taiwan * Gweilo, in Southern China, Hong Kong and Macau * Farang, in Thailand  References  External links  * Bule * \\"Bule - The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\" * \\"The Latest Trend: Date a Bule?\\" Category:Ethnic and religious slurs Category:Indonesian words and phrases Category:Slang ","title":"Bule"},{"id":"20866763","text":"Todo Me Recuerda a Ti (Spanish for \\"Everything Reminds Me of You\\") is the fifth studio album by Scottish singer Sheena Easton.

It is colored bright red to pale brown, around 400 millimeters in length, and has tassel-like appendages that aid its camouflage. This species lies in ambush, motionless and disguised amongst corals, where it awaits prey which it sucks into its large and quick mouth. A row of poisonous spines are found along the dorsal region which it is able to make erect when threatened. Scorpaena sumptuosa is also known as the Western red scorpionfish, or scorpioncod.

Built in 1889, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Paper Mill Village Bridge is located adjacent to a former paper mill building, located on the south side of State Route 67A, just south of the campus of Bennington College, northwest of downtown Bennington. It is a single-span Town lattice truss structure, long and wide, with a roadway width of (one lane). It rests on stone abutments that have been partially faced in concrete. The sides are clad in vertical board siding, while the portal ends are finished in horizontal flushboard siding. The side walls only rise part of the way to the roof, which shelters the upper portions of the trusses. A number of the truss members have been doubled to strengthen them, and there are also additional floor beams. The Paper Mill Bridge was built in 1889 by Charles F. Sears, whose family was prominent in the local bridge-building business. The bridge, which is the longest covered bridge in Bennington County, is similar in design to the nearby Silk Covered Bridge, whose design is sometimes attributed to Sears' father Benjamin.

He was ordained deacon on December 8, 1834 and priest on July 24, 1836. His first parishes were in Saugerties and Buffalo, New York. His brothers, Francis Lister Hawks and William Nassau Hawks, were also Episcopal priests. Hawks married Ann Jones in 1835. He became rector of Christ Church, St. Louis, Missouri in 1844, in what was then the Diocese of Missouri and Indiana. After the diocese was divided, Hawks became the bishop of Missouri. He was the 44th bishop in the ECUSA, and was consecrated on October 20, 1844 by Bishops Philander Chase, Jackson Kemper, and Samuel Allen McCoskry. He received a D.D. from the University of Missouri in 1847. During his service as bishop, he continued to be the rector of Christ Church, serving in both positions until 1854, when he relinquished the rectorship. During a cholera epidemic in 1849, Hawks ministered to the sick of the city. He became ill in 1867, and asked Bishop Thomas H. Vail of Kansas to assist in his parish visitations.

He recorded it with Ernest Tubb's band, the Texas Troubadours and Western Swing fiddler-vocalist Wade Ray with studio musicians Jimmy Wilkerson and Hargus \\"Pig\\" Robbins. At the time of the recording, Nelson was a regular on a syndicated TV show hosted by Tubb. Background From 1965 to 1971, Nelson would make some 150 appearances on Ernest Tubb‚Äôs syndicated television show, serving as the face of modern country in contrast to Tubb‚Äôs traditional honky-tonk appeal. A lifelong fan of Tubb, Nelson later stated, \\"I could compare Ernest Tubb to Frank Sinatra, in that they both had distinctive styles that you wouldn't confuse with anybody else.\\" Nelson, who had already recorded one album with Chet Atkins for RCA after moving there from Liberty, later recalled, ‚ÄúThe Ernest Tubb Show was something else entirely, different from the sparkled-and spangled look of the Opry...My usual outfit was a plain turtleneck and black slacks. Nothing fancy. But it was more casual clothes that made me comfortable.‚Äù It was due to his association with the show that Tubb‚Äôs band the Texas Troubadours wound up backing him on his second RCA LP. Recording & Composition Unlike his previous three albums, Country Favorites: Willie Nelson Style contains no original songs but rather cover tunes by fellow songwriters and singers such as Hank Cochran, Harlan Howard, Leon Payne, and George Jones. Like his second Liberty album, the recording made in mid-December 1965 had a strong western swing flavour, and the paring with the Troubadours made musical and commercial sense, since they knew Willie‚Äôs work from the television show and tours and were regarded as an ensemble with enough appeal to make their own records for Decca without Ernest. Country Favorites was arguably Nelson‚Äôs finest artistic achievement up to that point, with Lang Thompson of AllMusic observing, ‚ÄúNelson had already learned how to handle his unconventional voice effectively, giving these songs the honest freshness and sharp sense of rhythm that would characterize his later work.‚Äù Nelson first started playing ‚ÄúColumbus Stockade Blues‚Äù as a ‚Äújazzy up-tempo number too fast for the dancers‚Äù while touring with wife Shirley Collie and steel guitarist Jimmy Day as The Offenders. Nelson biographer Joe Nick Patoski notes that the reprisal of the song on this album ‚Äúwould have been better left off compared with the fiery earlier versions he‚Äôd recorded with Shirley Collie for Liberty Records...‚Äù Although Nelson respected Atkins, he later admitted to being unhappy with the producer‚Äôs formulaic approach: :I was patient. I went along with the same process on my second RCA record, Country Favorites: Willie Nelson Style. This time it was all covers, no originals, including ‚ÄúSan Antonio Rose,‚Äù the calling card of my idol, Bob Wills. I still found the production heavy-handed and wondered why Chet was so adamant about putting the word ‚Äúcountry‚Äù in the title. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre going for that mainstream audience, doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòcountry‚Äô restrict me?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but ask. ‚ÄúOne step at a time,‚Äù Chet answered...‚Äù Whatever you say,‚Äù I said, but I remained unconvinced. In 1970, RCA issued an abridged version of this album as \\"Columbus Stockade Blues\\" on the budget RCA Camden label (CAS-2444). Reception Country Favorites was released in early 1966 and stayed on the country charts for seventeen weeks, peaking at number 9. AllMusic: ‚ÄúPerhaps because the album is a collection of familiar songs, Nelson's idiosyncratic vocals went over better - or maybe his time had just come - but in any case, it's certainly a small treasure.‚Äù Track listing #\\"Columbus Stockade Blues\\" (Eva Sargent, Jimmie Davis) ‚Äì 1:58 #\\"Seasons of My Heart\\" (George Jones, Darrell Edwards) ‚Äì 2:44 #\\"I'd Trade All of My Tomorrows (For Just One Yesterday)\\" (Jenny Lou Carson) ‚Äì 2:24 #\\"My Window Faces the South\\" (Mitchell Parish, Abner Silver) ‚Äì 1:42 #\\"Go on Home\\" (Hank Cochran) ‚Äì 2:14 #\\"Fraulein\\" (Lawton Williams) ‚Äì 2:56 #\\"San Antonio Rose\\" (Bob Wills) ‚Äì 2:07 #\\"I Love You Because\\" (Leon Payne) ‚Äì 2:58 #\\"Don't You Ever Get Tired (Of Hurting Me)\\" (Hank Cochran) ‚Äì 3:00 #\\"Home in San Antone\\" (Fred Rose) ‚Äì 1:40 #\\"Heartaches by the Number\\" (Harlan Howard) ‚Äì 2:19 #\\"Making Believe\\" (Jimmy Work) ‚Äì 2:53 Personnel *Willie Nelson ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Buddy Charleton ‚Äì pedal steel *Jack Drake ‚Äì bass *Jack Greene ‚Äì drums *Wade Ray ‚Äì fiddle *Leon Rhodes ‚Äì guitar *Hargus Robbins ‚Äì piano *Cal Smith ‚Äì rhythm guitar *James Wilkerson ‚Äì bass, vibraphone *Jim Malloy ‚Äì engineer ReferencesBibliography  Category:1969 albums Category:Willie Nelson albums Category:Albums produced by Chet Atkins Category:Covers albums Category:Buddah Records albums ","title":"Country Favorites-Willie Nelson Style"},{"id":"20866931","text":"Curious George Goes to the Hospital is a children's book written and illustrated by Margret Rey and H. A. Rey and published by Houghton Mifflin in 1966. It is the seventh and final book in the original Curious George series, and tells the story of George's experiences in a hospital after swallowing a puzzle piece (from a jigsaw puzzle). The book was inspired by employees at the Boston Children's Hospital, who reached out to the Cambridge-based Reys to ask for help children prepare for going to the hospital.  Plot  George wakes up to find a box that says \\"surprise\\" on the desk, which is a jigsaw puzzle with around two dozen (24) pieces. George simply had to open it. He took one out and it looked like a piece of candy. Thinking it is a piece of candy, he (unsuccessfully) eats a colorful puzzle piece. The Man with the Yellow Hat comes home and (at first, not knowing that George had eaten a puzzle piece before he got home) tells George that the jigsaw puzzle was a surprise for him. They both work on it. Finally, the puzzle was almost \\"finished\\", except for the missing piece. Unable to find the other missing piece (and unable to finish the puzzle), they go to bed. The next morning, George has a stomachache (from swallowing the puzzle piece the night before) and is too sick to eat his breakfast. Worried, The Man (still not knowing that George had swallowed a puzzle piece; which he had been wondering all night why the last piece from their jigsaw puzzle had gone missing) calls the doctor (Dr. Baker). Dr. Baker tries to find the problem, but the doctor turns to be no help, so he recommends that George should go to the hospital. The Man reassures George at the hospital, saying \\"Don't worry. You have been here when you broke your leg\\" (what he states is a reference to the other previous book from the Curious George classic series books; Curious George Takes a Job). George is given a barium meal from a nurse down a long hallway. Then, he goes to the x-ray room. Even though George had thought that he would get an apron like the doctor and the Man, he did not. After the x-ray is over, the x-ray picture shows the undigested puzzle piece lodged in George's stomach when he swallowed the piece the night before (after the doctor says that there must be something with the patient George which should not be). The doctor and the man look at the printed document from the x-ray and later discover the (unsuccessfully) eaten puzzle piece. The man (who looks at the picture and discovers the puzzle piece) says that it was the puzzle piece missing from their jigsaw puzzle and was why he and George were unable to finish the puzzle the night before (saying, \\"That must be the puzzle piece which was missing from our jigsaw puzzle yesterday!\\"). Now the Man finally knows that George had swallowed the puzzle piece all along (which is why George had a tummy ache all this time since morning). He had a tummy ache the whole time (which is why he did not want to eat his breakfast that morning) and now the Man and the doctor finally noticed it when they took him to the x-ray. The doctor says that he at least knows it is clear exactly what is wrong with George. He then explains that since that is what is wrong with George, a small operation is needed to remove it. He reveals out that a tube is needed to take the puzzle piece out of George's stomach. Later, George is admitted to the children's ward waiting room where they meet Betsy and her mother. Betsy is scared because this is her first time in a hospital. She did not want to go to the hospital. George meets a nurse named Carol, who takes him to the children's ward where George‚Äôs temperature and blood pressure are recorded, and he is given a pill and a shot to put him to sleep then wheeled into surgery. After surgery, George is groggy and does not want to read a new book about a dog the Man has, and goes back to sleep. When George wakes up feeling better the next morning, he has some ice cream. As for Betsy, still not liking the hospital and watching George, she seems a little less sad. A boy named Steve in a wheelchair (called a \\"go cart\\" in the book) who has a broken leg, says that tomorrow he will be able to walk again, pleased about the news, George continues eating his ice cream. The next morning, George is then taken to the play room where he starts doing things to break Betsy out of her sadness. He puts on a puppet show, then stands on a turntable and spins around until he flies off. The kids laugh and Betsy smiles. A play lady picks up George and returns him to the children's ward for a nap, she also explains that the mayor is going to visit the hospital, and later, he will be going home. When George wakes up from his nap, he sees that Steve is trying to walk. With no one looking, George hops into his wheelchair and races down the corridors. By the time the nurse notices, George is heading down a steep ramp towards a hospital cafeteria. There, a couple of attendants are seen pushing food carts and a mayor is shown around the hospital. George crashes into the carts (and lands in the mayor's arms), spilling food (spinach, scrambled eggs, and strawberry jam) and breaking the wheelchair and the dishes (which makes the attendants complain; one about the dishes says, \\"YOU BROKE ALL MY DISHES!\\" while another as for the wheelchair says, \\"HE RUINED THE GO CART!\\"). The kids see the accident and the first to laugh is Betsy. This gets everyone laughing except George who cries, thinking he might be punished. Betsy consoles George, telling him this is what finally made her smile and be happy. The mayor tells George that even though he made a terrible mess, he also made the sad little Betsy happy. The adults agree George is not in trouble because he made Betsy happy, and the Man arrives to take him home. Then the adults say goodbye to George and remind him to \\"take care of himself\\". As they are about to leave, everybody (including Betsy and Steve) waved goodbye through the windows and Nurse Carol gives George a present to take home. At home George finds it to be the puzzle piece he swallowed. The Man (after George unwraps the paper and opens the gift box that held the puzzle piece) sees it was the last missing piece. He is happy that the doctor and nurse had saved it for them. Then the Man (about the puzzle) says, \\"So now, we can finish the puzzle!\\". Now able to finish the puzzle, they complete the puzzle (placing the last missing piece; which is in the center of the jigsaw puzzle). In the end, the now-completed puzzle reveals to be a picture of George on the grass of the jungle with the Man's yellow hat in front of him.

The estate is located in the western hills of Oakville, California within the Oakville AVA, in the Napa Valley AVA zone. Harlan Estate has been described as \\"the ultimate cult winery\\", with its limited availability, prices and status akin to those of Screaming Eagle. Its flagship Harlan Estate is one of the most sought-after Californian wines on the market, with the average price per bottle reaching $1,012. In addition to the estate wine, there is produced a second wine named The Maiden. History In 1984, H. William Harlan, a real estate developer and Napa Valley resort owner, purchased a property, a forested area, with steep hillsides, multiple elevations and exposures, west of Martha's Vineyard in Oakville, and proceeded to clear for viticulture, with Harlan's expressed ambition to \\"create a first growth wine\\". The first Harlan Estate wine label, a design inspired by a 19th- century engraving which was overseen by retired U.S. Treasury engraver Herb Fichter, was 10 years in the making, from when Bill Harlan first started his search for an engraver to the release of the 1990 vintage in 1996. On its qualities, Harlan has stated, \\"It was a label designed for a bottle that would sit on a table in candlelight, not on a store shelf.\\" Described by Jancis Robinson as \\"one of the ten best wines of the twentieth century\\", and consistent acclaim from Wine Spectator, and Robert Parker, including four scores of 100 \\"parker points\\", have further contributed to the wine's high prices and long waiting lists. Released at $850 per bottle, the price soon rises on the speculative market, and the cost may range from $1200 and up. A 10-vintage vertical selection of magnum bottles sold at the 2000 Napa Valley Wine Auction for $700,000. The Director of Wine Making, Bob Levy, has worked with Harlan since 1983 when Harlan took part in founding the Merryvale Winery, and since 1989 the estate has retained Michel Rolland as consultant enologist. Construction of the current winery was completed in 2002. Production The estate extends , of which approximately 15% of the land, is cultivated with the grape varieties Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.  BOND  Beginning production in 1997, Harlan also founded BOND, which is a small portfolio of wines \\"Grand Cru\\" in quality, all under the umbrella of one philosophy, one team, and one mark.

McInerney later played a key role with Galway for almost a decade, and won one All-Ireland medal and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team at various times, McInerney won three Railway Cup medal. At club level he was a one-time intermediate championship medallist with Sixmilebridge. McInerney also lined out with Liam Mellows. Throughout his career McInerney made a combined total of 26 championship appearances for Clare and Galway. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1983 championship. McInerney is widely regarded as one of Galway's greatest-ever hurlers. He has often been voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at full-back on the Fitzgibbon Cup Hurling Team of the Century. In retirement from playing, McInerney became involved in team management and coaching. At schools level he was involved in coaching the Galway vocational schools' hurlers to a remarkable sixteen All-Ireland titles, including a record eight-in-a-row. He also helped Moneenageisha Vocational School to two All-Ireland titles. McInerney later served as a selector with the Galway senior team. Playing careerClub= McInerney began his club career at juvenile level with Sixmilebridge. His first success was an under-16 B championship medal in 1963. In 1971 Sixmilebridge reached the final of the intermediate championship. McInerney was at left corner-back, however, he had a disappointing game. In the end, Sixmilebridge crushed Tubber by 4‚Äì14 to 4‚Äì4, and McInerney won a championship medal. After moving to Galway McInerney joined the Liam Mellows club. =Inter-county= In the mid sixties McInerney first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Clare minor hurling team. He later joined the under-21 side, before making a number of appearances for the Clare seniors. McInerney made his senior championship debut with Galway on 7 July 1974 in a 3‚Äì19 to 4‚Äì10 All-Ireland quarter-final defeat of Kildare. In 1975 Galway made a long-awaited breakthrough. A 4‚Äì9 to 4‚Äì6 defeat of Tipperary gave McInerney a National Hurling League medal. Galway later qualified for an All-Ireland final meeting with reigning champions Kilkenny, their first appearance in the championship decider in seventeen years and the very first seventy-minute final. Playing with the wind in the first half, Galway found themselves 0‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì3 down at the interval having played poorly. Early in the second half Kilkenny scored an early 1‚Äì3 to put this game to bed, and although Galway did reply with 1‚Äì1 and were only four points behind with twenty-five minutes left on the clock, there was never any doubt in this match. Galway were eventually defeated by 2‚Äì22 to 2‚Äì10. In spite of this defeat McInerney later won his first All-Star award. Four years later Galway shocked four-in-a- row hopefuls Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and qualified for an All- Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny. In one of the worst All-Ireland finals of the decade, Galway goalkeeper S√©amus Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A 70-yards free by Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day for McInerney's side as Kilkenny went on to win by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8. In 1980 Galway defeated Kildare and Offaly to reach a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Munster champions Limerick provided the opposition on this occasion and an exciting championship decider followed. Bernie Forde and P. J. Molloy goals for Galway meant that the men from the west led by 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì5 at half-time. √âamonn Cregan single-handedly launched the Limerick counter-attack in the second-half. Over the course of the game he scored 2‚Äì7, including an overhead goal and a point in which he showed the ball to full-back Conor Hayes and nonchalantly drove the ball over the bar. It was not enough to stem the tide and Galway went on to win the game by 2‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì9. It was Galway's first All-Ireland title since 1923, with McInerney picking up a winners' medal and the celebrations surpassed anything ever seen in Croke Park. McInerney later collected a second All-Star award. McInerney played his last championship game on 7 August 1983, when Galway were defeated by Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final. =Inter-provincial= McInerney also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. In 1979 McInerney was at full-back as Connacht reached the inter- provincial decider. A 1‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9 defeat by Leinster was the result on that occasion. McInerney was moved to corner-back in 1980 as Connacht faced Railway Cup specialists Munster in the decider. A low-scoring game followed, however, a 1‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì7 victory gave Connacht their first Railway Cup title since 1947. It was McInerney's first winners' medal in the competition. After surrendering their title the following year, Connacht reached the Railway Cup decider once again in 1982. A 3‚Äì8 t 2‚Äì9 defeat of Leinster gave McInerney a second Railway Cup medal. Connacht reached the Railway Cup final again in 1983. A 0‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì5 victory gave McInerney his third Railway Cup medal, while the province retained the title for the first time in their history. Personal life Born in Sixmilebridge, County Clare, McInerney moved to Galway during his studies at University College Galway. He settled in the city and found employment as a teacher of science and maths at Moneenageisha Vocational School. McInerney later married Mary Gilmore, a medical doctor from Moylough and the couple had three sons: Shane, Daragh and Niall. His grandchildren are Laida McInerney, Ainara McInerney, Saioa McInerney, Garce McInerney and Shane McInerney McInerney died on 22 November 2004 following a short illness.

New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000‚Äì. metmuseum.org (October 2001) Amanitore is mentioned in a number of texts as a ruler. These include the temple at the Nubian capital of Napata in present-day Sudan, in a temple in Mero√´ near Shendi, again in Sudan, and at the Naqa Lion Temple. Images of Natakamani frequently include an image of Amanitore; however, it could be that Amanitore was his mother rather than his wife. A Kandake was a powerful position in the hierarchy of Kush. The mothers would rule and create their sons as rulers, but they also deposed their own sons too. In fact, a Kandake could order the king to commit suicide to end his rule, an order that he was required to follow. Amanitore is buried in her own pyramid in Mero√´. The tomb is approximately six metres square at its base, and not a pyramid in the mathematical sense. Some sources say otherwise, but she is said to be mentioned in the Bible in the story about the conversion of the Ethiopian in Acts 8:26‚Äì40: Amanitore was among the last great Kush builders. She was involved in restoring the large temple for Amun at Mero√´ and the Amun temple at Napata after it was demolished by the Romans. Reservoirs for the retention of water also were constructed at Mero√´ during her reign. The two rulers also built Amun temples at Naqa and Amara.

This anti-personnel weapon was developed in the early 1950s and carried 35 milliliters of anthrax spores or another pathogen. History Around October 1953 the United States Air Force reoriented its biological warfare program. One result of this, in anti-personnel weaponry, was a move away from weapons such as the M33 cluster bomb to the lethal E61 anthrax bomb.Whitby, Simon M. Biological Warfare Against Crops, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2002, pp. 114-15, (). The E61 was first developed in January 1951 as both an anti-personnel and anti-animal weapon capable of being clustered and dropped from a medium height.Endicott, Stephen Lyon and Hagerman, Edward. The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea, (Google Books), Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 72, (). On March 5, 1954 a directive from the U.S. Department of Defense altered the course of the U.S. biological weapons program. The program shifted focus to developing munitions that were not only improved but those that could be delivered by high speed aircraft and balloon. The weapons referred to included the E61 bomblet.Guillemin, Jeanne. Biological Weapons: From the Invention of State- Sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterrorism, (Google Books), Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 101, ().

Biological Weapons, (Google Books), APH, New Dehli: 2004, p. 197, (). generally anthrax spores. The E61 was perceived as superior to its predecessors, the M33 cluster bomb and its payload of M114 bombs. In fact, four of the smaller E61 bomblets produced twice the coverage area of the larger M114 bomb.Smart, Jeffery K.

Background After working as a disc jockey in Texas and Oregon, Nelson moved to Nashville in 1960 in hopes of making a living as a songwriter and recording artist. He found work writing compositions for Pamper Music and scored his first hit when Faron Young recorded ‚ÄúHello Walls.‚Äù More hits followed, including Patsy Cline‚Äôs classic rendition of ‚ÄúCrazy,‚Äù but Nelson, who played bass on tour with Ray Price during this period, wanted to be a recording artist in his own right, and recorded his debut album, ...And Then I Wrote for Liberty in 1962. He scored a Top 10 hit with ‚ÄúTouch Me,‚Äù but the LP was not a huge seller. Against his better judgement, Nelson would allow his songs to be heavily augmented when he returned to the studio, later admitting, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt argue. In those days, big productions like Johnny Cash‚Äôs ‚ÄòRing of Fire‚Äô were huge hits. So if it worked for Johnny, maybe it‚Äôd work for me. I went along with the program.‚Äù Recording and Composition After failing to deliver a hit for Liberty, Joe Allison, who produced Nelson‚Äôs debut, was replaced by Tommy Allsup, who would go on to produce twenty-six sides on the singer between December 1962 and November 1963. Some of those tracks found their way onto his second album, on which Nelson‚Äôs voice was complemented by a pronounced country and swing sound, although the tracks arranged by Ernie Freeman blatantly pushed him in a pop or jazz direction. Unlike his debut, Here‚Äôs Willie Nelson contains more cover songs, including two made famous by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, ‚ÄúRoly Poly‚Äù and ‚ÄúRight or Wrong.‚Äù Wills, one of Nelson‚Äôs idols, would also write the liner notes for the LP. Nelson worked out several songs on his second album while touring with his wife Shirley Collie and steel guitarist Jimmy Day while playing shows as the trio The Offenders. Nelson later expressed dissatisfaction with the recorded version of ‚ÄúHome Motel,‚Äù a song he described as ‚Äúanother study in despair,‚Äù and it was typical of the frustration that he would feel regarding the tepid sound of his albums in the decade ahead: :It was a thrill to play the song live. Jimmy Day had his steel guitar weeping just enough, and Shirley added just a touch of harmony, and I got to sing my blues the way the blues should be sung: no frills. Yet when I brought the song into the Liberty studios, the producers felt compelled to put on the frills. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you worried you‚Äôre burying the soul of the song?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúMore worried about the song not selling,‚Äù was the usual answer. In his 2015 memoir, Willie admitted that ‚ÄúHalf a Man‚Äù was ‚Äúone of my stranger songs. It‚Äôs about a guy who considers what it would be like, in the name of lost love, to start losing body parts...This wasn‚Äôt exactly a song that made you want to dance.‚Äù The song was released as a single but only made it to number 25, with Allsup recalling, \\"Half the country stations wouldn't play 'Half a Man' because they thought it was morbid.\\" Years later Nelson would record the song as two different duets with Merle Haggard and George Jones.

After graduation in April 1935 he was promoted to Untersturmf√ºhrer (second lieutenant). In 1936 he was named Adjutant to Reichsleiter Martin Bormann. In May 1937 he joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party), and in September of that same year he was promoted to Obersturmf√ºhrer (first lieutenant).NSDAP #4166963 World War II In October 1939 he returned to the Waffen-SS as a company commander in the Deutschland and Der F√ºhrer Regiments in the SS-VT. He fought in the Battle of France and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class in July 1940 and promoted to Hauptsturmf√ºhrer (captain). Darges was then posted to the newly formed SS Division Wiking, took part in Operation Barbarossa and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st class in August 1942. In March 1943 he became a personal adjutant to Adolf Hitler. He was assigned to the F√ºhrerbegleitkommando, an SS bodyguard unit which provided personal security for Hitler. He was promoted to Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (lieutenant colonel) in January 1944. =Dismissal= On 18 July 1944, during a strategy conference in the Wolfsschanze,Destined to be wrecked just two days later by a bomb planted by Col. von Stauffenberg a fly began buzzing around the room, allegedly landing on Hitler's shoulder and on the surface of a map several times. Irritated, Hitler ordered Darges to dispatch the nuisance. Darges suggested that, as it was an airborne pest, the job should go to the Luftwaffe adjutant, Nicolaus von Below. Hitler took Darges aside, dismissed him on the spot and had him transferred to the Eastern Front. Another version of this story claims Darges was merely snickering as Hitler looked up from the map. Yet another version of Darges' dismissal and transfer by Hitler involves his refusal to marry Eva Braun's sister Gretl Braun, who was pregnant at the time. =Service in the Eastern Front= In August 1944 Darges returned to the SS Wiking to replace Johannes M√ºhlenkamp as the commander of the 5th SS Panzer Regiment. It was in command of this unit that Darges was awarded the Knight's Cross for his actions on the night of 4 January 1945. The division was advancing towards Bicske when it was stopped by the 41st Guards Rifle Division of the Soviet 4th Guards Army. Darges initially probed the Soviet line with a mixed Panzer and Panzer Grenadier Kampfgruppe and succeeded in breaking through the line at dawn. Subsequently he ambushed and destroyed a Soviet task force, knocking out four 122mm guns, four 76mm anti-tank guns, twelve trucks and a number of supply vehicles. He then attacked Regis Castle, forcing the garrison to retreat. Darges then found himself surrounded by Soviet reinforcements and was forced to repel several attacks. Three days later when they were relieved by another Kampfgruppe from SS Wiking, they left behind more than thirty destroyed Soviet tanks. Post- war Not much is known about his activities after Germany's surrender. He had a career as a car salesman after the war. He appeared in the 2000 documentary Hitlers Krieg im Osten, credited as himself. Shortly before his death, Darges stated that he found Hitler to be a \\"genius\\" and that \\"I served him and would do it all again now.\\" Darges authored a manuscript recounting his experiences as a member of Hitler's inner circle, with instructions that it be published after his death.

The band released their debut studio album Manners in 2009. A second studio album entitled Gossamer was released in 2012, which debuted at No. 4 on Billboard 200 and gave the band their first top 10 album. Kindred, the band's third studio album, was released on April 17, 2015 and was preceded by lead singles \\"Lifted Up (1985)\\", \\"Where the Sky Hangs\\", and \\"Until We Can't (Let's Go)\\". Passion Pit self-released their fourth album, Tremendous Sea of Love, on March 28, 2017 to Michael Angelakos' Twitter followers; the album was released to the public on July 28, 2017. HistoryName= The band culled their name from the Variety Slanguage Dictionary, a glossary of Varietys frequently used slang, which was provided by the Hollywood insider publication to help not-so-savvy readers decipher its content. The magazine used the term to refer to drive-in theatres, because of their privacy and romantic allure for teenagers. =Formation= The first Passion Pit songs, which would later become the Chunk of Change EP, were written by Angelakos at Emerson College as a belated Valentine's Day gift to his then-girlfriend. At first, he wrote and performed all his material alone using a laptop. After one of his solo shows in the Boston area, Ian Hultquist, who was attending Berklee College of Music at the time, approached Angelakos and expressed interest in creating and playing music collaboratively. They formed a group that consisted of Angelakos, Hultquist, Ayad Al Adhamy, Thom Plasse (bass), and Adam Lavinsky (drums). The band spent a considerable amount of time trying to flesh out a collaborative format and structure that would work best for them. Jeff Apruzzese and Nate Donmoyer joined the band shortly after they signed to Frenchkiss in 2008, replacing Plasse and Lavinsky, respectively. In 2012, Adhamy was replaced by Xander Singh. =2007‚Äì09: Chunk of Change= The band's debut EP, Chunk of Change, was released on September 16, 2008. The first four tracks were those that Angelakos had written as a gift for his girlfriend. The tracks quickly became popular throughout the Emerson College campus, where Angelakos was attending classes at the time, and had been passing out his own, self-produced copies. Two tracks, \\"Sleepyhead\\" and \\"Better Things\\", were added for the commercial release of the EP. The same year of their debut EP's release, the band was chosen as \\"Best New Local Act in 2008\\" in the WFNX/Boston Phoenix best music poll. Passion Pit in 2008 The first and only single to be released from the EP, \\"Sleepyhead\\", received a good deal of exposure through its use in numerous media campaigns and advertisements, while the video for the song, directed by The Wilderness, was included on Pitchfork's Top 40 Music Videos of 2008 list. \\"Sleepyhead\\" was also used for the release trailer for the video game \\"Little Big Planet 2\\". The song contains samples of \\"√ìr√≥ Mo Bh√°id√≠n\\" by Irish singer and harpist Mary O'Hara. Other songs from the EP received some exposure as well. \\"Cuddle Fuddle\\" was featured in E4's second series of The Inbetweeners and \\"I've Got Your Number\\" was used in an advertisement for the cash card from O2, Money in the UK. =2009‚Äì11: Manners= The band's first full-length studio album, Manners, was released on May 18, 2009 in the UK and May 19, 2009 in the United States and Canada. In celebration, the band played their record release party on the 18th in New York City on a Rocks Off boat cruise. In a preview article, ClashMusic.com commented that the album \\"has every chance to rank as one of the year's best\\" and that \\"it reveals additional nuances with each visit: a sure-fire sign of an album with true longevity\\". In order to obtain a specific background vocal accompaniment the band was looking for on Manners, Passion Pit enlisted the help of the PS22 chorus, who recorded vocals in-studio for three of the album's songs: \\"The Reeling\\", \\"Little Secrets\\", and \\"Let Your Love Grow Tall.\\" \\"The Reeling\\" was the first single to be released from the album and found success on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the fall of 2009, where it peaked at number 34 in October and \\"Little Secrets\\" was the third single to be released and had success on the chart as well, topping out at number 39. \\"Let Your Love Grow Tall\\" was never released as a single but had some exposure being used in the sixteenth episode of the fourth season of the TV series Ugly Betty. The album's second single, \\"To Kingdom Come\\", was used in the Rhapsody commercial for its iPhone application. \\"Sleepyhead\\" was the only track from Chunk of Change to be included on the album and was made available from iTunes for free as a discovery download in 2009. The song continued to receive additional exposure through its appearances in advertisements. It was used in a season 3 episode of the teen-drama, Skins and most recently in the debut trailer for LittleBigPlanet 2, which led to the band's increased popularity amongst fans and players of the game, who eventually created an in-game instrumental version of the song to listen to in the first game. When the sequel was released, it came with the song's actual instrumental version used in the trailer. The song \\"Moth's Wings\\" was used in the fourth episode of the third season of the CW teen drama Gossip Girl and in the closing credits of episode 36 of HBO's Big Love. It appeared in the FIFA 10 video game and was included in the films Life As We Know It and Wonder. It has also been used as a background theme for Sky Sports coverage of the UEFA Champions League and as the music for a dance routine in Episode 5, Season 8, of the US television show So You Think You Can Dance, which received a standing ovation from the show's judges. It was also featured in two episodes of MTV's show Awkward (the pilot and Season 3 finale, respectively). In June 2009, the band performed at the Glastonbury Festival 2009 in Pilton, Somerset, England, where they dedicated the final song of their set to festival headliner Jarvis Cocker, who was to perform on the same stage later that same day. Afterwards, NME, while favorably reviewing Passion Pit's performance, incorrectly reported the band as having dedicated their entire set to Cocker. On April 13, 2010, the band reissued Manners in a deluxe edition format which contained new artwork and three additional tracks: stripped-down versions of \\"Sleepyhead\\" and \\"Moth's Wings\\" and a cover of The Cranberries' song \\"Dreams\\". The deluxe release coincided with the extension of their North American headlining tour. The band released another cover in June 2010, this time offering up their take on The Smashing Pumpkins hit song \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" as part of a promotion with Levi's called \\"Pioneer Sessions\\". In September 2010, Passion Pit toured with the English band Muse as their opening act for eight shows during their fall tour through parts of the US. Following those supporting shows, the band headlined the Campus Consciousness Tour, produced by Pretty Polly Productions in collaboration with Guster guitarist Adam Gardner's non-profit organization Reverb. The two-week tour featured stops at twelve college campuses and, in addition to the music, focused on promoting eco-friendly lifestyles. Opening acts for the tour included Black Joe Lewis & the Honeybears and K. Flay. =2011‚Äì13: Gossamer= In an August 2010 interview with NME, Angelakos stated that work had already begun on the follow-up to Manners and that the band intended to release the album in the spring of 2011. He then said that it will be released early in 2012, and finally that the release date was July 24. Days after they have been presented in the Lollapalooza festival in Brazil in March 2012, they announced the title of the album, Gossamer, and that it would be released on July 24, 2012. On May 7, 2012, the first track from Gossamer was released, called \\"Take a Walk\\". On June 12, 2012, the second track from Gossamer was released, called \\"I'll Be Alright\\". The track leaked early on June 11 and was released as an NME premiere on June 8. On July 9, 2012, a third track from Gossamer, called \\"Constant Conversations\\", was reviewed and featured as \\"best new track\\" by Pitchfork. It was released with the review as streamed content. Gossamer was officially released on July 20, 2012. On July 16, 2012, Angelakos posted on the Passion Pit website that the band has cancelled the remaining July tour dates and suspended the tour in order for Angelakos to seek ongoing treatment for bipolar disorder. A Rolling Stone interview stated that Angelakos was diagnosed at 17, undergoing therapy, hospital care, and taking medication ever since. On October 13, 2012, they performed on Saturday Night Live. They played \\"Take a Walk\\" and \\"Carried Away.\\" On July 15, 2013, it was announced publicly that the band would be headlining the first ever \\"Coastline Festival\\" in Tampa, Florida and West Palm Beach, Florida with Two Door Cinema Club and Matt & Kim. Also included in the lineup are groups such as Fitz and The Tantrums, The Joy Formidable, The Neighbourhood, Capital Cities, The Mowgli's, Blondfire, Surfer Blood, The Royal Concept and St. Lucia. On September 24, 2013, Passion Pit released the Constant Conversations EP, originally released through Spotify, but was then made available on iTunes. The EP featured an alternative version of Constant Conversations from their 2012 album Gossamer, in addition to a formerly unreleased B-side called \\"Ruin Your Day\\". The final track on the EP was a remix of \\"Carried Away\\" by Dillon Francis. =2014‚Äì2016: Kindred= Passion Pit released Kindred on April 21, 2015 through Columbia Records. On June 24, 2014, Angelakos announced through Twitter that Passion Pit are working on their as yet to be titled third studio album. Angelakos confirmed that the third album would in fact be released in 2015. In anticipation of the release, the band posted several coded images to various social networking platforms. Soon after the release of the Morse code image, the official Passion Pit website, which had been under construction since the end of the 2013 tour, came back up. It is now known as \\"KindredTheAlbum.com\\". The website includes a short 13 second clip titled \\"That flickering light's just a flame\\" and a picture of Angelakos jumping in the air. On February 16, 2015, the band uploaded the lead single for the new album \\"Lifted Up (1985)\\" onto its YouTube channel. The band then followed up by releasing the names of the rest of the tracks and by announcing the album would be available for pre- order the following day (Tuesday February 17, 2015). The third track, titled \\"Where the Sky Hangs\\" was also released on the Passion Pit Vevo in the early hours of February 17, 2015. Following the release of their new album, Passion Pit had announced a tour across the United States, part of Canada, and even a stop in Tokyo, Japan. Angelakos continued to tour throughout the year until July he had slowed down due bronchitis and pneumonia. However, since then he has continued to tour and is expected to end in October. = 2017‚Äì2018: Tremendous Sea of Love = During February and March 2017, several new Passion Pit songs were uploaded on YouTube on the account The Wishart Group (from the name of a project started by Michael Angelakos and dedicated to supporting musicians by providing them with legal, educational and healthcare services, with a focus on mental health, a topic on which Angelakos has been especially forthcoming), foreshadowing a fourth album for 2017. All of the videos for those new songs have the same background photo (a woman wearing a white dress, located in the middle of the sea, turning around as though she had sensed she was being secretly observed from behind), as does the front cover of the album. The songs were taken down, but Angelakos announced that he will give a downloadable copy of the album for free to anyone who retweets neuroscientist Michael F. Wells' tweet on the importance of science and research. The profits from the album will be donated to a psychiatric research institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On July 11, an official release for the album was announced for July 28 on all streaming services. The band embarked on a North American tour between January and February 2018 to promote Tremendous Sea of Love as well as their EP Chunk of Change's 10th anniversary. = 2019‚Äìpresent = On May 14, 2019, Passion Pit teamed up with electronic duo Galantis for a new single called \\"I FOUND U\\". Awards and accolades In 2012, listeners of Australia's alternative radio station Triple J Hottest 100 voted \\"Take a Walk\\" as number 46 of the hottest 100 tracks of the year.

The city is strongly influenced by European immigrants, especially Germans and Italians. However, other nationalities also contributed to the formation of the city's character in terms of e.g.: architecture, gastronomy, religion and economy, amongst other factors. Its multiculturality is a remarkable characteristic not exclusively attributed to Fraiburgo but many other Southern Brazilian municipalities. The city is famous in Brazil for the large production of apples which its plantation is favored by the low temperatures in the winter season in the Southern Hemisphere that takes place in July, August and September. Depending on the period of the year tourists can experience first-hand the whole apple production cycle as well other products made from apple such as: cider, juices, snacks and so forth. Economy City Gateway In the early stages the economy of Fraiburgo's region was based on sawmills.Gloria de Pioneiros (vale do Rio do Peixe) Gentila Porto Lopes The former dense forests consisted mostly in Brazilian walnuts, Cedars, Cinnamons, Yerba mat√©, and the exuberant Brazilian Pines.*http://guiacidades.viageiro.com/cidades.php?nome=fraiburgo These forests still represent the typical Southern Brazilian landscape in spite of ruthless deforestation in the past decades. A significant turnover in the economy took place due to the shortage of wood, implementation of Brazilian environmental laws and environmental consciousness. As a result, agriculture became the predominant source of wealth alongside the production of paper, cellulose, and furniture derived from extensive reforestation areas. The reforestation projects introduced the Pinus elliottii to the region. =Agriculture= Apples are the base of Fraiburgo economy, being responsible for 60% of the total state production and 40% of the national production. The city also produces honey in large quantities; there are about 15.000 honeycombs to pollinate 7 million apple trees. Moreover, there are familiar farms that produce corn, beans, garlic, onions, and peaches. =Tourism= Rural tourism, tourism of adventure, gastronomy. Climate Fraiburgo has Seasoned climate: relatively hot dry summers (November to March) with temperatures reaching up to 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) on the hottest days; winters (June to August) cold mornings, typical maximum daily temperatures of 15 degrees Celsius (59 degrees Fahrenheit), and minimums of a few degrees above freezing. The year average temperature 16,1 ¬∞C (60.8F) Occasional snowfall occurs in suburbs at higher altitudes, and may extend throughout the city, though this happens infrequently (about every 8‚Äì10 years). Geography Its geographical position is , and its height is approximately 1048 meters above sea level. Currently, its population is around 36170 according to IBGE estimate. However, this figure fluctuates with the guest workers (10000) throughout the apple harvest season (From January to April). SymbolsFlag= The municipal flag was instituted by Law n¬∫ 303 of 05/09/1977. It was designed by the educators Rui Batagelo and Francisco Costella supported by the professor and vexillologist Ant√¥nio Peixoto de Faria. The flag has the colors green, white and yellow. In the center there is the coat of the arms of Fraiburgo (2nd version), representing the municipal government. The green color represents the fields and the harvests. The white color symbolizes the peace, friendship, work, prosperity, pureness, faith. The yellow color represents the industries of the city, generators of wealthValentin Poposki, 15 February 2006 http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/br-sc-fr.html#flag =Coat of arms= The coat or arms was created in 1964 in Paris by heraldist Robert Louis on commission of Albert Mahler, an early German-ascent local, and later changed. It refers to Fraiburgo's woods and timber industry (logs and flowers) and St. Catherine's martyrdom tools, for the State's namesake, and includes also storks as supporters standing for Alsatia, whence come the first settlers; cogwheel and apples symbolize Fraiburgo's recent industries.

It is located just in Crowthorne civil parish to the south of Bracknell in the English county of Berkshire. It falls within the Windsor Forest and is well wooded, although parts of the fort have now been cleared of some trees. The area is managed by the Forestry Commission but owned by Crown Estate, and is open and accessible to the public. The hill fort covers an area of about 17.2 acres (7 hectares) and is surrounded by a mile-long ditch, making it one of the largest in southern England. Etymology The origin of the name \\"Caesar's Camp\\" is unknown. However, the hill fort is close to the Roman road known as the Devil's Highway, and this may have led Medieval mapmakers to attribute the structure (wrongly) to the Romans. But the person who named the road must not have known its Roman origin, so mistakenly attributed it to Satan. History Caesar's Camp is thought to have been established around 500‚Äì300BC. It is the only hill fort of its type that has been identified in east Berkshire. Because the area had a thick bed of sandstone beneath the top layers of soil, it was likely not suitable for farming ‚Äì the community at Caesar's Camp was therefore dependent on the produce of neighbouring settlements. Caesar's Camp was therefore most likely used as an assembly point and a marketplace. Its huge outer walls and dump rampart also suggest that it was used as a safe haven in case of attack. Multivallate defences at Caesar's Camp Caesar's Camp appears to have fallen under the rule of Cunobelin, king of the Catuvellauni tribe in the first century AD from a coin discovered in the interior. Soon after, the Romans invaded England; after this time, there is no evidence that Caesar's Camp continued to exist as an inhabited community. A road from its south entrance was later built, connecting it to the Devil's Highway (Roman Britain). There is a small Roman settlement about halfway along this road, known as Wickham Bushes, which has yielded pottery and other Roman artifacts. The main Roman road connected Londinium with Calleva Atrebatum, the tribal capital of the Atrebates celtic tribe about 10 miles to the west in Hampshire. A redoubt roughly 40 m across in the fort is thought to be part of a defence line built in 1792 in preparation for the Napoleonic Wars. Description Scots pines on bank at Caesar's Camp Heather on upper rampart at Caesar's Camp The layout consists of a number of steep banks and ditches in the shape of an oak leaf, enclosing a large flat area of a settlement. The main entrance is at its northern end (at the tip of the leaf) and is very well defended with multiple banks and a sinuous entrance road. The banks to the side of the entrance are very steep, guiding any entrants along the way. It is north of the Roman road known as the Devil's Highway which connected Londinium to Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester). It is within the Crowthorne Woods part of Swinley Forest crown plantation and is located off Nine Mile Ride approximately from the Look Out visitor centre. Much of the fort is covered by mature broadleaf and coniferous trees, although some of the spruce plantation on the southern part of the fort has been cleared, and the ground reverted to heathland and scrub. On clear days, central Bracknell and Crowthorne, including Broadmoor hospital, are visible from its highest points. The camp falls within the Broadmoor to Bagshot Woods and Heaths Site of Special Scientific Interest, and forms part of the northern edge of the SSI. The zone protects numerous rare birds such as the woodlark and nightjar, as well as its diverse insect life and fauna. It is an entirely hand-built complex. The camp has suffered significant erosion, both natural and man-made. Efforts have been made by Bracknell Forest Council to restore some of the natural parts. A geophysical survey (examining the sub- structures) of 2 ha in the southern part of the fort was undertaken in 1995 before the restoration work. It found some evidence for sustained occupation and structures; the survey did find a ditch type anomaly within the western ramparts and a scatter of pit type anomalies. 1978 People's Free Festival The site was reoccupied between 29 August and 8 September 1978, when it became the location of the last of the Windsor Free Festivals in 1978, after the forced removal of those attempting to attend the People's Free Festival, in Windsor Great Park, by police.

In 1981 Kemp was one of the teachers who complained claiming that Georgia officials had intervened allowing nine college football players to pass a remedial English course, allowing them to play against Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl for the national championship in 1981. Kemp was demoted in 1982 and dismissed one year later. She then filed a lawsuit claiming she had been fired due to her complaints about the passing of players. During the time after she was dismissed Kemp tried to commit suicide twice. The University defended its actions saying that Kemp was dismissed for \\"disruptive conduct and for failure to conduct adequate scholarly research.\\"Jan Kemp Dies at 59; Exposed Fraud in Grades of Players The New York Times The jury found the University liable for the illegal dismissal of Kemp and she was awarded $2.5 million, which was later reduced to $1.08 million.

Born in Stockton-on-Tees, Tranter played as a left-back for Thames Ironworks, the team that would later become West Ham United. The club handbook described him as a player that \\"rushes in where others feared to tread\\". He was a part of the team that won the London League during the 1897-98 season, and captained the side to the Southern League Second Division championship in 1898‚Äì99. He then left to play for Chatham, but returned to the newly renamed club, along with teammate Albert Kaye, for the 1900‚Äì01 season. He played in the inaugural game for the new club, a 7‚Äì0 battering of Gravesend on 1 September 1900, and made a further three Southern League appearances for West Ham that season. His last two games for the club were in the FA Cup Qualifying Round 4 against New Brompton, which went to a replay on 21 November 1900. In June 1901, he and Kaye joined Belfast club Distillery.Hogg (2005). p. 116 Personal life Walter Tranter's father was Isaac Rogers Tranter, who was the Captain of the Fire Brigade Company in Thornaby-on-Tees.

The company was founded in 1959 in Jonqui√®re, but expanded greatly in 1990 with the acquisition of Voyageur's routes in the Saguenay region and the North Coast of the Saint Lawrence River. The next step in the evolution of the Intercar Group, already well established in student transportation in Saguenay-Lac- Saint-Jean, was the launch of school bus services in the area around Quebec City. Further expansion of their interurban routes to Sept-√éles meant that by 2001 they dominated those services in the triangle between Sept-Iles, Dolbeau and Quebec. Throughout the early part of this century they have continued to acquire more school transportation companies and further grow their charter service.Intercar: Who are we?
