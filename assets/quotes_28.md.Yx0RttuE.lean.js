Business cycles and skyscraper construction correlateThornton, p. 51 in such a way that investment in skyscrapers peaks when cyclical growth is exhausted and the economy is ready for recession.Thornton, p. 53 Mark Thornton's Skyscraper Index Model successfully sent a signal of the late-2000s financial crisis at the beginning of August 2007. The buildings may actually be completed after the onset of the recession or later, when another business cycle pulls the economy up, or even cancelled. Unlike earlier instances of similar reasoning (\\"height is a barometer of boom\\"),Willis, p. 167 Lawrence used skyscraper projects as a predictor of economic crisis, not boom. One statistical study found that the height of buildings is not an accurate predictor of recessions or other aspects of the business cycle, but that GDP can predict the height of building construction. Details Lawrence started his paper, The Skyscraper Index: Faulty Towers, as a joke (emphasized by a title referencing a comedy show) and based his index on a comparison of historical data, primarily from the United States' experience. He dismissed overall construction and investment statistics, focusing only on record-breaking projects. The first notable example was the Panic of 1907. Two record-breaking skyscrapers, the Singer Building and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, were launched in New York before the panic and completed in 1908 and 1909, respectively. Met Life remained the world's tallest building until 1913. Another string of supertall towers ‚Äì 40 Wall Street, the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building ‚Äì was launched shortly before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The next record holders, the World Trade Center towers and the Sears Tower, opened in 1973, during the 1973‚Äì1974 stock market crash and the 1973 oil crisis. The last example available to Lawrence, the Petronas Twin Towers, opened in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and held the world height record for five years. Lawrence linked the phenomenon to overinvestment, speculation, and monetary expansion but did not elaborate on these underlying issues. The concept was revived in 2005, when Fortune warily observed five media corporations investing in new skyscrapers in Manhattan (none of them, including the tallest, the New York Times Building, broke any records). The intuitively simple concept, publicized by the business press in 1999,Thornton, p. 53, reviews 1999 press coverage p. 26 has been cross-checked within the framework of the Austrian Business Cycle Theory, itself borrowing on Richard Cantillon's eighteenth-century theories.Thornton, p. 52 Mark Thornton (2005) listed three Cantillon effects that make the skyscraper index valid. First, a decline in interest rates at the onset of a boom drives land prices.Thornton, p. 62 Second, a decline in interest rates allows the average size of a firm to increase, creating demand for larger office spaces. Third, low interest rates provide investment to construction technologies that enable developers to break earlier records. All three factors peak at the end of the growth period.Thornton, p. 63 Critics dismissed the skyscraper index as an unreliable tool: the post-World War I recession, the recession of 1937, and the early 1980s recession were not marked by any record-breaking projects.Thornton, p. 71 Construction of the Woolworth Building (world height record 1913‚Äì1930) was marked by a local overbuilding crisis in New York City in 1913‚Äì1915Willis, p. 168 concurrent with a record construction boom in Chicago.Willis, p. 170 Thornton argues that completion of the Woolworth Building was followed by a third-worst-ever quarterly decline in gross domestic product, thus it should not be considered an exception from the rule (as Lawrence himself did). Cyclical patterns in real estate have been thoroughly studied before Lawrence, notably by Homer Hoyt in the 1930s. A 1995 analysis of New York and Chicago's experience by Carol Willis estimated that historically, two-thirds to three-quarters of skyscrapers were conceived for rent alone;Willis, p. 155‚Äì156 corporate \\"edifices\\" imposing their owners' brand name (including most historical record-holders) were a minority, and they too leased space to tenants.Willis, pp. 152‚Äì153 Speculative real estate markets cycle between the two different behavior patterns. In normal times when the value of resources is predictable, performance of a building project can be estimated reliably through well-tested formulae. In boom times, rational pricing gives way to irrational buyers' behavior; buyers bet on ever- increasing demand and rents and are willing to pay more than they would normally.Willis, p. 157 Willis said that \\"height is a barometer of boom\\", \\"the tallest buildings generally appear before the end of a boom, their height driven up by the speculative fever that affects both developers and lenders\\", citing cyclically inflated land values as the principal factor for increases in building height,Willis, p. 166 but did not elevate this fact to become an \\"index\\". A related concept, Skyscraper Indicator, was popularized by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s. pp. 375‚Äì376, pp. 212‚Äì213 In some ways this appears to be an elaboration of C. Northcote Parkinson's theory that only organizations in decline have sleek, well-planned buildings. His favorite example was not a skyscraper, but the city of New Delhi (particularly the area now referred to as Lutyen's Delhi) ‚Äì built shortly before India became independent of the British builders. The recently constructed Burj Khalifa may join this list. In October 2009, the construction company Emaar announced that it had completed the exterior of the building; within two months, the Dubai government came close to defaulting on its loans. Stephen Bayley from The Daily Telegraph commented, \\"For all the ambition of its construction, Dubai's new Khalifa Tower is a frightening, purposeless monument to the subprime era\\". Empirical test of the Skyscraper Index hypothesis A study by Barr, Mizrach and Mundra (2015) aims to see if there is, in fact, a correlation between skyscraper height and economic growth. The study looks at two types of data. First, the paper looks at the announcement and completion dates of the world's tallest buildings and the peaks and troughs of the United States business cycle, as measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research. They find that there is virtually no relationship between the timing of record-breaking buildings and the business cycle. Second, the authors investigate height and economic growth using the time series techniques of vector autoregression and cointegration tests. They investigate the time series relationship between the tallest building completed each year and the level of per capita GDP for the United States, Canada, China, and Hong Kong. The authors find that the two series are co-integrated, which means that they move together over time. That is to say, the tallest building completed each year in these countries does not systematically move away from the underlying income of the country, which provides evidence that, in general, skyscraper height is not fundamentally based on height competition among builders. Finally, the vector autoregression methods allow the authors to see if skyscraper height can predict changes in gross domestic product (GDP) (i.e., if heights predict recessions). The authors find that height cannot, in fact, be used to predict changes in GDP. However, GDP can be used to predict changes in height. In other words, the study finds that extreme height is driven by rapid economic growth, but that height cannot be used as an indicator of recessions.

Although the Alabama campus is physically located in Tuscaloosa, through the history of the program, several stadiums located in Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, Montgomery and Mobile have played host to the football team. TuscaloosaBryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium= Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium has served as the on-campus home of the Crimson Tide since its opening on September 28, 1929. Originally known as the George Hutchenson Denny Stadium after the university president of the same name, in 1975 the Alabama state legislature renamed the stadium Bryant‚ÄìDenny Stadium in honor of then coach Bear Bryant. Originally only have seating for 12,000 fans, further expansions in 1950, 1961, and 1966 raised capacity to 25,000, 43,000, and 60,000, respectively. The first upper deck was added on the west side of the stadium in 1988, adding 10,000 more seats for a capacity of 70,123. On September 5, 1998, the stadium's eastern upper deck was opened, and raised its official seating capacity to 83,818 at a final cost of $35 million. The University moved all home games here from Legion Field in exchange for the funding given to the project by local municipalities. Following the 2004 football season, the university spent approximately $47 million on an expansion to the north end zone, which was completed days before the 2006 season opener against Hawaii. The expansion added a new upper deck to the North end zone area, complete with three different levels of skyboxes, which collectively are known as \\"The Zone\\", which brought the number of skyboxes in the stadium to 123. This expansion brought its capacity to 92,138 by the 2006 season. An expansion to the south end zone, completed during the Summer of 2010, increased its capacity to over 101,000 to make it the 9th largest stadium in the world by seating. All-time, Alabama has a record of 218 wins, 46 losses and 3 ties at Bryant‚ÄìDenny in addition to selling out every home game since the 1988 season. =Denny Field= Denny Field served as the home stadium for the Crimson Tide football team from 1915 through the 1928 seasons, excluding 1918 when a team was not fielded due to World War I. Originally named University Field, but renamed in 1920, during its tenure as the team's home field, Alabama amassed an overall home record of 43 wins to only 3 losses. =The Quad= The first home of Crimson Tide football was located on The Quad at the center of the Alabama campus in Tuscaloosa. The Crimsons as they were known then compiled an overall record of 42 wins to only 11 losses between the 1893 through the 1914 seasons. The location of the playing field on The Quad was located at two locations. The first location of the field was at the southeast corner, with the field running parallel to 6th Avenue, and its second location was moved 90-degrees to the west to run parallel to University Boulevard. Birmingham Legion Field in 2006 Rickwood Field in 2007 =Legion Field= Opening for Crimson Tide football on November 26, 1927, Legion Field played host to Alabama through the 2003 season. Legion had an original capacity of 21,000, and was expanded over the years to reach a maximum capacity of 83,091 by the 1990s. The Crimson Tide posted an all-time record at Legion Field of 160 wins, 52 losses and 12 ties. After expanding Bryant-Denny in 1998, Alabama moved major conference games to their campus. In the ensuing years, Alabama decreased the number of games scheduled in Birmingham. The last home game for Alabama at Legion Field was against the University of South Florida on August 30, 2003. Though they had a couple of games scheduled at Legion Field in 2005 and 2008, the disrepair to the stadium and the structural issues to the upper deck led Alabama to end their contract with the city of Birmingham in 2004 and move all home games to Tuscaloosa =Rickwood Field= Rickwood Field provided for the fifth location of Alabama home games in Birmingham, and is located at the corner of 2nd Avenue West and 12th Street West in the West End. Alabama would play home games at Rickwood between the 1912 and 1927 seasons, with an all-time record at Rickwood Field of 23 wins, 12 losses and 5 ties. =Birmingham Fairgrounds= The Birmingham Fairgrounds provided for the fourth location of Alabama home games in Birmingham, and is located in western Birmingham at the location of Birmingham International Raceway. Alabama would play home games at the fairgrounds between the 1905 and 1911 seasons, with an all-time record at the Birmingham Fairgrounds of 12 wins, 6 losses and 2 ties. =West End Park= West End Park, also known as \\"Slag Pile Field\\", and also the home of the Birmingham Barons before Rickwood Field was constructed, was the third location of Alabama home games in Birmingham. The Crimsons would play home games at West End Park between the 1901 and 1904 seasons, with an all-time record at West End Park of 3 wins, 5 losses and 1 tie. =Lakeview Park= Located at the present-day intersection of Highland and Clairmont Avenues, Lakeview Park has the distinction of being the first home of Alabama football. On November 11, 1892, Alabama would win its first all-time game against Birmingham High School 56‚Äì0 and lose the first Iron Bowl against Auburn 22‚Äì32 on February 22, 1893 at Lakeview. Alabama would play home games at Lakeview between the 1892 and 1894 seasons, with an all-time record at Lakeview Park of 2 wins and 5 losses. Montgomery Cramton Bowl in 2009 =Cramton Bowl= The Cramton Bowl provided for the fourth and final location of Alabama home games in the capital city. The Tide played home games at the Cramton Bowl in the 1922 through 1932 seasons, in 1934, between the 1944 through 1946 seasons and again between the 1951 through 1954 seasons. Alabama's all-time record at the Cramton Bowl was 17 wins and 3 losses. =Highland Park= Highland Park provided for the second location of Alabama home games in the capital city. The Crimsons would play home games at Highland in the 1901, 1903, and the 1907 seasons. Alabama's all-time record at Riverside was 1 win, 0 losses and 2 ties.

Aristobulus may be mentioned in the New Testament in the Epistle to the Romans (: \\"...Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household\\") although this may mean members of the household of the late Aristobulus IV. According to Lionel Smithett Lewis, the writings of St Dorotheus, Bishop of Tyre AD 303, assert that he is the one saluted by Paul in the Epistle to the Romans. =Orthodox tradition= Orthodox tradition says Aristobulus was the brother of the Apostle Barnabas, of Jewish Cypriot origin. Like Barnabas, he accompanied Saint Paul on his journeys. He was one of the assistants of Saint Andrew,\\"Saint Aristobulus, Apostle of Britain\\", Orthodox Outlet for Dogmatic Enquiries along with Urban of Macedonia, Stachys, Ampliatus, Apelles of Heraklion and Narcissus of Athens (all of these names are mentioned together by St. Paul in , which cannot be casual). On his missionary journey to Britain, he stopped to preach to the Celtiberians of northern Hispania. Catholic tradition identifies Aristobulus with Zebedee, father of James and John. Aristobulus preached and died in Roman Britain. While some orthodox traditions say he \\"died in peace\\", others say he was martyred in Wales. Catholic tradition says he was martyred. The Benedictine monk Serenus de Cressy (1605‚Äì1674) maintained that Aristobulus was ordained by St. Paul and died at Glastonbury Abbey in 99; but Michael Alford (author of Fides Regia Britannica Sive Annales Ecclesiae Britannicae) says that Aristobulus was the husband of \\"Mary\\" Salome, which makes this date appear too late. Alford gives his death as \\"the second year of Nero\\" ‚Äì 56. Alford also asserts that \\"It is perfectly certain that, before St Paul had come to Rome, Aristobulus was away in Britain\\".\\"Regia Fides\\" vol.1, p.19. This is in accord with the date given by Gildas (c. 500‚Äì570 AD) that the \\"Light of Christ\\" shone in Britain in the last year of Emperor Tiberius. However, George Smith points out that this a misinterpretation of Gildas, and asserts that the Gospel was not preached in Britain before the reign of Claudius, whose full name was Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus. =British tradition= From these traditions, it seems that Aristobulus was the founder of British Christianity. There is no evidence for any connection with Glastonbury and John Scott shows in An Early History of Glastonbury that the legend purporting that Joseph of Arimathea founded the Abbey there is of 12th or 13th-century origin and has no basis in fact. Rather, the early writings frequently centre on Aristobulus. There is no mention of Joseph prior to the Conquest. For this and other reasons, Smith also considers the account of Joseph of Arimathea a \\"superstitious fable of comparatively modern invention\\". John Williams identifies Aristobulus with Arwystli Hen, a \\"man of Italy\\", and one of four missionaries believed to have brought Christianity to the British Isles. There is a tradition linking him to one of the medieval Welsh saints Arwstyl ap Cunedda. The title \\"Arwystli Hen\\" may have originated through a later British tradition.  Herodian parallels  Aristobulus of Chalcis was the son of Herod of Chalcis and Mariamme, the daughter of Olympias. He married Salome, the daughter of Herod II and Herodias.Antiquities xvii: 137 ; xx: 13, 104 They had three sons: Herod, Agrippa, and Aristobulus.Antiquities xviii: 137 Lionel Smithett Lewis maintains that this latter Aristobulus could have been the Aristobulus of Britannia,Lewis p.121 and referred to by Cressy. However, it is this man's father who was the husband of Salome, as mentioned by Alford (see previous section). In 55, Nero appointed Aristobulus of Chalcis as King of Armenia Minor. He participated with his forces in the Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 58‚Äì63, where he received a small portion of Armenia in exchange,Tacitus, Annals, XIII.7; XIV.26 an area he continued to rule until 72 when Vespasian reduced the regional autonomy of some of the provinces. It is probable that the \\"Philip\\" (mentioned above) are those mentioned in the New Testament are Philip the Tetrarch. The matter is disputed by scholars. There is no contemporary evidence for Philip the Tetrarch's use of the name \\"Herod Philip\\" as a dynastic title, as did occur with his brothers Herod Antipas and Herod Archelaus, yet he was of the same family and the scriptural reference may be emphasising this fact, as do later scriptural commentators. Today, Herod II is sometimes called \\"Herod Philip I\\" (because the gospels call the husband of Herodias \\"Philip\\"), and then Philip the Tetrarch is called \\"Herod Philip II\\", but this is an anachronistic convention.Kokkinos, Nikkos 'The Herodian Dynasty: Origins, Role in Society and Eclipse', Journal for the Study of the Pseudepigrapha Supplement Series, 1998, Sheffield Academic Press, Sheffield, 236‚Äì240 Kokkinos says, \\"The stubborn existence of many theologians in referring to Herod III as 'Herod Philip' is without any value...No illusory Herod Philip ever existed.\\"[p 223-233]; [266] Philip the Tetrarch, \\"unlike his brothers, did not use Herod as a dynastic name.\\"Bowman, Alan K., Champlin Edward, and Lintott, Andrew (eds) (2001), Cambridge Ancient History, Vol.10, The Augustan Empire, 43 B.C.-A.D. 69, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press; Refers to him throughout as Philip, or Philip the Tetrarch.

Established in the year 1856 and maintained by the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, it is the oldest and largest botanical garden in Romania. The small pond (autumn 2015) An alley near the entrance to the garden's grounds History In 1856, in the immediate vicinity of R√¢pa GalbenƒÉ, Anastasie FƒÉtu founded the Ia»ôi Botanical Garden with land bought using his own funds. In 1873, stimulated by interest expressed in Anastasie Fatu's garden, the Physicians and Naturalists Society founded a second botanical garden near the society; the second garden is now the natural history museum. In 1870, the Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy (then University of Ia»ôi) created its own botanical garden on a piece of land located behind the University. In 1900, after five years of pleading from Professor Alexandru Popovici, the University asked for land near the Palace of Culture to establish a new botanical garden there. Repeated attempts to obtain the necessary funding to realize this garden proved fruitless. In 1921, Alexandru Popovici organized a new botanical garden on land located at the back of the new university building. This garden served the botanical education over forty years, until 1964, when it was eventually moved to its current location in Copou, under the supervision of Professor Emilian ≈¢opa. The Ia≈üi Botanical Garden is currently involved in the conservation of eighty-five separate species included in the Red Book of the vascular plants from Romania and in the International Conventions. It is also in partnership with in-site conservation programs developed for plants species from the Carpathian Mountains and the Danube Delta.

The Masonic Memorial Temple was conceived as a meeting place for the Masonic order as well as a memorial to Freemasons who gave their lives during World War I, replacing a Masonic Temple that had existed in a mixed-use building on Dorchester Street since 1895. The order had renovations done in 1908 and began to raise funds for a new building in 1923. In 1928, they contracted architect John Smith Archibald, who had previously renovated the Dorchester Street Temple, to design a new temple and supervise its construction. The ceremonial laying of the cornerstone took place on June 22, 1929, with thirty-six lodges and 2,000 Masons parading to the new temple from the Dorchester Street Temple. The Grand Lodge of Quebec met for the first time in the new temple on February 12, 1930, at its 60th Annual Communication, on February 12, 1930. The temple commemorates Masons who died in the First and Second World Wars and the Korean War.

Cricketer Born in London but brought up in West Wales, Evans joined Glamorgan in the mid 1950s and became first-choice wicketkeeper after the retirement of Haydn Davies at the end of the 1958 season. For several seasons at the start of the 1960s, he was at or near the top of the wicketkeeping lists of dismissals with 79, 82 and then 89 dismissals in the seasons from 1961 to 1963. The 89 dismissals in 1963 set a new county record for Glamorgan, though it has since been surpassed by Eifion Jones, and made him the leading wicketkeeper of the year. As a right-handed batsman, he was very much a tail-ender, though in a county side that had more than its fair share of rabbits, with Don Shepherd, Jeff Jones and Ossie Wheatley in the team, he often batted higher than he might have done in other sides. He did not, though, pass 50 in any first-class innings. Injured for part of the 1964 season, Evans was replaced by Eifion Jones, but regained his place for three more seasons. Jones' better batting, though, saw him displace Evans as first choice from 1968, and though Evans was granted a benefit in 1969, he left first-class cricket at the end of the season. Umpire Evans had already shown interest in coaching and umpiring while a first-class cricketer. In the 1967-68 off-season, he travelled to Australia on a Winston Churchill Fellowship to study coaching methods. After his retirement in 1969, he returned to first-class cricket very quickly, qualifying as an umpire and being appointed to the first-class list for the 1971 English cricket season. In 1981, he graduated to the Test panel, and umpired his first Test in the dramatic match between England and Australia when Ian Botham's 149 and Bob Willis's eight for 43 won a match that had seemed lost. Later matches included England games against India, New Zealand and Pakistan, and he was one of the umpires for the first Test played by Sri Lanka in England in 1984. Shortly after standing in the Lord's Test in the 1985 Ashes series, Evans was taken ill and in September 1985 he underwent heart surgery. He returned to the first-class umpires list in 1986 for a further four seasons with a slightly diminished schedule, and did not stand in any further Tests. He had been reappointed to the umpires' panel for the 1990 season, but died before it began. Name and birthplace His second name was not used at all during his playing career, where he was referred to as \\"D. L. Evans\\". In various places it is spelled \\"Gwilym\\" (www.cricketarchive.com, www.cricinfo.com), \\"Gwillim\\" (The Cricketers' Who's Who) and \\"Gwilliam\\" (obituary in Wisden, 1990). As a player, his birthplace was given in Wisden as Ammanford, where he was brought up.

Born in Tottenham on 25 July 1842, Henry Hunnings worked as a Printer and Photographer at the family business on High Road, Tottenham. In 1864 Hunnings took the photo of Hare Pomare (Ref: PA2-0924 Portrait of Hare Pomare, c/o Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, New Zealand) whilst the MƒÅori party were staying with Elizabeth Fairburn Colenso. In January 1868, aged 25, Hunnings left the family business and became a student at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. In 1870 he obtained a BA and joined the Clergy (in 1874 he obtained an MA) and between 1874 and 1880 he was a Curate at All Saints, Bolton Percy near York. During this time Henry created his own telephone transmitter device which he patented in the UK on 16 September 1878 and in the US on 30 August 1881. The Hunnings transmitter was a great success, the secret being the use of carbon granules behind the diaphragm and this produced a clearer, stronger voice signal than any other at that time. It would be used around the world for generations and was only phased out by the British GPO in the 1980s. It was also at Bolton Percy where Henry met Margaret Ann Ridley. Margaret lived with her family in one of the cottages adjacent to the Church and in 1880 at the ages of 37 and 19 respectively Henry and Margaret were married. They subsequently had two children together; William Butters and Katherine Mary. Henry left Bolton Percy with his family in 1880 taking other Curate‚Äôs positions in Rothwell (Leeds), Ryde (Isle of Wight) and Eling (Hampshire) before securing his final role in November 1885 as Chaplain of Royal South Hants Infirmary.

It consists of a wedge emerging from the upper edge of the shield and converging to a point near the base. If it touches the base, it is blazoned throughout.  Variant positions and varying numbers  Though the pile issues from the top of the shield by default, it may be specified as issuing from any other part of the edge or as extending from edge to edge of the shield. Although it is not supposed to issue singly from the base, this rule is frequently ignored. When a shield has more than one pile, and they are angled so that they touch at the base, they are described as piles in point. A few heraldry authorities from the Middle Ages such as Sir Thomas Holme and Nicholas Upton believed that whenever piles issued from the chief, they should automatically meet in point, but this view eventually fell out of favour and it has become common practice that unless otherwise specified, they should be drawn perpendicularly. However, it is still possible to see examples of the previous school of thought. File:Pile reversed wiki.jpg  a pile reversed (or inverted or issuant from the base).

Like other earthstar mushrooms, the thick outer skin splits open at maturity to expose the spore sac to the elements; the specific epithet fornicatum (Latin for 'arched' or 'vaulted') refers to the arched shape of the rays which extend downwards to rest on the mycelial sac and elevate the spore sac. History When first described in the late 17th century, the species was called Fungus anthropomorphus due to its resemblance to the human figure. In his 1799 treatise Colored Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms, English naturalist James Sowerby wrote: > So strange a vegetable has surprised many; and in the year 1695 it was > published under the name of Fungus Anthropomorphus, and figured with human > faces on the head. It is at first roundish; in ripening the head bursts > through the two coats or wrappers; the inner wrapper, detaching itself from > the outer, becomes inverted, connected only by the edges; the coats most > constantly split into four parts. Description Arched earthstar found growing under an oak in southern California The immature fruit body is roughly spherical in shape, typically in diameter, and dark brown in color. At maturity, the exoperidium (outer layer) splits into four to five rays which curve backwards so as to elevate the fruit body and raise the spore sac for optimal spore dispersal; the tips of the rays remain attached to a basal cup. The spore sac contains an ostiole, a small opening near the apex. The mature fruiting body may be up to in diameter and tall. The exoperidium is attached to the soil by rhizomorphs. Spores are spherical, warted, thick-walled, nonamyloid and 5‚Äì6 Œºm. In mass, the spores have a dark-brown color. This species is found singly or in small groups under bushes and in deciduous woods. It is inedible. Antimicrobial activity Methanol extracts of G. fornicatum were shown to be inhibitory to the growth of various bacteria that are pathogenic to humans, including Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and Streptococcus pyogenes, as well as the fungi Candida albicans, Rhodotorula rubra, and Kluyveromyces fragilis.

The airfield was used during World War II but is no longer usable as an airstrip. HistoryWorld War II= With Japanese forces establishing bases on Guadalcanal which threatened the sea route between the U.S. and Australia, Admiral King distributed the joint basic plan for the occupation and defense of Efate on 20 March 1942. Under its terms the US Army was to defend Efate and support the defense of ships and positions. The US Navy's task was: (1) to construct, administer and operate a naval advance base, seaplane base, and harbor facilities; (2) to support Army forces in the defense of the island; (3) to construct an airfield and at least two outlying dispersal fields; (4) to provide facilities for the operation of seaplane-bombers. On 25 March 1942, the Army sent about 500 men to Efate from Noumea, and the 4th Defense Battalion, 45th Marines, arrived on 8 April. Elements of the 1st Naval Construction Battalion arrived on Efate on 4 May 1942. A site was chosen for a bomber airfield and in October the Seebees started constructing a by runway which was completed by the middle of January 1943.

Pure community rating prohibits insurance rate variations based on demographic characteristics such as age or gender, whereas adjusted or modified community rating allows insurance rate variations based on demographic characteristics such as age or gender.  Concept  Community rating, as a basis for premium calculation, is fundamentally different from the usual method of determining insurance premiums, i.e. risk rating. In a risk rated insurance market, an insurer calculates the premium payable by a potential policy holder in order to enter into an insurance contract on the basis of various factors particular to that individual, such as the risk of a claim occurring, and the value of any such claims during the term of an insurance policy. In a community rated market, the insurer may not calculate premium on the basis of the risk factors attaching to the particular person wishing to purchase an insurance contract, but rather the risk factors applying to all persons within the market as a whole. Thus, in a community rated market, the insurer evaluates the risk factors of market population, and not those of any one person when calculating premiums. Some form of risk equalization also often exists in a community rated system. * Health insurers vary premium rates based on case characteristics, such as: ** benefit design ** family composition ** demographic characteristics: *** age *** gender *** geographic area *** occupation *** industry ** lifestyle factors: *** tobacco use *** weight ** health status and claims history * Community rating ‚Äî prohibits insurers from varying rates based on health status or claims history ** Pure community rating ‚Äî allows insurers to vary rates based on benefit design and family composition only *** Limited variation in rates by geographic area is sometimes included in the pure community rating category (e.g. New York City) ** Adjusted (modified) community rating ‚Äî allows insurers to also vary rates based on demographic characteristics (e.g. age and gender) and lifestyle factors (e.g. tobacco use) * Guaranteed issue ‚Äî requires insurers to issue insurance to any eligible applicant without regard to health status or other case characteristics  Occurrence  Community rating of supplemental private health insurance: * Australia, Ireland ‚Äî lifetime community rating of private hospital insurance supplemental to universal publicly financed hospital insurance Community rating of basic private health insurance: * Netherlands ‚Äî age and gender rating illegal = pure community rating; individual guaranteed issue ** individual mandate with low-income government subsidies for 40% of households * Switzerland ‚Äî age and gender rating illegal = pure community rating; individual guaranteed issue ** individual mandate with low-income government subsidies for 40% of households * United States ** age rating limited to 3:1 (300 percent); gender rating illegal; individual guaranteed issue ** individual and employer mandates with government subsidies for individuals with income up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level - those with lower incomes pay lower costs. ** tobacco use can increase premiums up to 1.5:1, while geographic factors can also affect price.

It was discovered by Ye Quanzhi and Lin Chi-Sheng from Lulin Observatory. It peaked in brightness and arrived at perigee for observers on Earth on February 24, 2009, at magnitude +5, and at from Earth. The comet was near conjunction with Saturn on February 23, and outward first headed towards its aphelion, against the present position of background stars, in the direction of Regulus in the constellation of Leo, as noted on February 26 and 27, 2009. It was expected to pass near Comet Cardinal on May 12, 2009. The comet became visible to the naked eye from dark-sky sites around February 7. It figured near the double star Zubenelgenubi on February 6, near Spica on February 15 and 16, near Gamma Virginis on February 19 and near the star cluster M44 on March 5 and 6. It also figured near the planetary nebula NGC 2392 on March 14, and near the double star Wasat around March 17. According to NASA, Comet Lulin's green color comes from a combination of gases that make up its local atmosphere, primarily diatomic carbon, which appears as a green glow when illuminated by sunlight in the vacuum of space. When SWIFT observed comet Lulin on 28 January 2009, the comet was shedding nearly of water each second. Comet Lulin was methanol-rich.  Discovery  The comet was first photographed by astronomer Lin Chi-Sheng (ÊûóÂïüÁîü) with a telescope at the Lulin Observatory in Nantou, Taiwan on July 11, 2007. However, it was the 19-year- old Ye Quanzhi (ËëâÊ≥âÂøó) from Sun Yat-sen University in China who identified the new object from three of the photographs taken by Lin. Initially, the object was thought to be a magnitude 18.9 asteroid, but images taken a week after the discovery with a larger telescope revealed the presence of a faint coma. The discovery occurred as part of the Lulin Sky Survey project to identify small objects in the Solar System, particularly Near-Earth Objects. The comet was named \\"Comet Lulin\\" after the observatory, and its official designation is Comet C/2007 N3.  Orbit  Astronomer Brian Marsden of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory calculated that Comet Lulin reached its perihelion on January 10, 2009, at a distance of 113 million miles (182 million kilometers) from the Sun. The orbit of Comet Lulin is very nearly a parabola (parabolic trajectory), according to Marsden. The comet had an epoch 2009 eccentricity of 0.9999 _86_ , and has an epoch 2010 eccentricity of 0.9999 _98_. It is moving in a retrograde orbit at a very low inclination of just 1.6¬∞ from the ecliptic. Given the extreme orbital eccentricity of this object, different epochs can generate quite different heliocentric unperturbed two- body best-fit solutions to the aphelion distance (maximum distance) of this object. For objects at such high eccentricity, the sun's barycentric coordinates are more stable than heliocentric coordinates. Using JPL Horizons, the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 2014-Jan-01 generate a semi-major axis of about 1200 AU and a period of about 42,000 years.  Disconnected tail  On February 4, 2009, a team of Italian astronomers witnessed \\"an intriguing phenomenon in Comet Lulin's tail\\". Team leader Ernesto Guido explains: \\"We photographed the comet using a remotely controlled telescope in New Mexico, and our images clearly showed a disconnection event. While we were looking, part of the comet's plasma tail was torn away.\\" Guido and colleagues believe the event was caused by a magnetic disturbance in the solar wind hitting the comet. Magnetic mini-storms in comet tails have been observed before‚Äîmost famously in 2007 when NASA's STEREO spacecraft watched a coronal mass ejection crash into Comet Encke. Encke lost its tail in dramatic fashion, much as Comet Lulin did on February 4.

The film is a spin-off from his BBC Television series The Thick of It and satirises Anglo-American politics, in particular the invasion of Iraq.Xan Brooks, Iannucci's Iraq war satire lauded at Sundance in The Guardian, 21 January 2009. Retrieved 2010-02-26. It was nominated for the 2009 Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film stars Peter Capaldi, Tom Hollander, Gina McKee, Chris Addison, David Rasche, and James Gandolfini. Plot When both the UK and the US are suggesting military intervention in the Middle East, Simon Foster (Tom Hollander), the Minister for International Development, unintentionally states that a war in the Middle East is \\"unforeseeable\\" during a radio interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Prime Minister's Director of Communications, Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi), castigates Simon and tells him to toe the line. Toby Wright (Chris Addison), Simon's new aide, with the help of his girlfriend Suzy (Olivia Poulet), manages to get Simon into the Foreign Office meeting that day. Karen Clark (Mimi Kennedy), the US Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomacy, who is against military intervention, is leading the meeting and flags a report by her assistant Liza Weld (Anna Chlumsky) titled \\"Post-War Planning, Parameters, Implications and Possibilities\\" (PWPPIP). The report heavily opposes intervention, noting the lack of intelligence except that which is coming from an unsubstantiated source known as \\"Iceman\\". Also during the committee it is hinted at that the US Assistant Secretary of State for Policy, Linton Barwick (David Rasche), may have set up a secret war committee. After being ambushed by reporters, Simon contradicts his previous statement by saying the government has to be prepared to \\"climb the mountain of conflict\\" and is again subjected to chastisement from Tucker. Returning to the US, Karen and Liza conclude that Linton has created a war committee under the guise of Future Planning. At a party Karen teams up with General George Miller (James Gandolfini) who opposes the war believing that the US does not have enough troops to succeed. She tells him that they could use Simon on the committee as he would \\"internationalise the dissent\\". While on a fact-finding mission in Washington, Simon and Toby are invited by Karen to the Future Planning committee. Toby accidentally leaks the details of the meeting to a friend at CNN before meeting up with Liza at a bar; they end up sleeping together. Due to Toby's leak the Future Planning committee is swamped, but Karen and George fail to find out anything about the war. Both Karen and Linton turn to Simon to back their respective causes, but he struggles to say anything meaningful and ultimately does not take a side. Tucker, also in the US, is diverted by Linton to the White House for a fake briefing. He confronts Linton, who tells him that he must supply the US with the British intelligence on the situation in the Middle East, with which Linton will influence the vote on intervention. Simon, back in his constituency of Northampton, is harassed by a constituent, Paul Michaelson (Steve Coogan), about the state of one of Simon's constituency office walls which he claims is on the verge of collapsing into his mother's garden. News of this reaches the papers, who criticise Simon for not acting on the issue. Suzy finds out about Toby's one-night-stand with Liza and they break up. When leaving their apartment he gives her a copy of PWPPIP to leak if she chooses, but she calls him a coward for not doing it himself. The President rushes forward the security council vote on military intervention by vetoing tariffs on Chinese imports. Simon tells his Director of Communications Judy Molloy (Gina McKee), to leak to the press that he would resign if the committee votes in favour. Once at the UN Headquarters Tucker gets word that PWPPIP has been leaked, making a yes vote unlikely. It is later revealed that Michael Rodgers (James Smith) of the Foreign Office accidentally leaked it, not realising its importance. Miller and Tucker convince Jonathan Tutt (Alex Macqueen), the UK Ambassador, to push the meeting forward so that the leak will not have time to spread in the US. However, Linton asserts his dominance over Tucker by telling him that the British intelligence has to be handed over before a vote can be taken. Able to make Jonathan reverse his changes and delay the meeting, Tucker, with the help of Senior Press Officer Jamie McDonald (Paul Higgins), fabricates the details of PWPPIP by forcing Michael to remove all the arguments against intervention and presenting it as the intelligence. Subsequently, the committee votes in favour of intervention. After the vote, Miller informs Karen that he will not resign now that the war is happening. Simon realises that his own resignation is inevitable, but Tucker fires him from cabinet before he is able to do so. A new Minister for International Development arrives at the office. Cast The actors include Tom Hollander, who went on to appear in one episode of The Thick of It, Gina McKee, Steve Coogan, and seven American actors including James Gandolfini, Mimi Kennedy, David Rasche and Anna Chlumsky, the last of whom later starred in Iannucci's HBO satire Veep. Several actors from The Thick of It appear in the film, including Peter Capaldi, Chris Addison, Paul Higgins, James Smith, Alex Macqueen, Olivia Poulet, and Joanna Scanlan, and also, in very small roles, Samantha Harrington, Eve Matheson, and Will Smith.

After seven years with Halifax, he joined Hartlepools United, where he played for two years before joining Barrow in 1966. At Barrow, he was noted as a strong midfield player who played a key role in securing the club's promotion to the Third Division in 1967. He was at Southport from 1969 to 1971 before returning to Barrow for the 1971‚Äì72 season. In all, he made 162 league appearances for Barrow and a further 25 in other competitions, scoring three goals. He left Barrow for Scarborough in 1972.The Definitive Barrow AFC by Michael Gardner, publisher: Soccer Data/Tony Brown After retiring from playing Harrison entered coaching.  Manchester United  Hired from Everton in June 1981 by new Manchester United manager Ron Atkinson, with whom Harrison had played for the Royal Air Force football team, Harrison took the post of youth team manager. It was his responsibility to help guide the club's young players and mould them into future first-teamers. When Atkinson was sacked in 1986, his replacement, Alex Ferguson, decided to keep Harrison on as youth coach. Dissatisfied with the number of players coming through the United youth system, Ferguson called a meeting with Harrison to discuss potential improvements. Harrison pointed out that he had already made Norman Whiteside and a couple of others into first team players, but Ferguson argued that this was still not enough. Harrison retorted \\"Right, we'll do a deal. You get me better-quality players, and I'll get you more youngsters in the first team.\\" Ferguson agreed and set about increasing the club's scouting network two-or- threefold. Harrison's set-up subsequently produced a crop of first team players that became known as \\"Fergie's Fledglings\\" or \\"the class of '92\\". These included David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Robbie Savage. Harrison managed the Manchester United youth team that included many of these players and won the 1992 FA Youth Cup. The group has been described as \\"one of the best crops of young players in the English game\\". In 1993 Harrison introduced Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Keith Gillespie to first team football. In 1995 a Harrison-coached team, captained by Phil Neville, won the FA Youth Cup again. Other players brought through the Manchester United youth team by Harrison include Mark Hughes, Norman Whiteside, Clayton Blackmore and Graeme Hogg. Harrison left Manchester United around 2008.  Later life  Harrison was assistant manager of the Wales national football team for four years, under Hughes. In 2014, Harrison was diagnosed with mixed dementia, a condition that his own father had also lived with in his later years, and went to live in a nursing home. Harrison was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services to football in the 2018 New Year Honours. As he was unable to travel to London, he received his honour at Halifax Town's ground, The Shay. He died on 13 February 2019 at the age of 81.

Weightlifting career He competed for Great Britain in the 1948 Summer Olympics held in London, United Kingdom in the lightweight event where he finished third behind the winner, the outstanding Egyptian lifter Ibrahim Shams. He represented England and won a gold medal in the -67.5kg division at the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, New Zealand. Four years later he repeated the feat by winning another gold medal at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, Canada. Personal life Halliday's participation was remarkable as he had been a prisoner of war in the Far East from 1942 to 1945 having been captured when Singapore fell to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. During his imprisonment, he managed to lift a barbell (which had been made from wood) over his head, something which the other British prisoners (or the Japanese guards) could not manage. As a result of this, the Japanese commander cut the British prisoners' food rations as he believed they were getting too strong. He had weighed little more than 6 stone (38 kg) after three years as a PoW, including working on the Burma Railway. Halliday subsequently won two British Empire titles in 1950 and 1954. He worked on the coal gang at Kearsley Power Station and later became the Electricity Board's chief safety officer, travelling around the country lecturing men on how to lift heavy bags or dig holes.

CHF's mission is to \\"deliver hope to suffering children by equipping local churches for gospel-centered mercy ministry\\".  About  CHF's ministry approach to families and support of local churches is summed up in the acronym F.A.C.E.: Feed, Aid, Connect, and Equip. By providing food and aid to domestic and international churches, CHF connects them to families in their community. CHF equips these churches through training and education. CHF developed the Food Pak program as a method of delivering food into the homes of families in need. Food Paks, which can hold up to 20 pounds of non-perishable food and feed a family of four for up to a week, are packaged and prepared by volunteers in CHF distribution centers. Food Paks are later picked up by local churches, or shipped to international churches via sea containers. When the churches receive these boxes of food, they deliver them to families in their community. CHF calls this method of distribution Relational Mercy Ministry. As of 2013, CHF had distributed more than $1 billion in aid to children and families in need. History Dave Phillips, founder and president, began the ministry in 1991, working out of his garage with only one employee. They served eight churches composed of 200‚Äì300 families. In response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots, CHF increased its food distribution program in South Central Los Angeles. When the 1994 Northridge earthquake struck the San Fernando Valley, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asked Children's Hunger Fund to participate in relief efforts. CHF launched the Care Package program in 1998. For the first time, food was packed into cardboard boxes designed to assist a family in need. CHF‚Äôs desire was to encourage a more relational approach to helping the poor. Volunteers were trained to take the food to struggling families, visiting them in their own home, and establishing an ongoing, caring relationship through repeated home deliveries. What was then known as a Care Package is now called a \\"Food Pak\\", CHF's relationship-building tool, used to minister to children and families. In 2004, CHF began a partnership with Africa Renewal Ministries in Uganda, to form the first Mercy Network. A Mercy Network is a collection of like-minded churches that are pursuing gospel- centered Relational Mercy Ministry. CHF began resourcing churches in Uganda with Food Paks, and financial support to build homes for Bethany Village orphanage. Two years later, CHF expanded its reach by opening its second distribution center, located just outside of Chicago, IL. In its first year, the Midwest region trained 64 churches and agencies for Relational Mercy Ministry in their communities. However, this office was closed in July 2018. CHF's Southwest region was started in 2009 with the addition of a San Antonio distribution center, and expanded in 2016 by opening a Dallas distribution center. In 2013, CHF launched Rethink Mercy Equipping (RME)‚Äîthese workshops train churches to reach out to their communities through Relational Mercy Ministry. Once trained, churches receive resources, such as Food Paks, and join like-minded churches in Mercy Networks, with a goal to impact their communities with the gospel. To date, more than 1,100 churches have been trained by CHF through RME, resulting in a total of 46 Mercy Networks across five continents.  Efficiency rating  Since its inception in 1991, CHF has placed a priority on efficiency, transparency and financial accountability, consistently ranking at the top of America‚Äôs most cost-effective charities. 97% of every donation to CHF goes to support programs that serve suffering children. CHF is a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability and receives a 5 out of 5 Star Financial Efficiency Rating from Ministry Watch. CHF has repeatedly received a 4-star rating through Charity Navigator, their highest valuation possible.  Mercy Networks  A Mercy Network is a collection of like-minded churches that are pursuing gospel- centered, relational mercy ministry. CHF's international Mercy Networks are formed with the help of a central NGO which acts as the hub for churches in the area. Children's Hunger Fund Mercy Networks exist in 24 countries as of 2016: # United States # Mexico # Guatemala # El Salvador # Honduras # Haiti # Dominican Republic # Ecuador # Peru # Ghana # Uganda # Rwanda # South Africa # Kenya # Ethiopia # Zambia # Zimbabwe # Myanmar # Thailand # Nepal # Philippines # Belarus # Romania # Ukraine Volunteering CHF accepts volunteers from churches, community groups, and schools into distribution centers in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Antonio, and Dallas. Volunteers pack Food Paks on an assembly line, as well as bag bulk food, wrap toys, and sort donated product. CHF has an average of over 24,000 volunteer visits annually. America's Toy Wrap is CHF's largest annual volunteer event. Each year, thousands of volunteers gather to wrap toys donated by corporate manufacturers or retailers, which are later distributed to children through local churches and organizations.

He attended Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, from 1947‚Äì1951, studying English and journalism. In the 1970s, Robert Rodale played a major role in getting the state government's attention through his Cornucopia Project, which stimulated the publication of state- level analyses of how readily local demand could be met by local supply. At a time of increasing energy prices, a new emphasis on eating local became his platform for a more sustainable way of engaging with his community.Joan Gussow's article \\"But What Can I Eat In March\\" from the newspaper Natural Farmer Spring 1993 Personal life Rodale met his wife, Ardath Harter, at a square dance party held at her family home. His father \\"suggested\\" her as a wife for Robert after dancing with her himself. Robert and Ardath married in June 1951 after a short courtship.

He worked alongside his father as president of Rodale Press until his father's untimely death in 1971 during a television interview with Dick Cavett. Robert was the US representative at the founding of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) (now IFOAM-Organics International), at Versailles, France in 1972. He continued his work with the family publishing firm and non-profit agricultural research organization. That work included editing the high-circulation Prevention. He was the chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Rodale Press at the time of his death by car accident in Russia in 1990. Death On September 20, 1990, Rodale was killed in an auto accident in Moscow, while in the Soviet Union to establish a Russian-language edition of The New Farmer, one of several publications of Rodale Press devoted to an approach in farming that reduces reliance on chemicals. His widow, Ardath, died in 2009 at 81.

This episode first aired in the United States and Canada on January 18, 2009. It was released online to US residents at Funny or Die on December 17, 2008.Series Two pilot episode (Funny or Die) Plot synopsis Bret and Jemaine are at Murray's fancy new office discussing band matters. Murray tells the guys to return the seat cushion they stole from the library and mistakenly refers to Crazy Dogggz business, such as their gold records and collaboration with R. Kelly. The meeting ends as Bret and Jemaine fire Murray for failing to attend to his management duties. Murray sings \\"Rejected.\\" At a gig with a larger than usual crowd, two advertising agency executives offer Bret and Jemaine the opportunity to write a jingle for a commercial for a brand of toothpaste to be marketed solely to women. They agree, and work on ideas, asking Dave for his advice on what women like and how to negotiate with the advertising executives. Murray, meanwhile, finds himself unhappy that Bret and Jemaine are finding more success without him, and discovers the Crazy Dogggz have plagiarized \\"Doggy Bounce\\" from a Polish band, to the point where there are protests and public burnings in the street. (Led by Mel) A lawsuit results in a now-penniless Murray having to live in his car. The guys bungle Dave's negotiating strategy, but end up appearing in the commercial. When the executives ask for Bret and Jemaine's work permits to process their fees, Bret and Jemaine find themselves in a quandary, because they are illegal immigrants. They call Murray to ask him for their passports, which Murray says are in the consulate. Murray is reluctant to return to the place because he resigned with an incendiary letter, but he braces himself and finds that no one had noticed his quitting several months before and the letter is still on his desk, unread. He embraces his old desk in relief. Back at the commercial set, Murray arrives to help Bret and Jemaine, but only after they agree to rehire him as band manager. He tells the guys that their passports have not been processed, and suggests they make a run for it. Diving into Murray's car, they drive off as Murray comments that someone above must be looking out for them and the episode closes with \\"Angels\\". Songs The following songs were featured in this episode: =\\"Rejected\\"= Murray sings \\"Rejected\\" after Bret and Jemaine fire him as their manager. He describes his feelings at first in a delicate and poignant manner, but soon the song turns to an operatic style with Murray singing as a tenor (voice of Andrew Drost). He describes his feelings with increasing drama, such as \\"dejected, like a clown without a show\\" and \\"cut into two, or bisected\\". The song is briefly interrupted by Glenn (Andrew Secunda), who is told by Murray to wait a moment, before finishing the song, singing the final lyric in the manner in which the song began. =\\"Femident Toothpaste\\"= This is the boys' jingle for the Femident toothpaste commercial. In the ad, Bret and Jemaine are dressed as toothpaste being squeezed out of Femident toothpaste tubes. The song also incorporated some of the lyrics from \\"Nearly a Woman\\" from the \\"Pop Song\\" episode of the Flight of the Conchords radio series. =\\"Angels\\"= The episode ends with this song, after Murray announces he believes angels must be looking over them. The song is dedicated to the proposition that angels exist, live in the clouds above the earth, and primarily concern themselves with sex.

The LVRR had built coal docks in Perth Amboy when it built the Easton and Amboy in the 1870s, but it desired a terminal on the Hudson River close to New York City. The LVRR strove throughout the 1880s to acquire a route to the Jersey City waterfront. The first leg of that project was the Roselle and South Plainfied. Initially, the LVRR contracted with the CNJ for rights from Roselle to Jersey City, but the LVRR eventually constructed its own route to its terminal in Jersey City over the Newark and Roselle Railway, the Newark and Passaic Railway, the Jersey City, Newark, and Western Railway, and the Jersey City Terminal Railway. In 1891, the LVRR consolidated the company into the Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway, along with the other companies which formed the route from South Plainfield to the Jersey City terminal.

Killings  Reed and 28-year-old Laurie Rego dated briefly while they were both in the United States Army. Sometime after Rego tried to end the relationship, Reed pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to 37 months in prison. While incarcerated, he wrote numerous threatening letters to Rego. In May 1994, Reed was released from prison. Shortly afterwards he bought a gun and hitchhiked to the home of Rego's parents, Joseph and Barbara Ann Lafayette, who lived in Adams Run, South Carolina, looking for her. Reed shot the couple five times before fleeing the scene. Although no physical evidence linked Reed to the murder scene, he was arrested and questioned by police. He then cooperated with police in an attempt to locate the murder weapon and spent casings, however they were never recovered. Conviction Reed, who was said to have an IQ of 77 and have a \\"neurological impairment\\", represented himself and waived his right to testify during the final part of his trial at Charleston County Circuit Court. But prior to the jury being sent out to consider its verdict, Reed sought to alter his relationship with his standby counsel. He wanted to give a closing statement before his attorney would continue. Reed claimed it was because he was too emotional to cross-examine the victims' family. Over the objections of Reed‚Äôs standby counsel, District Court Judge William L. Howard refused to reappoint counsel because Reed had already waived his right to counsel at the opening of the trial making far too late in the proceeding for his attorney to adequately prepare. The jury took only 30 minutes to find Reed guilty of first degree murder recommending that he should receive the death penalty. Judge Howard concurred sentencing Reed to death for the double killings. In 2003, Reed ended his right to appeal in at least four different courts. He chose to die by electrocution instead of lethal injection, did not ask for clemency, eat a last meal, or make a final statement.  Execution  Reed's execution was set for 6pm on Friday June 20, 2008, but a series of appeals stopped the execution from occurring until 11:20pm, when the curtains were opened so that witnesses could view the execution. Reed was strapped into the chair, with a strap or mask that covered most of his head. Electrodes were connected to his head through a wire that could be seen connecting from the ceiling to a cap on his head and another wire was connected to the calf of his right leg. Reed was not seen to look at anyone and he declined to state any last words. He had earlier also declined to opt for a last meal or any spiritual advisor. After his declination to last words was announced, a leather hood was tied around his head. When the switch was thrown, witnesses heard a noise similar to the sound made by the key ring clip lock on a gas station pump handle when the tank is \\"full\\". The sound indicated that the circuit of the electric chair had been completed and current was now passing into Reed's body. Reed jerked forward, but other than that there was no significant movement. The electrodes were disconnected at 11:25pm and he was pronounced dead at 11:27pm. Witness to the execution included Marsha Lafayette Aleem, the youngest daughter of the couple Reed was convicted of murdering. She was seated in the first of three rows and directly in front of Reed as he sat in the electric chair. She was accompanied by two of her uncles. In the row behind them were a victims' advocate and an investigator. Seated in the third and final row were the three media witnesses invited to the execution. No one from Reed's family chose to attend his execution.

Building The present art centre was built in 1967 in Brutalist architecture by the architects Konrad Beckmann and Brockes. They used commercially available precast concrete for the construction work. History Ever since the building on the Grabbeplatz opened, it has housed two independent institutions, the Kunsthalle and the Kunstverein f√ºr die Rheinlande und Westfalen. Not merely externally different from all of the other museums in D√ºsseldorf, the Kunsthalle's conceptual direction is also distinct. Hosting an array of exhibitions, but without its own collection, contemporary art movements and positions, as well as their historical and local points of reference, were crucial to the Kunsthalle's program from the start. Pioneering shows were seen here, such as the series of \\"Prospect\\" exhibitions between 1968 and 1976, and so a number of international artists entered the European art market through the D√ºsseldorf Kunsthalle. It is the Kunsthalle's job to stimulate discussions and explorations of today's art, in its immediacy as well as in the context of current developments ‚Äì meaning, a kind of art that is articulate, that enters into social discourse. Mediating contemporary art, revealing its roots and its continuity within the artistic discourse is of central importance. At the end of the 1990s, D√ºsseldorf artists and citizens were successful in their efforts to retain the Kunsthalle. The building was temporarily closed for extensive renovation and modernization, which was carried out by the architectural team from rheinfl√ºgel. It has been open to visitors again since July 2002. Visitors are captivated by the inside of the building, thanks to its simple arrangement and the generous dimensions of its galleries. After renovation, the characteristics of these rooms were emphasized and optimized for presenting art. Discordant surfaces and technical additions were removed from floors, walls, and ceilings in favor of a new, smooth, glistening sheath that now hides installed technical equipment. The new lighting concept underscores the proportions of the rooms, and the fa√ßade of the entrance and the foyer zone, which extends from the ground floor to the second floor, once again fulfill the tasks of reception and orientation, as was foreseen in the original 1967 concept. The presence and form of the cashier's desk, bookshop, bar, and information desk have been designed to echo the cubist architecture of the Kunsthalle. The tradition of the Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf continued under the direction of Ulrike Groos from 2002 to 2009. With exhibitions like ‚ÄúBack to Concrete ‚Äî The Beginnings of Punk and New Wave in Germany 1977- '82,‚Äù ‚ÄúReady to Shoot ‚Äî Fernsehgalerie Gerry Schum, videogalerischum‚Äù (2003), ‚ÄúPalermo (2007), ‚ÄúSonic Youth etc.: Sensational Fix‚Äù (2009), and ‚ÄúEating the Universe.

Since January 2010, Gregor Jansen has been artistic director of the Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf. Under his direction, international currents and D√ºsseldorf positions, new talents and ‚Äúbig‚Äù names will continue to find their place in this out-of-the-ordinary venue.

After musical studies as a child, May studied voice in London with the composer George Benjamin Allen. She began singing in his concerts. May and Allen began to have a relationship, and she travelled with him to Australia in 1870, where they performed together in concerts. Beginning in 1872, May began star in comic operas in Australia. May and Allen returned to England in 1876, where she continued to perform in Offenbach works, earning good notices. In 1877, May created the role of Aline in The Sorcerer, earning warm reviews, but she left the company after only two months. She quickly returned to Offenbach in London under the management of Richard D'Oyly Carte and, by 1882, she was touring with Emily Soldene's opera company. She split up with Allen and moved to the U.S. in 1883, where she performed first in New York but soon joined Charles Ford's Opera Company in St. Louis and on tour. The next year, she married Louis Raymond, another member of the company. She was earning good notices, but she began to miss performances due to her growing struggle with alcoholism.

She debuted with the Barton English Opera Company in May 1883, in the title role of Michael Balfe's Satanella at New York's Standard Theatre. Her biographer, Adrienne Simpson, wrote that May was still reeling from her break-up with Allen and was drinking too much. This affected her performances and caused her to miss performances due to \\"indisposition\\". Satanella was a failure.Simpson, p. 138 Charles Ford, a son of John T. Ford, hired May for his St. Louis, Missouri opera company performing at Uhrig's Cave gardens and on tour. She first starred in F. C. Burnand and Meyer Lutz's operatic burlesque of Bluebeard, which had opened in London earlier that year. The piece was a popular hit, and May received excellent notices.Simpson, pp. 144‚Äì45 She then starred in H. B. Farnie and Robert Planquette's Rip Van Winkle, another hit.Simpson, pp. 145‚Äì46 May married bass-baritone Louis W. Raymond, another actor with Ford's Opera Company, in 1884.

Although the Objectivist movement has been criticized as being a cult of personality, The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies often publishes papers by mainstream intellectuals and academics from prestigious universities worldwide that approach Rand's legacy without hagiography. The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies is published twice a year. Occasionally, it publishes special issues. Controversy In 2002, philosopher Andrew Bernstein, who is intellectually affiliated with the Ayn Rand Institute, contributed a brief reply to a review of the CliffsNotes for Ayn Rand's novels. He subsequently issued an apology for having contributed to the journal. Bernstein wrote, \\"I deeply regret my thoughtless decision to contribute to this journal, and hereby irrevocably repudiate any and all association with it\\", and asserted that the journal was \\"filled with writings by people with whom I refuse to knowingly associate under any circumstances.\\" In 2007, the Department of Philosophy at Texas State University turned down a grant from the Anthem Foundation to support a visiting faculty position that would specialize in Objectivism. Bernstein was a candidate to fill the position. According to Rebecca Raphael, a Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Texas State, Bernstein's apology for publishing in the journal indicated that the Anthem Foundation was expecting the person hired to meet an \\"ideological litmus test.\\" According to reporter David Glenn, \\"When asked by The Chronicle about his 2002 comments, Mr. Bernstein replied that rejecting The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies was a moral and intellectual obligation.\\"  References  External links  * Category:Biannual journals Category:English-language journals Category:Penn State University Press academic journals Rand, Ayn Category:Publications established in 1999 Rand, Ayn Category:Works about Ayn Rand Category:Works about Objectivism (Ayn Rand) ","title":"The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies"},{"id":"20930166","text":"Andy Galvin (born 13 November 1965 in Whitstable, Kent, United Kingdom)Oakes, P & Rising, P (1986). 1986 Speedway Yearbook. was a speedway rider, most notable for his performances in the late 1980s and 1990 when he consistently appeared near the top of the UK National League averages.Oakes, P (1991).

The authorship of the song was uncertain for some time, being ascribed to various people, including Nikolay Gumilyov and Ivan Bunin. A popular belief attributed it to Russian Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak until the 1847 sheet music was found in archives. According to Russian romance researcher Yelena Ukolova, the song was created amid celebrations of the 700th anniversary of Moscow in January 1847. The music was composed by Pyotr Bulakhov (–ü–µ—Ç—Ä –ë—É–ª–∞—Ö–æ–≤), and the lyrics written by student Vladimir Chuyevsky (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ß—É–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π). However, the romance did not become popular until the eve of World War I when singer Vladimir Sabinin re-arranged it. The breakthrough came in 1915 when Sabinin's gramophone record appeared. During the Soviet years, the romance was labelled a 'white one' and obliterated for a while. In 1944 it was performed on record by Georgi Vinogradov. But, according to Ukolova, it was the 1956 American film War and Peace that made it possible for this romance to make a true comeback in USSR. The romance itself persisted only in tenors' repertoire until the bass singer Boris Shtokolov broke the custom. Lyrics { cellpadding=6 ! Russian ! Transliteration !

While Anas Al-Abdah is also a signatory of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and secretary of the Damascus Declaration Support Committee in the UK, his brother Malik set up the London-based Syrian opposition satellite channel Barada TV.  Controversies  Classified U.S. diplomatic cables, provided by the anti-secrecy Web site WikiLeaks, show that the U.S. State Department has funneled $6 million to Barada TV between 2006 and 2011 to operate the satellite channel and finance other activities inside Syria, The Washington Post reported. The State Department refused to comment on this allegation. There have been inconsistencies over the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights' leadership and an admission by them of some unvalidated and controversial reports, while WikiLeaks cables have revealed US State Department funding of Barada TV. The closeness of the Movement for Justice and Development in Syria, Barada TV and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights by virtue of the high level administrative & family links at the level of the al-Abdeh brothers casts doubt over the neutrality of these Syrian opposition groups operating out of Western Europe.

It have seen a lot of reconstruction since the Reformation. Hundslund Priory was a prominent Benedictine religious house in medieval Denmark. It was later transformed into the royal residence Dronninglund Castle. It is located at Dronninglund, north of Aalborg, Denmark. The priory was established about 1100 on a royal farm given by King Erik II Emune. The priory was built north of Aalborg for Benedictine nuns. It was dedicated to St. Mary and St. Clement (both names were used in documents). History The original church was built in Romanesque style with rounded arches and a flat timber ceiling. The old church was replaced in 1350 and then renovated several times into the remarkable structure which can still be seen today in its late Gothic form. The priory had three ranges attached to the church, so that it formed an enclosure to separate the nuns from the rest of the community. One range was used as a dormitory, a second for a refectory and cellars, and the third for lay sisters and unmarried noble women who lived at the priory. Margaret I gave income properties to Hundslund in the early 14th century, and her favor brought additional gifts from noble families, making the abbey the owner of farms, mills, and other rent property for the sustenance of the abbey. It became one of the largest landowners in northern Jutland. Hundslund Priory was involved in a lengthy lawsuit with State Councillor Anders Banner over the boundary between his estate and priory lands in 1455. The priory accused Banner of ordering his servants to move the boundary staves and then hired 25 witnesses at the local assembly to say that no one had claimed the disputed land for more than 60 years. Banner was excommunicated by the Bishop of B√∏rglum for his intransigence. The suit was mediated by King Christoffer I at Kalundborg in 1468. Anders Gyldenstierne was appointed superintendent of the secularized priory in 1531. In the confusion during Skipper Clement's 1534‚Äì1535 rebellion, the nuns were literally thrown out of the priory in 1535 by the last Catholic Bishop of B√∏rglum, Stygge Krumpen. Krumpen occupied the priory with his retainers. Gyldenstierne complained on behalf of the nuns to Christian III. The king wanted to strip Bishop Krumpen of his power in order to get control of the State Council and establish the . The king ordered him out of the priory and restored it to Anders Gyldenstierne and ordered him to keep an eye out for the king's interest in the estate until 1555. The abbey became a home for former nuns and unmarried women until 1572. The entire archive of the priory was transferred to Aalborg Castle, where it was inventoried, but all documents were lost. A few letters regarding Hundslund were preserved in other archives, including the letters of gift from Margaret I. In 1561 the mortgage on the abbey was paid off by one of Denmark's leading noblemen, Corfitz Uhlfeldt. Hundslund Priory passed into private ownership in 1581, when Frederik II sold the abbey and its properties to the nobleman Johannes Linenov.  Sources  *'Dronninglund Church' *'Dronninglund'.

Smithgall won re-election for a second term in the 2001 mayoral election against Democrat Ed Ruoff. Smithgall sought to seek a third term in the 2005 mayoral election. His Democratic challenger during that election was Rick Gray, a lawyer. The 2005 campaign between Smithgall and Gray was the most expensive mayoral election in Lancaster's history.

In a surprise outcome, Smithgall, an early favorite for re-election, was defeated by Gray by 16 percentage points. 2009 campaign Gray announced his intention to seek a second term as mayor on December 17, 2008. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary and initially had no Republican opposition in the general election as well. Smithgall initially declined a potential rematch with Gray, leaving no Republican challenger. However, a grassroots campaign was launched by supporters of the former mayor to support him as a write-in candidate in the Republican primary. Despite the efforts by supporters to draft him into the election, Smithgall remained out of the mayoral race until after the May 2009 primary. Smithgall received 227 write-in votes from supporters in the primary. Smithgall's supporters needed 100 votes to draft him as their write-in candidate and validate a potential candidacy. After some consideration, Smithgall entered the race and officially announced his candidacy on June 26, 2009. Unlike the 2005 election, Gray has outraised and outspent Smithgall by nearly five times between June 2009 and October 2009. Gray had raised in $33,908 and had approximately $20,805 in cash on hand as of October 19, 2009. By contrast, Smithgall raised just $6,900 and had just $519 in cash on hand during the same time period.

Description Winchester introduced the .32SL and .35SL cartridges in the Winchester '05 self-loading rifle, a centerfire version of the Winchester '03. The .32SL never gained popularity as a hunting cartridge, although it may be suitable for the largest small game such as fox and coyote at ranges under 150 yards.Whelen, Townsend (1918) The American Rifle Century Co. p. 257. Both the .32SL and .35SL were soon superseded by the introduction of the more powerful .351SL in the Winchester '07. Stebbins, Henry (1958) Rifles: A Modern Encyclopedia Stackpole Books, p. 127 When first introduced however, the notable firearm expert Townsend Whelen noted the .32SL cartridge as displaying similar ballistics as the .32-40 Winchester black powder, low-pressure cartridge.Whelen, Townsend (1918) The American Rifle Century Co. p. 257 He further suggests the best use of the .32 SL as being for rapid-fire target shooting for ranges up to 300 yards. Within such ranges, it is quite an accurate cartridge. In October 1940. an Army Ordnance circular suggested development of a light rifle using a .30 caliber cartridge similar to the \\"Winchester Self-loading Cartridge, Caliber .32\\" to replace the pistol and submachine gun. This led to the production of the \\"Caliber .30 SL, M1\\" cartridge directly based on the .32 SL in February 1941 and, after a design competition, adoption of the Winchester-designed M1 carbine in October 1941.Larry Ruth, M1 Carbine: Design Development and Production, The Gun Room Press, 1979.

It manufactures heavy trucks and buses under the Volkswagen marque. Volkswagen Caminh√µes e √înibus was originally a part of the Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles division of the Volkswagen Group, but as of 1 January 2009, it came under the ownership of MAN SE and is now part of MAN Latin America. Volkswagen Caminh√µes e √înibus operation In 1979, Volkswagenwerk AG acquired a 67% percent stake in Chrysler Motors do Brasil Ltda. In January 1980, it increased its shareholding to 100%, therefore giving it the right to rename the company to Volkswagen Caminh√µes Ltda. The first Volkswagen Truck - the 1981 13.130 Volkswagen Caminh√µes Ltda. released their first trucks in February/March 1981; the Volkswagen 11.130 and the Volkswagen 13.130, both had a reworked version of Volkswagen's Mk1 LT cabin, and were powered by MWM Motores Diesel Ltda (MWM) diesel engines on Chrysler engineered platforms which were inherited from the takeover. AutoLatina years From 1990 to 1995, Volkswagen Trucks and Buses were built with Ford components as part of the AutoLatina venture, and were built in Ford's Ipiranga complex in Brazil. Once the AutoLatina marriage fell through, Volkswagen Group had no factory for its trucks and their parts, so the Resende plant was built in 1995. Resende rebirth 1996, Resende was the official start for Volkswagen Trucks and Buses, developing their own parts and platforms. The Modular Consortium was introduced for the first time in Resende. Modular Consortium The Modular Consortium is the group of main suppliers that make the parts, and assembles them for Volkswagen Truck and Bus on site in the Resende factory. Volkswagen Groups involvement is only in supplying the factory and inspection at the end of production; Volkswagen pays only a small amount of wages, as each partner of the Modular Consortium pays the workers. The Modular Consortium comprises these companies: *Maxion Sistemas Automotivos Ltda. manufacture the chassis parts such as Air Reservoir, Fuel Tank and Frame *ArvinMeritor manufacture the Suspension and Axle parts such as Springs and Hubs and Drums *Remon S.A. manufacture the Tires and Wheels *Aethra Karmann-Ghia manages the Body Shop *Carese manages the Paint Shop *Continental AG manufacture the Cab Trim components such as Seats and Instrument Panel Sales Most of the early sales of the Truck and Bus chassis' operations were mainly within South America; with the exception of small exportations to China and the Middle East. Prior to Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles' new role of managing the Truck and Bus operation; in 1994 Volkswagen imported to Germany a 7 tonne truck: the Volkswagen L80. Due to the European Union Gas Emissions EU4 standards; exports discontinued in late 2000. The Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles era Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles took over the Brazilian Trucks and Buses operation in 2000 from Volkswagen do Brasil; Volkswagen's Brazilian subsidiary. This signaled the start of a new era for the Volkswagen Group in producing its own Heavy Truck and Bus chassis range, which covers the gross combination mass (GCM) of 5 tonnes to 57 tonnes category. Since Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles have taken control; the company has been looking at expanding Truck and Bus sales to other markets outside of South America, South Africa and Middle East regions. All Volkswagen Caminh√µes e √înibus vehicles are built in the Resende, Brazil factory and sent in semi knocked down (SKD) kits to Uitenhage in South Africa and Puebla in Mexico. Planned future markets for export are ASEAN and Eastern Europe countries. Volkswagen Caminh√µes e √înibus released the new Volkswagen Constellation range in September 2005, with a gross combination mass from 13 tonnes to 57 tonnes. Volkswagen Caminh√µes e √înibus company facts *The Resende plant was built in 153 days at a cost of US$250 million *The Resende plant adheres to International Organization for Standardization ISO TS and ISO 14001 *Resende plant produces 240 vehicles per day in two working shifts and employs 4,500 workers.Locations ‚Äì America ‚Äì Resende (Brasil) *Volkswagen Trucks and Buses are sold in over 35 countries around the world.

These thoughts converged with the assignment to create the first Oyako photo shoot where he decided to photograph the rockers with their parents to bring forth the differences in lifestyle and fashion between generations. ‚ÄúIt was the coincidence of being asked to photograph punks and being an expectant father that gave birth to the idea of Oyako,‚Äù Bruce Osborn stated in an interview with Olympus. To his surprise and delight, these pictures transcended the scope of his assignment and touched on the deeper subject of family relations. By focusing on this core relationship over 1,000 photo- shoots, he has been able to chronicle the changes Japanese society has undergone over more than twenty-five years. With years already invested in the project, in 2003 Bruce and his wife decided to take the series to the next level by using the concept of a public photo shoot to start a day where people would put their attention on parent-child relationships. In an interview with Olympus in 2006 Bruce shares the insights he‚Äôs gained through Oyako Day: > ‚ÄúI‚Äôve discovered just how beautiful the Japanese parent-child relationship > is. It‚Äôs a bit of an oversimplification, but I think parent-child > relationships in the West are more animal-like, emphasizing being strong and > independent, where in Japan this relationship is more plant-like and gets > intertwined like roots. I think people in other countries could benefit by > learning more about Japanese culture and its special parent-child > relationship. The parent-child bond is the basis of all human relations, and > the world would be a better, more peaceful, place if families got on well > with each other. But it takes more than just words to get this message > across.‚Äù Participation in Oyako Day Super Photo Session To participate in Oyako Day hopeful families must send a snapshot of their family, with names and occupations, and a brief note about why they want to attend.

The series takes place in a fictional universe where the rich and powerful can have their deepest desires filled by a fetish club called the Roppongi Club. The series follows the discovery of the girl at the center of the club and one man's quest to free her. Speed Grapher's main character is Tatsumi Saiga, a veteran war journalist who now survives on photographing for tabloids. He discovers the Roppongi Club while stalking for the newspaper and meets Kagura Tenn≈çzu. He takes her from the club and tries to escape the influence of Ch≈çji Suitengu with the help of others. Suitengu, wishing to have Kagura back in his control, sends club members, all Euphorics who were granted special powers based on their desires, to stop them. Main charactersTatsumi Saiga= Tatsumi Saiga from Speed Grapher. is the male protagonist. A veteran war journalist, he somehow took a liking to it. His love for photography develops into sexual fetish; he gets an erection whenever he takes exciting photographs. However, after returning to Japan, his passion seems to have died. While investigating a secret club where rich and influential people meet to fulfill their most perverted desires, he receives a kiss from Kagura and develops the ability to explode whoever and whatever he photographs - Death by Photograph. The effect of this ability depends on what type of camera and lens he is using (e.g., a telescopic lens has a more powerful effect than a regular lens). He can also psychically load film into his camera. He was infected by the virus on the same island that Suitengu was. Saiga uses a Nikon camera and what looks to be Nikor lenses (despite the title of the series, Saiga was never depicted with a Speed Graphic). When using his powers his camera gains a black aura, while his right eye (it can be either, but he aims with his right) turns blood shot and the iris bright green while large veins protrude around it. Although he is thrown into a fight he does not fully understand, Saiga shows a natural prowess for fighting. He is able to keep a cool head, and even demonstrates some level of training in close range combat. No doubt, skills he picked up after years of being a war photographer. Over the course of the series Saiga gets more and more protective of Kagura. First acting as a sort of teacher, he shows her the world that she never saw. When anyone questions whether he is in love with her, he casually brushes it off saying \\"it's not like that\\", or just ignoring the question altogether. In the final episode when Kagura says the world would be better if she and Suitengu were dead, Saiga admits to her that he loves her and wants her to live more than anything. Five years after Suitengu's coup d'etat, a blind Saiga is taking pictures of the sunset, when a twenty-year-old Kagura walks through the laundry drying in the sun. He then says \\"Welcome back\\", and the two embrace and the screen moves up toward the sunset. His Japanese voice actor is Y≈´ji Takada. Christopher Sabat provides his voice in the English version. =Kagura Tenn≈çzu= Kagura Tennozu as the club's \\"goddess\\" from Speed Grapher. is the female protagonist and a student at the elite and prestigious St. Ignatius Academy. Raised as the heir to the powerful Tenn≈çzu Group, her bodily fluids contain an enzyme that has the ability to transform people infected with a mysterious virus into Euphorics (people with supernatural powers related to their innermost desires). She also has an inoperable brain tumor, causing her to only have six months left to live. Associates of Suitengu have given her injections to keep her from reaching puberty as this will apparently cause her to stop producing the enzyme, not to mention Shinsen starves her to almost death. Even though Saiga doesn't acknowledge his feelings about Kagura, she has no problem expressing the fact that she wants to be at his side no matter what. When Saiga comes to terms with his feelings and Kagura sees how much he changes she often jokes about how \\"uncool\\" he's become, but nevertheless she still loves him. Before Saiga's fight with Suitengu he tells Kagura his feelings, which makes her very happy. Then tells Ginza to take Kagura to the island where Ry≈çgoku is, so he can treat her right away. After five years she returns to Japan to be at Saiga's side. Her voice actress in the original Japanese version is Kei Shindou, and she is voiced by Monica Rial in the English version. Tokyo Police DepartmentHibari Ginza= Hibari Ginza from Speed Grapher. is a vicious policewoman in love with Saiga. She is very jealous of him and does anything she can to protect him from harm. She has a joking habit of saying or threatening \\"self-defense\\" whenever she shoots or kills someone (usually while they're attacking her). She blackmails Saiga into having sex with her by stealing his camera and promising to give it back after. She is very envious of Kagura and makes a deal with Shinsen to recapture Kagura if she can \\"keep\\" Saiga. After returning Kagura, she takes an unconscious Saiga back to her apartment. Ginza begins to become depressed when people tell her things about Saiga she didn't know. She really goes off the handle when Suitengu tells her that she severely underestimated the worth of Saiga and Kagura to the Tenn≈çzu Group, after she tried to bargain for his life in exchange for a petty conman. Ginza eventually realizes that she cannot stop Saiga from loving Kagura and helps him to stay alive. Even though she is angry when Saiga tells Kagura he loves her she agrees to take her to the island where Ry≈çgoku is to get treatment.

She is voiced by Takako Honda in the original Japanese version and by Clarine Harp in the English version. =Shiina= Hibari Ginza's partner, tends to be very scared of Ginza and as such tends to pretty much follow her orders without so much as thinking of telling her no. He is also an amateur photographer and a fan of Saiga's work. At the end of the series he finally becomes a photographer and takes Saiga's old job. In his new job he is degraded because his skills are inferior to Saiga's, even though Saiga is now blind. His Japanese voice actor is Jin Yamanoi and his English voice actor is Anthony Bowling. =Chief Ekoda= Chief is the Chief of the Tokyo Police Department. He has an extreme leg fetish; he cuts off the legs of numerous women and proudly displays them in his house. Later he is caught by Ginza as a member of Suitengu's club.

Roppongi Club/Tenn≈çzu GroupCh≈çji Suitengu= Choji Suitengu from Speed Grapher. , the main antagonist, is a Euphoric with the ability to manipulate his own blood and use it at will to attack and defend. Apparently he is only using Kagura and her mother to extend his influence and profits, but there is a hidden vengeance plan in his agenda. He carries around a music box that belonged to his younger sister, Yui. His real name is Ueno Takeshi. Suitengu once had a normal life with his family. However, his parents were deep in debt with the Tenn≈çzu Group's predecessors (the Ashikaga Group) and were murdered. Yui and Suitengu were separated, the thirteen-year-old boy given to the mercies of a perverted and lecherous man before being sold as a child soldier while the five-year-old girl was sold as a prostitute. Suitengu grew up on the battlefield, told that every kill he made reduced his parents' debt and brought him that much closer to freedom. His last mission was infiltrating a research lab, but the facility was destroyed and Suitengu was severely wounded, even dismembered, in the destruction. However, he contracted the Euphoria virus as a result of this and was thus retrieved and repaired by the research lab's remaining scientists so that they could preserve their work. They grafted different body parts from his mercenary team and the arm of Kazuki Odawara, Kagura's father and the scientist that developed the research and who had the enzyme that awaken his power. Suitengu despises the fact that his family and his life were ruined for money and as such secretly holds a deep hatred for it. Eventually he was reunited with his sister, but is horrified at discovering her state of mind had been shattered from years of abuse. As he held her with bloody tears streaming down his eyes, he reluctantly euthanized Yui to end her suffering. His ultimate goal was to take revenge on the Prime Minister who destroyed his peaceful life and punish people steeped in greed and money by causing the entire country to go bankrupt.

Her body had been \\"remodeled\\" by a doctor named Kazuki Odawara, whom she soon fell in love with. Despite her rise to fame, she chose to leave it behind and marry Kazuki. Shinsen had signed their marriage licenses and waited for several days for him to show up at a hot spring, but he never came. She then returned to Tokyo, left bitter by his betrayal and sees Kagura as the ultimate symbol of it, and punishes the girl by starving her to almost death, even having sex with her female teacher and having Kagura catch them in the act purely out of spite. Though she seems in love with Suitengu, Shinsen realizes he was just a replacement for Kazuki in her loneliness. While incredibly cruel to Kagura and many others, Shinsen is incredibly kind to G≈çtokuji, whose injuries she believes are her fault, showing a different, more compassionate side. Seeing Suitengu's true nature, Shinsen once again intended to leave fame behind to try and live a quiet life. She is then strangled to death by Suitengu, using Kazuki's left arm. Before she is about to be strangled Suitengu reveals to her why his left arm always felt so loving by saying \\"You were always caressed by your true love's arm\\". In her final moments, she hears Kagura telling her that Kazuki had indeed come for her and she wasn't abandoned to which she gives a slight chuckle realizing how foolish she had been. Her voice actress in the original Japanese series is Gara Takashima and her English voice actress is Pam Dougherty. =Tsujid≈ç= is Suitengu's right-hand man and accompanies him wherever he goes, often as a personal attendant. His Euphoria power is super enhanced olfaction, allowing to smell his enemies miles away (unlike most Euphorics, Tsujido does not require a physical transformation to be able to use this). He doesn't reveal himself as a Euphoric until the last episode while fighting Ginza, in which he transforms into a large wolf. Along with Makabe, he was abused by local Yakuza years before and saved by Suitengu. However, he had already had his nose cut off and was near death due to blood loss. He chooses to stay behind with Makabe to protect Suitengu when the building is under attack. Despite serious injuries, he manages to find and carry Suitengu to the generator's control room, where he dies alongside him as the main office of the Tennouzu group self-destructs. Tsujido's voice actor in the Japanese anime is Hiro Y≈´ki and his English voice actor is Greg Ayres. =Makabe= One of the men who works under Tsujido, is a big, tall, bear of a man, and doesn't talk as much as his partner, Niihari. Makabe tends to be more professional in getting the job done. When tracking Kagura and Saiga with Niihari and Tsujido, he often acts as the driver. He knew the two before Suitengu had met them. After being beaten unconscious by Yakuza, Suitengu appears and slaughters all but one of them. Because of this, he feels great gratitude and stays behind with Tsujido to help Suitengu. During the assault on the main office, the ceiling collapses due to a rocket barrage and he dies protecting Tsujido from being crushed. His Japanese voice actor is Hisao Egawa while Bob Carter serves as his English voice actor. =Niihari= is the other henchman working under Tsujido. Unlike his more silent partner, Makabe, Niihari has a habit of talking a lot and speaking with profoundly foul language at times.

Niihari was the first henchman that Suitengu met as he was outside the building Makabe and Tsujido were kept, nervously holding a sword as he was preparing to rescue them both. He is the only one of the Tennouzu Group to survive and in the end of the series, Niihari has become a successful businessman who intends to one day build three colossal towers and name them after Suitengu, Tsujido, and Makabe. Kenjiro Tsuda provides the Japanese voice for Niihari and Robert McCollum is his English voice actor.

His head was blown off by Saiga using a piece of mirror to reflect his camera shot. His Japanese voice actor is Takehito Koyasu and his English voice actor is J.

She was the wife of a talented artist who gave her diamonds to make her happy, but hanged himself after taking out an insurance policy. Since then she has become obsessed with making her body into a shining monument of his love for her. In her diamond form, her translucent body made it hard for Saiga to focus on her body. She betrayed the club and kidnapped Kagura and demanded a ransom of diamonds, but Saiga came to her rescue using spray paint on Koganei's body which gave him points to focus on. She was then killed by Suitengu for her betrayal by being shattered into a million pieces and having her body turned into diamonds to be sold. The last shot of her was her shattered face shedding a tear. Her Japanese voice actress is Mari Yok≈ç and her English voice actress is Colleen Clinkenbeard. =Toshiki Mizunoguchi= is a sadistic dentist and Euphoric user who has been given extra spider-like limbs with dental devices on them and can even turn other parts of his body into drills (such as his tongue). He tortures patients by inserting all of his limbs into their mouths and polishing their teeth slowly. Apparently he removed Kagura's lower molars three years ago, but did it as slow as he could so he could see Kagura writhing in pain. He kept one of them as a crown jewel of sorts and carves it obsessively. He even requested that Kagura be sent to him for a monthly \\"cleaning\\" after retrieving her. He met his end when Saiga blew his head off, with his prized tooth laying beside his lifeless hand. He is voiced by Shiro G≈ç in the original Japanese version and by R Bruce Elliott in the English version. =Ran Yurigaoka= is an esthetician whose Euphoric power enabled him to make the tattoos on his skin a reality. His most commonly used tattoos are the large spider on his back, used for travel if needed as well as attack, and the skull and dagger on one of his arms which is used for battle. He can also control other people with the small spider tattoo on one of his fingers, by merging with its victim's skin the spider tattoo can manipulate their limbs with its own. Ran derives pleasure from merging his spider tattoo into the skin of women, and then using it to kill them. With help from Ginza, Saiga was able to destroy his body, leaving only his legs and fragments of skin. His voice actor in the original Japanese version is Takeshi Kusao, and he is voiced by Christopher Bevins in the English version. =Father Kanda= A corrupt Priest, who was found out to have given all of the Church's donation money to the Roppongi Club to pay his Membership dues, Father is a Euphoric who had the power to control electricity. He can also transform into wires and control thunder bolts. He believes he is a God, due to his powers. He was to be the minister at Kagura and Suitengu's wedding, but Saiga's interruption made him want to try and kill him after he destroys part of the chapel which Kanda felt was a worthy tribute to himself. In the end he killed himself after using his powers to try and electrocute Saiga after he had been seriously injured, thereby blowing himself up. His Japanese voice actor is Ry≈´zabur≈ç ≈åtomo and his English voice actor is Bill Flynn. =Miharu Shirumaku= is a former actress who had a traumatic past due to her mother trying to drown her in a suicide/murder attempt. Since her mother's suicide she's become mute. She's also drowned every man who has fallen in love with her. Appropriately she can turn herself into a fish-like being, resembling a mermaid or a fish monster, and manipulate water (or fog by controlling the water droplets it's made of), she can even transform herself into water. Despite her mother's actions, she still loves her and sees water as a substitute for her mother's embrace. She died by using too much power, causing her liquid form to evaporate into the atmosphere. Before her death she managed to speak, saying \\"At last, I can be with her\\" referring to her mother. (In a flashback she had before her death it's revealed that she begged her mother to \\"take her with her\\", indicating that she wanted to drown with her mother, even showing her smiling as she and her mother were sinking).

The sound he emits can cause internal damage to the body and can reduce objects to dust. He loves music and, when using his powers, pretends he is a conductor. He turned to Saiga to help him bring down Suitengu and Kamiya, but in reality he only wanted to get rid of him and anyone else who could expose the truth. During his battle with Saiga he reveals that he believes that the media exists to hide the truth. After a tough battle with Saiga, he was killed when Saiga got close enough to him to use a miniature camera. While he is not seen dead, it is assumed he died.

After feeling he had been double-crossed he took Kagura and drank a bottle containing the virus he extracted from Saiga, making himself a carrier.

IGN commented that Speed Grapher is largely character-driven and positively noted many characters. Anime News Network liked the minor villains because they were more developed than \\"the norm for bad guys in their roles,\\" though Suitengu was criticized for being bland. ANN also noted that \\"Many of its character designs are a little rough\\" compared to other Gonzo releases and that their animation was \\"frequently bad.\\" SciFi Weekly pointed out that though many characters' stories were deeply explored, they were thrown together in a baffling manner. In addition, SciFi Weekly disliked how many characters were \\"almost as throwaways\\" and how they \\"tend to make brief appearances and then disappear without comment.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official Japanese Site * Official English Site * Speed Grapher ","title":"List of Speed Grapher characters"},{"id":"20930685","text":"Ariyalai (; AriyƒÅleyi) is a suburb of the city of Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka.

He was then announced as the mystery new buyer of Mill Cottage. He seemed keen to help Ashley Thomas (John Middleton) in the church and all that he appeared to have was his dog ‚Äì Bolan. Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower) didn't like Ray at first, as Ray had beat him to the purchase of Mill Cottage. Ray started growing closer to Louise during 2002 and they started going out. But it was obvious that Ray had a darker, more menacing side to him. He got involved with Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman) in a car scam, which was run by one of his right hand men, Tony. But Tony soon disappeared after Ray and Scott talked. Another example of Ray's dodgy side was when he got involved with Chris Tate (Peter Amory) and his wife, Charity (Emma Atkins), through Tate Haulage. He wanted certain goods to be transported, but Charity and Terry Woods (Billy Hartman) soon found out that there were more than just goods in the truck. They discovered that Ray had been bringing illegal immigrants into the country. When Charity confronted Ray, his nasty streak appeared when he pinned Charity up against the wall and threatened her. Despite all this, Louise continued to turn a blind eye to his activities unaware that Ray was hiding more than just his dodgy deals from his girlfriend, he had also hidden the fact that he had diabetes. He proposed to her in September 2002, but she turned him down. The storyline leading up to Ray's departure started rather simply, with Ray comforting Louise after a stalker started terrorising her. As the ordeal progressed Ray continued to comfort Louise, helping her as she got freaky phone calls, expensive gifts and lingerie through the post. Eventually the situation got so bad that just before Christmas, Ray proposed that he and Louise emigrate to Italy and she agreed but not before leaving a message on her stalker's phone before she left. On the way to the airport, Ray's phone started ringing and she discovered that Ray had two phones and that one phone had a new voicemail message. Despite his attempts to stop her listening to the message, Louise did and heard her own voice. She realised that her stalker was right under her nose the whole time ‚Äì it was Ray. As Ray started driving erratically, he explained his reasons for stalking her and the car crashed into a ditch. Ray was unconscious, but Louise managed to escape and ran to the village. Ray followed her though and they returned to Mill Cottage and trying to stop him following her, she grabbed a vase and hit Ray with it, knocking him back down the stairs and breaking his neck.

Maggie found out that Nicola had changed bookings around, so that some guests arrived earlier than expected. This was the last straw for Maggie, who pushed Nicola into the swimming pool. In early April, Jess left the village with her mother Anne-Marie. Maggie and Phil's relationship was eased slightly without Jess. But soon Nicola's games started again. Maggie embarked on an affair with Rodney and he and Phil had a fight when the truth came out. Phil dumped Maggie and left the village. Shortly afterwards, Maggie left the village with Craig and Lucy and moved to Scotland. Phil Weston Phil Weston arrived with his girlfriend Maggie Calder, her children and his daughter Jess. He had recently split up with his alcoholic wife, Anne-Marie. Jess and Maggie didn't see eye to eye at all. They fought over minor things. Phil was stuck in the middle, but got on with Craig and Lucy. Jess continued to try and break up the new family and soon teamed up with Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler). Nicola plotted against Maggie, and was very friendly towards Phil. But Maggie and Phil's relationship survived. In the end Jess left the village with her mother. Phil was upset about this, but soon got over it. Phil got a job working for Tate Trash. He left the village in July 2002, a few months after arriving, when he found out Maggie had an affair with Rodney Blackstock (Patrick Mower). Jess Weston Jess Weston is the mature, yet scheming daughter of Phil and Anne-Marie Weston. She instantly disliked her father's new partner Maggie Calder, and did not hide this fact, opting to try and break up her father's relationship. At Christmas, Jess visited her mother, but was late back from her break. Phil got worried and drove down to try to find her. This continued to put strain on her father's relationship. Jess even teamed up with Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler) to try and bring down the new family. Although she didn't like Maggie, Jess found friend's with Lucy and Craig. They got on very well together. When Jess left the village in April 2002, a few months after she arrived, after her mother turned up, everyone was sad to see her go.

Lyn Hutchinson Lyn Hutchinson, played by Sally Walsh, made her first appearance on 8 January 1997. Walsh said receiving the role of Lyn was \\"like coming home in a way\\" because she had previously worked with Steve Halliwell (Zak Dingle) and Paul Fox (Will Cairns). Louise Oswald of The People dubbed Lyn and Kelly Windsor (Adele Silva) Emmerdale's \\"terrible twosome\\" and compared them to Coronation Street's Battersby sisters. Oswald also stated, \\"Kelly and Lyn are the original sweet-faced kids with a frightening wild streak. Parents watching the show see what they get up to and start wondering what their own daughters are doing. And young soap fans love to see them up to the sort of tricks they wouldn't dare try themselves.\\" Walsh's younger sister Amy Walsh joined the cast of Emmerdale in 2014 as Tracy Shankley. Lyn taunts Kelly Windsor about her relationship with teacher, Tom Bainbridge (Jeremy Turner-Welch), causing the two girls to fight and forcing Tom to separate them. Despite this, Lyn and Kelly later become friends. Lyn bullies Emma Cairns (Rebecca Loudonsack) about her teenage pregnancy. She dates Roy Glover (Nicky Evans) and Marlon Dingle (Mark Charnock), who she then cheats on with Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman). Lyn breaks up with Marlon on his 25th birthday. Lyn and Scott start a relationship, which ends when she discovers Scott has been having an affair with Kelly, who is his stepsister. Disgusted by this, Lyn ends her relationship with Scott and leaves the village. Barry Clegg Barry Clegg, played by Bernard Wrigley, made his first appearance on 30 January 1997. Barry was introduced as the estranged husband of Lisa Clegg (Jane Cox). Despite the couple being separated, Barry lived in an outhouse on the same farm as Lisa. He was \\"an irritation\\" to Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell), who was in love with Lisa. Barry is an eccentric, who builds a space rocket. Marlon (Mark Charnock) and Butch Dingle (Paul Loughran) accidentally cause it to launch early while fighting, and it enters the Dingle's barn and explodes. Barry tries to stop Lisa from marrying Albert Dingle (Bobby Knutt), but is forcibly ejected from the church, leading to Albert's brother Zak to declare his feelings for Lisa. Months later, Barry competes against Zak for a busking pitch and he shows off his pedal powered microwave on a television show filmed in the village. Barry returns with a wedding present for Zak and Lisa's wedding. Although, they tell him he cannot come to the service, he attends Zak's stag night and lends him some money for the alcohol for the reception. John Millar of the Daily Record branded Barry's space travel ambitions as \\"a laugh.\\" Paddy KirkDee Pollard Dee Pollard (n√©e de La Cruz) was the former wife of Eric Pollard and she appeared from February 1997 until April 1998. Eric Pollard flew to the Far East looking for love and found it with Filipino student Dee de la Cruz in a Manila restaurant. His initial interest was sex, but two weeks later he proposed and the couple made plans for Dee to follow Eric back to Britain. When she arrived in 1997, dressed in a miniskirt and skimpy coat, and wearing high-heels, the locals in Emmerdale were curious. They were shocked when she announced that she was Eric's fianc√©e. But the unlikely relationship continued and Dee became Mrs Pollard in a May registry-office wedding. Dee left Emmerdale in April 1998 after discovering that her mother had died and Eric had kept this hidden from her. Dee returned home to the Philippines. Her marriage with Eric was annulled in 2001. Will Cairns William \\"Will\\" Cairns arrived in Emmerdale in February 1997 with his family as the second child and only son of Tony and Becky Cairns.

Will left the village in January 1999, joining the rest of his family in Germany after his father was injured in a climbing accident. Emma Cairns Emma Cairns arrived in Emmerdale in February 1997 with her family as the youngest child and daughter of Tony and Becky Cairns, heavily pregnant. She gave birth to her daughter Geri a month later. Her father Tony wanted her to have Geri adopted and Emma initially agreed. However, she changed her mind when she bonded with her baby daughter but this didn't last. Gradually, Becky found herself looking after Geri more and more and so Geri was put up for adoption after all. The father was later revealed to be Greg Cox, the ex-boyfriend of her sister Charlie. This led to Charlie leaving, only a few months after arriving. Her parents left for Germany in April 1998, with Emma joining them in the Summer. Tony Cairns Anthony \\"Tony\\" Cairns arrived in Emmerdale in March 1997 following the rest of his family after retiring early from the army.

Of humble origin, he became Theodore's companion in childhood and was raised to high state office upon the latter's assumption of power. This caused great resentment from the aristocracy, which had monopolized high offices and opposed Theodore's policies. Shortly before Theodore's death in 1258, he was appointed regent of Theodore's under-age son John IV Laskaris (). He was assassinated only a few days later by soldiers, as the result of a conspiracy led by the nobles under the soon-to-be emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos ().  Biography  Early life and service under Theodore II = Emperor Theodore II Laskaris (), George Mouzalon's friend and patron The Mouzalon family is first attested in the 11th century, but produced few notable members until the mid-13th century, with exception of Nicholas IV Mouzalon, Patriarch of Constantinople in 1147‚Äì1151.. George Mouzalon was born at Adramyttium on the western Anatolian coast in . His family was considered as low-born, but he and his brothers became the childhood friends of the future Theodore II Laskaris, being raised with him in the palace as his paidopouloi (œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥œåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøŒπ, \\"pages\\"). It is assumed that they were also educated along with Theodore, sharing his classes under the scholar Nikephoros Blemmydes... There were also at least two sisters, one of whom was later married to a member of the Hagiotheodorites family. When Theodore became emperor in November 1254, he raised the Mouzalones to the highest state offices: George was made megas domestikos (commander-in-chief of the army) while two of his brothers, Andronikos and Theodore (the eldest brother), were made protovestiarios (grand chamberlain) and protokynegos (grand huntsman) respectively.. According to the contemporary chroniclers, the emperor loved George \\"above all others\\"; in some letters he calls him \\"son\\" and \\"brother\\". During Theodore's reign, George was the Emperor's senior minister and his most trusted advisor. Little is known, however, about his personal involvement in the governance of the state, except for his participation in the council convened to discuss the proper reaction to the invasion of Nicaea's Macedonian holdings by the Bulgarians after the death of Theodore's father, John III Doukas Vatatzes. George Mouzalon supported the majority opinion that Theodore himself should campaign against the invaders. During Theodore's absence on campaign in 1255, George was left behind as regent of the state. Upon his return, Theodore raised George further, naming him protosebastos and protovestiarios and instituting the new title of megas stratopedarches for him. Andronikos Mouzalon succeeded George as megas domestikos. It was an extremely high honour: the combined title \\"protosebastos and protovestiarios\\" was normally conferred only to close kinsmen of the emperor, while the offices of protovestiarios and megas domestikos had always until then been the preserve of aristocratic families. The elevation of the Mouzalones was not only a mark of personal affection or favour, but also in line with Theodore's policies, which aimed to curb the influence and independence of the powerful nobility. The appointment of low-born \\"new men\\" to such high posts, and Theodore's often harsh and arbitrary treatment of the nobles, aroused the ire of the traditional aristocracy, and especially the capable and ambitious Michael Palaiologos.. The aristocrats' hostility was further intensified when the emperor gave his low-born favourites noble brides: George Mouzalon wedded Theodora Kantakouzene, a niece of Michael Palaiologos, and Andronikos married a daughter of the former protovestiarios Alexios Raoul. After Mouzalon's murder, Theodora would marry the protovestiarios John Raoul Petraliphas (in 1261). A staunch opponent of her uncle's unionist religious policies, she was exiled and became a nun. After Michael's death, she restored the monastery of Saint Andrew in Krisei, to where she transferred the relics of Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos, and was a prominent member of the capital's literary circles. = Appointment as regent and assassination = Michael Palaiologos, who as leader of the aristocrats orchestrated Mouzalon's murder, facilitating his own rise to the imperial throne. Shortly before Theodore II died on 16 August 1258, he left George Mouzalon as regent and guardian of his eight-year- old son John IV. Patriarch Arsenios Autoreianos may have shared guardianship of John: although the later historians Nikephoros Gregoras and Makarios Melissenos say the Patriarch was named in this context, the contemporary historians George Pachymeres and George Akropolites name only Mouzalon. This appointment further enraged the aristocracy, and Mouzalon's position became extremely precarious. Mouzalon was also unpopular with the clergy because he was associated with Theodore's high-handed treatment of the Church, and with the people, who feared that he would try to usurp the throne. Most importantly, however, he faced the hostility of the army, in particular the Latin mercenaries, who had apparently been denied the usual stipends and donatives. In addition, they probably resented Theodore's intention to raise a \\"national\\" army composed solely of Byzantine Greeks, and Mouzalon is recorded by Pachymeres to have taken such measures. Palaiologos, who as megas konostaulos held command over the Latins, was in a good position to exploit these grievances. To prevent any action against his testament's provisions for his son's succession and the regency, Theodore on his deathbed demanded an oath to be taken by Senate, army, people and clergy, both those present at court and those absent elsewhere in the state.. Immediately after his death, George Mouzalon, aware of his vulnerability and his complete lack of support, called an assembly of the leading nobles, officials, and military commanders. He offered to resign from his post in favour of any person that the assembly chose, but the dignitaries, led by Michael Palaiologos, dissuaded him and encouraged him to stay on and even accepted to take an oath of loyalty to him as well as to the young emperor. It was a sham, as a conspiracy by the leading aristocratic families was well under way to depose him, in which Palaiologos apparently played a covert but leading role. Only a few days after the death of Theodore II (the sources disagree on the exact date, although 25 August is the widely accepted date), a memorial service was held at the Monastery of Sosandra in Magnesia, founded by John III Vatatzes and serving as his and Theodore's burial place. The entire court attended, while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery. As soon as George Mouzalon, his brothers and his retinue arrived, the service began. Outside the church soldiers had assembled, many of them Latin mercenaries, and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor. John IV went outside and raised his hand to quiet them; the soldiers allegedly mistook this as a signal. Joined by a large mob, they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers. They were warned of what was going on, but George only sent his secretary, Theophylact, to investigate. He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd. The mob soon realized its error (the secretary was wearing black shoes, while the protovestiarios wore the green ones appropriate to his rank) and entered the church, the soldiers with swords in hand. As the people inside the church scattered, the Mouzalon brothers tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore in a corner by the emperor's tomb. The mob proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos (a Hellenized form of \\"Charles\\"). Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and, despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was the frenzy of the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is to be identified with Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told to be quiet or she would share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalon brothers' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant. Mouzalon's death was followed by a purge of Theodore II's other prominent \\"new men\\", the protostrator John Angelos and the protovestiarites Karyanites: Angelos was recalled by Palaiologos, but died (or committed suicide) on the way, while Karyanites was imprisoned. Among Theodore II's prot√©g√©s, only George Akropolites survived, apparently because he at the time was a prisoner of war in Epirus; eventually, he reached high office under Michael Palaiologos. Michael Palaiologos in the meantime consolidated his position, being named regent with the rank of megas doux. Soon he took the title of despotes, and in early 1259, he was crowned emperor.. Ostensibly still the guardian and co-emperor of John IV, after the recapture of Constantinople in 1261 he sidelined and imprisoned John, being crowned sole emperor at the Hagia Sophia and founding the Palaiologan dynasty, the last ruling house of Byzantium.  Treatment by historians  Among the contemporary sources, the history of Akropolites is the most negative towards the Mouzalon brothers, whom he calls \\"loathsome little men, worthless specimens of humanity\\" and \\"false of tongue, nimble of foot, peerless at beating the floor in dance\\". Although otherwise reliable, Akropolites's account on this issue is suspect: on the one hand, he evidently tries to disassociate himself from Theodore II's \\"new men\\", to whom he too originally belonged, while on the other he is generally strongly biased in favour of Michael Palaiologos, whom he tries to exculpate from the assassination.. Other historians of the time paint a more favourable picture. The account of the near-contemporary Theodore Skoutariotes, which otherwise generally follows Akropolites closely, notably fails to repeat the latter's negative comments, and even records that it was the assembled nobles who persuaded the Mouzalones to stay in the church during the riot on the day of their murder. George Pachymeres too, whose treatment of Theodore Laskaris's reign and the Laskarid emperors in general is far more favourable than Akropolites's, considers the Mouzalones to have been promoted on merit, condemns their murder, and names Palaiologos as directly responsible. The later historian Nikephoros Gregoras likewise avoids negative comments, as do most modern historians.

Eileen Pollock Eileen Pollock is the first wife of Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell). She arrives in Emmerdale after reading about the Emmerdale plane crash and the death of Eric's second wife Elizabeth Feldmann (Kate Dove). She threatens to expose Eric as a bigamist until he pays her off for a divorce. She then leaves the village and they divorce after 30 years of marriage, although they have only been together for a short amount of time during the marriage itself. In November 2018, Eric reveals to Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) that he and Eileen parted ways after their son, Edward, was born stillborn in 1978. The grief of their loss led to them leading separate lives, and ultimately Eric abandoning Eileen, changing his name and not seeing her again until 1994. He advises Chas to not let her and her partner Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) drift apart like he and Eileen did after their newborn baby dies. Victoria SugdenBetty EagletonReg Dawson Reg Dawson is the first husband of Viv Windsor (Deena Payne) and father of Scott Windsor (Toby Cockerell). He first appeared on 5 May 1994. Reg, who abandoned Scott and Viv early in Scott's life, arrives in Emmerdale to see Scott after serving time in prison. His stay causes friction with Vic (Alun Lewis), Viv's current husband after Reg declares that he is going to get Viv and Scott back. Reg eventually leaves. Several days later, Reg and his gang commit an armed robbery on the post office and take Viv and Shirley Turner (Rachel Davies) hostage at Home Farm. The situation worsens when Reg shoots and kills one of his henchmen Simmy (Stuart St. Paul),mistaking him for a police officer. Later into the siege, Viv argues with Reg and he is about to shoot her when Shirley jumps in the way of the gun and takes the bullet and dies instantly. Viv then tries to get Reg to give himself up and tells him she will say Shirley's death is an accident. Reg, realising there is no way out, plans for him and Viv to die together in a suicide pact. Before this can happen, a police marksman shoots Reg dead. In his will, he leaves Viv several thousand pounds, but a stipulation said she had to leave her current husband, to receive the money. She declines and stays with Vic. Roy GloverNed Glover Edward \\"Ned\\" Glover first appeared in 1994 and was a series regular for five years, departing in 1999, before returning for a brief stint in 2000. Ned married his wife Jan Glover in 1971 and had three children: Dave, in 1973, Linda, in 1978 and Roy, in 1980. Ned had known the Sugden family for years and helped them out on their farm, indicating that he had lived in the village before. In October 1994, he was challenged by his old adversary Zak Dingle to a bare-knuckle fist fight and won. Jan left the village in 1998 after she and Ned split up, with Ned following a year later. By the time he originally left the village in 1999, he had already lost two of his three children, Dave in a fire at Home Farm in December 1996 and Linda in a car crash in October 1997. This had caused his marriage breakdown. Ned left the village to run a bar in Ibiza with an old girlfriend, Dawn Wilkins. Ned returned in July 2000 for his son Roy's leaving storyline. Ned comes back to the village to celebrate his 53rd birthday. He offers Roy and his wife Kelly the chance to come with him. Roy ends his marriage and goes to Ibiza alone with Ned. Jan Glover Jan Glover (also Worrel) first appeared in August 1994 with her husband Ned and their children. Jan had married Ned in 1971 and the couple had three children: Dave, in 1973, Linda, in 1978 and Roy, in 1980. Jan worked as a barmaid at the Woolpack pub. She was devastated by the deaths of two of her children: Dave in a fire at Home Farm during Christmas 1996 and Linda in a car crash in October 1997. Jan suffered a nervous breakdown after this and abducted James Tate, blaming James' mother Kim for her children's deaths. Jan is sectioned but later discharged and returns home. However her actions put strain on her marriage and when Jan realises that Ned no longer trusts her, the couple separate. Jan leaves the village to live with her sister, June Worrel, for a fresh start. Linda FowlerDave GloverBen Dingle Benedict Alan \\"Ben\\" Dingle is the son of Zak Dingle. He appeared in 1994. Ben is the first member of the Dingle family to appear in Emmerdale. During a fight with Luke McAllister, Ben dies of a heart defect. It originally appears as if Luke had murdered him, and the Dingles continue to blame him even after the truth comes out. Butch Dingle Francis Albert \\"Butch\\" Dingle , played by Paul Loughran, arrived in the village in August 1994 to confront Luke McAllister, who Butch believed was responsible for the death of his brother Ben. Butch caused trouble for Luke for the remainder of the year in revenge. Butch got his nickname because at six years old he had come home from school with some flowers which he wanted to dry and press in a book. His father Zak was concerned that his son was too sensitive so he started calling him \\"Butch\\" in an attempt to get him to behave more like a man. As a result of this, Butch felt he was unable to develop as a person properly and unable to express his true feelings and he became a bully and troublemaker during his early years on the show. However, he mellowed as the years went by and lost his virginity to nanny Sophie Wright when they were drunk at New Year 1996/1997. Butch later began stalking Sophie as he couldn't handle her rejection. Butch also had an obsession with his cousin Mandy Dingle. In November 1998 he married Mandy but she only went through with it for financial gain and not because she loved him. Butch felt himself in love with her and was sad that his feelings were not reciprocated. Butch later divorced Mandy and fell in love with Emily Wylie. Emily and Butch had a lot in common and both considered themselves to be misfits. Emily decided to stay in Emmerdale with Butch rather than leave the village with her father. Butch died in hospital of injuries sustained in the bus crash on 24 March 2000. Butch had been a passenger in the community bus when it was hit by an out-of-control lorry driven by Pete Collins. Before dying, Butch married Emily on his death bed. Butch was buried next to his brother, Ben, who died nearly six years earlier. The epitaph on their tombstone is 'Dead but still Dingles'. Zak DingleHarry Barker Harry Barker is the uncle of Kim Tate who arrives in the village on her wedding day to Frank Tate to give her away. He strikes up a friendship with Seth Armstrong and Zoe Tate. He gets drunk in the build-up to the ceremony, and the wedding party soon realize that he is withholding something. After nearly collapsing, he tells Kim that he is nervous about giving her away and admits that he is too drunk to do it. Seth then decides to give her away instead, and Harry watches on at the church as Frank and Kim remarry, although Frank is confused as to why Harry was not walking Kim down the aisle. He leaves Emmerdale shortly afterwards, and does not attend Kim's 'funeral' in 1997. Tina Dingle Tina Marie Dingle is the youngest child of Zak and Nellie Dingle. She arrived in the village a few months after her family. Her most famous storyline was in July 1995 when she was going to marry Luke McAllister, claiming to be pregnant with his child. However, this proved to be fake, to get revenge for the death of her brother, Ben, the year before. A few days later, Luke kidnapped her and took her on a mad van drive through the village. She dived out of the van and Luke was killed moments later in an explosion when the van crashed into a wall. 1996 saw Tina caught in a love triangle with Frank Tate and Steve Marchant. She left on Christmas Eve that year as she was sick of being caught in the middle and potentially ending up like Frank's wife Kim, as well as her family life not going anywhere. Her last line was to her cousin and best friend Mandy Dingle, \\"No, I'm finished here now. I'll see you Mand.\\" Tina then gets in her car and drives out of the village, as the song Moving On Up plays on the car radio.

In the Alpine region it corresponds to the W√ºrm glaciation. It was characterized by a large ice sheet (the Fenno-Scandian ice sheet) that spread out from the Scandinavian Mountains and extended as far as the east coast of Schleswig-Holstein, the March of Brandenburg and Northwest Russia. In Northern Europe it was the youngest of the glacials of the Pleistocene ice age. The preceding warm period in this region was the Eemian interglacial. The last cold period began about 115,000 years ago and ended 11,700 years ago. Its end corresponds with the end of the Pleistocene epoch and the start of the Holocene. The German geologist (1858-1944) named it using the German name (Weichsel) of the Vistula () in present-day Poland.  Naming in other parts of the world  In other regions Major Glacial 4 of the Pleistocene is given a local name. In the Alpine region it is the W√ºrm glaciation, in Great Britain the Devensian glaciation, in Ireland the Midlandian glaciation and in North America, the Wisconsin glaciation.F.J. Monkhouse Principles of Physical Geography, London: University of London Press, 1970 (7th edn.), p. 254. SBN 340 09022 7Whittow, John (1984). Dictionary of Physical Geography. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 265. . Development of the glaciationEarly and Middle Weichselian= The Fennoscandian Ice Sheet of the Weichselian glaciation most likely grew out of a mountain glaciation of small ice fields and ice caps in the Scandinavian Mountains. The initial glaciation of the Scandinavian Mountains would have been enabled by moisture coming from the Atlantic Ocean and the mountains high altitude. Perhaps the best modern analogues to this early glaciation are the ice fields of Andean Patagonia. Jan Mangerud posits that parts of the Norwegian coast were likely free from glacier ice during most of the Weichselian prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. Between 38 and 28 ka BP there was a relatively warm period in Fennoscandia called the √Ölesund interstadial. The interstadial receives its name from the √Ölesund municipality in Norway where its existence was first established based on the local fossil record of shells. =Last Glacial Maximum= Note that the coastlines are modern; coastlines during the Weichselian were different as sea level was lower. The growth of the ice sheet to its Last Glacial Maximum extent began after the √Ölesund interstadial. The growth of the ice sheet was accompanied by an eastward migration of the ice divide from the Scandinavian Mountains eastwards into Sweden and the Baltic Sea. As the ice sheets in northern Europe grew prior to the Last Glacial Maximum, the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet coalesced with the ice sheet that was growing in the Barents Sea 24 ka BP (kiloannus or one thousand years Before Present) and with the ice sheet of the British Islands at about thousand years later. At this point the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet formed part of a larger Eurasian ice sheet complex‚Äîa contiguous glacial ice mass which spanned an area from Ireland to Novaya Zemlya. The central parts of the Weichsel ice sheet had cold-based conditions during the times of maximum extent. This means that in areas like north-east Sweden and northern Finland pre-existing landforms and deposits escaped glacier erosion and are particularly well preserved at present. Also during times of maximum extent the ice sheet terminated to the east in a gently uphill terrain meaning that rivers drained into the glacier front and large proglacial lakes built up. The Last Glacial Maximum extent was first reached 22 ka BP in the southern boundary of the ice sheet in Denmark, Germany and Western Poland. In Eastern Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and Pskov Oblast in Russia the ice sheet reached its maximum extent about 19 ka BP. In the remainder of northwestern Russia the largest glacier advance occurred 17 ka BP. =Deglaciation up to Younger Dryas= As the ice margin started to recede 22-17 ka BP Denmark (except Bornholm), Germany, Poland and Belarus were ice-free 16 ka BP. The ice margin then retreated until the Younger Dryas when the ice sheet stabilized. By this time, most of G√∂taland, Gotland, all of the Baltic states and the southeastern coast of Finland had been added to the ice-free regions. In Russia, Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega, the bulk of Kola Peninsula and the White Sea were free from ice during the Younger Dryas. Before the Younger Dryas, deglaciation had not been uniform and small ice sheet re-advances had occurred forming a series of end-moraine systems, notably those in G√∂taland. During deglaciation, meltwater formed numerous eskers and sandurs. In north-central Sm√•land and southern √ñsterg√∂tland part of the meltwater was routed through a series of canyons. It is speculated that during the Younger Dryas a small glacier readvance in Sweden created a natural lock system that brought freshwater taxa such as Mysis and Salvelinus to lakes like Sommen that were never connected to the Baltic Ice Lake. The survival of these cold-water taxa into the present- day means they are glacial relicts. =Final deglaciation= When ice margin retreat resumed the ice sheet became increasingly concentrated in the Scandinavian Mountains (it had left Russia 10.6 ka BP and Finland 10.1 ka BP). Further retreat of the ice margin led the ice sheet to concentrate in two parts of the Scandinavian Mountains, one part in Southern Norway and another in Northern Sweden and Norway. These two centres were linked for a time. The linkage constituted a major drainage barrier that formed various large and ephemeral ice-dammed lakes. About 10.1 ka BP the linkage had disappeared and so did the Southern Norway centre of the ice sheet about a thousand years later. The northern centre remained a few hundred years more so that by 9.7 ka BP the eastern Sarek Mountains hosted the last remnant of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet. As the ice sheet retreated to the Scandinavian Mountains this was not a return to its former mountain centred glaciation from which the ice sheet grew out, it was dissimilar in that the ice divide lagged behind as the ice mass concentrated in the west. It is not known if the if the ice sheet disintegrated into scattered remains before vanishing or if it shrunk while maintaining its coherence as a single ice mass. It is possible that while some ice remained east of Sarek Mountains parts of the ice sheet survived temporarily in the high mountains. Remnants east of the Sarek Mountains formed various ephemeral ice-dammed lakes that caused numerous glacial lake outburst floods down the rivers of northernmost Sweden. =Isostatic adjustment= Map of the Littorina Sea around 7000 years BP. Note the reduced area of Finland due to higher sea levels. Isostatic adjustment bought by deglaciation is reflected in the shoreline changes of the Baltic Sea and other nearby bodies of water. In the Baltic Sea uplift has been greatest at the High Coast in the western Bothnian Sea. Within the High Coast the relict shoreline at 286 m in Skuleberget is at present the highest known point on Earth to have been uplifted by postglacial isostatic rebound. North of the High Coast at Furu√∂grund off the coast of Skellefte√• lies the area with the highest uplift rates at present with values of about 9 mm/yr.√Ögren, J. and Svensson, R., 2006. Land uplift model and system definitions used for the RH 2000 adjustment of the Baltic levelling ring. The 15th General Meeting of the Nordic Geodetic Commission, Copenhagen, 29 May‚Äì2 June 2006, 1‚Äì9 Ongoing post-glacial rebound is thought to result in splitting of the Gulf of Bothnia into a southern gulf and a northern lake across Norra Kvarken no earlier than in about 2,000 years. Isostatic rebound exposed a submarine joint valley landscape as Stockholm archipelago. Since deglaciation the rate of post-glacial rebound in the Kandalaksha Gulf has varied. Since the White Sea connected to the world's oceans uplift along the southern coast of the gulf has totaled 90 m. In the interval from 9,500‚Äì5,000 years ago the uplift rate was of 9‚Äì13 mm/yr. Prior to the Atlantic period the uplift rate had decreased to 5‚Äì5.5 mm/yr, to then rose briefly before arriving at the present uplift rate of 4 mm/yr. Emergence above sea level is thought to have resulted in the triggering of a series of landslides in western Sweden as pore pressure increased when the groundwater recharge zone came above sea level.  Sequence and subdivisions of the Weichselian  Depiction of the Earth at the last glacial maximum. Illustration based on: Ice age terrestrial carbon changes revisited by Thomas J. Crowley (Global Biogeochemical Cycles, Vol. 9, 1995, pp. 377-389). About 115,000 years ago average temperatures dropped markedly and warmth-loving woodland species were displaced. This significant turning point in average temperatures marked the end of the Eemian interglacial and start of the Weichselian glacial stage. It is divided into three sections, based on the temperature variation: the Weichselian Early Glacial,John Dodson (ed.), Earth Systems and Society, New York, London, etc., Springer, 2010 p. 173. the Weichselian High GlacialWolfgang Schirmer, Quaternary field trips in central Europe, Volume 1, Pfeil, 1995, p. 375. (also Weichselian Pleniglacial) and the Weichselian Late Glacial. During the Weichselian, there were frequent major variations in climate in the northern hemisphere, the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger events. The Weichsel Early Glacial (115,000 - 60,000 BC) is in turn divided into four stages: * Odderade Interstadial (WF IV) - The pollen spectra indicate a boreal forest. It starts with a tree birch phase, which rapidly transitions to pine forest. Also apparent are larches and spruce as well as low numbers of alder. * Rederstall Stadial (also WF III) - In North Germany the pollen spectra indicate a grassy tundra followed later by shrubby tundra. * Br√∂rup Interstadial (also WF II) - Several profiles show a short period of cooling shortly after the start of the Br√∂rup Interstadial, but this does not appear in all profiles. This led some authors to distinguish the first warm period as the Amersfoort Interstadial. However, since then, this first warm period and cooling phase has been included in the Br√∂rup Interstadial. Northern Central Europe was populated by birch and pine woods. The Br√∂rup Interstadial is identified with marine isotope stage 5c. * Herning Stadial (also called WF I) - Was the first cold phase, in which northwestern Europe was largely treeless. It corresponds to marine isotope stage 5d. In the Weichselian High Glacial (57,000 - c. 15,000 BC) the ice sheet advanced into North Germany. In this period, however, several interstadials have been documented. * Glaciation and ice sheet advances to North Germany (Brandenburg Phase, Frankfurt Phase, Pomeranian Phase, Mecklenburg Phase). * Denekamp Interstadial - The pollen spectra indicates a shrubby tundra landscape. * Hengelo Interstadial - The pollen show sedges (Cyperaceae) and temporarily a high number of dwarf birches (Betula nana). * Moershoofd Interstadial - The pollen spectra show a treeless tundra vegetation with a high proportion of sedges (Cyperaceae). * Glinde Interstadial (WP IV) - The pollen diagrams indicate a treeless, shrubby tundra. * Ebersdorf Stadial (WP III) - In North Germany this period is characterised by pollen-free sands. * Oerel Interstadial (WP II) - The pollen diagrams point to a treeless, shrubby tundra in North Germany. * Schalkholz Stadial (WP I) - The first ice advance may have already reached the southern Baltic Sea coast. At the type locality of Schalkholz (county of Dithmarschen) pollen-free, sands indicate a largely vegetation-free landscape. The short \\"Weichselian Late Glacial\\" (12,500 - c. 10,000 BC) was the period of slow warming after the Weichselian High Glacial. It was however again interrupted by some colder episodes. * Younger Dryas - In this period the proportion of non-tree pollens climbed again, especially those of heliophytes. * Aller√∏d oscillation - This section is again dominated by birch tree pollens. * Older Dryas - This cool period is characterised by a reduction in tree pollens. * B√∏lling oscillation - The period begins with a rapid increase in tree birch pollens. * Oldest Dryas - The cool period is characterised by a maximum number of non-tree pollens. * Meiendorf Interstadial - This interstadial is typified by a rise in the pollens of dwarf birches (Betula nana), willows (Salix sp.), sandthorns (Hippophae), junipers (Juniperus) and sagebrush (Artemisia). Following the last of these cold periods, the Younger Dryas, the Weichselian Glacial ended with an abrupt climb in temperature around 9,660 ¬± 40 BC. This was the start of our present interglacial, the Holocene. In addition to the above subdivisions the depositions of the Weichselian Late Glacial following the retreat of the ice sheet are divided into four stages: the Germanic Glacial (Germaniglazial) (Germany becomes ice-free), the Danish Glacial (Daniglazial) (Denmark becomes ice-free), The Gotland Glacial (Gotiglazial) (Gotland becomes ice-free) and the Finnish Glacial (Finiglazial) (Finland and Norway become ice-free).

Career Summary  After starting out as a MotoCross rider, Alfonso switched to speedway in 1992 at the age of 24. In 1995 Alfonso finished second in both the Continental Semi Final in Lonigo and the Continental Final in Miskolc before finishing 15th out of 16 in the Grand Prix Challenge in Lonigo. These performances were enough to get him noticed by British League clubs and he signed for the Scottish Monarchs for the 1996 season. The highlight of Alfonso's career came during the 1996 season when he competed in the 1996 Italian Grand Prix, a meeting where he defeated the eventual 1996 World Champion, Billy Hamill. An arm injury in June interrupted his British League season in 1996, and he only made a few more appearances before the end of the season. Alfonso didn't return to the UK in 1997 after being banned from racing due to failing a drugs test at the Italian Championships in 1996. After competing on the Continent during 1998, Alfonso returned to the UK with Edinburgh Monarchs near the end of the season. However, he didn't make the expected impact while competing on sub-standard, borrowed machinery and failed to return to the Monarchs after a return home for an Italian Championship meeting. His failure to complete the necessary 6 matches to gain a new league average saw him excluded from the 1999 team and he never raced in UK speedway again. He continued to compete on the Continent, including racing in the Italian League in 2002, before a broken leg ended his career.

He was executive director of the American Mathematical Society during the 1970s and 1980s when that organization was growing rapidly and greatly increasing its use of computers in academic publishing. Life and education LeVeque was born August 9, 1923 in Boulder, Colorado. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Colorado in 1944, and a Master's degree in 1945 and a Ph.D in 1947 from Cornell University. He was an instructor at Harvard University from 1947 to 1949, then started at University of Michigan as an instructor and rose to Professor. In 1970 he moved to the Claremont Graduate School. In 1977 he became executive director of the American Mathematical Society and remained there until his retirement in 1988. After retirement LeVeque and his wife, Ann, took up sailing and lived on their sailboat for three years while they traveled from Narragansett Bay to Grenada. They then moved to Bainbridge Island, Washington where he kept active in volunteer activities for the rest of his life. He died December 1, 2007. His son Randall J. LeVeque is a well known applied mathematician. Work LeVeque's research interest was number theory, specifically transcendental numbers, uniform distribution, and Diophantine approximation. He wrote a number of number theory textbooks and reference books, which influenced the development of number theory in the United States. A long-term project was to update Leonard Eugene Dickson's History of the Theory of Numbers. This project eventually produced a six-volume collection titled Reviews in Number Theory. The Special Libraries Association's Physics-Astronomy-Mathematics Division awarded LeVeque its Division Award in 1978 for his contributions to the bibliography of mathematics. The American Mathematical Society grew rapidly during LeVeque's time as executive director (1977‚Äì1988). Revenues tripled from $5 million in 1977 to $14.9 million in 1988. The Society began computerizing at a rapid rate during this period, with Mathematical Reviews first becoming available electronically through existing academic dial-up services; this system later evolved into MathSciNet. Most of the headquarters staff received computer terminals for use in the new operations.

This was a promotional tie-in with the release of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The summer-long event included a new show, changes to the Jungle Cruise attraction and appearances by a live actor playing Indiana Jones. There was some controversy about the Secret of the Stone Tiger stage show playing at Aladdin's Oasis, in which Indiana Jones is seen punching a female villain. Following a news story in the Orange County Register, the show was altered to remove the punch. EventsThe Jungle Cruise= The Disneyland attraction the Jungle Cruise was given an Indiana Jones overlay, featuring 5 artifacts from the Indiana Jones films. The Life Preserver from the CORONADO, the Ark Crate, Henry's Umbrella, Mola Ram's Headdress, and a carving of the Crystal Skull were all \\"lost\\" in the jungle for explorers to relocate, except the Life Preserver which still remains to this day on the \\"Danger\\" dock. =Secret of the Stone Tiger= 250pxThe Aladdin's Oasis storytelling show was also given an Indiana Jones overlay, becoming the Secret of the Stone Tiger stage show. The show featured a female archaeologist named Rachel Flannery, who was hot on the trail of a Golden Idol in the shape of a tigers head. This idol was said to give its owner unlimited power. In the search for the idol, Rachel follows several clues that have been left behind in Indiana Jones' journal. In her quest, she calls for several young volunteers to assist her. Children from the audience then come onto the stage and assist in the discovery of clues. After the final clue is revealed, the Stone Tiger begins to roar and Dr. Jones emerges from its mouth. Indy quickly hands the Golden Idol to Rachel as he begins to tell a tale to the children. However, Rachel fits the Golden Idol onto a staff and is overcome with its power. After a series of punches, kicks, and whip cracks, Rachel falls into the Stone Tiger's mouth. Indy quickly gathers his belongings and rushes off to locate an old map, supposedly leading him to the nearby Temple of Mara. =Random Acts of Indy= 250pxShortly after the Secret of the Stone Tiger show, Indy would emerge into the crowded streets of Adventureland, first on the rooftop of The Jungle Cruise. Indy would then encounter a Desert Hawk where shortly thereafter a fight would ensue. Once Indy knocks the villain out, he would often look into the crowd say, \\"When he wakes up, tell him Indy won!\\" Indy would then run through the streets of Adventureland, in search for the mysterious temple. Needing to get \\"higher up,\\" Indy would then run up the stairs and end up on the roof of the Adventureland Bazaar. The Desert Hawk would soon be on his trail, and another fight would follow. Apparently, somewhere in that second fight, the Desert Hawk would get the map. In the third and final battle, now taking place on Tarzan's Treehouse, Indy would chase the Desert Hawk, trying to get the map back. The two would have their showdown on the suspension bridge that hung over the Adventureland/New Orleans Square path, similar to the climatic confrontation between Indy and Mola Ram in Temple of Doom. Indy would then use his whip to get the map from the Desert Hawk's hand. Finally, Indy would take off running through Adventureland once again. Due to an agreement with Lucasfilm at the time, Indiana Jones was not allowed to meet park guests in a typical meet-and-greet format. This does not apply to Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular at Walt Disney World, as the actor portraying Indy will often come to the audience and sign autographs. Reception After an article analyzing the male-on-female violence seen at Disneyland in the Orange County Register, the show was quickly altered. Indy would no longer throw any direct punches at the woman, he would simply dodge. The Indiana Jones Summer of Hidden Mysteries was directed by Senior Show Director Glenn Kelman, who was also behind the short lived Jack Sparrow's Swashbuckling Adventure on Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island.

Adam Forrester Adam Forrester, played by Tim Vincent, made his first appearance on 21 March 2000. Vincent said he was \\"really excited\\" when he was approached to play the role. Adam marked his first major acting role since he appeared in Dangerfield in 1997. Vincent was initially contracted until November 2000, and he commuted between his home in London and the studios in Leeds. The character was introduced during the aftermath of a bus crash, where he earned the respect of the villagers by helping the injured. Adam moves to the village to work at the local veterinary practice. Vincent told Rachel Corcoran of All About Soap that his character has \\"very good intentions\\" upon his arrival. He is \\"confident\\" and has many new ideas about how to run the practice. However, Adam's approach annoys his new boss Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt). Vincent said, \\"Adam is genuinely a nice guy and everyone likes him, But Paddy's constantly telling him how things are run at the surgery while Adam says 'No, this is the way I'll do it' before doing it his way. And it seems to work, much to Paddy's annoyance.\\" Vincent explained that Adam does not realise he is annoying Paddy, and he is not being deliberately nasty to him, but Paddy worries that their clients will think Adam is the better vet. Paddy is also put out because Adam took all the glory during the crash, while he could not help out because he had a broken wrist.

It was loosely adapted from the 1900 novel of the same name by African-American writer Charles W. Chesnutt, who explored issues of race, class and identity in the post-Civil War South. No print of the film is known to exist, and it is considered lost. Micheaux remade the film in 1932 under the title Veiled Aristocrats. The Virginia Censorship Board, an arm of white supremacy, at first banned the film from being shown in the state, saying it would threaten race relations. In 1924, the state had passed the Racial Integrity Act incorporating the one-drop rule into law for the first time. It classified as black for state record keeping any person with any known African ancestry, regardless of their self-identification or community. Although Micheaux made some cuts to get the film distributed, he wrote to the board: \\"There has been but one picture that incited the colored people to riot and that still does. [T]hat picture is Birth of a Nation.\\" Plot Rena (Shingzie Howard) is a young woman of mixed race. Although she is romantically pursued by an upwardly mobile African American named Frank (C.D. Griffith), Rena does not decide in his favor. Her appearance allows her to pass for white, as she is of majority European ancestry, although she has grown up in the black community. She meets and falls in love with George Tryon, a young white aristocrat (Lawrence Chenault). But as their relationship deepens, Rena believes she has to acknowledge her African ancestry. She leaves John and returns to Frank, yet her decision creates great inner turmoil. As she accepts Frank as her life partner, she confesses: \\"Frank, I am miserable.\\"‚ÄúOverview: The House Behind the Cedars\\", AllMovie, New York Times Production The House Behind the Cedars was adapted from the 1900 novel by the American writer Charles W. Chesnutt. Chesnutt was of mixed race and predominately European ancestry, with a portion of African. He grew up in the \\"black\\" community, where his ancestors had been classified because of slavery. He explored issues of race among those of similar mixed-race descent, particularly in the postwar South.Whiteman, \\"Charles W. Chesnutt\\" , Berea University faculty This is the second of two Oscar Micheaux films based on Chesnutt's books. His 1926 production of The Conjure Woman was the first, based on a story in Chesnutt's collection by that name published in 1899.Dan Moos, Outside America, University Press of New England, 2005, Micheaux promoted The House Behind the Cedars by calling attention to the current scandal in New York scandal related to the legal proceedings of Leonard Rhinelander, a wealthy socialite who sought to have his marriage to Alice Jones annulled after he discovered her mixed-race parentage. This took place after they had married. Although the plot of The House Behind the Cedars differed significantly from the Rhinelander case, the film's advertising campaign noted its similarities to the contemporary legal case. Advertising included statements such as, \\"An Amazing Parallel to the Famous Rhinelander Case!\\", and \\"Rhinelander Case at the Regent\\". A longer account said, \\"The House Behind the Cedars is a remarkable parallel to the famous Rhinelander Case ... It tells the story of a beautiful mulatto girl who poses as white, and is wooed and won by a young white millionaire. Although worried, she does not betray her secret. Then comes the discovery as in the Rhinelander case.\\"‚ÄúHeadline to Headlights: Oscar Micheaux's Exploitation of the Rhinelander Case\\", The Western Journal of Black Studies, Fall 1998 Lawrence Chenault, who played the white aristocrat, was a light-skinned, mixed-race actor. Shingzie Howard, who played Rena, was also of mixed race. She had previously starred in Micheaux's films The Virgin of the Seminole and Uncle Jasper's Will.Bernard L. Peterson, Early Black American Playwrights and Dramatic Writers: A Biographical Directory and Catalog of Plays, Films, and Broadcasting Scripts, Hartford, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1990. Micheaux shot The House Behind the Cedars in Roanoke, Virginia. When he returned to the state to secure exhibition locales, he found that the three- man Virginia Board of Censors banned the film from theaters because the Board found it \\"so objectionable, in fact, as to necessitate its total rejection\\".J. Douglas Smith, Managing White Supremacy, pp. 101-104, UNC Press, 2002. This was only a few years after the white Democratic legislature, which had disfranchised most black voters earlier in the century, had passed its Racial Integrity Act of 1924. This instituted the one-drop rule, by which any person with any African heritage was classified as black for state record-keeping. The board called in other state officials to help them review the film, including Walter Plecker, a supporter of eugenics who implemented the new act, and other known supporters of white supremacy. All were white. Officials found the film's story too threatening to its Jim Crow social order, despite the well-documented history of miscegenation and mixed-race slaves in colonial and antebellum Virginia. They suggested it would threaten current relations between the races. Micheaux agreed to make some cuts in the film, while remarking that no other state or censorship board had objected or required changes. He said it had been screened in many areas \\"without incident.\\" He also noted that when the Chesnutt novel had been published 30 years earlier, it was \\"read by over a thousand white people to every colored person.\\" He said, \\"There has been but one picture that incited the colored people to riot and that still does. [T]hat picture is Birth of a Nation.\\" After his cuts, the film was shown in Virginia. Afterward, the board used its review of the film into \\"a litmus test for the proper allegiance of white civil servants to the Racial Integrity Act.\\" Finding some of board member Arthur James' comments insufficiently critical of the film, they released them to John Powell, leader of the Anglo-Saxon Clubs, an organization devoted to white supremacy. Powell initiated threats to James' position and generated letters of strong criticism by the members of the Anglo-Saxon Clubs. James survived the attacks and was later appointed as commissioner of Public Welfare.

He was head coach of the Weber State Wildcats team from 1974 to 1985 and at the New Mexico State Aggies from 1985 to 1997. At Weber State, McCarthy led the Wildcats to four NCAA Tournaments, including the school's first NCAA Tournament win since reaching the Sweet 16 in 1972. He remained Weber State's winningest coach until Randy Rahe broke his wins record in 2016. During most of McCarthy's tenure at New Mexico State, the Aggies were the second-best team in what became the Big West Conference, behind UNLV. After UNLV hit the skids, McCarthy took advantage and led the Aggies to four straight Big West tournament titles and four straight NCAA Tournaments from 1990 to 1994. His best team was the 1991‚Äì92 unit, which advanced all the way to the Sweet 16‚Äîthe Aggies' deepest run in the tournament since the 1970 Final Four unit. McCarthy was abruptly fired just weeks before the start of practice for the 1997‚Äì98 season. Athletic director Jim Paul cited a number of factors, principally the basketball team's poor performance in the classroom. McCarthy only graduated nine players in his 12 years at the school (an 11 percent graduation rate), including only one in his last four years. In Paul's view, this meant that McCarthy emphasized winning over academics.McCarthy out as coach; NMSU turns to Henson. Associated Press, October 17, 1997. He left New Mexico State as the school's winningest coach, but has since been passed by Lou Henson. Officially, McCarthy was reassigned as an assistant athletic director for the balance of his contract. However, he resigned rather than assume that post. Academic scandals Despite McCarthy's success in building two regional powers, two major academic scandals forced his departure from the coaching profession. In early 1995, it emerged that six players had received help from one of McCarthy's assistants on their work at correspondence courses, including answers on their exams. After this came to light, New Mexico State withdrew from postseason consideration for the 1995-96 season. In July 1996, the NCAA placed New Mexico State on three years' probation and stripped the Aggies of their NCAA tournament appearances in 1992, 1993 and 1994. Although McCarthy was not involved in the violations, the NCAA severely criticized him for not properly controlling the program. It slapped him with a two-year \\"show-cause\\" order, meaning that if he ever left New Mexico State, any penalties imposed on him would have followed him to his new employer unless that school demonstrated that he had served his punishment.1996 NCAA infraction report After his ouster, McCarthy sued New Mexico State for wrongful termination. During a deposition related to that suit, McCarthy admitted under oath that he'd entered into a verbal agreement to hire Fletcher Cockrell, then the head coach at Jones County Community College in Mississippi, as an assistant coach if two of his star players signed with New Mexico State. Cockrell helped the players with their coursework and exams.Herrerra, Pete. NCAA places New Mexico St. on four years' probation. Associated Press via San Diego Union-Tribune, June 20, 2001. After the violations came to light, New Mexico State withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2000‚Äì01 season, and placed the basketball team on two years' probation. The NCAA accepted New Mexico State's penalties, but imposed an additional four years' probation and forced the Aggies to vacate every game they played in 1996‚Äì97 and 1997‚Äì98. It also slapped McCarthy with a five-year show-cause order. Cockrell, who had been involved in violations at another school, received a 10-year show-cause order. The final report noted the similarities with the 1996 case. It also strongly hinted that had the Aggies not taken swift corrective action, the penalties might have been even harsher, and possibly included the \\"death penalty\\". However, it praised New Mexico State for forcing out McCarthy, the school president and Paul's predecessor as athletic director.2001 NCAA infraction report Head coaching record * New Mexico State was forced to vacate its 1992, 1993 and 1994 NCAA appearances due to academic fraud.

Winchester introduced the .401SL in the Winchester '10 self-loading rifle as a supplement to the Winchester '07 and the .351SL in their offering of hi-power, self-loading rifles. The only chambering available in the Winchester Model 1910, the .401SL was used by France, Russia, and American company security forces in the First World War.Houze, Herbert G. (2003). Winchester's First Self-Loading Rifles. 'American Rifleman' Vol 151(5) p.84. The .401SL proved powerful enough for both deer and other large game at ranges under 150 yards.Whelen, Townsend. The American Rifle. Century Co., 1918. p.274 Both 200gr and 250gr bullet weights were offered by Winchester and other ammunition manufacturers as factory loadings. With extra available detachable magazines holding 4-rounds each, the Model '10, could provide much firepower for the big-game hunter. This feature helped promote the use of the .401SL on dangerous game such as moose and grizzly bear in spite of the lack of controlled expansion bullet designs, which doubtlessly would have improved game-taking performance and the subsequent reputation of the .401SL cartridge.Stebbins, Henry M. Rifles, A Modern Encyclopedia. Stackpole Co., 1958. p.274 The .401 SL is of similar size to the later .41 Remington Magnum; but the longer self-loading rifle cartridge produced a muzzle energy of with a bullet, while the magnum revolver is credited with a muzzle energy of with a bullet. The .41 Rem magnum revolver comparison is not entirely relevant, however, since in a carbine the same cartridge generally at least doubles its energy over the much shorter barreled version.

Examples of radiation detectors described as ionometers can be found through to the 1950s but the term more often now means a device for measuring the chemical ion concentration of a fluid. Ionometer (radiation) An early ionometer is due to the Swiss physicist Heinrich Greinacher in 1913. However, Greinacher was not the first to build an ionometer, he credits one Bronson with building an instrument upon which Greinacher's was an improvement. Greinacher states the advantage of his instrument over Bronson's being in not requiring the quadrant electrometer (invented by Lord Kelvin).Greinacher, H, \\"The Ionometer and its Application to the Measurement of Radium and R√∂ntgen Rays\\", Physikal. Zeitsch., vol 15, 1914, pp410-415. abstract only from Journal of the Chemical Soc, vol 106 (1914), Part ii (Abstracts), p411 retrieved 2nd Jan 2008. Greinacher also had to invent the practical voltage doubler circuit in order to provide the 200-300 V he needed for the ionometer as the 110 V AC supplied by the Zurich power stations of the time were insufficient.Mehra, J, Rechenberg, H, The Historical Development of Quantum Theory, p284, Springer, 2001 . Ionometer (ion concentration) Possibly the first use of ionometer with this meaning was by F. E. Bartell. In his paper on the instrument in 1917 he discusses possible names, rejecting potentiometer as inappropriate, so implying that there was not already a name in existence.Bartell, FE, \\"A Direct Reading Ionometer\\", J.

The word ripieno is from the Italian for \\"padding\\". The ' was sometimes referred to as a \\"\\" (or \\"\\" if the orchestra included two viola parts, a standard scoring in the 17th century). These were merely compositions for the ripieno alone (i.e. for string orchestra and continuo), with either no solo parts or clearly subsidiary ones. Beginning with the six ripieno concertos, Op. 5 (1692), of Giuseppe Torelli, this genre enjoyed an efflorescence that extended until about 1740. Types Most ripieno concertos fall into one of two distinct classes: a sonata type and a sinfonia type. The sonata type generally mirrors the form and style of the ' in its use of four-movement slow‚Äìfast‚Äìslow‚Äìfast cycles and predominantly fugal texture. The more modern sinfonia type was firmly established in Torelli's second publication to include concertos, Op. 6 (1698), and in Giulio Taglietti's , Op. 4 (1699), which turn to the three-movement (fast-slow-fast) pattern and more homophonic texture familiar to us from the solo concerto and opera sinfonia. The opening movements also parallel the solo concerto in utilizing ritornello form (without solo sections), in which the opening material recurs from one to several times in various keys, the last statement normally in the tonic. Finales are most often binary in form and dancelike in style. The sinfonia type gradually merged with the early concert symphony beginning in the 1720s, doubtless in part because the term concerto was by that time acquiring an indelible association with the notion of tutti-solo contrast. A special class of 20th-century concertos is the Concerto for Orchestra. These works are not for the most part ripieno concertos in the Baroque sense but rather display pieces in which the orchestra itself is the virtuoso, from soloists to sections of the orchestra, choirs or tutti. Examples of this genre, best known through Bart√≥k's popular work of 1943, include compositions by Hindemith (1925), Walter Piston (1933), Zolt√°n Kod√°ly (1939‚Äì40), Michael Tippett (1962‚Äì63), and Elliott Carter (1969). In the latter piece, Carter dramatically personifies or characterizes the various concertino groupings, a technique he had previously explored in his Double Concerto for harpsichord and piano (1961) and his Piano Concerto (1964‚Äì65).

Based in the city of Salamanca, the paper is owned by Bradford Publishing, which also publishes the Bradford Era and the Olean Times Herald. The newspaper focuses on the municipalities of Salamanca, Ellicottville, Cattaraugus, Little Valley and Randolph. Its coverage also extends into neighboring areas, such as East Otto, West Valley, and Conewango, among others. The paper is the official newspaper of the City of Salamanca and the Salamanca City Central School District. An offshoot, the Gowanda Press, launched in August 2016. The Gowanda version of the paper was launched to fill the void of the Gowanda Pennysaver News, which abruptly shut down (along with a number of weekly papers in the vicinity) in July of that year. The Gowanda Press would close operations in October 2017.  History  Founded in 1867 as the Cattaraugus Republican, the paper printed weekly editions until 1904, when The Republican Press was founded and printed daily. The name would eventually change to the Salamanca Republican-Press in 1926 and, as it is known now, The Salamanca Press in 1981. It would continue as a daily newspaper until 2009 when its publication was made weekly again. And through the majority of Salamanca‚Äôs history ‚Äî including fires, floods, politics and more ‚Äî it was one family that headed the newspaper‚Äôs publication and management. In fact, the newspaper‚Äôs ownership stayed in the same family‚Äôs hands for more than 100 years. The newspaper began under the direction of Augustine W. Ferrin, a native of Concord, near Springville, who had purchased the Springville Herald in 1867 and moved its equipment to Ellicottville, which was the county seat at the time. Ferrin, who had served as city editor of the Buffalo Express when he was only 22, founded the Cattaraugus Republican and managed it until he sold his interest in the company to Blanchard B. Weber, his brother-in-law, in 1895. Weber had been involved in the Cattaraugus Republican‚Äôs operations since he bought half an interest in the company in 1873 when the newspaper operated in Little Valley. He took charge of the newspaper‚Äôs office in Salamanca at that time and was active in the community for the next 70 years. Weber‚Äôs son, Matthew, became editor of the paper in 1902 and two years later helped establish the daily Republican Press ‚Äî which was renamed the Salamanca Republican-Press in 1926. Matthew Weber‚Äôs son, Latham B. Weber, began working for the Salamanca Republican-Press in 1938 and eventually became managing editor in 1945. He would serve that role until 1977, when his nephew, Weber Austin, became the fifth publisher of the paper. The ownership of the paper left the Weber family in 1976 when the Salamanca Republican-Press announced the purchase of the stock of the company by a group of businessmen from Pennsylvania. A derivative of those owners, now identified as Bradford Publishing Co., currently operates The Salamanca Press along with its sister papers, the Olean Times Herald, The Bradford, Pennsylvania Era and The Gowanda Press. The history of The Salamanca Press also includes a variety of offices, beginning at the corner of Washington and Monroe streets in Ellicottville in 1867 and moving to Little Valley in 1868 before opening a Salamanca branch in 1873. Two years later, the paper printed its first edition in Salamanca and has had offices in the city ever since. Prior to 1926, most of The Press history was on Atlantic Street in the space later occupied by Reed‚Äôs Newsroom across from the Dudley Hotel. Then, in April 1926, the move was made to its present location at 36 River St.  Timeline  Feb. 7, 1867 The first edition of the Cattaraugus Republican prints out of the newspaper‚Äôs office at the corner of Washington and Monroe streets in Ellicottville, which was the county seat at the time. The first edition featured four pages. A. W. Ferrin served as first editor and publisher. May 20 & 21, 1868 The Cattaraugus Republican moves ‚Äî along with the county seat ‚Äî from Ellicottville to Little Valley. The final Ellicottville edition was published May 21, with the first Little Valley edition published May 28. July 1, 1873 The Republican commences business in Salamanca and its first press, which was delivered a few days earlier, was the first printing press in Salamanca. The press makes its first appearance in public in operation on a float in the industrial parade July 4. The Republican begins business in Salamanca with the office located on the second floor of the Fitts Building at 123 Main St., now Weast Insurance Agency. Spring 1874 Hevenor Bros. erects an addition on their north side of the store at the corner of Main and Atlantic streets and The Republican moves into its second home in Salamanca. Oct. 28, 1875 The Republican prints its first edition in Salamanca. Printing was possible after the cylinder press the newspaper was printed on was moved to Salamanca from Little Valley earlier in the month. A copy of that first edition was preserved in a tin box of the Republican building that was erected in 1882, but the whereabouts of those contents are unknown. Sept. 4, 1880 The Hevenor block ‚Äî including The Republican‚Äôs offices ‚Äî is destroyed by a fire that tears through much of Main Street. Its regular issue for the week had just been mailed, and ‚Äúwhile the conflagration was still raging,‚Äù according to a history printed in 1887, the Republican rented an idle newspaper plant in Salamanca and printed a special ‚ÄúFire Extra‚Äù edition. The Republican would rebuilt at the same location, 7 Atlantic St. 1881 B.B. Weber, one of the publishers of The Republican along with A.W. Ferrin and Stephen Green, moves to Olean and takes over the Olean Times. Four years later, he sold the paper to Charles Straight and rejoined The Republican. 1895 A.W. Ferrin sells his interest in The Republican to B.B. Weber but continues to work with the publication until his death in 1902. September 1902 Matthew Weber, the son of B.B. Weber, one of the newspaper‚Äôs publishers, is named editor of The Republican. April 25, 1904 A new partnership, B.B. Weber & Son, forms. The first edition of The Republican Press, which would be printed daily until 2009, publishes. The decision to print a daily came after the B. R. & P. railroad announced it would establish a division headquarters in East Salamanca. According to an editorial printed April 1916, the decision to produce a daily paper was made on a Saturday and the first issue appeared two days later. July 26, 1915 The Republican Press announces it will begin receiving news over a leased wire from the International News Service. It assures it will print ‚Äútoday‚Äôs news today‚Äù and boasts none of the ‚ÄúBuffalo papers reaching here in the afternoon contains the latest news that will be found in The Press.‚Äù Oct. 28, 1918 On exactly 43 years to the day after the first newspaper was printed in Salamanca, The Republican Press inaugurates the Associated Press wire service.

Jan. 3, 1921 A backed-up sewer on Atlantic Street floods the pressroom of The Republican Press, as well as parts of the Salamanca Trust Co., but the paper is printed.

Ground would be broken at the site April 15. Feb. 16, 1926 The Republican Press changes its name to the Salamanca Republican-Press. It cites the name change to ‚Äúbetter describe the relations between the people of Salamanca and this paper which so long has been a part of the community life that it will convey a more accurate idea of the policy and purpose of the paper.‚Äù It kept ‚ÄúRepublican‚Äù in its name, stating the word is ‚Äúan adjective rather than a noun,‚Äù acknowledging that the term ‚Äúrepublic‚Äù refers to a community of people rather than the paper having a political interest. Aug. 2, 1926 The first edition of the Republican-Press is printed at 36 River St. The location continues to serve as home of The Press offices, although the press is no longer location in the building. A formal opening of the office to the public would be made Sept. 1. Sept. 1, 1926 A formal public opening of the Salamanca Republican-Press office at 36 River St. is hosted by the newspaper.

Early life and career As a child, during his school years, Edgard already showed interest in art, specially drawing. He was also a music enthusiast, and his favourite instrument was the violin. He actually studied violin with his father and he turned 16, though a short time later he realized music wasn't for him, and he decided to dedicate most of his time to his biggest talent: painting. At 17, he joined the \\"Belas Artes\\" course in Rio directed by Professor Carlos Chambelland, with whom he studied drawing, painting and decorative art. After studying the methods used by some of the greatest European artists of all time, like Rembrandt, Rubens, D√ºrer and others, he started his unique experiences with drawing, in several different phases: \\"√°gua-forte\\" (in metal), xylography (drawing in wood) and lithography (drawing in stone). Four years later, he showed his artwork for the first time at the \\"Sal√£o Nacional de Belas Artes\\", and in the following year he showed his work again there, this time receiving two awards: the \\"Men√ß√£o Honrosa\\" in painting and the \\"Medalha de Bronze\\" in drawing. World War II During the World War II, Edgard had to stop his activities because he was called by the Brazilian Army to join their forces in Italy, where he stayed for two years as a member of the \\"FEB\\". When the war was over, in 1945, Edgard regressed to Brazil and he continued his work, this time winning another \\"Medalha de Bronze\\" for his new exposition at the \\"Sal√£o Nacional de Belas Artes\\", as well as the \\"Medalha de Ouro\\" for his painting \\"Ind√∫stria do Vidro\\", which measures 2,30m x 1,90m, and represents the fabrication of glass in the first factory of its kind in Brazil. In 1956, Edgard won the \\"Medalha de Prata\\" during an exposition promoted by the Brazilian \\"Casa da Moeda\\". International success In Buenos Aires, Edgard exposed his artwork at the \\"Sal√£o Ramos Mejia\\", where he also won several awards. Some of his painting and drawings were or still are exposed in countries such as Argentina, Portugal and Italy. He was invited by the \\"Ossevartorio Cristiano\\", in Assis, Italy, to expose some of his artwork there as well as replacing Professor Carlos Oswald. Among some of his most famous drawings and paintings are \\"S√£o Francisco de Paula Walking on the Waves\\", dated from 1973, the \\"Ind√∫stria do Vidro\\" and a painting that he made for the \\"National Association of War Veterans in Brazil\\".

A ward heeler is an American urban political operative who works for a political party in a political ward, the smallest electoral subdivision of a city, usually to achieve an election result. A ward heeler may have controlling influence with a small clique in the ward organization. Often, ward heelers have been low-level operatives soliciting votes and performing campaign tasks on behalf of a political boss, including get-out-the-vote efforts, placing campaign signage, coordination of constituent support, etc. In many urban areas, ward heelers also serve as precinct captains. The term originated during the period of machine politics around the turn of the 20th century, when powerful political machines in major cities run by political bosses, such as the Tammany Hall organization in New York City, used corruption, such as graft and patronage to maintain their power. So \\"ward heeler\\" has the connotation of a corrupt political operative. As integral players in the \\"spoils system\\", ward heelers were often both recipients and distributors of patronage, illegal benefits from the political machine. Examples of illegal acts which a ward heeler might do include tearing down an opposition party's posters or paying constituents for their votes. In return for his services the ward heeler was often given a sinecure job, such as in the city's civil service, which was controlled by the organization.

Enderta is bordered on the west by Tembien, on the south and south west by Lasta and Wag, on the east by denkel (southern Red Sea region of Eritrea), and on the north by Agame and Adwa.Salt, A Voyage to Abyssinia, p. 379Ethiopian Mapping Authority, 1997 Enderta's local administration of Denkel/Afar up to the edges of Aseb under its jurisdiction seems to have been highly, interlinked with the operation of the salt trade and its taxation system; the entire tasks of salt caravan organization being the responsibility of the b√§algada, title assumed by the governor of End√§rta, since at least the Medieval period (c.1270-1527)ed. by Svein Ege, Harald Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, Trondheim 2009, 185Tsegay B.Gebrelibanos, The Ethiopian Salt Trading System in the 20th Century: A View from M√§q√§la, Northern Ethiopia Notable Bea'al gadas included the mighty Ras Robel, grand father of Emperor Sertse-Dengel as well as the paternal ancestor of Ras Suhul Mikael, Ras Faris the great, Ras Woldeselassie the great and Ras Araya Dimtsu, maternal uncle of Emperor Yohaness. Historically, the province of Enderta had been ruled by its own hereditary governors, at least, since the restoration of the solomonic dynasty in 1270.Roland Oliver, the Cambridge History of Africa c. 1600 to c. 1790, p. 132.Taddesse, \\"Church and State\\", p. 73J.D.

Capital Hintalo (also known as Antalo) had originally been Enderta's capital city; it is located on a high plateau beneath the south face of Amba Aradam, making the town a natural fortress. Hintalo would remain for centuries as one of the most important cities in the empire of Abyssinia; However, when Emperor Yohannes IV moved his capital to Mek'ele, the political and social life for both the Tigray province as well as Enderta moved from Hintalo to Mek'ele instead. The hereditary chiefs of Enderta had their origins in Hintalo and it was from Hintalo that they ruled Enderta.Mansfield Parkyns, Life in Abyssinia, vol. 2, p. 93. =Early history= After the fall of the Axumite empire some time in the late 9th century AD, the center of economical as well as political power shifted to Enderta. After some four hundred years later however, the Solomonic dynasty had been restored fully and with it, the province of Inderta/Enderta had been increasingly asserting its independence under Emperor Yekuno Amlak in 1270.Taddesse, Church and State, p. 73. the many provinces in the north were governed by the Tigray Mekonen based in Enderta.Richard M. Trivelli, Afrika spectrum 33(1998) 3: p. 259. Before the restoration of the solomonic dynasty, and during the time of the Zagwe dynasty, the Chief of Enderta was the Tigray Mekonen Ingida Egzi who was a protagonist of the \\"solomonic\\" legitimacy who played a major role in restoring the solomonic dynasty along with the chief priest of Aksum by the name of Tekeste Birhane; the two, Ingida Igzi and the powerful chief priest of the cathedral of Aksum, Tekeste Birahne are listed among the most influential dignitires on the side of Yekuno Amlak and among the pro-solomonic champions who played a major role in ending the zagwe dynasty and in restoring the solmonic dynasty. Ingida Igzi continued to be a powerful personality in 13th century Abyssinia, as governor of Enderta. In his 1316/7 campaigns in the south, Emperor Amda Seyon had to turn north to strengthen his control over areas that had in the meanwhile gained more autonomy.Mantel-Nieƒáko and Nosnitsin, \\"Amd√§ ·π£eyon I\\" in von Uhlig, Encyclopaedia. The northern province of Enderta had increasingly been asserting its independence since the Solomonic restoration under Yekuno Amlak in 1270; during Yekuno Amlak's time, the hereditary govornor/chief of Enderta, Ingida Igzi was succeeded by his son, Tesfane Igzi; as govornor of Enderta, Tesfane Igzi' had the most power among the northern provinces and held the title Hasgwa and Aqab√© Tsentsen ('keeper of the fly whisks - an ancient Aksumite title) and threatened the Amhara-based lineage currently in power; as early as 1305, Tesfane Igzi' referred to Inderta as \\"his kingdom,\\" his son and successor, Ya'ibika Igzi, did not even mention the Emperor Amda Seyon in his 1318/9 land grant. Ya'ibika Igzi among other things is credited for commissioning the writing and translation into Geez of one of the most distinguished books of Christian Ethiopia: Metsahafe kibre negist or \\" The book of the Glory of the Kings.\\" The book was compiled and translated into Geez by a group of Abyssinian clerics at the command of Ya'ibika Igzi. The text, in its existing form, is at least seven hundred years old, and is considered by many Ethiopian Christians and rastafarians to be an inspired and a reliable account. Not only does it contain an account of how the Queen of Sheba met Solomon, and about how the Ark of the Covenant came to Ethiopia with Menelik I, but contains an account of the conversion of the Ethiopians from the worship of the sun, moon, and stars to that of the \\"Lord God of Israel\\". As Edward Ullendorff explained in the 1967 Schweich Lectures, \\"The Kebra Nagast is not merely a literary work, but‚Äîas the Old Testament to the Hebrews or the Qur'an to the Arabs‚Äîit is the repository of Ethiopian national and religious feelings.Edward Ullendorff, Ethiopia and the Bible (Oxford: University Press for the British Academy, 1968), p. 75. It is The foremost creation of Ethiopic literature. Based on the testimony of this colophon, \\"Conti Rossini, Littmann, and Cerulli, inter alia, have marked off the period 1314 to 1321‚Äì1322 for the composition of the book.Hubbard, \\"The Literary Sources\\", p. 352.

Raised to the title of Ras and confirmed as Governor of Tigray, Semien, Seggada, Walqat and 44 other governments, 13 September 1759. Established his capital at Adowa. Invested as Ras Bitwodad and Enderase (Viceroy) of the Empire 22 January 1768. He died on 23 June 1779. =Zemene Mesafint or Era of princes= By the Zemene Mesafint, or Era of Princes (1769‚Äì1855), the province of Enderta assumed great prominence when its nobility ascended to power. The beginning of this period is set to the date Ras Mikael Sehul killed Emperor Iyoas (7 May 1769), Ras Suhul Michael after he was defeated by rebels at Sarbakusa in May 1771 however, he was chained, imprisoned for a year in Gondar and let go to Tigray. Upon hearing Michael's predicament, Dejazmach Kefla Yossous, the then hereditary governor of Enderta, challenged Michael for the over-lordship of Tigray and Merebmilash; in the ensuing battle Kefla Yossous was killed. Wolde Selassie, the second son of Dejazmach Kefla Yessous was a young man. His brothers included Dejazmach Bilaten-Geta Mennase and Dejazmach Debbab who is the great grandfather of Emperor Yohannes IV through his son Dejazmach Dimtsu Debbab who fathered Yohannese's mother Amate Selassie Dimtsu. Born in 1736 in Antalo Enderta, Wolde Selassie rose to prominence. He emerged as a heroic warrior after years of fighting; Nathaniel Pearce who lived with Ras Wolde Selasie for many years, describes an encounter where Wolde Selassie made a name for himself by single- handedly slaying the brothers Abel and Cail, \\"two of Ras Michael's choice men\\" who were sent by Michael to kill Wolde Selassie. Sehul Mikael was so impressed at Wolde Selassie's bravery he tried to make peace with him. However, Wolde Selassie remembered how the older man (Suhul Michael) had his father killed, and spent the years until the old Ras died in exile amongst the Wallo Oromo and in Gojjam. Upon the death of Michael, however, his grandson Wolde Gabriel succeeded the governorship, but was soon fiercely challenged by Kefla Yossous' son Wolde Selassie. Immediately, the two men went to war; Wolde Gabriel attempted to crush Wolde Selassie in Wogera, but according to Pearce, after besieging Wolde Selassie for 20 days Wolde Gabriel came off the worse and quickly made peace with Wolde Selassie by proclaiming him Balgadda or governor of the salt-making districts, but Wolde Selassie was aiming for the highest office in the land and when Wolde Gabriel was killed in a battle he waged against Ras Aligaz of Yejju, Wolde Selassie went after another powerful warlord of Tigray by the name of Ras Gebra Meskel. The two fought many battles but Ras Gebra Meskel was on the losing side; this prompted Wolde Selassie to head for Gondar to claim the governorship of Enderta. When he petitioned the Emperor Tekle Giorgis for that office, the Emperor however, gave the position to Ras Gebra Meskel instead; this angered Wolde Selassie, and he soon quickly marched forth with a small army against Gebra Meskel. He defeated his troops, then entered Gebra Meskel's camp and took him prisoner. Wolde Selassie, after effectively clearing the way for the highest office for himself, headed back to Gondar and placed his claim to the throne. The two Emperors, Tekle Haymanot and Tekle Giyorgis, bestowed Wolde Selassie the titles of both Ras and Bitwoded of the Abyssinian Empire in 1790.Henry Salt, A voyage to Abyssinia, p. 252 The family of Dejazmach Kefla Yessous and Wolde Selassie were of distinguished origin, and came from Antalo, in Enderta, of which place they were chiefs. Ras Wolde Selassie was known to be one of the bravest princes in the records of Abyssinia after engaging successfully in more than forty battles and rising to the level of Betwoded Enderase while a governor of all provinces as well as the major counties of Tigray, Gondar and Merebmilash (Eritrea) between 1790 and 1816. He was distinguished more for his intrepidity and firmness than by the politics and policy with which he had uniformly governed Abyssinia as Enderassie during the reign of Emperors Tekle Haymanot II, Tekle Giyorgis I and Egwale Seyon.Salt, A Voyage to Abyssinia, p. 253 His wives included Mentwab (died in 1812 from smallpox), the sister of Emperor Egwale Seyon; and Sahin, the daughter of Emperor Tekle Giyorgis. Wolde Selassie made his seat of government in Chalacot, but maintained his capital at Hintalo in Enderta Province. He built four residential palaces at Chelekot, Hintalo, Mekelle and Felegdaro all within Enderta. He played a role in the politics of the Imperial Throne, in part by providing shelter to Emperor Tekle Giyorgis I in 1799 and 1800, and was visited by the former Emperor Baeda Maryam in 1813.Pankhurst, History, p. 201f. Although at first he cooperated with Ras Aligaz, the Imperial Regent, after his power grew, Wolde Selassie came to challenge Aligaz for that office prior to Aligaz's death in 1803.Mordechai Abir, Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769‚Äì1855) (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 31 The first years of the 19th century were disturbed by fierce campaigns between Ras Gugsa of Begemder, and Ras Wolde Selassie of Tigray, who fought over control of the figurehead Emperor Egwale Seyon. Wolde Selassie was eventually the victor, and practically ruled the whole country as Enderase till his death in 1816. Wolde Selassie, a conservative Christian who greatly valued Ethiopia's monarchical traditions, hated the Yeju parvenus. He hit out at them by effectively conquering the Azebo and Raya Oromo and by taking control over all the important passes in Lasta leading to Tigray. He then turned his attention to the coast, slowly but surely imposing his suzerainty over the Muslim authorities there until he finally could control and tax their trade inland; he used the revenues, to train, reform and re-equip his army and when the 19th century opened, Wolde Selassie was by far Abyssinia's leading figure and certainly the main champion of the Solomonic tradition.Harold G. Marcus, A history of Ethiopia (University of California press: 2002), p. 53 For 25 years, Ras Wolde Selassie was known to have had wielded the most power during his tenure as Ras exceeding formidable rases such as Ras Aligaz of Yejju, Ras Gugsa of Gojam and the Oromo chieftain Gojje; and throughout his vast districts, all kinds of crimes, grievances, rebellions, disputes and inheritances were directly referred to him and most wars were carried by himself in person.Salt, A Voyage to Abyssinia, p. 109 According to Paul Henze, Ras Wolde Selassie was the first ruler of this period to have close contact with Europeans, hosting three British diplomats, George Annesley, Viscount Valentia, his secretary Henry Salt, and Pearce. Salt's arrival in Abyssinia culminated in the signing of a treaty of friendship with Wolde Selassie representing Abyssinia and the former representing Great Britain in 1805. Henry Salt also proposed inaugurating trade with Britain; Wolde Selassie was quick to see possible advantages in relations with Britain and promised to encourage such commerce with every means in his power. Revealing himself a realist, and speaking, Salt says, with 'great sincerity', he nevertheless expressed the fear that his country: might not be able to supply any quantity of valuable commodities sufficient to recompense our merchants for engaging in so precarious a trade; more especially as the Abyssinians were not much acquainted with commercial transactions...Could any plan, however, be arranged for obviating these difficulties...he would most readily concur in carrying it into effect. Wolde Selassie also touched on a major obstacle that the Abyssinians had faced, the Egyptians had control over the port of Massawa which they acquired from the Ottoman Empire and reminded King George that with their \\"naval superiority in the red sea\\" Abyssinia might find it difficult to gain access to the port.Salt H., A Voyage to Abyssinia (London, 1814) Wolde Selassie's effort, however, did bear fruit in the long term when his successors Dejazmatch Wube of Semien and Tigray and Emperor Yohanness of Ethiopia followed up on the treaty that was struck between him and the kingdom of Britain. Nathaniel Pearce lived with Ras Wolde from about 1808 and the warlord's death. Pearce's diary of his stay is not only valuable for the history of this period, but also provides enormous detail about daily life in Ethiopia.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 122 At the effort of Ras Wolde Selassie, Abyssinia received its bishop from Egypt at around 1816: Abuna Qerellos III (1816‚Äì1828) who made his residence in Antalo. Henry Salt who was one of the three British diplomats who visited Abyssinia both in 1805 and in 1810 was hosted by Ras Wolde Selassie at his residence in Antalo; he writes, \\"Ras Wolde Selassie ruled Abyssinia with firmness and a vigor of constitution that united the different ethnic groups of Abyssinia. When ever I have seen him in the exercise of his power, he has shown a vivacity of expression, a quickness comprehension, and a sort of commanding energy, that overawed all who approached him\\".Salt, A voyage to Abyssinia, p. 255 Another British envoy, Mansfield Parkyns, adds, \\"Wolde Selassie reigned for twenty-five years, and during this long period obtained and maintained for himself the character of a good and wise prince\\".Mansfield Parkyns, Life in Abyssinia, vol. 2, p. 109. The Great Ras Wolde Selassie died at an advanced age in 1816 at his residence in Antalo, Enderta due to natural causes. His death was universally mourned. =The end of Zemene Mesafint= With the rise of Kassa Hailu of Quara known as Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia came the end of Zemene Mesafint. Originally little more than a bandit or an outlaw, surviving in the Ethiopian marches against the Sudan, Kassa won his way to control of first one province of Ethiopia, Dembiya, then following a series of battles beginning with Gur Amba (27 September 1852) and ending with Battle of Derasge (1855), came to control all of Ethiopia. With imperial power once again in the hand of a single man, Tewodros, the Zemene Mesafint had ceased to exist, and the beginning of a centralized authority had commenced. =The rise of Emperor Yohannes= A European sketch of Yohannes IV Born into the family of the lords of Enderta and Tembien, Dejazmach Kassai Mercha, ascended the imperial throne in 1872 under the name Yohannes IV. He was born in 1831 to Mercha, Shum (or \\"governor\\") of Tembien, and his wife Woizero (or \\"Dame\\") Silass Dimtsu (Amata Selassie), who was the daughter of Dejazmach (roughly equivalent to \\"Duke\\") Dimtsu Debbab of Enderta the nephew of the powerful Ras Wolde Selassie of Enderta. With the death of Emperor Tewdros in 1868, Ethiopia was once again divided into three rival over lords: Wagshum Gobaze ruler of Amhara, Wag and Lasta, Dajazmtach Kasa Mercha of Tigray and Menilek, heir to the throne of Shawa. Wagshum Gobaze was immediately crowned Emperor Takla Giyorgis at Gondar. He was, however, soon effectively challenged by Dajazmach Kasa who was more powerful militarily, in part on account of the gift of arms he had received from the Napier expedition, and assistance given him by a former member of the British force, John Kirkham who had volunteered to train his army on European lines. Gobaze set out with 60,000 men to capture the city of Adwa, but Kassa, making good use of his British guns, defeated him at the battle of Assam, on 11 July 1871; He then proclaimed himself Emperor Yohannes IV, on 21 January of the following year. Yohannes was an uncompromising patriot, a staunch supporter of the church and a strong opponent of Christian missionaries. He accepted the existence of virtually independent rulers, provided that they recognized his overall suzerainty and paid him some occasional taxes.Pankhurst, The Ethiopians A History, p. 163 His reign coincided with the beginning of the age of Imperialism. Throughout his reign, Yohannes was embroiled in military struggles on his northern frontiers. First was from Khedive Isma'il Pasha of Egypt, who sought to bring the entire Nile River basin under his rule. The Egyptians marching from the port of Zeila occupied the city-state of Harar on 11 October 1875. The Egyptians then marched into northern Ethiopia from their coastal possessions around the port of Massawa. Yohannes pleaded with the British to stop their Egyptian allies, and even withdrew from his own territory in order to show the Europeans that he was the wronged party and that the Khedive was the aggressor. However, Yohannes soon realized that the Europeans would not stop the Khedive of Egypt. Yohannes responded by declaring war, and the Patriarch excommunicated in advance any soldiers who failed to respond to the call to arms. The powerful Egyptian army then crossed the Marab river into the heartland of Tegray, but were almost annihilated by the emperor's forces at the battle of Gundat (also called Guda-gude) on the morning of 16 November 1875; the Egyptians were tricked into marching into a narrow and steep valley and were wiped out by Ethiopian gunners surrounding the valley from the surrounding mountains. Virtually the entire Egyptian force, along with its many officers of European and North American background, were killed. News of this huge defeat was suppressed in Egypt for fear that it would undermine the government of the Khedive. The Khedive of Egypt Ismail, on learning of his unexpected reverse, assembled a much larger army of 15,000 to 20,000 men, armed with the most modern weapons. Yohannes mauled the invaders at the three-day battle of Gura, b/n 7 and 9 March 1876. His soldiers, who displayed great heroism, captured close on twenty cannon, as well as several thousand Remington rifles. His army as a result emerged as perhaps the first really well-equipped Ethiopian force in the country's history. The Egyptians aware of the extent of their defeats in 1875-6, as well as the apparent invincibility of the emperor's army, abandoned their expansionist ambitions in this part of Africa, as it turned out for ever. The Ethiopian victories of Gndat and Gura were important in that they helped to consolidate the internal political position of Yohannes, and assisted him forge a considerable measure of national unity. Yohannes went on to repel and quel on multiple occasions Italian and Sudan mahdist aggressions with his famed generals such as Ras Alula Aba Nega. In one of his last battles against the invading army of Mahdists who broke into the country, Yohannes hastened to Qallabat on the Sudan frontier to repel them, but, at the close of a victorious battle at Matamma on 9 March 1889, was mortally wounded by a sniper's bullet. He died on the following day, one of the last crowned heads in the world to die on the field of battle. According to Augustus B. Wylde who claimed to have heard the story from a priest who managed to escape the slaughter, wrote how Yohannes' uncle Ras Areya Dimtsu of Enderta stood beside the body of his dead master with \\"a few of his soldiers and the bravest of the king's servants, who had lost their all, and had no more prospects to live for\\". Ras Areya was last seen standing alongside the box containing the king's body, after having expended all his ammunition, with his shield and sword in his hands, defending himself, till at last he was speared by a Dervish from behind, and died fighting gamely like the fine old warrior that he was; according to Wylde, as he saw death come Ras Areya announced \\"that he was now old and done for, that his time had come, and it was useless at his age to serve another master that he knew little about, and it was better to die like a man fighting unbelievers, than like a mule in a stable.\\"Wylde, Modern Abyssinia, p. 43 =Modernization under Yohannes= Yohannes' successive struggles against foreign invaders, Egyptian, Dervis and Italian, left him moreover with little time for technological or other innovation. He nevertheless succeeded, in sending envoys on important diplomatic missions abroad. Yohannes was like wise the first Ethiopian ruler to appoint a foreign consul, a certain Samuel King, who served as his representative in London. Advancement in the medical field introduced mercury preparations for the treatment of syphilis came into extensive use at this time, at least in the principal Ethiopian towns. Yohannes also had in his court a Greek doctor, Nicholas Parisis. He was similarly the first Ethiopian monarch to be inoculated with modern-style smallpox vaccine, which was then beginning to replace the country's traditional inoculation.Pankhurst, The Ethiopians A History, p. 176 =Notable men of Enderta of the 18th-19th century AD= * Dejazmatch Weldo, hereditary chief of Enderta 1720‚Äì1747 * Dejazmatch Kefla Iyasus son of Amda Mikael, hereditary Chief of Enderta 1747‚Äì1773. * Ras Wolde Selaassie Kefla Iyasus.

The law or edict provides for fourteen provinces (Teklay gizat), around 100 counties (Awrajas), and 600 districts (Woredas).Sarah Vaughan, \\"Ethnicity and Power in Ethiopia\\", PhD dissertation, p. 123, 2003 Therefore, curbing the power of the hundreds of nobles and their provinces throughout the Empire. This then enabled Haile Selassie to centralize his authority and in effect rendered these nobles with their administrations dependent to the central government. Historians agree that \\"the basic policy of Haile Selassie was a centralizing one continuing the tradition of the great centralizing Emperors from 1855 onwards.\\"Clapham, Christopher, Transformation and continuity in Revolutionary Ethiopia, Cambridge University press, p. 27, 1988. The provision reduced the many provinces of Tigray into eight counties: Raya Azebo, Enderta, Tembien, Kilete Awla'lo, Agame, Adowa, Axum and Shire along with many districts under each of the counties' jurisdictions. After the liberation of Ethiopia from Italian occupation in 1941, Ethiopia saw many rebellions spread out in different parts of the empire. Among these rebellions however, the \\"Woyane Rebellion\\" in southern and eastern Tigray in 1943 had become a powerful and highly popular uprising that, within a few months it had shaken the government of Haile Selassie to its core and as a consequence, the Imperial government resorted in using aerial bombardment by collaborating with the British Royal Air Force so as to quell the rebellion. The woyane uprising in Tigray seems to have arisen when administrative corruption and greed ignited a situation of existing instability and insecurity, one awash with weaponry in the wake of the Italian defeat.Sarah Vaughan, \\"Ethnicity and Power\\", p. 126. The rebellion In 1943, open resistance broke out all over southern and eastern Tigray under the slogan, \\"there is no government; let's organize and govern ourselves.\\" Household and Society in Ethiopia, African studies center, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michi., 1977. Throughout Enderta awraja including, Mekelle, Didibadergiajen, Hintalo, Saharti, Samre and Wajirat, Raya awraja, Kilete-Awlaelo awraja and Tembien awraja, local assemblies, called gerreb, were immediately formed. The gerreb sent representatives to a central congress, called the shengo, which elected leadership and established military command system. The rebels established their headquarters at Wokro. During the rainy season of 1943 the rebels under the leadership of Fitawrari Yeebio Woldai and Dejazmach Neguise Bezabih, hailing from Enderta,Mamoka Maki, The wayyane in Tigray and the reconstruction of the Ethiopia government in the 1940s, In: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, ed. by Svein Ege, Harald Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Trondheim 2009, p. 5. which was the heart of the woyane rebellion,Mamoka Maki, The wayyane in Tigray and the reconstruction of the Ethiopia government in the 1940s, In: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, ed. by Svein Ege, Harald Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Trondheim 2009, p. 6. were busy organizing their forces; and after celebrating the Ethiopian New Year on 12 September, they went on the besieged government garrison at Quiha. The highly equipped government forces were to meet with the poorly equipped but determined rebels for the first time in the rebels' stronghold district of Didiba Dergiajen, Enderta in the village of Sergien; the rebels under the leadership of Fitawrari Yeebio Woldai (Wedi Weldai) and Dej. Neguisie Bezabih defeated the government forces decisively; they captured countless modern weapons that helped them attract many peasants to join the rebellion; and many government soldiers deserted and joined the rebellion. In the month of September 1943, on the government's second offensive in the village of Ara, also in Enderta, the woyane rebels under Wedi Weldai scored yet a second victory over the heavily armed government forces; this time, the rebels captured high level feudal chiefs including and killed many prominent Tigray and Amhara war lords that sided with the Emperor Haile Selassie's government. The rebels under Bashay Gugsa Mengesha also captured General Essyas and many of his commanders and imperial soldiers at Quiha. The rebel forces estimated at 20,000, moved eastward from Quiha to Enda Yesus, a fort overlooking the provincial capital, Mekelle. They captured the fort and then took Mekelle. The representatives of Haile Selassie's government fled. The woyanti issued a proclamation to the inhabitants of Mekelle which stated, inter alia: > \\"Our governor is Jesus Christ... > And our flag that of Ethiopia. > Our religion is that of Yohannes IV. > People of Tigray, follow the motto of Weyane.\\" The Pan Ethiopian nature of Woyanne The slogans of the first Woyanne were clearly Pan Ethiopian and for equality and autonomy. Their proclamation after liberating Mekelle had five main points. * Reduced tax * Local leadership to collect tax * Appointment of one's own leaders free of domination. * Eradication of thieves and bandits (shiftas) * Objection to payment of excessive taxation and payment to appointee of the Emperor A similar victory was achieved by the rebels under the leadership of one of the top leaders of the woyane movement namely Dejazmach Negussie Bezabih and Bashay Gugsa Mengesha again in the district of Hintalo and Wajerat in Enderta; the rebels defeated the heavily armed government forces numbering in thousands and aided by British air power, the rebels were able to capture and acquire yet again heavy modern armaments. By 20 September the successful Weyane rebel army was ready to turn south to face an Ethiopian force attempting to advance to Tigray. Haile Selassie had ordered his minister of war Ras Abebe Aregai, to take charge of the campaign against the rebels. The Ras rushed northward and arrived at Korem, south of Maichew, on 17 September but his way was blocked by rebels. During the next three weeks, the Weyane forces fought hard against Ras Abebe's Ethiopian troops, who were bolstered by a small contingent of British officers and specialists.Rebels and Separatists in Ethiopia, Regional Resistance to a Marxist Regime by Paul Henze, Rand corporation-- prepared for the office of the under secretary of defense for policy, p. 42, December 1985. The fighting centered on the great natural fortress of Amba Alaji. Basha Gugusa, one of the first Woyanne leaders, led the battle of Ambalage in the month of September 1943 to victory over Imperial army which was well equipped and supported by British airpower. The Weyane forces outnumbered those of the government, but their advantage in numbers was offset by artillery and British air power. The woyane leaders precipitated the final decisive battle by launching a three-pronged attack on government positions with perhaps 10,000 men. The war is spread to Alaje in Raya, Wukro in Agame and Tembien whereby the rebels mostly peasants beat the huge government forces equipped with tanks and modern weapons led by Ras Abebe Aregai, General Abebe Damtew and aided by British Col. Pluck. The total annihilation of government forces heavily supported by the British army sent a signal to the Emperor, that \\"the Tigrians weren't only brave fighters but also astute strategist\\" said Hailemariam when he gave an interview to Wegahta magazine.Blata Hailemariam Reda, Wegahta Magazine, Nos. 1, 2, and 4, 1993. Countless British officers were killed including Col. Pluck who was killed by a Woyane rebel. The inability to subdue the rebellion prompted the Emperor to authorize an aerial bombardment by collaborating with the British royal air force. On 6 14 October bombs and on the 14th 54 bombs were dropped in the provincial capital Mekelle respectively; on 7, 16 October bombs and on the 9th 32 bombs were dropped in Corbetta Raya and Hintalo Enderta respectively as well, though they were devastating mainly to civilians with thousands of people killed, they did not however, crush the rebellion.Gilkes, The dying lion, p. 180. Although the rebels scattered and battle formations began to disintegrate on 7 October, uncertainty still affected the Ethiopian government forces and Ras Abebe did not personally move out of Korem until 9 October. He then moved systematically northward and entered Quiha and Mekelle on 14 October, capturing the erstwhile rebel headquarters at Wokro on 17 October. Ras Abebe Aregai was appointed as governor of Tigray and was given authority with the pacification of that province. His pacification was brutal. The punishment for the uprising severe as it may be with the aerial bombardment, the people were obliged to pay large sums of money and their land was confiscated and distributed to loyal gentry as a punishment and deterrent to future revolt. A new taxation was imposed that 'cost the peasants five times more than they had under the Italians during the occupation.Haggain Erlich \\"British involvement and Haile Selassie's emerging absolution northern Ethiopia, 1941‚Äì1943\\", Asian and African studies 15, 2 (1981), p. 219. Ten woyane rebel leaders were captured and sent to prison in Debrebirhan. Including the top leaders, Basha Gugsa Mengesha, Dej. Bezabih Negussie, and Hailemariam Reda.Mamoka Maki, The wayyane in Tigray and the reconstruction of the Ethiopia government in the 1940s, In: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies, ed. by Svein Ege, Harald Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Trondheim 2009, p. 8. Bashay Gugsa was also not allowed to return to Tigray, because the central government feared his influence. However, the central government tried to make use of his military skills and sent him with a group of soldiers to suppress other rebellions in the southern Ethiopia. Although the Woyane rebellion of 1943 had shortcomings as a prototype revolution, historians however agree that, the Woyane rebellion had involved a fairly high level of spontaneity and peasant initiative.Gebru Tareke, Ethiopia: Power and Protest, p. 121. It demonstrated considerable popular participation, and reflected widely shared grievances. The uprising was unequivocally and specifically directed against the central amhara regime of Haile Selassie I, rather than the Tigrian imperial elite.Gebru Tareke, Ethiopia: Power and Protest, p. 122. =Notable men of Enderta of the 20th century AD= * Dejazmatch Hailu Araya (Son of Ras Araya dimtsu of Enderta).

These seventy elders were also bestowed provincial authority by the governor of the province to legally represent Enderta and its people in a provincial level with neighboring districts, counties and provinces. This is a form of old age democratic process through which elected and assigned elders are representing their constituency in social, political, and governmental affairs within the empire of Ethiopia. In a communal or individual level, individual Endertans enjoyed self representation within the district, county and even the provincial level; in Enderta, jural independence included the right to claim farmland and to represent oneself in community councils and in court. In a household level, Endertans had a strong ethos of individualism and that households were more political than kin units, with non-kin recruited on a contractual basis for their labor. Important to this ethos of individualism was a man's construction of a Hidmo as a material statement of his ambition to be someone of consequence in his community,Bauer, D.

Anne Villiers's nieces included Elizabeth Villiers, mistress to William III, and Barbara Villiers, who was the mistress of Charles II and would be made Duchess of Cleveland in her own right.Ollard 1987, p. 131. In April 1627 she married Robert Douglas, Lord Dalkeith, later Earl of Morton. The Earl and Countess of Morton had at least three children who lived to adulthood:Cokayne The Complete Peerage Reprinted Gloucester 2000 Vol. IX, p. 296 #William Douglas, 9th Earl of Morton (died 1681), married Lady Grizel Middleton, daughter of the 1st Earl of Middleton and had issue; #Lady Anne Douglas, married in 1654 to William Keith, 6th Earl Marischal and had issue; #Lady Mary Douglas, married on 24 July 1662 to Sir Donald Macdonald, 10th Laird of Sleat, 3rd Baronet and had issue. Royalist heroine Anne Villiers, Lady Dalkeith, by Anthony van Dyck Lady Dalkeith, as she was styled at the time, was a godmother of Princess Henrietta. During the Civil War, the infant princess, less than one month old, was left in Lady Dalkeith's care. After being besieged in Exeter by Parliamentary forces in April 1646, she was forced to expend her own funds to care for the princess. She refused to take the child to St James's Palace, endeavoring instead to convey her to France to be united with her mother, Queen Henrietta Maria. She disguised herself and the princess as peasants and fled to Dover and then France. Apparently, during the journey, the princess nearly revealed their identity by innocently informing the townspeople that she was not accustomed to dressing in such a shabby fashion. Nevertheless, they arrived safely. Lady Dalkeith's actions were well-received and highly praised upon her arrival. Shortly after, her father-in-law died, making her Countess of Morton.Ollard 1987, p. 127. Despite efforts of conversion to Catholicism by the princess's mother and the child herself, Lady Morton remained a staunch Protestant throughout her time as Princess Henrietta's governess. Lady Morton lived in France as the princess's governess until 1651, when her husband, the Earl, died. She herself died in Scotland on 15 December 1654, of a sudden bout of fever.Ollard 1987, p. 130. Anne and Lord Clarendon For many years an exceptionally close friendship existed between Lady Morton and Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, a cousin by marriage, whose letters to her sometimes suggest feelings warmer than friendship.Ollard 1987, p. 128. Eventually they quarreled, in slightly obscure circumstances, when she accused him of interfering with her marriage plans for her daughter Anne, and she broke off friendly relations, much to Clarendon's distress.Ollard 1987, pp. 130‚Äì131. A long projected second marriage between Lady Morton and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, never took place, possibly due to opposition from Clarendon, who had quarreled with Berkeley. Clarendon's regard for Anne's memory is thought to have been one of the reasons for his hatred of her niece Barbara Villiers, mistress of Charles II: he thought it intolerable that so close a relative of his old friend should disgrace her family in this fashion. This eventually contributed to his downfall, since Barbara returned his hatred, and worked constantly to destroy him.

Advocacy and #BringBackOurGirls Campaign  In March 2014, she delivered a keynote speech at the national summit of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the leading opposition party in Nigeria. She criticized the many cross-carpeting governors and urged the party to have \\"a conversation deeper than how you're going to chase (the ruling) PDP out of power\\".Ayokunle Odekunle, \\"10 things you SHOULD know about Oby Ezekwesili‚Äôs speech at the APC National summit\\", Naija.com.

The former minister had hinted at contesting for the office of the president. At an event commemorating the 58th anniversary of Nigeria's independence, Pastor Tunde Bakare announced that she would be running for the office of the president. One of her campaign promises was to lift 80 million Nigerians out of poverty. On 24 January 2019, Oby stepped down from the presidential race owing to a divergence of values and visions with her political party, Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN). However, later in the day, the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) said it was too late for anyone to withdraw from the race because the ballot materials had already been prepared. For that reason, the crest of the party would still appear. Fela Durotoye commended Oby for taking the lead and clamouring for a coalition to end the rule of #APCPDP. On 4 February 2019, Oby organised a press conference in NICON Luxury Hall, Abuja. She opened up during her press conference on her rough political journey while campaigning for the office of the President of Nigeria under the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN).

Montefoschi was born in Rome. She started studying psychoanalysis after the degree in medicine and in biology. She was a student of Ernst Bernhard, (in turn student of Jung). She was distinguished, since her first works, for an interpretation in dialectical key of the Jungian thought. From the vision of the psychoanalytic relationship as an intersubjective evolutionary relationship, she theorized the universal meaning of the human cognitive experience as process of self-consciousness and evolution of the being. After 1977, she began focusing on issues of intersubjectivity in a unified reading of the history of psychoanalysis from Sigmund Freud to Carl Jung and to this day, applying the \\"principle of individuation\\" to the same psychoanalysis and its history. Selected works Her books constitute an organic work of knowledge of the reality, that goes over to know psychoanalytic: * L'uno e l'altro.

Description It reaches in length, and is named for the bright red stripes on its otherwise translucent body, which are reminiscent of peppermint candies such as a candy cane. Its eggs, by contrast, are bright green. Distribution Lysmata wurdemanni was originally described from specimens collected at Key West, Florida and Charleston, South Carolina. Alternative link Its range extends along the Atlantic seaboard of the United States from Long Island to Florida, and along the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Port Aransas, Texas. It may also occur in the northern Caribbean Sea, but this has not been confirmed. Reproduction Peppermint shrimp carrying eggs Freshly hatched peppermint shrimp zoea Lysmata wurdemanni is a protandric simultaneous hermaphrodite. This means that it begins as a male but may later become a hermaphrodite. It has four moults as a male before changing sexes to become a euhermaphrodite. However, under certain conditions some males never change to hermaphrodites. In the euhermaphrodite stage the shrimp act as a male between moults and as a female immediately following a moult. During this hermaphroditic stage the shrimp gradually lose their male organs, likely because more energy is being allocated to the development of female reproductive organs. Lysmata wurdemanni employs a 'pure searching' tactic for mate-finding in which the males are constantly searching for receptive females. Males use olfactory organs (aesthetascs) on their antennnules to detect soluble female sex pheromones (distance pheromones). These pheromones are released 2‚Äì8 hours prior to female moulting. Guided by these chemical signals, males make their way to the female and will approach her. The male will then 'taste' the female's contact pheromones with his aesthetascs to make sure she is a suitable mate. If the chemicals are right, courtship may commence and, if courtship goes well, copulation will ensue. This process is very brief and occurs immediately post-moult, while the female's cuticle is new and soft. Aquaria Lysmata wurdemanni is a reef safe cleaning animal which consumes parasites and dead or diseased tissue from other animals, and is therefore used in marine aquariums. Additionally, these shrimp are known to consume the Aiptasia or \\"glass\\" anemone which is regarded as a pest and is difficult to eradicate from home salt-water aquariums. The hatching of eggs, moulting, and copulation cycle is identical to that of L. debelius, yielding weekly batches of zoeae from each pair. Taxonomy The species L. wurdemanni has undergone reclassification and has been divided into four distinct species ‚Äì L. wurdemanni, L. ankeri, L. bahia and L. boggessii. More recent molecular phylogenetic work found that L. wurdemanni is a cryptic species with at least 5 (and potentially 9) morphologically identical species being present across its range .

He represented Queens County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1925 to 1926 as a Conservative member. Biography Barnjum was born in Montreal, Quebec, the son of Francis Barnum and Leonora Pryor. Barnjum married Bertha L. Clement. He was extensively involved in lumbering in Nova Scotia and became a millionaire. Barnjum, a proponent of forest conservation and reforestation known as the \\"Canadian Forestry Crusader\\", opposed the export of pulpwood to the United States. However, an embargo on exports of pulpwood would also benefit Barnjum's business interests. He helped have Otto Schierbeck named as Nova Scotia's first Chief Forester in 1926; in 1923, Barnjum had hired Schierbeck as forester for his own timber holdings in Nova Scotia.Sandberg, AL & Clancy, PL Against the Grain: Foresters and Politics in Nova Scotia (2000) Barnjum resigned his seat in the provincial assembly in 1926 because he had made a campaign promise to have a paper mill built on the Mersey River; however, it was built by others first. In 1932, he purchased one of the last remaining large stands of virgin timber on Vancouver Island to preserve it for future generations. Barnjum died in Paris at the age of 74 during a visit to Europe to study forest conservation; he was buried in Lynnfield, Massachusetts.

It was written by Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas and Kevin Jonas and produced by the Jonas Brothers alongside John Fields, for Lovato's debut studio album, Don't Forget (2008). It was released as the album's second single on December 18, 2008, through Hollywood Records. \\"La La Land\\" is one of six songs on the album co- written by the Jonas Brothers, who also contributed backing vocals and guitars to the track. Lovato said that she wrote the song about being yourself in Hollywood and not letting other people change who you are. Musically, the song is a guitar-driven pop rock song and the lyrics speak of Lovato feeling \\"out of place\\" in Hollywood. The song was met with positive reviews from critics. Commercially, \\"La La Land\\" peaked at number fifty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number thirty-five on the UK Singles Chart. The song achieved its highest peak in Ireland, where it reached number thirty on the Irish Singles Chart. It was less successful in Australia and Germany, where it peaked in the lower half of the charts. The song was used to promote Lovato's Disney Channel sitcom Sonny with a Chance and its music video features appearances from her co-stars. Background and release \\"La La Land\\" is one of six songs on Lovato's debut album Don't Forget (2008) that she co-wrote with the Jonas Brothers. Lovato said that it was \\"important\\" to have them on her album, because \\"I mean, just look at how successful they are. I would love to have their input anytime, because they're obviously doing something right.\\" The band also contributed backing vocals and played the guitar to the song. It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums. In an interview, Lovato explained that the song is about being yourself when you are surrounded by \\"the pressures of fame\\". She said, \\"You get to Hollywood and a lot of times people can try to shape you and mould you into what they want you to be. The song is just about keeping it real and trying to stay yourself when you're out in Hollywood.\\" \\"La La Land\\" was released as the album's second single on December 18, 2008. It was later released in the United Kingdom on May 31, 2009, with the new song \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\". A CD single was released on June 1, 2009, with a recorded live version of the Camp Rock song \\"This Is Me\\" from Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience. Composition \\"La La Land\\" is a guitar-driven pop rock song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is composed in the time signature of common time with a moderate beat rate of 84 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A major and Lovato's vocal range spans from the low-note of F3 to the high-note of E5. It has a basic sequence of Fm‚ÄìD‚ÄìE as its chord progression. Lyrically, \\"La La Land\\" is about Lovato feeling \\"out of place\\" in Hollywood, demonstrated in lines such as, \\"Who said I can't wear my Converse with my dress?\\", and \\"I'm not a supermodel, I still eat McDonald's.\\" Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic compared the track's theme to Miley Cyrus' \\"Party in the U.S.A.\\", and the guitars present in the song to works by English punk rock band The Clash. Music video \\"La La Land\\" was directed by Brendan Malloy and Tim Wheeler. It was used to promote Lovato's then-upcoming Disney Channel sitcom, Sonny with a Chance. In an interview with MTV News, Lovato said that it \\"really describes the show. I'm excited about that.\\" Speaking of the video, co-director Malloy said, \\"The idea for the video is to create this hyperreal world, that's the word we keep using, La La Land. Fame has definitely gotten to everybody's head. It's more like [Lovato] is the only one in this world that fame hasn't gotten to.\\" According to Lovato, her Sonny with a Chance co-stars play \\"stereotypical Hollywood Los Angeles [...] big type of people.\\" The video premiered on December 19, 2008 on Disney Channel. It was released to the iTunes Store on January 20, 2009. For the video, the lyric \\"I still eat McDonald's\\" was changed to \\"I still eat at Ronald's\\". Jefferson Reid of E! Online praised the video, writing, \\"Mocking Hollywood phonies is always cool by us, and bonus points to Demi Lovato for doing it while rocking out in admirable form. Skewering the \\"La La Land\\" machine with sass and grit, Disney's latest everygirl rock star seems like she might eventually give Miley Cyrus a real run for her money.\\" The video features appearances from Lovato's Sonny with a Chance co-stars Allisyn Ashley Arm, Doug Brochu, Sterling Knight, Michael Kostroff, Brandon Mychal Smith and Tiffany Thornton, as well as Lovato's older sister Dallas Lovato. The video begins with Lovato being interviewed on a talk show called Rumor Has It with Benny Beverly (Brochu). After introducing her to the audience, Beverly asks Lovato what it is like to be a star. A video is then shown to the audience, which serves as the main portion of the clip. In Hollywood, Lovato walks past a \\"Be-seen section,\\" and bumps into a stranger on the street, which a paparazzo (Knight) takes a picture of. A woman then reads a tabloid magazine with Lovato and the \\"mystery man\\" on the cover. The video then cuts to Lovato and the Sonny with a Chance cast at a red carpet event, with paparazzi taking pictures of Lovato wearing Converse sneakers with a dress. Lovato is then shown on the set of a commercial for her perfume, in a pink wig with makeup being applied to her. She is uncomfortable and eventually refuses to cooperate, which angers the director (Smith). The video then cuts back to Rumor Has It with applause from the audience and ends with Beverly praising Lovato. Live performances Lovato performed \\"Get Back\\" and \\"La La Land\\" at the Kids' Inaugural: \\"We Are the Future\\" event on January 19, 2009, in Washington D.C. at the Verizon Center. The event was held to celebrate the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States. On April 7, 2009, Lovato performed \\"La La Land\\" on the eighth season of Dancing with the Stars. During the performance, Benji Schwimmer and Tori Smith danced along. Barrett wrote that \\"the frantic nature of both song and dance complemented each other quite nicely.\\" On April 25, 2009, Lovato performed the song on the final episode of singing competition My Camp Rock (UK), where she also presented the award to the winner, Holly Hull. During the summer of 2008, Lovato performed the song in both of her Warm Up Tour and the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour, for the latter she served as the opening act. Later in 2009, the song was performed during the Summer Tour 2009. In 2010, she performed the song during her South American tour. Lovato also performed the song during her set at the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert World Tour 2010. Scott Mervis of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that Lovato performed a \\"high-energy, high- volume\\" version of the song. In September 2011, Lovato performed the song during the revue concert An Evening with Demi Lovato as part of a medley with \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Here We Go Again\\". Critical reception Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote a positive review of the song and rated it four out of five stars. He wrote, \\"So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, but the good news is that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really.\\" McAlpine concluded his review, writing, \\"You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the only thing she has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if she slips up for a second, we'll all be watching...\\" Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows \\"her Gen-Y stripes\\", and \\"forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' ‚Äì pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included \\"La La Land\\" at number eight on his \\"Top 10 from the Disney girls\\" list, and wrote, \\"Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's \\"Party in U.S.A.,\\" this song is all about how out of place Lovato feels in La La Land.\\" Chart performance On January 10, 2009, \\"La La Land\\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 83. The following week, it rose to number 56. The same week, it debuted on the Hot Digital Songs chart at number 42. On January 31, 2009, \\"La La Land\\" reached its peak of number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 27 on Hot Digital Songs. To date, it has sold 935,000 digital copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In the UK, on the UK Singles Chart, the song debuted at number 63 on May 2, 2009. The following week, it reached its peak of 35, and spent a total of seven weeks on the chart. In Ireland, it debuted at number 30, which became its peak.

Monkeys reproduce without human interference, so their offsprings' characteristics are determined by natural selection. Captive bred monkeys may be intentionally bred by their owners. A person who intentionally mates monkeys to produce babies is referred to as a monkey breeder. Breeding outside of zoos is typically done for commercial gain.  History  Monkeys have been bred in captivity for hundreds of years. Initially used for circus and street performance, their trainers would breed stock to maintain the correct temperament and to ensure the young are tamed early. Breeding also occurred in European zoos from the 18th century when monkeys were returned from sea voyages and the public took interest in them. Recently large scale commercial breeders have been established. They are typically located in the United States where is there is a growing demand for monkey pets. The cost of breeding is quite high and thus only selected breeders do it in volume.http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/157/9/1192-a.pdf  Types of monkeys that can be bred  Not all breeds are suited for breeding in captivity.

Early life He was born in Munich, on his father's side to the dynasty of Freiherren (Barons) von Firmian descending from Sigmundskron (Formigar) Castle in Tyrol, by virtue of being the son of Countess Maria Viktoria von Thun and the Imperial envoy, Baron Franz Wilhelm von Firmian. His maternal uncle Count Johann Ernst von Thun was Bishop of Seckau from 1679 until 1687 and Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg from 1687 to 1709. Leopold Anton von Firmian was the uncle of Cardinal Leopold Ernst von Firmian, also prince-bishop of Passau. His nephew, Karl Joseph von Firmian, the Austrian plenipotentiary minister in Milan, was renowned as a patron of the arts, including poets such as Giuseppe Parini, musicians such as Johann Ernst Eberlin and painters such as Giambettino Cignaroli. While Leopold Anton was an early patron of Leopold Mozart, his nephew, Count Karl von Firmian appears to have been one of the patrons of Amadeus Mozart's opera Mitridate, Re di Ponto in Milan circa 1770. Ecclesiastical career Firmian had prepared for an ecclesiastical career, received his ordination in Rome in 1707 and became provost of the Salzburg chapter in 1713. Pope Clement XI appointed him Bishop of Lavant in 1718, Pope Benedict XIII also made him Bishop of Seckau in 1724. On 4 October 1727 he was elected Archbishop of Salzburg. He had Schloss Klessheim finished and Schloss Leopoldskron erected as his private residence. Firmian saw it as his goal to give the Catholic Church its \\"old power and glory\\". Accordingly, he tried to convert the Protestant minority living in the archbishopric (especially in Pongau) to the Catholic faith - he had Jesuits preach in the village squares, all villagers had to appear at threat of severe penalties. On 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of Martin Luther's nailing of his 95 Theses to the door of the church in Wittenberg, Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion of Protestants declaring that all Protestants in the archbishopric had to recant their non-Catholic beliefs or be banished within days. To enforce his order Firmian brought over 6000 Austrian soldiers to Salzburg. Surprisingly, over twenty thousand of his subjects professed Protestant beliefs and were exiled. Most of those who survived their flight were received by King Frederick William I of Prussia and settled around Gumbinnen in East Prussia. Others found refuge in Hanover, the Netherlands, and the British colony of Georgia. The expulsion drew vehement protests from the Protestant body in the Reichstag and the Protestant countries of Europe. For Salzburg, the expulsion had catastrophic economic consequences. After the expulsion of the Protestants, Firmian divided the Salzburg territory into four mission areas: Augustinian, Capuchin, Benedictine and Franciscan. Firmian completed construction on Schloss Klessheim, he had the Kapitelschwemme and Marstallschwemme redesigned, and constructed the Schloss Leopoldskron for his nephew Franz Laktanz Firmian. Archbishop Firmian is buried at the crypt of Salzburg Cathedral.

Two classes of arabinogalactans are found in nature: plant arabinogalactan and microbial arabinogalactan. In plants, it is a major component of many gums, including gum arabic and gum ghatti. It is often found attached to proteins, and the resulting arabinogalactan protein (AGP) functions as both an intercellular signaling molecule and a glue to seal plant wounds. The microbial arabinogalactan is a major structural component of the mycobacterial cell wall. Both the arabinose and galactose exist solely in the furanose configuration. The galactan portion of microbial arabinogalactan is linear, consisting of approximately 30 units with alternating Œ≤-(1-5) and Œ≤-(1-6) glycosidic linkages. The arabinan chain, which consists of about 30 residues, is attached at three branch points within the galactan chain, believed to be at residues 8, 10 and 12. The arabinan portion of the polymer is a complex branched structure, usually capped with mycolic acids; the arabinan glycosidic linkages are Œ±-(1-3), Œ±-(1-5), and Œ≤-(1-2). The mycobacterial arabinogalactan is recognized by a putative immune lectin intelectin present in chordates. Structure of microbial arabinogalactan The reducing end of microbial arabinogalactan consists of the terminal sequence ‚Üí5)-D-Galf-(1‚Üí4)-L-Rhap-(1‚Üí3)-D-GlcNAc. A muramyl-6-P is also found within the peptidoglycan functional group. The mycolylarabinogalactan of mycobacteria is attached to the peptidoglycan by the actinomycete-specific diglycosylphosphoryl bridge, L-Rhap-(1‚Üí3)-D-GlcNAc-(1‚ÜíP). Arabinogalactan contains a galactan chain, with alternating 5-linked Œ≤-D-galactofuranosyl (Galf) and 6-linked Œ≤-D-Galf residues. The arabinan chains are attached to C-5 of some of the 6-linked Galf residues. There are three major structural domains for arabinan. The first is a domain consisting of linear 5-linked Œ±-D- Araf residues. The second is a domain with branched 3,5 linked Œ±-D-Araf residues substituted with 5-linked Œ±-D-Araf units at both branched positions, and the third is A terminal non-reducing domain for end arabinan consisting of a 3,5-linked Œ±-D-Araf residue substituted at both branched positions with the disaccharide Œ≤-D Araf-(1‚Üí2)- Œ±-D-Araf. These three arabinan chains are attached to the galactan at residues 8, 10, and 12. The non-reducing end of arabinogalactan is covalently attached to the mycolic acids of the outer membrane. The hydrophobicity of mycolic acids is a barrier to drug entry. Additionally, the mycolyl arabinogalactan peptidoglycan is responsible for aspects of disease pathogenesis and much of the antibody response in infections. The mycolyl substituents are selectively and equally distributed on the 5-hydroxyl functions of terminal- and the penultimate 2-linked Araf residues. The mycolyl residues are clustered in groups of four on the non reducing terminal pentaarabinosyl unit (Œ≤-Araf-(1‚Üí2)-Œ±-Araf)2-3,5-Œ±-Araf . Thus, the majority (66%) of the pentaarabinosyl units are substituted by mycolic acids, leaving the minority (33%) available for interaction with the immune system. Approximately one of the three arabinosyl chains attached to the galactan chain contains succinyl groups. Although one succinyl group is most common, up to three succinyl groups per released arabinan fragment can be found on oligo-arabinans. However, arabinan fragments substituted with GalNH2 are not succinylated. Importantly, in the case of M. tuberculosis, and most likely in all slow growing organisms, both positive charge (protonated GalNH2 as GalNH3+) and negative charge (succinyl) are present in the middle regions of the arabinan, specifically at O-2 of the inner 3,5-Œ±-D-Araf units. The succinyl residues are on the non-mycolylated chain. Recently, a complete primary model of arabinogalactan has been proposed.  Commercial applications  Currently, Arabinogalactan is used in many ways.http://arabinogalactan.info/ As an additive in food, animal feed, cosmetic, pharmacy, construction, pulp production, oil production, plant grow, etc. Arabinogalactan can be used as an additive in the way it is or in combination. Arabinogalactan main use is as a replacement for gum arabic, guar gum, and starch in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Using Arabinogalactan leads to more efficient land distribution, leaving more land for agricultural purposes. It plays an essential role in environment preservation, as manufacturers use non-polluting biorefinery processes.

Frank Baum, famous as the creator of the Land of Oz. First published in 1910, the book is the fifth volume in the Aunt Jane's Nieces series, which was the second- greatest success of Baum's literary career, after the Oz books themselves. The novel carries forward the continuing story of the three cousins, Louise Merrick, Beth De Graf, and Patsy Doyle, and their relatives and friends. Like the other books in the series, it was released under the pen name \\"Edith Van Dyne,\\" one of Baum's multiple pseudonyms.\\"Edith Van Dyne,\\" Aunt Jane's Nieces in Society, Chicago, Reilly & Britton, 1910. Theme The book \\"develops a favorite theme of Baum's, the emptiness and artificiality of fashionable life.\\"Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, St. Martin's Press, 2002; p. 154. Throughout Baum's literary canon, but most notably in the Oz books and the Aunt Jane's Nieces series, Baum stresses the fundamental values of simplicity and naturalness as opposed to \\"sophistication.\\"Fred Erisman, \\"L. Frank Baum and the Progressive Dilemma,\\" American Quarterly, Vol. 20 No. 3 (Autumn 1968), pp. 616-23. Characters in the book express pronounced skepticism about the pretensions of high society. Patsy argues that \\"all decent folks\\" are members of society ‚Äì and when another character calls this \\"communism,\\" Patsy agrees, \\"Perhaps so.\\" She continues, > ...certain classes have leagued together and excluded themselves from their > fellows, admitting only those of their own ilk. The people didn't put them > on their pedestals ‚Äì they put themselves there. Yet the people bow down and > worship these social gods and seem glad to have them.Aunt Jane's Nieces in > Society, pp. 57-8. Beth's initial attitude is so negative that her cousin Louise calls her a \\"rank socialist.\\"Aunt Jane's Nieces in Society, p. 68. Synopsis The story begins with a scene between the cousins' patron, Uncle John, and his sister- in-law, Louise's mother. Mrs. Merrick insists that the girls are suffering a disadvantage in not being active in \\"Fashionable Society.\\" Though Uncle John knows that his sister-in-law is a vain and foolish woman, her criticism hits him in his most vulnerable spot; he cannot stand to think that his beloved nieces are lacking any of the good things in life. Uncle John capitalizes on a business contact with Hedrik Von Taer, a fixture of the Four Hundred, the social elite of New York City. The broker asks his daughter Diana Von Taer to sponsor the nieces' debut; Diana, well aware of John Merrick's millions and his importance to her father's business, agrees, as long as the girls are not \\"impossible.\\" Diana calls on the cousins individually; she is struck with Louise's sweetness and classic femininity, Patsy's liveliness, and Beth's beauty (though Diana and Beth dislike each other cordially on first acquaintance), and finds them at least marginally acceptable. Diana sponsors their debut, and all goes well; the cousins are accepted into the social whirl, and are soon managing the flower booth at the year's biggest charity ball. Complications arise with the appearance of Arthur Weldon, the on-again off-again suitor of Louise from previous books. Arthur has been keeping company with Diana Von Taer, but once he sees Louise again his passion for her re-awakens ‚Äì which arouses Diana's jealousy. Diana solicits her cousin Charles Connoldy Mershone, a ne'er-do-well and social black sheep, to pay court to Louise as a way to disrupt her romance with Arthur. Diana doesn't anticipate that Mershone will actually fall in love with Louise ‚Äì but he does. When Louise rejects him for the virtuous Arthur, Mershone goes to the extreme of abducting the young woman and keeping her at Diana's country house (in East Orange, New Jersey, then a rural backwater). Louise's absence impels her family and Arthur to call in the police and hire private detectives ‚Äì one in particular, Quintus Fogerty, \\"the best man in all New York.\\" Mershone is the obvious suspect in Louise's disappearance, but he is too crafty to reveal the missing girl's location. The affair allows the novel to take a look at a harsher and uglier side of contemporaneous social world. Louise is initially shocked and disoriented by her abduction; but after five days she recovers enough to stage an escape. During an \\"old fashioned snowstorm\\" she climbs out a window and down a trellis. She is eventually overcome by the storm, but is rescued by a passing farm couple. Arthur Weldon discovers Louise at the farmer's house, where they are joyfully re-united. Louise's family decides not to prosecute the repentant Mershone, to avoid a newspaper scandal and to eschew the \\"doubtful satisfaction\\" of revenge. The story concludes with the very fashionable wedding of Arthur Weldon and Louise Merrick. In the end, even Beth has modified her attitudes toward the social world: The detective Baum introduces the character of the private detective Quintus Fogerty in this book; the character re-appears in a later volume of the series, Aunt Jane's Nieces on Vacation. Fogerty serves the \\"purpose of extricating the girls when necessary\\"Raylyn Moore, Wonderful Wizard, Marvelous Land, Bowling Green, OH, Bowling Green University Popular Press, 1974; p. 213. from plot difficulties. Critic Fred Erisman has judged Baum's use of this \\"real world\\" character as a tacit admission that the genial milieu of his gentler characters, the cousins and their family, cannot accommodate the darker elements of American society.Erisman, pp. 621-2.

The building was dedicated in 1786 by Francis Asbury, the first Methodist bishop in the United States. After its construction, the church was a center of Methodism: Asbury returned at least three times in the next ten years to lead Annual Conferences at the church. Architecture Rehoboth Church is a vernacular structure, designed using the log framing construction techniques utilized by early settlers in the western reaches of the Virginia Colony. The interior of the church is dominated by the raised pulpit, fashioned from planed timber which allows maximum visibility to both the nave and the galleries. Three sides of the church are lined with galleries which offer additional seating (used as a slave gallery during the antebellum period). A steep fixed ladder in the southwest corner of the nave provides access to the galleries, which are supported by two massive log pillars and small braces set in the side and rear walls of the church. The logs are shaped to a diamond at their ends. Aside from the pulpit, the only furnishings in the church are the pews, crudely constructed from half-sawn logs, and wooden lamp stands. The altar from the church, believed to have been used by Bishop Asbury, is preserved as well. Preservation Built simply of logs hewn from the forest, Rehoboth Church naturally deteriorated as the years passed. Restoration efforts began in 1927, when the entire structure was repaired. By 1930, continuing efforts had seen the erection of a firm shelter for the building: while the original roof was left in place, a large tin roof was set over the entire structure. It has since been recognized by a Methodist church history society, being named a National Methodist Shrine for its place as the most westerly church remaining in its region of the United States built before the Constitution was implemented and the only such church in West Virginia. By the early 1960s, the building was still in sturdy condition, and it was even used periodically for worship services. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 1974. Today, a small museum stands on the site near the church.Rehoboth Church and Museum, General Commission on Archives & History, United Methodist Church, 2008. Accessed 2009-01-02.

Following on from Extreme Survival, Bushcraft was first shown in 2004, and ended in 2005. EpisodesSeries 1= # \\"Aboriginal Britain\\": Mears is based in Great Britain, where he shows how Stone Age hunter-gatherers used the resources around them to feed and clothe themselves. # \\"Jungle Camp\\": Mears sets up a jungle camp in the Amazon rainforest close to a native village, and sees how the Yekuana live in harmony with their environment. He encounters poison dart frogs and climbs into the forest canopy to gain a different perspective on the surroundings. He also offers an insight into the people who inhabit the dense tropical environment # \\"Jungle Trek\\": Mears encounters huge waterfalls, clouds of butterflies on a trek through the Amazon jungle in the shadow of flat-topped mountain formations called tepuis. He then journeys to the huge rock outcrops which inspired The Land That Time Forgot and The Lost World. # \\"Africa Camp\\": Mears makes a return visit to northern Tanzania to spend some more time with the Hadza, sharing a love of bows, tracking and the landscape with true hunter-gatherers whose way of life demonstrates a profound connection to the natural world. This episode was withdrawn by the BBC when the series was repeated in 2019. # \\"Africa Safari\\": Mears fulfils a childhood dream by experiencing a true safari, Maasai-style. He teams up with a Maasai warrior in Tanzania and embarks on a walking safari. As they travel through a valley inhabited by wild animals, he spots a variety of useful plants and ends the day sleeping under the stars. =Series 2= # \\"Birch Bark Canoe\\": As far as Mears is concerned the birch bark canoe is the best vessel man has ever created. He has always wanted to construct one and in this programme he works with Algonquin canoe maker Pinock Smith, one of the few people left who know how to craft them using traditional methods. # \\"Canoe Journey\\": In Mears' view, the canoe is the most natural way to travel and to get close to wild places. To demonstrate this, he paddles down the Missinaibi River, a river as unspoilt today as it was three hundred years ago when it was the essential route for the fur trade canoes. # \\"American Prairies\\": Mears takes a journey into America's past as he travels in the footsteps of Jim Bridger, one of the mountain men who opened up the route to the Pacific Coast of America. Ray makes a bull boat using willow and buffalo skin and spends time with the Shoshone. # \\"Sweden\\": One country where the ancient skills of bushcraft are alive and well and in daily use is Sweden. Mears sees how pine tar is made and used on traditional skis before spending time with the Sami people in the north where he takes a dog sled journey into the snowy wastes. # \\"Four Seasons\\": Mears shows the viewer how bushcraft brings a new perspective on the countryside and its changing seasons. He points out the foods and plants that are available, from pig nuts to lime leaves. He observes wild badgers and deer and explains his interest in sleeping outdoors whenever he can.

Ladd. Published in The Pacific Monthly, Vol 14 No 1, 1905 Sarah Hall Ladd (April 13, 1860 ‚Äì March 30, 1927) was an early 20th-century American pictorial and landscape photographer. Ladd was born Sarah L. Hall in Somerville, Massachusetts, the daughter of John Gill Hall and Sarah Cushing. Little is known about her childhood. On September 7, 1881 she married Charles E. Ladd, a West Coast businessman and son of early Portland (Oregon) mayor William S. Ladd. She then moved to Portland with her new husband, and they soon settled into a very comfortable life with an elegant home overlooking the Willamette River. It is not known how Ladd became interested in photography or if she received any formal training. She joined the Oregon Camera Club in September 1899, and by early 1901 a number of her works were exhibited in San Francisco. In 1902, leading New York photographer Alfred Stieglitz formed the Photo-Secession, a group of American photographers who worked to promote photographic pictorialism, and he listed Ladd as an Associate Member. It is not known how he became aware of her photography or if he had even seen her photographs, since most of those she was then taking did not accord with the pictorial tradition. In 1903, Ladd began taking extended trips on the Columbia River on her friend and fellow photographer Lily White‚Äôs custom-built houseboat, the Raysark, which contained a darkroom. Some of her most famous photographs of the river were included in an exhibition in 2008 at the Portland Art Museum, \\"Wild Beauty: Photographs of the Columbia River Gorge, 1867-1957\\". Ladd had become a successful and highly regarded photographer by the early twentieth century, and many of her photographs were published in The Pacific Monthly magazine (founded by her husband). After about 1904, Ladd‚Äôs other responsibilities took time away from her photography. She assisted her husband when he became involved in the preparations for Portland‚Äôs 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. In 1910, the Ladds moved to Carlton, Oregon, after Charles became president of the Carlton Consolidated Lumber Company. In spite of these additional obligations, Ladd exhibited fourteen photographs at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Ladd became prominent in the Christian Science movement from 1911. After her husband died in 1920, she moved to Carmel, California, in late 1924 to join her long-time friend, Lily White. Ladd died in Carmel on March 30, 1927.

The organisation's goals consist of bringing free education, affordable health care and job training to thousands of families living in several remote villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Existing Projects FIAFED built a primary school, C.S. Les Huit Colombes, in the remote village of Bungu Bungu in Katanga. Prior to building the school in this village of 5,000, 80% of the children did not attend school. This new school had a deep impact on the whole population because it represented a hope for a better future for the families. Since opening in 2005,C.S. Les Huit Colombes has had approximately 2,500 children attending. For the 2008-2009 session, the school had an impressive record of 630 students. The 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years had a big drop in enrollments because of the global economic crisis as more than 300 students decided to quit school to work in plantations to help their laid-off parents. Even though tuition was free, the students simply could not afford to not be working. A health center was also built in Bungu Bungu with the considerable help from Katanga's current governor, Mr. Moise Katumbi. Thousand of lives have been improved have improved through the public health programs initiated by Ir√®ne Maloba Kayembe. Le Centre de Sant√© Moise Katumbi Chapwe was created to help the local villagers gain easy access to affordable health care. This center is equipped with ten beds, one pharmacy, one lab, two bathrooms and two showers. The staff is composed of one doctor, one pharmacist, two nurses and a housekeeper. In 2009, FIAFED completed the construction of its maternity unit, La Maternit√© Robert Levi in Bungu Bungu. This is a groundbreaking event for this community, especially for the women, who need never again give birth inside huts or under a tree. Now these strong mothers will take advantage of a great maternity center as do other women around the Katanga province. In 2010, FIAFED opened its second primary school in the province of Katanga: E.P. Princ√®sse Onda Onda Numbi. Several prominent business leaders contributed to FIAFED's efforts including Governor Moise Katumbi of Katanga who donated 100 brand new desks made exclusively for the school and Albert Yuma President of the Chamber of Commerce and Executive Director at TEXAF who donated 100 new school uniforms to the organization. This is the first modern school ever built in the village of Djino. Training Disadvantaged Women Job training is an important activity inside FIAFED. With the help of experienced FIAFED and IMEXIN staff members, teen mothers, single mothers, widows and other disadvantaged women have enrolled in this free six-month program to get intensive training on computer applications, empowering them to become financially independent. Under the leadership of Ir√®ne Maloba Kayembe, FIAFED also offers a free cutting and sewing program to women in Kinshasa, the capital city, in its headquarters in Kintambo teaching how to cut, assemble, and finish all kinds of clothing. In addition to providing women with new skills, this successful program is designed to leave them a margin of creativity crucial to a good self-image and confidence.

A large and attractive palm, it has been planted throughout the tropics and subtropics as an ornamental tree. Although it is sometimes called R. elata, the conserved name R. regia is now the correct name for the species. The royal palm reaches heights from 50 to over 80 feet tall. Populations in Cuba and Florida were long seen as separate species, but are now considered to belong to a single species. Best known as an ornamental, R. regia is also used as a source of thatch, construction timber, and in some forms of so-called traditional medicine, although there is currently no valid scientific evidence to support the efficacy or use of any palm species for medicinal purposes. The fruit is eaten by birds and bats (which disperse the seeds) and fed to livestock. Its flowers are visited by birds and bats, and it serves as a roosting site and food source for a variety of animals. Roystonea regia is the national tree of Cuba, and has a religious role both in Santer√≠a and Christianity, where it is used in Palm Sunday observances. Description Worm eye view of a mature Royal palm thumb The distinctive smooth crownshaft and rows of circular leaf scars are clearly visible. Roystonea regia is a large palm which reaches a height of tall, (with heights up to reported) and a stem diameter of about . (K. F. Connor reports a maximum stem diameter of .) The trunk is stout, very smooth and grey-white in colour with a characteristic bulge below a distinctive green crownshaft. Trees have about 15 leaves which can be up to long. The flowers are white with pinkish anthers. The fruit are spheroid to ellipsoid in shape, long and wide. They are green when immature, turning red and eventually purplish-black as they mature. Root nodules containing Rhizobium bacteria have been found on R. regia trees in India. The presence of rhizobia-containing root nodules is usually associated with nitrogen fixation in legumes; this was the first record of root nodules in a monocotyledonous tree. Further evidence of nitrogen fixation was provided by the presence of nitrogenase (an enzyme used in nitrogen fixation) and leghaemoglobin, a compound which allows nitrogenase to function by reducing the oxygen concentration in the root nodule. In addition to evidence of nitrogen fixation, the nodules were also found to be producing indole acetic acid, an important plant hormone. Taxonomy Roystonea is placed in the subfamily Arecoideae and the tribe Roystoneae. The placement Roystonea within the Arecoideae is uncertain; a phylogeny based on plastid DNA failed to resolve the position of the genus within the Arecoideae. As of 2008, there appear to be no molecular phylogenetic studies of Roystonea and the relationship between R. regia and the rest of the genus is uncertain. The species was first described by American naturalist William Bartram in 1791 as Palma elata based on trees growing in central Florida. In 1816 German botanist Carl Sigismund Kunth described the species Oreodoxa regia based on collections made by Alexander von Humboldt and Aim√© Bonpland in Cuba. In 1825 German botanist Curt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel moved it to the genus Oenocarpus and renamed it O. regius. The genus Oreodoxa was proposed by German botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1807 and applied by him to two species, O. acuminata (now known as Prestoea acuminata) and O. praemorsa (now Wettinia praemorsa). Although these species were transferred to other genera, the genus Oreodoxa continued to be applied to a variety of superficially similar species which were not, in fact, closely related. To address this problem, American botanist Orator F. Cook created the genus Roystonea, which he named in honour of American general Roy Stone, and renamed Kunth's species Roystonea regia. Cuban royal palm (Roystonea regia) in Aburi, Ghana Stem base of two individuals in Kolkata showing fibrous roots typical of monocots. Cook considered Floridian populations to be distinct from both the Cuba R. regia and the Puerto Rican R. borinquena, and he placed them in a new species, R. floridana, which is now considered a synonym of R. regia. In 1906 Charles Henry Wright described two new species based on collections from Georgetown, British Guiana (now Guyana) which he placed in the genus Euterpe ‚Äî E. jenmanii and E. ventricosa. Both species are now considered synonyms of R. regia. The name R. regia var. hondurensis was applied by Paul H. Allen to Central American populations of the species. However, Scott Zona determined that they did not differ enough from Cuban populations to be considered a separate variety. Based on the rules of botanical nomenclature, the oldest properly published name for a species has priority over newer names. Bartram applied the Linnaean binomial Palma elata to a \\"large, solitary palm with an ashen white trunk topped by a green leaf sheath [the crownshaft] and pinnate leaves\\" growing in central Florida. While no type collection is known, there are no other native palms that would fit Bartram's description. In 1946 Francis Harper pointed out that Bartram's name was valid and proposed a new combination, Roystonea elata. Liberty Hyde Bailey's use of the name in his 1949 revision of the genus, established its usage. Harper's new combination immediately supplanted Cook's R. floridana, but there was disagreement as to whether Cuban and Floridian populations represented a single species or two species. Zona's revision of the genus concluded that they both belonged to the same species. According to the rules of botanical nomenclature, the correct name of the species should have been Roystonea elata. Zona pointed out, however, that the name R. regia (or Oreodoxa regia) has a history of use in horticulture that dated from at least 1838, and that the species had been propagated around the world under that name. Roystonea elata, on the other hand, had only been used since 1949, and was used much less widely. On that basis, Zona proposed that the name Roystonea regia should be conserved. =Common names= In cultivation, Roystonea regia is called the Cuban royal palm or simply the royal palm. In Cuba, the tree is called the palma real or palma criolla. In India, where it is widely cultivated, it is called vakka. In Cambodia, where it is planted as decorative along avenues and in public parks, it is known as sla barang' (\\"Western palm\\"). Reproduction and growth A pair of trees in Kolkata. Alongside on the ground is a freshly shed leaf with the sheath still green. shedding of leaf in Royal palm Roystonea regia produces unisexual flowers that are pollinated by animals. European honey bees and bats are reported pollinators. Seeds are dispersed by birds and bats that feed upon the fruit. Seed germination is adjacent ligular‚Äîduring germination, as the cotyledon expands it only pushes a portion of the embryo out of the seed. As a result, the seedling develops adjacent to the seed. The embryo forms a ligule, and the plumule protrudes from this. Seedlings in cultivation are reported to begin producing a stem two years after germination, at the point where they produce their thirteenth leaf. Growth rates of seedlings averaged per year in Florida.Jones, Julie Lynn. 1983. An Ecological Study of the Florida Royal Palm, Roystonea elata. M.S. Thesis. Florida Atlantic University. Distribution Roystonea regia is found in Central America, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Hispaniola, the Lesser Antilles, The Bahamas, southern Florida, and Mexico (Veracruz, Cabo San Lucas, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Yucat√°n).Zona, S. 1996. Roystonea (Arecaceae: Arecoideae). Flora Neotropica 71: 1‚Äì36. William Bartram described the species from Lake Dexter, along the St. Johns River in the area of modern Lake and Volusia Counties in central Florida, an area north of its modern range. It is also a popular ornamental tree in the Canary Islands. Today Roystonea is cultivated in tropical and subtropical climates in the United States, Australia, Brazil, and parts of southern Asia as a landscape palm. In the United States it grows mostly in central and southern Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and in small numbers in South Texas in the Rio Grande Valley and southern California.Simon Gardner, Pindar Sidisunthorn and Lai Ee May, 2011. Heritage Trees of Penang. Penang: Areca Books. Botanical garden Aswan, Egypt Ecology The leaves of Roystonea regia are used as roosting sites by Eumops floridanus, the Florida bonneted bat, and is used as a retreat for Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentriolalis), a non-native species, in Florida. In Panama (where R. regia is introduced), its trunks are used as nesting sites by yellow-crowned parrots (Amazona ochrocephala panamensis). The flowers of R. regia are visited by pollen-collecting bees and are considered a good source of nectar. Its pollen was also found in the stomachs of Phyllonycteris poeyi, the Cuban flower bat (a pollen-feeder) and Monophyllus redmani, Leach's single leaf bat (a nectar- feeder). Artibeus jamaicensis, the Jamaican fruit bat, and Myiozetetes similis, the social flycatcher, feed on the fruit. Roystonea regia is the host plant for the royal palm bug, Xylastodoris luteolus, in Florida. It also serves as a larval host plant for the butterflies Pyrrhocalles antiqua orientis and Asbolis capucinus in Cuba, and Brassolis astyra and B. sophorae in Brazil. It is susceptible to bud rot caused by the oomycete Phytophthora palmivora and by the fungus Thielaviopsis paradoxa. The species is considered an invasive species in secondary forest in Panama. Uses Roystonea regia has been planted throughout the tropics and subtropics as an ornamental. The seed is used as a source of oil and for livestock feed. Leaves are used for thatching and the wood for construction. The roots are used as a diuretic, and for that reason they are added to tifey, a Haitian drink, by Cubans of Haitian origin. They are also used as a treatment for diabetes. Fibres extracted from the leaf sheath of R. regia have been found to be comparable with sisal and banana fibres, but lower in density, making it a potentially useful source for the use in lightweight composite materials. An extract from R. regia fruit known as D-004 reduces benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) in rodents. D-004, is a mixture of fatty acids, is being studied as a potential alternative to finasteride for the treatment of BPH. =Religious significance= Roystonea regia plays an important role in popular religion in Cuba. In Santer√≠a it is associated primarily with Shango or with his father Aggay√∫. It also has symbolic importance in the Palo faiths and the Abaku√° fraternity. In Roman Catholicism, R. regia plays an important role in Palm Sunday observances.

It is an \\"enduring (and illegal) practice\\" according to The New York Times journalist Katie Rogers, \\"believed to be part of a yearly tradition, often carried out by bored teenagers looking for an easy prank.\\" The prevalence of such thefts has caused the owners of outdoor manger scenes to protect their property with GPS devices, surveillance cameras, or by other means. Incidents Dozens of communities across America have suffered thefts of Baby Jesus figurines, and, in some instances, entire nativity scenes, Washington, D.C., journalist Daniel Nasaw reports for the British newspaper The Guardian. He observes that it is unclear whether such theft is on the rise, as it is not tracked by federal law enforcement. In 2008, a Baby Jesus was stolen from First United Methodist Church in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, and replaced with a pumpkin, and, in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, a thief not only stole the Baby Jesus from a public display but absconded with the concrete block and chain that was supposed to act as a deterrent. Some communities suffer repeat Baby Jesus thefts. A Baby Jesus was stolen in December 2008 from a Stony Point, New York, town display. A town official remarked, \\"If someone did it as a prank, I don't find it funny.\\" The nativity had been vandalized the year before, and a menorah next to it had been toppled and broken. During some Christmases of the first decade of the 21st century, the Baby Jesus statue was often stolen from the outdoor nativity scene in J√∂nk√∂ping in Sweden, once thrown into the nearby lake of V√§ttern. This has led to the nativity scene, resembling a wooden stable, being closed by nights. In December 2015, as many as five Baby Jesus statues were stolen from the lawns of churches in northern New Jersey. Some figurines have been defaced with profanity or Satanic symbols. In December 2008, for example, a fiberglass Baby Jesus valued at US$375 was stolen from a Eureka Springs, Arkansas, park and later recovered, but had been defaced by racial slurs, a swastika, and a Hitler mustache. The eyes were also blacked out and pieces had been broken off, rendering it damaged beyond repair. In his autobiography, The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, Marilyn Manson admitted playing a prank in which he and a few friends stole figurines of Jesus then replaced them with hams. They sent a communique to a newspaper posing as a black radical group saying that it was a protest against \\"the plasticisation of the black man's wisdom with the so-called 'White Christmas'.\\" Security measures Some nativity display owners have taken measures to secure their property against would-be thieves. Others are reluctant to exercise such vigilance. One man in the state of Indiana who suffered the loss of his Baby Jesus figurine rebuffed suggestions to secure the figurines on his porch because, \\"that would be like putting Jesus in jail\\". Traditional security measures are not always foolproof. The Baby Jesus fastened to the National Christmas Creche at Independence Hall disappeared within days. Some communities, churches, and citizens are employing electronic technology to protect their property. A Texas family, for example, positioned surveillance cameras in their yard and discovered a teenage girl stealing their Baby Jesus figurine, valued at nearly US$500. In 2008, a security device distributor offered its surveillance cameras and GPS devices to 200 non-profit religious institutions for a month's use gratis. GPS protection has met with some success. In one case, after a life-size ceramic nativity figurine disappeared from the lawn of a community center in Wellington, Florida, sheriff's deputies tracked it to an apartment where it was found lying face-down on a carpet. An 18-year-old woman was arrested. Perspectives While Baby Jesus thefts are largely regarded as pranks, they are set apart by the involvement of a religious icon. \\"They think it's a prank, but it isn't a prank to some of these people,\\" Pennsylvania state police Corporal Paul Romanic told The Morning Call newspaper, in regards to an incident in which ten nativity scene figures were found in a yard after being stolen from across Bucks County, Pennsylvania. \\"Plus, it's just wrong to steal the baby Jesus.\\" Some have wondered if an anti-Christian sentiment lurks behind the thefts. Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund), a Christian legal group, stated, \\"I suspect most of it is childish pranks. Clearly, there are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas. But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion.\\" Stephen Nissenbaum, the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor, views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes. Nissenbaum writes that, \\"What it means is that it's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms, as long as real human harm isn't being done. It's not exactly devaluing Christianity, but it is sort of a ritualized challenge to it. It could be Christian kids doing it--and on January 2 they become good Christians again.\\" Historian Daniel Silliman has argued that, whatever the thieves' intention, the act puts the culture of Christmas in a different light. \\"Baby Jesus thieves literally take the Christ out of Christmas,\\" Silliman writes. \\"When they do, it becomes apparent that the sacred object is also a piece of property, protected by the law that protects property and this whole apparatus that defends Christmas: fences and lights, tracking devices and private security companies, patrolling police and the courts. The commercialization of Christmas is visible here in a way it might not be, otherwise. That's the power of the joke.\\" In drama In \\"The Big Little Jesus,\\" the December 24, 1953 episode of the television series Dragnet, Sgts. Friday and Smith are called upon to investigate the theft of a Baby Jesus from a church nativity display on Christmas Eve. Unable to solve the crime, the officers tell the priest that Mass must be celebrated without the Baby Jesus. The figurine is restored when a boy arrives with it in a wagon. He tells the officers that he had vowed that if he got a wagon for Christmas, Baby Jesus would have the first ride.

Owned and operated by AES Hawaii, the plant is the only coal-fired power plant in the state of Hawaii, and is the state's leading single source of toxic pollutants. AES Hawaii consists of a single unit on the grounds of Campbell Industrial Park, has a year-around capacity of 180 MWe, and in 2006 represented about 11% of Oahu's commercial electricity supply. The plant is expected to close by September 2022. Coal supply AES Hawaii burns approximately 650,000 tons of subbituminous coal each year. The coal is imported from Indonesia via a marine terminal at the Barbers Point Harbor. From there, coal is taken to the plant by a long conveyor system. Alternate fuel sources AES uses alternate fuel sources, such as old tires and used motor oil, to help power the plant. The plant also burns carbon from Board of Water Supply filters. In addition, the ash waste product created by AES is used in concrete mixes. In negotiations between Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) and AES in 2014, it was asked that the plant be converted to run partly on biomass.HECO asking regulators for more time to negotiate agreement with Hawaii's only coal plant, Duane Shimogawa, Pacific Business News, December 22, 2014 Environmental impact AES introduces limestone early into the coal-combustion process, filtering out harmful sulfur dioxide early. Most coal plants use industrial scrubbers to remove harmful pollutants late in the combustion process, which have a higher cost, but are much more efficient, removing as much as 98% of SO2, compared to the 75% removal rate at AES.http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/air/epss.nsf/735056a63c1390e08825657e0075d180/e403abb6b68d1c8c0a25657500838c22!OpenDocumenthttp://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/03/NOxSO2/06-Klitzke%20Sidwell%20Jensen%20presentation%20Part%20123.pdf According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data, the AES plant was the leading source of toxic pollutants in the State of Hawaii, producing in toxic releases in 2013. This represented a pollutant increase for the plant of more than 100% from 2012. Coal tax break In July 2015, it was learned that the state approved a special tax exemption for coal that was acknowledged to be for the benefit of AES.

It is headquartered in Cairo, Egypt. Afreximbank's vision is to be the trade finance bank for Africa. Afreximbank's mission statement is: \\"To stimulate a consistent expansion and diversification of African trade, to rapidly increase Africa's share of global trade, and in doing so, to operate as a first-class, profit-oriented, socially responsible financial institution and a 'Centre of Excellence in African Trade Matters.'‚Äù Afreximbank's mandate is to finance and promote intra- and extra-African trade using three broad services: # Credit (Trade finance and Project finance) # Risk Bearing (Guarantees and Credit Insurance) # Trade Information and Advisory Services Afreximbank has 50 African member-countries. As of June 2020, the bank had four regional locations and is in the final stages of establishing a fifth regional office for Central Africa. The regional offices are: *Harare: managing the southern African countries *Abidjan: managing francophone western and central African countries *Abuja: managing anglophone western African countries *Kampala: managing the countries in eastern Africa * Yaounde: managing the countries in Central Africa.  History  Afreximbank was established in 1993. The agreement establishing the bank was signed by member states in Abidjan on 8 May 1993 and conferred the bank the status of an international organization with full juridical personality under the laws of the participating states. Under the agreement, participating states grant to the bank in their territories, certain immunities, exemptions, privileges, and concessions to facilitate the bank business in those territories. = Afreximbank charter = The Afreximbank charter was adopted in Abuja, Nigeria, on October 1993, and its provisions regulate the bank as a corporate body. Afreximbank works with African and non-African export credit agencies, development finance institutions, commercial banks and other multilateral institutions to support trade finance activities in Africa. Afreximbank began with a start-up raised capital of US$750 million in 1993, but the authorized share capital of the bank was increased to US$5 billion on 8 December 2012.  Shareholding structure  , the bank's shareholders, totaling 146, were divided into four categories: * Class \\"A\\" Shareholders - African governments, African central banks, African development banks and African economic organisations. * Class \\"B\\" Shareholders - African private investors and African national financial institutions. * Class \\"C\\" Shareholders - International financial institutions, export credit agencies, and non-African private sector firms * Class \\"D\\" Shareholders - Open to subscription by any investor, African or non-African. Recent developments Afreximbank postpones planned initial public offering (IPO) = In October 2019, Afreximbank postponed its planned IPO, valued at US$250 million at the London Stock Exchange, citing ‚Äòunfavourable market conditions‚Äô. = MANSA = Afreximbank has partnered with the African Development Bank, African Central Banks, and other international and national strategic partners to launch MANSA, a collaborative CDD/KYC information repository platform with a special emphasis on African financial institutions and corporate to enable global institutions, partners and counter-parties to access African entities‚Äô CDD profiles and information as well as leverage the platform to conduct customer due diligence on African entities; financial institutions, corporate and SME. = Intra African Trade Fair (IATF) = In December 2018, Afreximbank held the First Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2018) which took place in Cairo, Egypt. IATF2018 attracted more than 1,000 exhibitors from 45 countries and across 20 sectors, generating over $32 billion in deals, some of which Afreximbank has already financed. The IATF provides a platform for businesses to share trade, investment, and market information and for buyers and sellers, investors and countries to conclude business deals. The second Intra-African Trade Fair (IATF2020) will take place in Kigali from 01-07 September 2020, targeting the execution of intra-African trade deals worth more than $40 billion. = Trade Facilitation Programme = Afreximbank launched its Trade Facilitation Programme in August 2018 to African banks. = FEDA = Afreximbank has established FEDA, the Fund for Export Development in Africa, as a subsidiary that will catalyze foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into Africa's trade and export sectors. Afreximbank's equity investment is expected to aim to drive four times that amount of FDI. FEDA will provide investors with the same protections, immunities and privileges available to the Afreximbank and will also give them access to tax privileges and incentives. The fund will, furthermore, make it possible for more financing to come to Africa through the expansion of its guarantee offering, including the Intra-African Investment Guarantee Facility. = AFTRAF = The Afreximbank Trade Facilitation Programme was introduced in 2018 to enhance the confidence of counterparties in the settlement of international trade transactions and to improve correspondent banking relationships. It supports critical imports into Africa, boosts intra-African trade, and facilitates the purchase of equipment for the production of export goods. It provides trade confirmation services, trade confirmation guarantees, and irrevocable reimbursement undertakings. It is designed to counter the reduction or withdrawal of trade lines to African banks by international banks. It enables local banks to meet international compliance requirements and use the trade confirmation guarantee facility to expand their correspondent banking relationships. = FECONTRAF = Afreximbank's Food Emergency Contingent Trade Financing Facility (FECONTRAF) enables physical food (grains) reserves to be substituted with a standby facility allowing vulnerable African countries to finance the commercial imports of grains, or their staple food of choice, if they have a food emergency. It guarantees the availability of an import financing facility in the event of a crisis when access to trade financial markets may be more stringent for the country. = Medical centre of excellence = The Medical Centre of Excellence, planned for construction by Afreximbank in Nigeria, beginning in December 2019, will have a major impact in reducing the foreign exchange cost incurred by Africans when traveling outside the continent to seek medical care, thereby also keeping medical tourism within the continent. More than 300,000 Africans travel annually to India alone for medical services, spending more than $2 billion each year. The Bank's Health and Medical Tourism Programme, working with partners like Kings College Hospital, London, is designed to foster the emergence of world-class medical facilities and research centers across Africa, which will improve life expectancy as well as stem the outflow of billions in scarce foreign exchange.

In Wild Food Documentary, Ray presents an informative guide to cookery, travelling across the world to demonstrate traditional cooking skills and cuisine. Episodes #\\"Australia\\": Ray travels to the other side of the planet to hear from Australian Aboriginals about what food means to a hunter-gatherer and the role it plays in their culture as well as their society. Along with many other discoveries, the trip sees Ray sample that most iconic of 'bush tucker': the witchetty grub, a huge maggot that lives in the roots of the witchetty bush. #\\"Coast\\": Ray finds out just what Britain's coast had to offer our ancestors, as he continues to explore the wild food that tickled the taste buds of Stone Age man. The coastline of Stone Age Britain was rather different from today, as Britain was yet to become an island. #\\"Wetlands\\": Ray and Professor Gordon Hillman, an expert in the use of plants through the ages, look at the marshes and waterways which our ancestors used for travelling and as an abundant source of food. Along the way, Ray explains how to take the sting out of nettles and how to use water lily seeds as a source of carbohydrate. He then travels to the spectacular Ardeche Gorge in France where he gains special permission to take to his canoe and demonstrate spear fishing. #\\"Summer Harvest\\": Summer Harvest shows that our ancestors would have had access to a wide variety of plant foods, but meat would have been the staple in their diet. Ray shows viewers how they would have cooked a deer in a huge pit and then demonstrates how they would have preserved the meat by smoking it. #\\"Woodland\\": For our ancestors, Autumn would have been the last chance to gather food before winter stole much of it away. Nuts are an obvious source of stored energy. Ray travels to the island of Colonsay in Scotland to investigate the remains of thousands of charred hazelnuts which date back to the Stone Age.

In an aquarium, they are generally peaceful, and tend not to bother other fishes, even those much smaller than they are although they are susceptible to be bullied by larger more boisterous fish. They prefer cooler water (76 ¬∞F/24.4 ¬∞C at most, although higher temps are tolerated in the short term providing oxygen levels do not drop). Gentle water flow is preferred and be sure to use a soft substrate as this fish has sensitive bristles which is uses whilst foraging. Oreichthys cosuatis is found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. This fish favours slow flowing areas of rivers with dense vegetation and clear water. This fish reaches around 40mm with the male growing slightly larger than the females, slightly more colourful and they have an extended dorsal fin References Category:Tropical fish Category:Oreichthys Category:Fish described in 1822 Category:Fish of Bangladesh Category:Fish of Myanmar Category:Fish of India Category:Fish of Thailand ","title":"Oreichthys cosuatis"},{"id":"20933011","text":"\\"Save the Life of My Child\\" is a song by American music duo Simon & Garfunkel from their fourth studio album, Bookends (1968).

College wrestler A native of Cresco, Iowa, Nichols attended the University of Michigan to wrestle under legendary wrestling coach, Cliff Keen. While at Michigan, Nichols won the NCAA wrestling championship of 1939 in the 145-pound weight class. He interrupted his college studies to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II as a pilot, reaching the rank of Lieutenant. After the war, he received a master's degree at the University of Illinois and a doctorate at Michigan. Wrestling coachArkansas State= After finishing his schooling, Nichols began his coaching career at Arkansas State in 1948. The school did not have a wrestling program yet so he served as an assistant in football and basketball and the head coach in track & field as well as swimming. In 1949 he was able to implement a wrestling program and amass a 37-18-3 record in five seasons. =Iowa State= When Hugo Otopalik unexpectedly died in 1953, Harold Nichols was the only person Iowa State interviewed to replace him. He would go on to helm the Iowa State wrestling program for 32 years.

He enlisted in the French Army during the reign of Louis XVI and fought in the American Revolutionary War. Appointed an officer at the start of the French Revolutionary Wars, he rose in rank to become a general officer by 1799. From 1805 to 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars, he led a brigade in the Grande Arm√©e at Dornbirn, Jena, Ko≈ÇozƒÖb, Golymin, and Eylau. After promotion he commanded a division in the thick of the action at Friedland in 1807. In 1808, Napoleon ennobled Lapisse and transferred him to Spain where he led his division at Espinosa. Detailed to lead one of three columns that were invade Portugal, he was completely outmaneuvered by an inferior force. He surprised and defeated a British infantry division in the Casa de Salinas action, but was mortally wounded the following day during heavy fighting at Talavera. Lapisse is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 37. Early career Lapisse was born into the family of a tapestry weaver in Lyons on 25 November 1762. He enlisted on 5 April 1779 in the Armagnac Infantry Regiment, which had been created by splitting it from the old Navarre Regiment. He fought with the unit in the American Revolutionary War and was promoted to sergeant in 1784. French Revolution After the outbreak of the French Revolution Lapisse was named lieutenant in the Corsican Chasseurs Free Company on 19 December 1789. This unit was incorporated into the 16th Light Infantry Battalion. On 9 May 1793 he was promoted adjutant major when the battalion was expanded into the 16th Light Infantry Demi-brigade. He became captain on 2 August 1793 and chef de bataillon (major) on 22 March 1794. In this period Lapisse served in Corsica, including the Siege of Bastia during which he was wounded. He then fought against the Kingdom of Piedmont and was promoted chef de brigade (colonel) on 26 March 1795. He was wounded at Ormea. On 8 November 1795 he was named the commander of the 83rd Line Infantry Demi-brigade. At the beginning of 1796 the 83rd was part of Andr√© Mouret's 1st Division of the Coast in the Army of Italy. After the Second Amalgame in May 1796, the 83rd became the 57th Line Infantry Demi-brigade with Lapisse as chef de brigade on 19 June 1796. The demi-brigade fought at the Battle of La Favorita which took place on 16 January 1797 and was part of the Battle of Rivoli. The 57th also participated in the spring campaign in Carinthia including the Battle of Valvasone on 16 March 1797. In 1798, Lapisse and the 57th were assigned first to the Army of England and later to the Army of Mainz. On 10 June 1799 he was appointed chef de brigade of the 36th Line Infantry Demi-brigade. In mid-September that year, the 36th was part of Jean-de-Dieu Soult's division in Andr√© Mass√©na's army in Switzerland. During the Second Battle of Zurich on 25 September 1799, Soult launched a surprise assault crossing of the Linth River while the French main body under Andr√© Mass√©na attacked the Russians at Zurich. The Austrian commander on the Linth, Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze was killed and his command defeated. Lapisse received a battlefield promotion to general of brigade on 26 September 1799. Subsequently, Lapisse fought with the Army of Italy under Guillaume Brune and Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey. On 12 January 1801 he had his horse killed under him at Castelfranco Veneto while leading the 1st Brigade of the Advance Guard. After the peace he commanded French troops in Liguria from 1801 to 1803. He became a member of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803. EmpireUlm to Friedland= Lapisse became a Commander of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 14 June 1804. That year he was appointed to command a brigade in the 1st Division in Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps at Brest. The 1st Division was present at the Capitulation of Dornbirn on 13 November 1805 when Franz Jellacic surrendered an Austrian division numbering three generals, 160 officers and 3,895 soldiers to Augereau. At the Battle of Jena on 14 October 1806, Lapisse led a brigade in Jacques Desjardin's 1st Division of VII Corps. The unit included four battalions of the 16th Light Infantry Regiment. On 24 December, Desjardin's division secured a bridgehead on the Wkra River at Ko≈ÇozƒÖb against strong Russian resistance. While this struggle was taking place, Lapisse took a task force downstream, surprised the bridge guard at Pruszkowo and gained an additional crossing. He fought at the Battle of Golymin and was promoted to general of division a few days later on 30 December 1806. In February 1807, he led his brigade at the Battle of Eylau where the VII Corps suffered very heavy losses. Ordered to attack the Russian left flank, Augereau's men soon disappeared into a blizzard. Losing their sense of direction, the corps instead assaulted the enemy center which was defended by a 70-gun battery. Crushed by artillery fire and ridden down by Russian cavalry the survivors fled. The shattered corps was later broken up and its units redistributed throughout the army. At the Battle of Friedland, Lapisse commanded the 2nd Division in Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's I Corps. The division included two battalions each of the 16th Light, 8th Line, 45th Line, and 54th Line Infantry Regiments. Michel Ney's VI Corps started the French attack from the right flank. When Ney's soldiers faltered, Emperor Napoleon committed the I Corps from the army reserve. As Victor's troops drove a wedge into the Russian center, Ney's corps returned to the attack on their right. Aided by Victor's exceptionally well-handled corps artillery, the French defeated the Russian Imperial Guard and fought their way into Friedland, ending the battle. =Spain= Claude Perrin Victor In 1808 Lapisse was made a Baron of the Empire with the title Sainte-H√©l√®ne and received the Order of the Iron Crown. By October of that year, Victor's I Corps was transferred to Spain to fight in the Peninsular War. Lapisse commanded the 2nd Division, made up of the same regiments as at Friedland, only with three battalions each. Lapisse fought at the Battle of Espinosa de los Monteros on 10 and 11 November 1808. On the 10th Eug√®ne-Casimir Villatte recklessly threw his division at the Spanish army of Joaqu√≠n Blake y Joyes without waiting for Victor's other two divisions to arrive. The attack fell on the Division of the North which had recently escaped from Denmark and was repulsed. When Victor came up with his other two divisions, he sent one regiment of Lapisse's division and one brigade of Francois Amable Ruffin's division against the same defenders. Though Blake had to send reinforcements, the Spanish were able to drive off the French attackers. On the 11th Victor reasoned that Blake would expect his right flank to be attacked again, the same as the previous day. On this day, Lapisse launched an assault on the Spanish left flank on a very high ridge. This time the defenders were not of the same quality as the Division of the North. After their division commander and two brigadiers were wounded, the Spanish troops bolted for the rear. One of Lapisse's brigadiers, Nicolas Joseph Maison wheeled his troops against Blake's center just as Victor ordered a frontal attack by the rest of I Corps. The Spanish army disintegrated and took to the hills. Victor lost about 1,000 killed and wounded. The Division of the North suffered about 1,000 casualties while Blake's total losses were about 3,000. On 1 January 1809 Emperor Napoleon ordered Lapisse to detach from I Corps and operate in the Province of Le√≥n. Two brigades of cavalry under Archange Louis Rioult-Davenay and Pierre-Honor√©-Anne Maupetit were assigned to Lapisse's force. Despite Victor's pleas to return his 2nd Division, King Joseph Bonaparte obstinately refused. French General of Division Instead, Napoleon planned on launching an invasion of Portugal from three directions, with Soult and 20,000 men overrunning the north, Lapisse with 9,000 troops advancing from the east, and Victor pushing in from the south. Robert Thomas Wilson's aggressive use of his 1,200 Portuguese regular troops completely fooled Lapisse, who became convinced that he was outnumbered and halted his advance. Baffled by Wilson's maneuvers, he was withdrawn and ordered to rejoin Victor. On 14 May 1809 Lapisse brushed aside Colonel Mayne's 1,850 Portuguese regulars and militia in the Battle of Alcantara in Extremadura. Lapisse's 2nd Division and a brigade of dragoons were engaged, a total of 9,500 soldiers and 12 guns. The Portuguese lost 250 men while French casualties were described as light. Lapisse's men sacked the town before rendezvousing with Victor at M√©rida. Two days before, the British army of Arthur Wellesley's won a victory over Soult's corps at the Second Battle of Porto and chased him out of Portugal. So ended the second unsuccessful French invasion of that nation. On 27 July 1809, as Victor pursued Gregorio Garc√≠a de la Cuesta's Spanish army, Arthur Wellesley's British troops attempted to cover their retreat across the Alberche River. Having successfully overseen the withdrawal of the Spanish infantry, Alexander Randoll Mackenzie's British 3rd Division pulled back to the west bank. The British cavalry had been withdrawn because it was useless in the wooded area near the Casa de Salinas in which Mackenzie's troops were situated. Lapisse's division crossed the Alberche farther north undetected and was able to get close to the British formation because its pickets were badly posted. Wellesley was there in person and even he was completely taken by surprise as Lapisse's division rolled forward against Mackenzie's left flank. With the 16th Light Infantry in the front line with the other three regiments in support, the French fell on Rufane Shaw Donkin's brigade, breaking the 2nd Battalion of the 87th Foot, 1st Battalion of the 88th Foot and 2nd Battalion of the 31st Foot and taking 80 prisoners. The 1st Battalion of the 45th Foot and a half-battalion of the 60th Foot held firm and covered the retreat of the beaten units. Though Lapisse aggressively pressed forward, Mackenzie's division was able to fall back to the main position in good order well- protected by the 14th Light Dragoons and the 1st Light Dragoons of the King's German Legion (KGL). However, the Casa de Salinas action cost the British 447 casualties, including 70 killed, 284 wounded, and 93 missing. The 87th alone lost 198 casualties. Lapisse's losses were probably less than 100. On 28 July 1809 at the Battle of Talavera, Lapisse's 6,862-strong division consisted of the same organization as at Espinosa. At 2:00 pm, 80 French cannons began firing on the British infantry positions, inflicting losses. The fire of the 30 British and six Spanish field pieces was quickly suppressed. Lapisse advanced together with the divisions of Horace Fran√ßois Bastien, baron S√©bastiani and Jean Fran√ßois Leval. The Dutch-German division of Leval on the left struck the British line first and was defeated; a second attack later in the day met the same fate. At about 3:00 pm, S√©bastiani in the center and Lapisse on the right closed with John Coape Sherbrooke's British-KGL division. Each French division was 12 battalions strong with the front line deployed in column of divisions and the rear line in column of battalions. Lapisse's front line consisted of Jean-Gregoire Laplane's brigade, the 16th Light and the 45th Line. In front of Lapisse were two KGL brigades under Ernst Langwerth and Sigismund L√∂w plus the 2nd Battalion of the 83rd Foot. The French skirmish line pressed back the less numerous skirmishers of their enemies. Despite taking losses from musketry, Sherbrooke's troops waited until the French were within then fired a murderous volley. The French infantry were cut down in hundreds and the survivors took to their heels with their enemies in pursuit. However, the British Guards and KGL units went too far and when they came up against the intact French second line, they were defeated. The troops facing Lapisse were badly mauled; the 2nd KGL Infantry Battalion sustained 387 casualties in 20 minutes and the 5th KGL lost over 100 men captured. Langwerth was killed. The divisions of S√©bastiani and Lapisse again advanced into contact with the British line, into which Wellesley threw his reserves. Soon a terrific firefight raged. After losing 1,700 men and inflicting about the same number, the French fell back, their attack beaten. Lapisse was fatally wounded during the attack. He died at Santa Olalla two days later. LAPISSE is engraved on Column 37 of the Arc de Triomphe.See Arc de Triomphe photo.

In 1890, he returned to Geraldton with his young family, and was elected to the Geraldton Town Council in 1892. He was made a Justice of the Peace in 1898, and became Mayor of Geraldton from 1898 until 1900. At a by-election on 24 July 1900 following the resignation of Richard Robson, Hutchinson was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Geraldton. He was in opposition to the party led by Premier Sir John Forrest, and in the confusing parliamentary situation created by the 1901 election, he was counted with the supporters of George Leake, who became Premier twice, and his successor Walter James. He retired at the 1904 election. Following his time in Parliament, he worked in various temporary positions in the Department of Lands and Surveys and the Department of Public Works. He was elected to the Town Council for a year in 1908‚Äì1909. Hutchinson died on 14 July 1918 in Maylands, and was buried in the Anglican section of Karrakatta Cemetery.

(2009). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved November 03, 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/278018/hybrid- inviability The relatively low health of these hybrids relative to pure-breed individuals prevents gene flow between species. Thus, hybrid inviability acts as an isolating mechanism, limiting hybridization and allowing for the differentiation of species. The barrier of hybrid inviability occurs after mating species overcome pre-zygotic barriers (behavioral, mechanical, etc.) to produce a zygote. The barrier emerges from the cumulative effect of parental genes; these conflicting genes interfere with the embryo's development and prevents its maturation. Most often, the hybrid embryo dies before birth. However, sometimes, the offspring develops fully with mixed traits, forming a frail, often infertile adult.Campbell, N. A., J. B. Reece, L. A. Urry, M. L. Cain, S. A. Wasserman, P. V. Minorsky, and R. B. Jackson. 2008. Biology: Eighth Ed. San Francisco, CA:491. This hybrid displays reduced fitness, marked by decreased rates of survival and reproduction relative to the parent species. The offspring fails to compete with purebred individuals, limiting genes flow between species.Freeman, S., and J. C. Herron. 2007. Evolutionary Analysis:Fourth Ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ:627.  Evolution of Hybrid Inviability in Tetrapods  In the 1970s, Allan C. Wilson and his colleagues first investigated the evolution of hybrid inviability in tetrapods, specifically mammals, birds, and frogs.Prager, E. M., and A. C. Wilson. 1975. Slow evolutionary loss of the potential for interspecific hybridization in birds: a manifestation of slow regulatory evolution. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72:200-204.Wilson, A. C., L. R. Maxson, and V. M. Sarich. 1974. Two types of molecular evolution: evidence from studies of interspecific hybridization. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71:2843-2847. Recognizing that hybrid viability decreases with time, the researchers used molecular clocks to quantify divergence time. They identified how long ago the common ancestor of hybridizing species diverged into two lines, and found that bird and frog species can produce viable hybrids up to twenty million years after speciation. In addition, the researchers showed that mammal species can only produce viable hybrids up to two or three million years after speciation. Wilson et al. (1974) proposes two hypotheses to explain the relatively faster evolution of hybrid inviability in mammals: the Regulatory and the Immunological Hypotheses. Subsequent research finds support for these hypotheses. The Regulatory Hypothesis accounts for two characteristics of mammals, and explains the general formation of hybrid inviability in mammals, birds, and frogs. First, mammals display relatively lower protein diversity than frogs. As Wilson et al. (1974) suggests, ‚Äúmammals that can hybridize with each other differ only slightly at the protein level, whereas frogs that differ substantially in protein sequence hybridize readily.‚Äù This analysis suggests that gene divergence is not the only determinate of hybridization in mammals, birds, or frogs. Second, the evolution of anatomical diversity occurred far faster in mammals than in either birds or frogs. As Fitzpatrick (2004) indicates, ‚Äúthe morphological disparities among bats, mole-rats, and whales are more dramatic than any disparities in birds and frogs.‚Äù This anatomical diversity is evidence for the diversification of regulatory systems. This mammalian characteristic suggests that, although mammals are genetically similar, dramatic changes in regulatory genes caused distinct developmental differences.Fitzpatrick, B. M. 2004. Rates of evolution of hybrid viability in birds and mammals. Evolution 58:1865-1870. The Regulatory Hypotheses specifically attributes hybrid inviability in mammals, birds, and frogs to differences in gene regulation. It proposes that hybrid inviability evolved faster in mammalian taxa because mammals have accumulated significantly more changes in regulatory systems than birds or frogs, and it suggests that organisms with distinctly different systems of gene regulation may not produce viable hybrids. Wilson et al. (1974) recognizes that the development of embryos in the mammalian placenta requires regulatory compatibility. Both the regulatory genes of the sperm and egg contribute to the expression of other protein-coding genes in the zygote; if certain regulatory genes are not expressed or are expressed at the wrong time, the inter-specific zygote will abort or develop unhealthy traits. Moreover, because the development of the zygote depends on maternal characteristics, such as cytoplasmic determinants, the regulatory traits of the mother may not support the hybrid's developmental needs. The Immunological Hypothesis proposes that the divergence of certain protein structures associated with mother and child causes hybrid inviability. The hypothesis applies only to mammals, where fertilization and development is internal. In birds and in frogs, fertilization is primarily external, and the mother‚Äôs immune system does not interfere with fetal development. This hypothesis stems from the immunological characteristics of the placenta, where the growing fetus is in constant contact with the fluids and tissues of the mother. Variation within species and variation between species may contribute to fetal-maternal incompatibility, and according to the hypothesis, if the proteins of the fetus varies significantly from the proteins of the placenta, the mother may produce anti-bodies that will attack and abort the fetus. Therefore, if the fetal proteins of the father species are incompatible the mother's placental proteins, the mother's immune system may abort the embryo. Evidence for the Immunological Hypothesis varies considerably. Wilson et al. (1974) recognizes studies that provide no support to the Immunological Hypotheses. In these experiments, the use of immunological suppressants provided no additional viability to inter-specific hybrids. In contrast, Elliot and Crespi (2006) documents the effects of placental immunology on hybrid inviability, showing that mammals with hemochorial placentas more readily hybridize than mammals with epitheliochorial or endotheliochorial placentas. These different placenta types possess divergent immunological systems, and consequently, they cause varying degrees of hybrid inviability.Elliot, M. G., and B. J. Crespi. 2006.

In 1912, prior to the construction of the plant, the company had four baking plants throughout the city of Chicago and general offices in the Chicago Stock Exchange Building on LaSalle Street in the Chicago Loop. In the 1910s, the company had extensive legal battles regarding protecting its trademarks. In 1921 Paul Schulze sold control of the company to Ralph Leroy Nafziger.http://www.schulzeburch.com/about/index.asp In 1930 Nafziger announced the formation of Interstate Bakeries through the merger of Schulze Baking and Western Bakeries of Los Angeles to form Interstate Bakeries. Schulze and Western continued to maintain their own separate companies under the Interstate umbrella until 1937 when Schulze formally became Interstate. Paul Schulze went on to operate small bakeries elsewhere under the name of Schulze and Burch Biscuit Company. Architecture The building is a white terra cotta structure designed by John Ahlschlager in 1914 for the Schulze Baking Company. The terra cotta walls were five storeys high. The building featured blue lettering, foliated cornice ornamentation, and stringcourses of rosettes. The building uses 700 windows grouped to complement the ornamentation's allusion to themes of nature and purity. The ornamentation is considered abstract, Sullivanesque and modern. The company used Apron conveyor manufactured by the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company of Columbus, Ohio. A lengthy low industrial complex extends northward behind the main five-story building. The structure has a flat concrete slab floor with four-way reinforcement designed to support . The dimensions of the building by and it is composed of floor space segmented into by . The second floor is thick except in the square surrounding each column where it is thick. As of late 2008, the building was showing signs of wear, disrepair and neglect. At least one terra cotta cornice was missing, and the building had numerous walkway coverings to protect passersby from falling debris such as further terra cotta loss. One side wall was propped up with wood beams at 45 degree angles. In addition, the building had some graffiti markings. However, developer Ghian Foreman stated in February 2016 that the rehabilitation of the former Schulze Baking Company plant into a data center, to be called the Midway Technology Center, was on schedule for operation in 2017. The adaptive reuse project allegedly involved the investment of more than $130 million.

It was released for iOS on December 18, 2008, and uses the Box2D game engine. Rolandos gameplay revolves around navigation of \\"Rolandos\\", small ball-like creatures, throughout a fictional world known as \\"Rolandoland\\". Rolando has received generally positive reviews. A sequel, Rolando 2: Quest for the Golden Orchid, was released in 2009. A third game was announced and later cancelled. After being unplayable on newer devices since 2017, Rolando was later re-released in the form of a remake, Rolando: Royal Edition, on April 3, 2019. Story The goal of the game is to save Rolandoland from an invasion of little shadow creatures. The inhabitants of Rolandoland are the Rolandos, which are little ball-shaped creatures. Rolandos must be directed to safety by tilting the iPhone or iPod Touch and using different bonus items like conveyor belts and elevators. The Rolandos proceed through a series of worlds before eventually finding and defeating the leader of the shadow creatures. Gameplay Rolando gameplay Each stage has a required number of Rolandos that must escape if the player wants to advance to the next stage. Players can manipulate objects in the world and can tilt an iPhone or iPod Touch to move the Rolandos through the stage. The player rolls the Rolandos either one at a time or in groups, selected by drawing boxes over the intended Rolandos. By swiping one's finger up, the selected Rolandos jump. The player gets help from the Rolando commandos, an elite group of sticky balls who grip surfaces and defy gravity. Contrary to normal Rolandos, these creatures can also stick to the ceiling. This game also features tutorial levels in the first world, which explain the controls and how to play. One may be very familiar with the controls, but it will take a long time to master them. Music and art The soundtrack for Rolando is largely from the discography of DJ Mr. Scruff, who lent many of his songs to the game. Such songs include \\"Spandex Man\\" (from Keep It Unreal), \\"Shrimp\\", \\"Ug\\" (from Trouser Jazz), \\"Donkey Ride\\", \\"Kalimba\\", \\"Stockport Carnival\\" (from Ninja Tuna), and \\"Mice At The Organ\\" (from the Large Pies EP). Simon Oliver, Rolandos creator, called Mr. Scruff's contribution \\"icing on the cake\\" for the game. Art for the game was created by Finnish illustrator Mikko Walamies. Oliver sent Walamies videos, level layouts, and other development media without ever meeting the illustrator in person. However, Oliver described the relationship positively, saying that their \\"ideas always seem to be in sync.\\" Walamies made available high-resolution art from Rolando on his website in February 2009. = Version history = Version 1.1 of the game was released on March 16, 2009 and includes five secret levels with the Honeycup Meadows theme. Version 1.2 of the game was released on April 21, 2009 and added two more secret levels based on the Fire Canyon theme, and reveals the remaining secret levels as locked icons, bringing the final level count to fifty-six levels. The game was updated weekly with more levels until the release of Rolando 2: Quest for the Golden Orchid. Rolando Lite was released February 4, 2009 and includes the first eight levels in Honey Cup Meadows, and later, one secret level in the Rolando Lite 1.1 update. In 2017, Rolando became unavailable on iOS devices using iOS 11 or later due to its 32-bit nature. Reception IGN gave the game a 9.5 out of 10 rating. The game was voted as Best iPhone Game of 2008 by the Boston Herald, VentureBeat, and 148Apps and is winner of Pocket Gamers Platinum Award. Edge Online gave Rolando a 7 out of 10 rating, criticizing the game for using graphics and ideas similar to LocoRoco. The Royal Edition was nominated for \\"Best Mobile Game\\" at the Develop:Star Awards. Sequel In February 2009, ngmoco announced two sequels to Rolando. Rolando 2: Quest for the Golden Orchid is similar to its predecessor in that it is a puzzle-based platformer, however, new characters and settings allow new types of movement and some offensive action against the antagonists. The focus of this quest is to cure the two sages of the kingdom of a disease using the mysterious \\"Golden Orchid\\". Also new to Rolando 2 are \\"Golden Idols\\" which, when acquired, will allow a player to skip some of the more challenging puzzles. Golden Idols are found throughout the levels of Rolando 2.

On January 16, 2009, it was suggested by the Russian government the link could be completed with a bridge, rather than tunnel. HistoryEarly proposals and planning= The concept of a tunnel under the Nevelskoy Strait has existed since the 19th century, although it was never seriously pursued due to economic reasons. Studies into the feasibility of the project were first undertaken by the Soviet Union in the late 1930s, although World War II made progress at this time impossible. Joseph Stalin later announced in 1950 his intention to build a railway link to Sakhalin, either via rail ferry, a causeway, or a tunnel. A decision to construct a tunnel was announced by the Soviet government on May 5, 1950, along with a rail ferry link to serve as a temporary solution. The project was intended primarily to serve a military purpose, allowing better connection between Sakhalin and the mainland for sections of the Red Army stationed on the island. =Construction= The construction of the railway connection from Selikhino near Komsomolsk-on-Amur to the intended mainland tunnel portal at Cape Lazarev was assigned to the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, with the Ministry of Transport in charge of the tunnel itself. In 1952, the project was transferred to the full management of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The planned route on Sakhalin was intended to run from Cape Pogibi, where the tunnel should resurface, to the then northern terminus of the Sakhalin rail network at Pobedino (formerly known as \\"Koton\\" under Japanese rule), north of Smirnykh. The length of the tunnel between Cape Pogibi and Cape Lasarev was planned to be around . On the mainland, a rail line was to be constructed to the railway connecting Komsomolsk-on-Amur with Sovetskaya Gavan, now a section of the Baikal-Amur Mainline. The project was planned for completion by the end of 1953 and to be in full operation by the end of 1955. Annual goods traffic on the line was projected to reach four million tonnes. The project included three separate constructions‚Äîmainland and island railway links, connecting with the rest of railroad network (Building 507 and 506 respectively) and tunnel itself (Building 6 of the MPS). Railway characteristics were very poor; in fact, it was a temporary railway, which was to be followed by capital rebuilding after construction. Tunnel works (Building 6 of MPS) were a different story. It was to be constructed by military engineers and Metrostroy tunnel specialists. After the death of Stalin, work on the project stopped, with the tunnel allegedly almost halfway across the straits, although later investigation has shown that just two shafts were built. The shafts have a depth of about 55 meters and a diameter of about 9 meters, with the trunk concreted and lined with cast-iron tubing, fastened to each other by bolts.–°–∞—Ö–∞–ª–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–æ–Ω–Ω–µ–ª—å While the reasons for cancellation of the project are not fully clear, some sources have indicated that because of numerous amnesties granted to prisoners after Stalin's death, there was no longer the required workforce. Tunnel workers waited eight months after cancellation, but without linking railways, the tunnel had no purpose. Completed sections of the project Around of track along the right bank of the Amur River from Selikhino to Chyorny Mys was completed, although this was still well short of the planned tunnel entrance at Cape Lazarev. The Selikhino-Chyorny Mys railway was later used for transport of lumber by the Soviet forestry industry, but was closed in the 1990s and the track has been largely dismantled. Remains of the tunnel entrance are still visible around Cape Lazarev. No new track was built on Sakhalin, although preparatory earthworks on the planned route were used in the construction of a road from Nysh to Pogibi. Current operations and future prospects Since 1973, a train ferry has connected Vanino (on the mainland near Sovetskaya Gavan) with the town of Kholmsk on Sakhalin. Even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, there have been calls from politicians for a revival of the project, although there have been concerns that its cost would outweigh the benefits.International Railway Journal - Sakhalin rail link too expensive However, there have been signs that the link is under serious consideration, including an announcement of support from Russian President Dimitry Medvedev in November 2008. The project is proposed to be completed by 2030. New plans would see the connection in Sakhalin at Nogliki, which has in the meantime been connected to the island's rail network. Work is under way to convert the island's narrow-gauge rail system, a legacy of the previous Japanese administration of the southern half of the island, to the broader Russian standard gauge. There have also been proposals to connect the southern tip of Sakhalin to the Japanese island of Hokkaido via a bridge or tunnel, providing a direct land transport link for container traffic from Japan to the Asian mainland and Europe. In July 2018, Russia's president Vladimir Putin commissioned an analysis of a proposal to build a bridge from the Russian mainland to Sakhalin. Putin said that the project was very important for Sakhalin residents and would be a major factor in encouraging people to remain in the region. It would also boost the development of Khabarovsk Territory. He said that he had instructed the government to analyze this matter, particularly its economic aspects.

Background and service under Wei Gao  It is not known when Liu Pi was born. During the middle of Emperor Dezong's Zhenyuan era (785-805), Liu passed the imperial examinations in the class of those who used language grandly.

When Wang subsequently exiled another regional staff member, Yang Shi'e (ÁæäÂ£´Ë´§), who was also in Chang'an to make demands for his supervisor, Liu became fearful and fled back to Xichuan. Subsequently, Wei submitted a petition to Emperor Shunzong, who was then seriously ill, condemning Wang and his associates, causing much apprehension among Wang and his associates. Wang lost power shortly after, and, later in the year, Emperor Shunzong yielded the throne to his son Li Chun the Crown Prince (as Emperor Xianzong).

He had his subordinates submit petitions on his behalf, asking to be made military governor. Emperor Xianzong initially refused and commissioned the chancellor Yuan Zi as the comforter of the three circuits, and then as military governor of Xichuan. He ordered Liu to return to Chang'an to serve as imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). Liu refused and prepared his forces to resist Yuan. Yuan, in fear of the strength of Liu's forces, did not dare to advance. Emperor Xianzong, in anger, exiled Yuan. However, as he was new to the throne and he believed himself to have insufficient strength to overpower Liu at this point, he formally made Liu the deputy military governor and acting military governor. Liu, however, was not satisfied, and he demanded control of Dongchuan and Shannan West as well. When Emperor Xianzong refused, in early 806, Liu launched his forces and put the military governor of Dongchuan, Li Kang (ÊùéÂ∫∑), under siege at Dongchuan's capital prefecture Zi Prefecture (Ê¢ìÂ∑û), wanting to capture Dongchuan and put his colleague and friend Lu Wenruo (ÁõßÊñáËã•) in control of Dongchuan. When his assistant Lin Yun (ÊûóËòä) tried to dissuade him, he ordered that Lin be beheaded ‚Äî but secretly told the executioner to halt the actual beheading, hoping that Lin would beg to be spared, and then he planned to spare Lin. As the executioner held the sword to Lin's neck and then withdrew it, and repeated it several times, Lin rebuked the executioner: \\"Scoundrel! If you want to behead me, go ahead. My neck is not your whetstone.\\" Liu, hearing this, remarked: \\"This is truly a faithful and brave man.\\" He thus spared Lin, only demoting him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. Hearing that Liu was attacking Dongchuan, Emperor Xianzong considered responding militarily, but was apprehensive that Xichuan was well-fortified. The chancellor Du Huangchang, however, advocated stern military action, pointing out that Liu was, in Du's words, \\"an insane civilian,\\" who was not capable militarily. Du recommended the general Gao Chongwen to command the campaign against Liu, and Emperor Xianzong agreed, giving Gao the command of the various armies on the western border and ordering him to advance south against Liu, in association with Yan Li (Âö¥Á§™) the military governor of Shannan West. Emperor Xianzong still offered Liu a chance to apologize and submit, but Liu did not respond. Meanwhile, Liu had captured Zi Prefecture and taken Li captive. Gao's forces soon arrived at Zi Prefecture, however, and Liu's forces were forced to withdraw. Liu sent Li to Gao, and requested that Gao help him receive a chance to apologize to Emperor Xianzong. Instead, Gao executed Li under the rationale that Li had brought disgrace to the imperial forces by his defeat. Emperor Xianzong soon issued an edict stripping Liu of all of his titles. Liu set up defenses at Lutou Pass (ÈπøÈ†≠Èóú, in modern Deyang, Sichuan) and nearby Wanshengdui (Ëê¨ÂãùÂ†Ü). Gao, however, was able to defeat Liu's forces in eight straight battles, and Yan also defeated Liu's forces. Meanwhile, the imperial military officer Adie Guangyan cut off the supply route of Liu's army at Lutou Pass; in fear, Liu's commanders at Lutou Pass, Li Wenyue (ÊùéÊñáÊÇÖ) and Qiu Liangfu (‰ªáËâØËºî) surrendered, and Liu's son-in-law Su Jiang (ËòáÁñÜ) was captured. With Lutou Pass out of the way, Gao headed straight for Xichuan's headquarters at Chengdu, and Liu's defenses completely collapsed. On November 5,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BE%CB%A9v&reign;=%A4%B8%A9M&yy;=1&ycanzi;=&mm;=9‚ÖÜ=&dcanzi;=%A8%AF%A5%E8 Chengdu fell. Liu and Lu took some cavalry soldiers and fled west, hoping to flee to Tufan. Gao sent soldiers to chase after them, and caught up with them at Yangguantian (ÁæäÁÅåÁî∞, in modern Chengdu). Liu jumped into a river, intending to commit suicide, but was taken out of the water by the imperial officer Li Dingjin (ÈÖàÂÆöÈÄ≤). Lu killed his wife and children, and then jumped into the river with rocks strapped to himself, and his body was not recovered. Gao had Liu delivered to Chang'an. It said that on the way, Liu was still eating normally, believing that he would not be executed. He only became frightened when, as he approached Chang'an, soldiers of the imperial Shence Army (Á•ûÁ≠ñËªç) bound his head and limbs. As he reached Chang'an, Emperor Xianzong ascended a tower to receive him as a captive, and had an eunuch read him a list of his crimes. He responded, \\"I, your subject, would not dare to rebel. It was that the soldiers of five camps wanted to do evil, and I was not able to stop them.\\" Emperor Xianzong replied, \\"I sent an eunuch to deliver banners and your commission certificate. Why did you not accept them?\\" Liu was forced to admit his guilt. He was delivered to the imperial shrines, and then executed on December 12, 806. Also killed were several of his subordinates, as well as his nine sons.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 140. * New Book of Tang, vol. 158. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 236, 237.

It is one of three churches in the Parish of Monkwearmouth. The others are All Saints' Church, Monkwearmouth and St Andrew's Church, Roker. St Peter's was founded in AD 674‚Äì5 as one of the two churches of the Benedictine double monastery of Monkwearmouth‚ÄìJarrow Abbey. The other church is St Paul's, Jarrow. The church is a Grade I listed building and part of a scheduled monument. ArchitectureAnglo-Saxon= The original church on the site was built at the behest of Benedict Biscop in AD 674‚Äì75, when the area was part of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria. Bede (circa 673‚Äì735) wrote that Benedict brought stonemasons and glassworkers from Gaul to build the church, as these crafts were not yet established in Anglo- Saxon England. Of Benedict's building only the west wall and porch survive. The ground floor of the porch is barrel vaulted. Its outer arch, at the west end of the porch, is of elaborate design and decorated with stone reliefs. By about AD 700 the porch had been enlarged by the addition of a second storey and north and south porticus, forming a westwork. By the end of the 10th century further storeys had been added to the porch, raising its height to form the present west tower. =Gothic and Gothic Revival= The rest of the church is much later. The north aisle was first built in the 13th century. A five-light east window was inserted in the chancel in the 14th century. Inside the nave, looking east to the chancel Early in the 19th century the arcade of the north aisle and most of the chancel arch were removed, and galleries were inserted. In 1875‚Äì76 St Peter's was restored under the direction of the architects Hubert Austin and RJ Johnson, who had the north aisle rebuilt and the east window of the chancel replaced. There is also an organ loft built onto the north side of the chancel. The present stained glass in the windows was made in 1969 by LC Evetts. In 1973 an octagonal extension was added east of the organ loft as an interpretation centre. In 1984 the church was damaged by fire, and about 1985 the interior and roof were rebuilt.

It rises on the eastern slopes of Fan Gyhirych in the Fforest Fawr section of the Brecon Beacons National Park and flows south for 7 miles (12 km) to join with the Afon Mellte at Pontneddfechan, their combined waters continuing as the River Neath (Welsh Afon Nedd) to the sea near Swansea. The only significant tributary of the Nedd Fechan is the Afon Pyrddin which joins it at Pwll Du ar Byrddin ('the black pool of the Pyrddin'). Downstream of this confluence it forms the boundary between Brecknockshire to its east and Glamorgan to its west.Ordnance Survey Explorer sheet OL12 'Brecon Beacons National Park: western area' __TOC__  Geology  The headwaters of the river run over Old Red Sandstone as far as Blaen-nedd-isaf where they encounter the Carboniferous Limestone outcrop. The river then continues through a wooded gorge for the remainder of its course. The section downstream of Pont Rhyd-y-cnau is cut in sandstones and mudstones of the Millstone Grit series. The section between Pont Melin-fach and the confluence of the river with the Afon Pyrddin is perhaps the most dramatic as the river plunges over several falls of which Sgwd Ddwli and Sgwd Pedol are the most acclaimed. Each of the falls is associated with faults bringing harder sandstone beds into contact with the more readily eroded mudstones.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 map sheet 231 'Merthyr Tydfil' & accompanying memoir  Habitat protection  The entire gorge section of the Nedd Fechan valley is protected as part of a larger site of special scientific interest which also covers neighbouring river gorges.

Biography Margaret Nisbett was born in Preston, Victoria. She had an older sister, Coral (Capelin), now deceased. Margaret always loved music and, as a child, performed small concerts at home with her sister, as well as at her local Church of England. She attended Tyler Street Primary School in Preston and later Preston Girls High School until the age of 15 (typical for the time) and showed a great interest in French, History and Painting. Upon leaving school she trained as a shorthand typist and worked in that field for a time. Margaret married Jon Weaving in 1952 and their only child (Jon Hugh Weaving) was born in 1955. They were separated in 1959. She has one grandson, Talon Ashley Weaving, born 1985. Margaret still lives in the family home in Victoria, Australia. Career Margaret started piano and singing lessons with Thelma Ford when she was nine years old. During those first five years of training she competed in The Royal South Street Competition (Ballarat). Later, whilst working as a typist, Margaret also competed in many singing competitions and performed at concerts. She joined the National Theatre School where she studied Opera for 2 years and performed in many operas. In 1947, at age 18, Margaret was given her \\"big break\\". While still working full-time, as well as studying, she was understudying the lead role of Gilda in Rigoletto, which was being performed at Melbourne's Princess Theatre. Due to the leading lady falling ill and with only 24 hours notice, she was asked to perform the lead role on opening night. This was a great success, receiving the first of many standing ovations and immediately establishing her as a new \\"star\\" of the operatic stage.. Margaret continued studying (her singing teacher during that time was Pauline Bindley, a famous operatic soprano of the bel canto style) and entered many of the biggest singing competitions in Australia, including Geelong, Ballarat and the Mobil Quest. Conductor and (future) TV producer Hector Crawford created the famous Mobil Quest in 1949 and it seems unlikely that any other country in the world had, at the time, the same sort of serious singing competition on radio solely concerned with \\"bringing to the attention of the public the best vocal talent available in the Commonwealth\\", and requiring each competitor to sing an operatic aria. The second winner of the rich Mobil Quest prize (in 1950) was Joan Sutherland. Margaret won the Mobil Quest in 1951 and amongst the other finalists that year were soprano June Bronhill. The finalists toured Australia with conductor Hector Crawford. Margaret Nisbett's prize included the opportunity to study opera overseas and, in 1954, she departed for England with her husband, Jon, where she continued studies under Dino Borgioli and Clive Carey, who was also Joan Sutherland's teacher. Margaret's previous experience as a typist enabled her to continue singing lessons, while auditioning for opera companies. The group of expat singers and musicians with whom she was friendly included Richard Bonynge, Joan Sutherland and June Bronhill. Margaret was in great demand by a number of opera companies; she sang full-time with London's Sadlers Wells for 8 years as one of their leading ladies. Her roles included Adele in Die Fledermaus, Gilda in Rigoletto, Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro. During this time she also performed for BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) TV and Radio. Margaret returned to Australia in late 1962. In 1965 she was approached by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) to perform a series of operas for TV, with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. She performed the role of Maria in The Sound of Music touring Australia for 15 months, including at the Sydney Opera House. She performed a successful 36-week series on ABC TV Margaret Nisbett Operetta. During the 1960s, Margaret was a regular guest on the Melbourne variety show In Melbourne Tonight, hosted by Graham Kennedy. During this time she also performed at Music for the People, a very popular concert series presented by the Government of Victoria and Melbourne City Council. They were held over Summer at Melbourne's Sidney Myer Music Bowl, as well as Victorian regional centres. Margaret toured regularly, performing cabaret at various interstate clubs and major venues. Margaret performed over a number of years at a great Melbourne institution. The Christmas Eve Carols by Candlelight for the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind (RVIB) now Vision Australia during the 1970s. These are still held at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. Margaret was a principal with the Melbourne Opera Company in the early 70s, performing with others such as Norman Yemm. In the late 1970s, Margaret toured Canada and the USA with Mervyn Simpson and the Footscray-Yarraville Brass Band. She was the compere and soloist. The Band won the prestigious World Championship Brass Band Competition during that time. The State Concert Orchestra of Victoria was a Government funded concert series which toured metropolitan and regional Victoria. Margaret was a soloist for many years. Other artists included baritone John Lidgerwood. In the early 1990s, Margaret reduced her public performances and commenced a successful career teaching singing. She still has many private pupils and has just (2009) completed a 17-year engagement with the Melba Conservatorium of Music, in Melbourne. Margaret's pupils include Helena Dix and Christopher Diffey, both having undertaken operatic careers in the UK.

Constructed in the 1880s for one of two competing county fairs, it is typical of exhibition buildings from the period. Although no longer used for the county fair, it has been named a historic site. HistoryBackground= The first Wood County fair was held in 1851 in Bowling Green, although the next five years saw it held also at Perrysburg and Portageville, due partially to dissension among the sponsoring Agricultural Society members and partially to the presence of diseases such as cholera and ague in the different grounds. The board purchased land at Tontogany for permanent fair grounds after the end of the Civil War,Commemorative Historical and Biographical Record of Wood County, Ohio: Its Past and Present. Chicago: Beers, 1897. but Bowling Green still retained the memory of holding the county fair. This state of affairs ultimately induced the formation of a separate Wood County Fair Company in Bowling Green, which obtained land in Bowling Green and began holding fairs in 1881, becoming successful enough that the Agricultural Society began merger talks in 1885. From 1884 until 1894, their receipts grew from $3,889.30 to $7,945.99. =Usage= The Floral Hall was constructed in 1884 at the fairgrounds in Bowling Green; it originally held horticultural exhibits, although in the 20th century it was renamed \\"Needle Hall\\" after it began hosting needlework exhibitions. In later years, the fair moved to another location, the original grounds were converted into a city park, and all other buildings from the fairgrounds were eventually destroyed. However, the city retained the floral/needle hall, changing it into a picnic shelter and carefully attending to the building's upkeep.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2.

One story tall, the hall is an octagonal structure, typical of Ohio floral halls from the period; its plan is essentially a modified Greek cross. The doors and other parts of the facade bear Stick-style detailing. In 1982, the former floral/needle hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its architecture and because of its place in local history. It is one of five National Register-listed locations in Bowling Green, and one of thirty-one in Wood County.

However, the rules used likely did not resemble anything that a modern football observer would recognize, being that of a mix of soccer and rugby.

Petro Nini Luarasi (teacher) in the center Flampouro (, ) is a village in the central part of Florina regional unit, northern Greece, part of the Perasma municipal unit. The original indigenous name for the village of Flambouro is Negovani and means \\"cold water\\" (known for its pure mineral water source) The village's year round population is estimated at 500 people, but in the summer it grows to nearly 700. In the surrounding area many other villages can be found, including Aetos, Skopia, Kato Ydroussa, and Ano Ydroussa.  History  The original village was established in the 1840s by villagers (mostly masons and other tradesmen) who came from Plikati and other villages from Mastorochoria (a region around Mount Gramos) in Epirus. The villagers were Albanians and they settled in an area of West Macedonia that was almost exclusively populated by indigenous (endopi) Macedonians. In the local Slavic dialect, the town is known as –ù–µ–≥–æ–≤–∞–Ω (Negovan). There are now three villages in the area that were exclusively settled by Albanians. They are Drosopigi, Flambouro, and Lechovo. In 1842, leading families from Plikati, Epirus purchased the land and forest after negotiating with Osman Ismael Pasha, the Bey from Florina. The village was inhabited many families. The total population at 1900 had reached 1,880. The villages of Flambouro and Drosopigi were some of the very first villages in its area to have tunnels for the Greek Revolutionaries during the Greek Struggle for Macedonia. Many great revolutionaries stopped at Flambouro as place to heal, rest, or hide. The Hellenic Army leader who most symbolized the Macedonian Struggle, Pavlos Melas, other army leaders, and their troops, used these tunnels for a quick escape from their enemies. In addition, many Flambouro's localsI.S. Koliopoulos, I.D. Michailidis, K. S.

Some of these men were the guerilla leaders Georgios Seridis and Ilias Pinopoulos, Konstantinos Vassos who was executed by the komitandjis in 1905, Ilias Kolepina who was member of Ioannis Poulakas group, Georgios Nikolaidis who also fought as a minor guerilla leader during the Balkan Wars etc joined the Greek Struggle as fighters or agents. Moreover Flambouro's men captured a Bulgarian general at the time. Legend has it that the head of this general was cut off and brought back to the village so that Pavlos Melas could see it. This is when the village was also known proudly as Flambouro (also meaning bright Greek flag). Papa Kristo Negovani a native of the village was a representative of the Albanian National Awakening and came in sharp conflict with the Greek-Orthodox hierarchy being against his initiative. During the Balkan Wars (1912-1913) the area came under the control of the Greek forces. The Treaty of London would cease the area to Greece, and the borders were confirmed by the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. When the World War II hit Europe, Greece suffered a lot, as did Flambouro. In the Battle of Greece (6‚Äì30 April 1941), the country faced three Axis powers: Nazi Germany, the Kingdom of Italy and the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Their alliance won the conflict and established an Axis occupation of Greece. The men of Flambouro went on to fight Nazi occupation as the women took control of the village and defended it also. Following the German devastation of Flambouro, the people of the village set out to rebuild it to its original glory. From April 1944 till April 1947 the villagers was rebuilt. The end of World War II was followed in Greece by the Greek Civil War between the Democratic Army of Greece and the Hellenic Army. In the first stages of the civil war many communist-led guerrillas stopped at the village as a hiding place. On April 7, 1947, the Greek government under Dimitrios Maximos adopted a policy of forced relocation for certain villages that were strategic for the guerrillas. Luckily, the village of Flambouro was already loyal and occupied by the Hellenic Army, however, many children were sent to communist countries such as Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and the USSR as refugees. These children were known as Flambouro's lost generation. Other village natives fled with the aid of the Truman Doctrine to the United States in hope to find job to send money to the rest of their families. In the 1950s and 1960s a new era was coming about in Greece, it was the time of moving. Many families, because of economic conditions, from all around Greece started to emigrate, becoming part of the Greek diaspora. Individuals and families who emigrated from Flambouro mostly went to the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Australia in search of a new life. Some went with the intention to make money and return, but many did not return to Greece and left their villages in their past. At present, the cities of Rochester (New York) and Adelaide (South Australia) have the largest concentration of immigrants and families that trace their roots from Flambouro. Many people still visit Flambouro to this day and always keep it their hearts as many Flambouryiotes (people from Flambouro) say. The village today also has a hotel where many Greeks from other regions of Greece come to the Florina region for camping, relaxation and an appreciation for the wonderful nature of Macedonia. There are still people who live there but not as many as there were in 1900s.

The clan historically held lands near the Anglo-Scottish border. Clan status Today Clan Blackadder does not have a chief recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, therefore the clan has no standing under Scots Law. Clan Blackadder is considered an armigerous clan, meaning that it is considered to have had at one time a chief who possessed the chiefly arms, however no one at present is in possession of such arms. The arms of Blackadder of that Ilk are blazoned as: Azure, on a chevron Argent three roses Gules. Name The clan name is a territorial name derived from the lands of Blackadder in Berwickshire. The lands, in turn, are named after the Blackadder Water, a river which is part of the River Tweed system, and which runs through the Scottish Borders. The name Blackadder is derived from the Old English awedur which means \\"running water\\" or \\"stream\\". George Fraser Black states that in 1426, Blakadir de Eodem (of that Ilk) held the lands in the earldom of March. Early bearers of the surname are Adam of Blacathathir in 1477, Robert Blackader in the 15th century, and Charles Blakater in 1486. Eminence in 1450‚Äì1518Fife branch= A junior branch moved to Tulliallan in Fife and included Robert Blackadder, bishop and then in 1492 the first Archbishop of Glasgow, who added the eponymous crypt and aisle in Glasgow Cathedral. The archbishop died while on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1508. The Fife branch were supporters of Clan Douglas. In 1471 the archbishop was also made Abbot of Melrose, not far from the main Blackadder lands. Sir John Blackadder of Tullialan was made a baronet in 1626. The title was allowed to lapse with his death, although the celebrated covenanting preacher John Blackadder (1622‚Äì1685) was legally the heir. The preacher's son Colonel John Blackadder later became governor of Stirling Castle. =Main branch= The Blackadders of that Ilk were Border Reivers, involved in the deadly raids and feuds along the Anglo‚ÄìScottish border during the 15th and 16th centuries. Their base by the Blackadder Water was near Berwick-upon- Tweed, a town that changed hands 13 times between England and Scotland in the period 1147‚Äì1482. The family gained lands from James II of Scotland in reward for their deeds in repelling in English raids. In 1518 the family lost their Border lands by the forced marriages of the two heiresses of Robert Blackadder of that Ilk to the neighbouring Clan Home (pronounced \\"Hume\\"). This process became known as \\"the fraud of the Homes\\". According to the 19th-century historian William Anderson, the marriages were achieved in the following way. Map of Berwickshire. This process was challenged by a Blackadder kinsman, Sir John Blackadder who held the lands of Tulliallan. He attempted to gain assistance from the Parliament, and also attempted to use force to regain the former Blackadder possessions. In March 1531, he was beheaded for the murder of the Abbot of Culross, in the dispute. Sir John Blackadder was succeeded by his brother Patrick, who also took action to regain the lands from the Homes. Anderson's version of events has Patrick ambushed and murdered by the Homes, while he was attempting to meet them and resolve the dispute. By 1567 the dispute had died down, as the Tulliallan branch and the Homes of Wedderburn were allies of Mary, Queen of Scots on the losing side in the important Battle of Carberry Hill. After the battle Mary abdicated as queen.See: The Historie of James the Sext Subsequently, the Blackadders relinquished their claim to the Border lands, and in 1671 Sir John Home was created Baronet of Blackadder. Some members of the clan continued to farm their lands as tenants of the Homes, and the last family burials at Edrom kirk were made in the 1980s.Archive of Erica Hunt, n√©e Blackadder, at Edinburgh University Library William Francis Blackadder played in the Scottish rugby team in 1938, and was awarded the DSO and OBE as an RAF ace in World War II.

It was serialized by Futabasha in the seinen manga magazine Comic High! between October 2006 and August 2010, and subsequently published as five bound volumes. The manga has been licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment.  Plot  The story revolves around the quiet and solitary Mari Kumakura, whose only noticeable quality is her top of the class grades. Enter the cute and friendly Akko Oohashi, whose goal is to get to know Mari and become best friends with her. With Akko's help, Mari becomes more confident and sociable, quickly transforming into one of the more fashionable girls in school. As the story progresses, she becomes good friends with Akko, Sugi and Tamami. The group gets into all kinds of situations: alcohol, boys, diets, fashion, friends and studies. However, as the plot develops, Mari, and later Akko, becomes aware of the deeper feelings she possesses for her best friend, feelings that eclipse friendship. Caught between romance and friendship, the two must come to terms with their love for one another, knowing that by doing so, their relationship, and even their lives, could drastically change forever.  Characters  ; : :The protagonist, whose nickname is Mari. She is a shy and polite person who always sits by herself during lunch breaks and reads books. When Akko befriends her, Mari starts to change and her personality starts to develop. She has recently become less shy and more socially-aware. In an effort to distance herself from her feelings for her friend, she goes out with a boy (despite having growing feelings of romantic love for Akko). Her resolve to remain \\"just friends\\" with Akko did not hold for long; tormented by the then unaware Akko's kindness and care, she kissed Akko on the lips on impulse twice, but then chooses not to speak of it any more (on the realization that her love will never be reciprocated.) ; : :Second protagonist, known to her friends as \\"Akko\\". A confident and attractive girl who befriends Mari at the start of the story. She displays many attributes of a stereotypical teenage girl, such as being knowledgeable about dating, fashion, and dieting. She claims to know a lot about guys despite barely interacting with them, interacting even less so when she becomes friends with Mari. Over the course of the story she developed feelings for Mari, and her increasing jealousy of Mari's boyfriend made that clear for her. ; : : Nicknamed \\"Sugi-san,\\" she is an outgoing playgirl who has several boyfriends, likes to go to mixers, and drinks a lot. It has been mentioned that she and Tamami kiss quite often (though only as a sign of friendship.) She often is seen as the most promiscuous and party-loving of the group and tends to strip her clothes off when she is drunk. She is surprisingly a light-weight when it comes to drinking. She sometimes is embarrassed to be friends with Tamami whenever the latter girl is publicly cosplaying or engaging in her geeky hobbies. Sugi is often viewed and revered as the \\"grown-up\\" in the group (in terms of her attractiveness, allure and knowledge about male-female relationships,) and Akiko has consulted her several times when it comes to issues involving Mariko. She is quite perceptive; she is the first and only person to figure out that Akko and Mari are in love with one another. She seems a bit wary of this, as she is concerned about their well-being, but chooses to watch over them from afar. In an omake chapter dedicated to her, she even envies how the both of them can retain their innocence and purity. ; : :A cute and funny girl who is best friends with Sugi. Her nickname is Tamanin. She is an otaku and often buys or talks about anime, manga, and video games. Contrastingly, she also likes nightclubs, drinking, food, and partying. When the original group is split up, Tamami and Satoko grow apart despite promising to stay in touch and be good friends but with help from Mari and Akko they are reunited. They have since been extremely close despite no longer being in the same class. ; :Becomes friends with Mari and Akko in the 2nd year, when Sugi-san and Tamamin end up in different classes. Called \\"Kuno-chin\\"; she has an older boyfriend (her \\"prince\\") met at a mixer party, with whom she is constantly preoccupied. A good student who hates sports, particularly the interpretive dances in which the students are forced to participate. Becomes friends with Sugi-san and Tamamin when the two take Mari and Akko's place at a mixer party. ; :Introduces herself to Mari and Akko in the 2nd year, along with Kuno-chin. Usually called \\"Tagu\\"; she resents her parents having given her such a cute, girly name (unfitting for her as she's something of a tomboy). She's in the tennis club, which takes up a good deal of her free time (and because of which she often gets severely sunburned). Despite being best friends with Kuno-chin, is irritated by her constant flow of talk about her \\"prince\\"- not least because she herself doesn't really have the time to find a boyfriend. Loves scary stories, but is easily terrified by them (as shown on the school trip).

Public safety professionals teach the career classes and the school partners with the City of Phoenix, its police and fire departments, and other agencies to provide students with real world opportunities such as internships, physical training and special employment programs. School history Franklin School was built in 1926 by the Phoenix Elementary School District. Wings were added in 1935 and 1936, and those wings were expanded to its current configuration in 1945. Designed by local architect Jay Knapp, important decorative elements included porthole gable ventilators, cast stone tablets and keystones, and a frieze- like panel with the inscription of the school name. After Phoenix Elementary closed the school, Phoenix Union used the building to house its Desiderata Program for special needs students in the 1990s. The school fell into disrepair and stood abandoned for several years. Phoenix Union purchased it in 2004 and took on the task of bringing the school building back to life, dealing with environmental issues with the property and strict adherence to historical restoration. The part of the building from the 1920s and 1930s required hardwood flooring and custom wood windows and doors. Tiles on the roof was fabricated locally to the color and size specifications of the time period.  Facts  *Franklin features law enforcement, and firefighting science training. It is partnered with Phoenix Police Department, Phoenix Fire Department, and Bureau of Land Management for internships, career opportunities and hands-on training, including a 911 emergency operator course. *The restored building opened in October, 2007, and in 2008-09 welcomed its first 9th and 10th grade classes. *The Franklin name came with the building, originally built in 1926, but it fits with the school's new mission.

His freelance crime stories have appeared around the world in such publications as The New York Times, Reader‚Äôs Digest, Marie Claire, The South China Morning Post magazine and The Moscow Times.

Rick‚Äôs third Jason Wade book is A Perfect Grave, which New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen called, ‚ÄúA lightning-paced thriller with lean, tense writing.‚Äù Rick followed A Perfect Grave with his first standalone book, the global thriller Six Seconds.

In late January 2007, Yedioth Ahronoth reported yet another seemingly contradictory announcement, which indicated that the maiden flight was to take place in the coming days.\\"Eitan: Israel develops the world's largest UAV\\" The Eitan was publicly unveiled at a media event at Tel Nof Airbase on 8 October 2007.Egozi 2007Opall-Rome 2007 The sensors fitted on this occasion included a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mounted in a pod on the aircraft's belly, a multi-sensor payload carried under its nose, and two conformal signals intelligence (SIGINT) arrays. Additional sensors may be carried at the ends of the tail booms. Analysis of the configuration presented to the media suggests an aircraft intended for deep penetration roles and on-board SIGINT processing capability. However, at the media event an IAF official stated that IAI and the IAF had tested \\"all kinds of payloads, in all kinds of configuration schemes.\\" Apart from its Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) role, the Eitan may also be used for aerial refuelling, and armed roles including missile defence and long-range strategic strike.\\"Israel AF Hones Manned-UAV Mix\\" Design A medium-altitude, long endurance (MALE) UAV,\\"Heron TP\\" the Eitan can operate at altitudes above commercial air traffic and features all-weather capability, de-icing systems,\\"IAI's Heron TP UAV sets new technological and operational records\\" automatic takeoff and landing (ATOL) systems, and triple-redundant avionics. It is a high-wing cantilever monoplane with wings of high aspect ratio. Booms extend rearward from the wings and carry twin tails that are joined by a common horizontal stabiliser. The main units of the tricycle undercarriage retract into the tail booms, and the nosewheel retracts into the fuselage. A single turboprop engine is mounted in the rear fuselage, driving a pusher propeller. Construction throughout is of composite materials. Operational history One report stated that Israel deployed Eitans in its alleged 2009 airstrike against an alleged Gaza-bound Iranian arms convoy traveling through Sudan. In February 2010 the Israeli Air Force unveiled its new fleet of Eitans. The first unit to operate the type, 210 Squadron, was inaugurated at Tel Nof in December 2010. In January 2012, an Eitan drone crashed near Hafetz Haim during tests of new payloads; no injuries were reported. The IDF does not comment on the arming of drones, but reports describe the Eitan being used for ‚Äúarmed roles‚Äù with missiles ‚Äúattached to wing hardpoints,‚Äù as well as for target acquisition. Used allegedly during several operations, will help government-owned IAI market its latest drone models as ‚Äúcombat-proven systems.‚Äù Exports In 2010 IAI offered the Eitan, under a teaming agreement with Rheinmetall, in pursuit of the German Air Force's long-term \\"Saateg\\" MALE UAV requirement. On 21 May 2014, IAI signed a deal with Airbus to team up on a bid for a bridging contract to supply the German armed forces with the Heron TP from 2015 until 2020. A current contract between the companies to supply Germany with the Heron is set to expire by 2015. Airbus said the German government would have the choice of either a purchase option or a lease for the system. In 2011 France selected the IAI Eitan for the French military. The deal was cancelled later in November 2011 by the French senate with the funds being allocated to a joint Franco-British MALE UAV design. Britain's Royal Air Force considered purchase of IAI Eitan UAVs in 2012.Britain's Royal Air Force considering purchase of Israeli unmanned aerial vehicle - Israel News Haaretz Daily Newspaper India finalized deal of purchasing 10 Heron TPA in 400 million $.

The episode first aired in the United States on December 9, 2001, on the Fox network. It was written by Steven Maeda and directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode is a \\"monster-of-the-week\\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of The X-Files. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.1 and was viewed by 5.38 million households. It received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, a vicious murderer named Irwin Lukesh, capable of jumping between parallel universes, shoots Doggett using Reyes' gun. Brad Follmer opens an investigation to figure out the truth. They eventually deduce that Lukesh is the real murderer. Maeda wrote the episode after being inspired by the situation of a real-life French journalist, Jean-Dominique Bauby, who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and was created by Maeda in the hopes that he would go on to be a memorable villain. Effects expert Mat Beck created the unique visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown. Plot Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) monitors Irwin Lukesh, a suspected serial killer who cuts out his victims' tongues. While pursuing him, Reyes goes into an apartment building and is attacked by Lukesh with a razor. John Doggett (Robert Patrick), observes the pursuit electronically and hears a scream. He rushes to help Reyes and finds her dying, her throat cut. Doggett chases Lukesh into an alleyway, where the killer seemingly vanishes. Lukesh then appears behind Doggett and fires at him with Reyes' gun. The setting then changes; Doggett arrives at Reyes' new apartment with a housewarming gift. Neither seems to be aware of the previous events. Reyes then receives a phone call from Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who informs her that Doggett has been shot and is being taken to the hospital. Reyes tells Skinner that Doggett is in her apartment, but then finds that he has vanished. The FBI matches the bullet surgically removed from Doggett with Reyes' gun and she is questioned by Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes), but she insists that Doggett was with her at the time of the shooting. Meanwhile, Lukesh watches the interrogation and identifies Reyes as the shooter. Doggett regains consciousness, but is breathing with the help of a respirator. Meanwhile, Lukesh goes to his apartment where he lives with his disabled mother. As he prepares to fix her lunch, he goes to his freezer and pulls out a bag containing a human tongue, intending to surreptitiously feeding it to her, as he has many times before. Reyes performs a background check on Lukesh, and becomes convinced that he is in fact responsible for the shooting. Reyes goes to Doggett, and through a computer setup that enables him to tap out words on a screen, Doggett tells her that Lukesh shot him but that Doggett also saw her with her throat cut. Lukesh then returns to the alleyway where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on the contradictory evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because two versions of the same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her. Doggett tells Reyes that, in order to resolve the situation, she must turn off his respirator and allow him to die, but she refuses. Suspecting that Lukesh plans to kill Reyes next, Skinner convinces Reyes to go back to her apartment while he, Scully, and Follmer monitor her. She returns and is attacked by Lukesh. The team rush to her aid and Follmer shoots Lukesh in the head, killing him. Reyes then returns to the hospital, closing her eyes as she shuts off Doggett's respirator. As she opens her eyes, the scene changes back to her apartment at the moment Doggett had disappeared earlier. Reyes, stunned and fighting back tears, embraces Doggett as he, evidently unaware of any of the previous events, asks her what is wrong. ProductionWriting= right Writer Steven Maeda had previously written the eighth season episodes \\"Redrum\\" and \\"Vienen\\"; due to their success, Maeda was asked to pen a ninth season standalone episode. His efforts were hampered by the fact that, due to the departure of David Duchovny, the show had changed considerably. Maeda was inspired to write the episode after learning the story of a French journalist name Jean-Dominique Bauby, who had been paralyzed and could only communicate by blinking his left eyelid. Maeda thought the ailment was interesting, and initially wanted to give it to a guest character for this purpose. However, he eventually felt it would be more successful if it effected a regular character, such as Doggett. Maeda employed the theory of parallel universes in order to explain the logistics of the episode. The character of Lukesh was in part inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Maeda later noted that he wished to create a villain that would be as memorable as other antagonists in The X-Files, such as Eugene Victor Tooms and The Flukeman. \\"4-D\\" expounded upon the budding relationship between Doggett and Reyes. Most of the two's romantic interactions were limited to \\"flirtatious undercurrents\\" because, according to Annabeth Gish, series creator Chris Carter \\"was never big on the flamboyant big performances.\\" Robert Patrick later claimed that he came up with the scene in which Reyes shaves a wounded Doggett. He noted, \\"I'd read The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, and I believe there's a part of that in the book where the character gets shaved, and I thought, 'Wow, that's really an intimate kind of moment.'\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 201. =Effects and cultural references= Effects expert Mat Beck was instructed to create a visual sequence that showed Doggett and Lukesh traveling between the different universes. Various effects were tested, including characters disappearing into black holes as well as phasing through the air in a more \\"exaggerated\\" and \\"watery\\" way. Beck ultimately decided to use a combination of both effects. Separate shots of a morphing scene were taken: one of the actors, and one of the background. Beck then used software to morph the two together to make it appear as if they had vanished. Later, artistic touches were added in post-production editing to give a more futuristic effect. To create the effect of a parallel universe, every scene in the episode's teaser was flipped so that the mirror image was shown. In order to render words correctly, letters had to be re-written backwards so that they yielded the correct spelling. Monica Reyes' Georgetown apartment address is 67 Bennett Avenue. This is a reference to Rod Serling's address in Binghamton, New York. Furthermore, her apartment number 6, is a reference to Patrick McGoohan's number in the 1967 television series, The Prisoner. ReceptionRatings= \\"4-D\\" first aired in the United States on December 9, 2001. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.1, meaning that it was seen by 5.1% of the nation's estimated households and was viewed by 5.38 million households. \\"4-D\\" was the 62nd most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending December 9. The episode was later broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One in November 25, 2002. =Reviews= \\"4-D\\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two noted that, while the episode's premise \\"doesn't seem as well thought through\\" as Maeda's past efforts, \\"4-D\\" is \\"worth it\\". Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode \\"earns its stripes by at last restoring to the series a pulse.\\" Furthermore, they praised Gish's performance, noting that she \\"finally [is] given a showcase that makes Reyes so much more than a New Age fanatic\\".Shearman and Pearson, p. 263. Christina Urban, in an editorial review of the ninth season for Barnes & Noble, praised the episode, calling it \\"by far the best of the season\\". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a \\"B\\". Morgan slightly criticized the episode's resolution, writing that it \\"explained nothing. I mean, how do these other universes work?\\" In a season review, Michelle Kung from Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"4-D\\" was one of the few ninth-season episodes \\"worthy\\" of praise, but that it was overshadowed by the show's \\"ludicrous conspiracy plots\\". Other reviews were more mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"C\\" and called it a \\"mediocre to bad hour of television\\", but one that could have been better had more effort been applied to it. Handlen was particularly critical of the editing, structure, and sense of urgency. He wrote that \\"'4-D' shows what happens when this creative team has a legitimately cool concept: it wastes the opportunity.\\" M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, felt that the interactions between Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish were the \\"highlights\\" of the episode, but he was critical of the ending for wrapping things up \\"far too conveniently.\\"  Notes FootnotesBibliography * *  External links  *\\"4-D\\" at XFiles.com * * \\"4-D\\" at TV.com Category:2001 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about parallel universes Category:The X-Files (season 9) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

It was originally built by Portuguese Jesuits in 1575. It stands on the sea-shore of the Bandra suburb of Mumbai, and was the only church there till the first quarter of the 17th century. History In 1534, the island of Salsette, containing Bandra came under Portuguese rule. In 1568, Bandra was assigned to the Portuguese Jesuits. At first, the Jesuits made hardly any progress in their evangelical mission, until Brother Manoel Gomes, the Apostle of Salcette, arrived. With his knowledge of local language and customs, by 1580, two thousand persons were baptized and this number multiplied from year to year till in 1603, practically the whole of Bandra was Catholic. In 1575, a church, described as the \\"biggest and best of all those in the island of Salcette\\", was being built through the generosity of \\"a wealthy lady of good social standing\\". There is evidence gathered from the indulgence granted to the faithful by Pope Clement VIII that the Hermitage of St. Andrew existed in 1601. In the 400 (and counting) years, the Church withstood natural disasters and political turmoil. In 1618, a cyclone blew off the entire roof. It was closed just once between 1740 and 1749 during the Maratha invasion. Thereafter, the secular clergy took charge and the Church has continued to evolve to the present day. After the engineered blow-up by the British, to save Bandra's first church, the Church of Santa Anna from the Maratha invasion, in 1739, the Church of St. Andrew was the only church left to administer to the spiritual needs of the Catholics of Bandra. This was a vast area extending in the north as far as Juhu and included Santa Cruz and Khar, till about 1853. After this date, Bandra acquired the rest of the churches in the Bandra Deanery. While St Andrew Church was being built in Bombay, there was much back and forth over the steeple. The Bishop of Calcutta and the government of Bombay objected to its installation because that would give it the \\"character of an established church\\". However, the church session argued against this \\"slight\\" pointing out that \\"Muslims, Hindus and Pagans of every caste and colour may raise temples and minarets and spires, that lift themselves to the clouds, without asking the consent of the Government.\\" Kolis were originally part of the Church of St Anne, but according to a 1669 Jesuit letter, the parish grew too large and unwieldy. Also, some parishioners objected to the fish smell so the Kolis were given their own parish. Then in 1739, Salsette was taken over by the Marathas and St Anne and its surrounding fortifications were blown up so they wouldn't fall into enemy hands. From 1739 until St Peter's was built in 1853, St Andrew's was Bandra's only church. In 1966, the church's wooden portico was demolished and the building's facade was extended. Every effort was taken to ensure that it resembled the original. Even the height of a round window was adjusted so on both solstices, the sun's morning rays continue to hit the central point of the altar where the host is kept - just like in the original design. Description The high altar of the church extends almost to the roof, and carries statues of Sacred Heart, Our Lady and St Andrew. Smaller statues of St John the Baptist, St Sebastian and the Bom Jesu are above the main statues. The 16th-century wood side altars were carved and painted in popular Portuguese style. The church also has 16th-century hanging wood panels depicting the Resurrection of the Christ and the Assumption of Mother Mary, and a 16th-century pulpit. One of the largest and oldest stone crosses in Mumbai is in its compound. This stone cross is carved from a single stone. Originally installed at the older Church of St. Anne, it was moved. The Maratha Army destroyed the church during the invasion of the settlement. The Church of St. Anne was formerly at the site of the current Bandra Bus Depot. The main altar A small round aperture in the center of the front facade of the building, just above the statue of St Andrew, allows the rising sun to shine into the church. St Andrew Church houses a mini-museum in the choir loft. The church conducts regular masses every day. On either side of the fa√ßade the two towers which originally flanked it were demolished and new ones, having stained glass windows were built with the new fa√ßade when the church was extended. The base of the north tower now accommodates the stairway to the choir. The base of the other tower houses the Baptistery whose stained glass window has been recently restored. The bell that was first kept in the window facing east is the oldest. It bears the inscription ‚ÄúSANTO ANDRE DE BANDORA 1793‚Äù round the outside of the rim and on the body is a cross in an oval. It was used to announce deaths, arrival of funerals at the church and on All Souls Day. The bell that was kept in the window facing north, has the inscription partly in Portuguese and partly in English: ‚ÄúSANTO ANDRE DE BANDORA 1900‚Äù. This was used for the Angelus and to summon the faithful to services and on festive occasions. The largest bell in the center of the Belfry is of more recent origin being presented in 1934 by Sir Dominic Joseph Fereira, K.C.S.S. in memory of his wife Josephine. It was cast by Gogossen Von Humpert, Brilon, and was used daily at 8.30 p.m. ‚Äúto remind the faithful to pray for the departed souls, for the Angelus and on festive occasions‚Äù. All three bells are now in the new north tower. Mother of Pearl The 1669 Jesuit letter mentions a curious legend about a Mother Mary statue in one of the side altars.\\"Once upon a time, the Kolis were fishing in this sea of Bandra,\\" reads the translation.Side View of the Altar \\"They fished not a fish but a statue of the Mother of Pearl, within which the pearl Jesus was found and with festival joy placed it in this church.\\" The side altars are originals - so it's possible the current statue is the same one that was fished out of the sea. After remaining for a time in St. Andrew's church, was restored to its former position in 1761, and has since been held in much veneration not only by Christians but by Hindus, Musalmans, and Parsis. Graveyard The Graveyard of St. Andrew's which covers a very large area, was initially meant for the parishioners of St. Andrew's. However, in 1946, when parts of the Parish were sliced to form the parishes of St. Theresa's. St. Vincent de Paul's and St. Anne's, some of the parishioners so transferred, have still a claim for burial I the graves of their ancestors in St. Andrew's graveyard. Due to non-availability of space, it is not possible to allot fresh permanent graves even to the existing parishioners of St. Andrew's whose numbers have increased tremendously. To meet the shortage, persons who do not have permanent graves are buried in temporary graves. Vaulting of Graves: Section ‚ÄòB‚Äô (area along Chimbai Road) needs to be re-planned as there are a number of overhanging trees which not only cause a cleaning problem but graves cannot be dug in the allotted space because of the spreading roots, resulting in problems of encroachment. Besides the passage in the corner is very narrow and gets waterlogged during the monsoons. It was therefore decided to vault the graves so that the area would be leveled up and easy to clean. Each grave holder is expected to defray part of the expenses by paying ‚Çπ2000. In 1964 the graveyard was rearranged and the entire area divided into sections marked ‚ÄòA‚Äô, to ‚ÄòH‚Äô. Some of these sections were vaulted. Each permanent grave owner was issued a Registration Card giving the name of the grave-owner, the co-users and the grave number and section and a plan showing the location of the grave. It may be noted that while allotting a permanent grave, the property rights of the Church are not transferred but only the right of use of the particular grave is given to the family concerned, subject to the rules and regulations governing the graveyard. As regards temporary graves, permission is given for one particular burial and the family members have no right over the grave.

Formerly known as the Great Forest of Brecknock in English, it was a royal hunting area for several centuries but is now used primarily for sheep grazing, forestry, water catchment and recreation. It lies within the Brecon Beacons National Park.  Extent  The area extends from the edge of the Black Mountain in the west eastwards to the A470 Brecon to Merthyr Tydfil road, just west of the Brecon Beacons themselves. It includes the peaks of Fan Fawr (734 m), Fan Frynych (629 m), Craig Cerrig-gleisiad (629 m), Fan Llia (632 m), Fan Nedd (663 m), Fan Gyhirych (725 m), Fan Bwlch Chwyth (603 m) and Cefn Cul (562 m). Traditionally Fforest Fawr also included the peaks of Fan Hir and Fan Brycheiniog, although the modern recreational use of the name tends to be restricted to the area east of the Black Mountain of which they form a part.Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map OL12 'Brecon Beacons National Park; western area' Fan Gyhirych is one of the highest summits in the Fforest Fawr area  Geology  The area is largely underlain by sandstones and mudstones of the Old Red Sandstone, the more resistant sandstone beds of the Brownstones Formation give rise to the major peaks. To the south of the main peaks are two more broken north-facing scarps, that of the Carboniferous Limestone and, to its south, that of the Twrch Sandstone, commonly referred to as the Basal Grit or Millstone Grit.http://mapapps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyofbritain/home.html? These three suites of rock all dip southwards into the regionally important South Wales Coalfield basin. The area is criss-crossed by faults which fall into two groups. Two major faults which are closely associated with tight folding of the rocks through which they pass, constitute one group. These are known as the Cribarth and Neath Disturbances. They run north-east to south-west through the area and are usually associated with the Variscan orogeny though the origins of these weaknesses in the Earth's crust can perhaps be ascribed to the earlier Caledonian Orogeny. The second set of faults form something of a swarm which run north-northwest to south-southeast and are most apparent within the limestone and Millstone Grit outcrop. The area was glaciated during the ice ages and at least three glacial cirques are evident, of which Craig Cerrig- gleisiad is the most dramatic. At both this location and on the eastern slopes of Fan Dringarth are spectacular landslips.British Geological Survey map sheets 213 'Brecon' & 231 'Merthyr Tydfil' & accompanying memoirs Archaeology Maen Llia a prehistoric standing stone There are many extant prehistoric monuments in the area, and especially two famous standing stones, Maen Llia and Maen Madoc, both of which stand near to the Roman road of Sarn Helen. There are also remains of hut circles, stone circles, stone rows and other traces of habitation such as hut platforms and pillow mounds. The mounds are the large remains of former attempts to farm rabbits or cuniculture on the moorland. There are also round barrows visible usually as cairns sometimes on the peak summits, such as that on Fan Gyhirych but also elsewhere on what is now wild moorland. They are mainly of British Bronze Age date of 2000 BC and sometimes earlier, although few have been excavated scientifically. The cairn on Fan Foel excavated in 2002-4 showed a central cist with the ashes and bones of a woman and two children of date about 2000 BC with a possible wreath of meadowsweet flowers.  History  Although it is an area of open moorland today, it was much more wooded in the past; but that is not the meaning of \\"Fforest\\" in the name. In the Middle Ages, \\"forest\\" referred to land demarcated for hunting, with the right to hunt animals there restricted to the local lord (cf Radnor Forest and New Forest). Bernard de Neufmarche, Norman lord of Brecon, established the forest around 1100. In the 13th century, another part of the highland was added, to the SW of Sennybridge; the two were distinguished by the names Fforest Fach (Little Forest) and Fforest Fawr (Great Forest).Terry Marsh, The Mountains of Wales (Llundain, 1981). Following the Norman Conquest the area was owned by the Lord of Brecon, Bernard de Neufmarche, eventually passing into the possession of the Crown in 1521. It was sold by the Crown in 1819 to raise funds depleted by the cost of the Napoleonic Wars. The entrepreneur John Christie purchased some of this land and subsequently constructed a tramroad across the area from Sennybridge to Ystradgynlais in an effort to improve agricultural production though the venture ran into financial difficulties.Hughes, S. 1990 'The Brecon Forest Tramroads', RCAHMW, Aberystwyth Parts of the area, notably on the flanks of Cefn Cul above Cray Reservoir, were set aside during the 19th century for rabbit breeding for both fur and meat. 'Pillow mounds' remain as the most obvious sign of this venture. These long low earth mounds were constructed to allow the animals to burrow in what were otherwise thin soils.Leighton, D.K. 1997 'Mynydd Du and Fforest Fawr' RCAHMW Aberystwyth Since October 2005 it has formed the core of the Fforest Fawr Geopark, the first Geopark in Wales and one of several areas in the UK designated for their outstanding geological heritage.Fforest Fawr Geopark website  Modern land use  Afon Dringarth before it enters the Ystradfellte Reservoir The waters of the southerly- flowing Afon Dringarth have been impounded between Fan Fawr and Fan Llia as Ystradfellte Reservoir. The headwaters of the northerly-flowing Afon Crai are stored in Cray Reservoir immediately west of the A4067 Ystradgynlais to Sennybridge road. There are numerous conifer plantations on both the northern and southern slopes of Fforest Fawr. Fan Frynych and Craig Cerrig-gleisiad are protected as a national nature reserve which is owned and managed by Natural Resources Wales for its Arctic‚Äìalpine flora.Countryside Council for Wales website Almost the entire area is open access for walkers.

He was decorated with both his nation's highest decorations for valor, the Military Merit Cross as an enlisted soldier, and the Pour le M√©rite after he was commissioned as an officer. He was one of only four German aces of World War I to achieve this double award. Early life Karl Thom was born the son of a field hand. He began his military service by enlisting in 1911 with Hussar Regiment Number 5. He was serving with Mounted Rifle Regiment Number 10 when World War I began. He was wounded for the first time in November 1914.Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914‚Äì1918, p. 215 Reconnaissance service Upon his recovery, Thom transferred to the Air Service. His first assignment after training was piloting a two-seater reconnaissance plane for FFA 216. He patrolled in the vicinity of Vosges until he was injured in a crash in May 1916. Upon recovery, he was reassigned to FFA 48. He was captured there when forced down. He was awarded the Iron Cross First Class for his subsequent escape. He returned to duty for a brief tour with FFA 234 before transferring again. Fighter service Despite being a Prussian, he was assigned to a Saxon fighter unit, Jagdstaffel 21, in May 1917. He joined his new squadron at approximately the same time as its new leader, Staffelf√ºhrer Eduard Ritter von Schleich, who took charge on 26 May. He marked his Albatros airplane's fuselage with a large black capital block 'T' with pronounced serifs to identify himself in the air. The 'T' was in addition to the customary squadron marking of a vertical black stripe and a vertical white stripe just aft of the cockpit; the 'T' itself was on the outside wall of the cockpit. Thom reeled off a string of 11 victories, including a triple win on 18 September, and doubles on 19 and 22 September. October brought changes, as Jasta 21 received Oskar Freiherr von Boenigk as the new commanding officer and Fokker D.VIIs as new airplanes to replace the Albatros D.Vs that had been the squadron's craft. On 11 October, Thom was awarded the Military Merit Cross, Prussia's and Germany's highest decoration for valorous enlisted men. He had previously been awarded the Member's Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. Thom scored only once that month, on 29 October. November was a blank. He next scored on 1 December, with one confirmed and one unconfirmed victory. On 23 December, Thom was wounded in action. He took a bullet in the leg while undertaking the usually hazardous duty of attacking an observation balloon. He was not successful in his assault, or would he ever shoot down one of the gasbags. Thom's return to the victory rolls roughly coincided with Jasta 21's adoption of Fokker D.VIIs, replacing its Albatros D.Vs. Thom shot down five enemy aircraft in June, beginning with his 15th win overall on 11 June. July saw him victorious six more times, Including the youngest son of President Theodore Roosevelt, Quentin Roosevelt on Bastille Day, July 14, 1918. He capped his career with a triumph each on 1 and 4 August. With 27 victories confirmed, he became the leading ace for Jasta 21. All but four of his victories were against the French. On 11 August, he was severely wounded in the hip and remanded to hospital. He was also commissioned on 11 August 1918. On 1 November, while he was still in the hospital, he was awarded the Pour le M√©rite, Germany's highest award for commissioned officers. On 6 November, he rejoined Jasta 21. Three days later, he crashed, suffering multiple fractures. Two days after that, the Armistice ended World War I. Post World War I Karl Thom returned to the Luftwaffe to serve during World War II. He was Fliegerhorst-Kommandantur A (o) 4/I from July 1944- September 1944 and then Fliegerhorst-Kommandantur E (v) 217/I until October 1944. His final end is uncertain.

He previously coached running backs and was a recruiting coordinator at Auburn under head coach Gene Chizik. Prior to coming to Auburn, Luper served as the assistant head coach and running backs coach of the Oklahoma State Cowboys. Some of the prominent players Luper has helped develop include Dantrell Savage, Derrick Blaylock, DonTrell Moore, Terrance Shaw and Jeremiah Trotter. Personal life Luper earned his bachelor's degree in communications from Stephen F. Austin State University in 1996 and his master‚Äôs from the college in 1998. He also completed coursework toward a doctoral degree in secondary and higher education from Texas A&M;‚ÄìCommerce and is expected to receive it in May 2009. He has 5 children with his wife Nikki. Playing career Luper was a 1984 graduate of Sherman High School, where he captured All-State honors as a senior and was the #2-rated prep running back in Texas behind future Cowboys teammate Thurman Thomas. He was recruited to play at Oklahoma State where he played from 1984‚Äì1987 and was part of three bowl teams (playing behind future Hall-of-Fame running backs Thurman Thomas and Barry Sanders). Luper left school to serve as an air traffic controller for the United States Army, before completing his playing eligibility at Stephen F. Austin State University where he led the Lumberjacks in rushing and scoring as a second- team All-Southland Conference running back in 1993.

It was built at Sion and was initially affiliated to the St. Michael's Church at Mahim in 1596. The artistically done stained glass windows of the Church portray the martyrdom of Blessed Thomas of Tolentino, Fr. James of Padua, Fr. Peter of Siena, a Cleric and Br. Demetrius of Tiflis at Thane, in April 1321. History The coming of Franciscans to Bombay= When the Portuguese took possession of Bombay, the seven small islands out of which it had formed had by then partly coalesced. Colaba and Al-Omanis still remained to the South separated by narrow channels. But between the islands of Bombay, Mazagaon and Parel the creeks had silted up. A broad but shallow lagoon occupied the center, invaded by higher tides. But for the most part consisting of salty marsh. The sea flowed in by a narrow channel between Mahim and Worli, while the deep gulf between Mahim and Sion, while the deep gulf at Breach Candy was the only one which always required passage by boat. This \\"seven-island kingdom\\" as some authors wish to call it thus identifying it with the Heptanesia of Ptolemy, was not thickly populated. The inhabitants with the exception of some Mohammedans at Mahim, were mostly Hindus of the Kolis and the Bhandari castes, agriculturists, toddy tappers, gardeners, fishermen. Only after they had established themselves in Bassein and Salsette Island did the Franciscans venture on Bombay-island. In the course of the 16th and the 17th centuries, the Franciscans established several Churches and Chapels in Bombay; among them was the Chapel of O.L. of Good Counsel, Sion. The discord between the Portuguese (the Friars were Portuguese) and the English resulted in the expulsion of the Franciscans from Bombay. =The return of the Franciscans to Bombay= In 1925, the Franciscans of the ancient \\"Provincia Angliae\\" arrived in India. For three years they worked in Hyderabad. The Franciscans of Bellary, formed in 1928, looked to Bombay to ultimately establish a Franciscan Friary because Bombay possessed a large and excellent body of Catholics and vocations were numerous. In the course of 1943-1944, Archbishop Roberts offered the Friars the choice of three places : Byculla, Chembur or Sion. It was decided to accept Byculla with a view of setting up a new parish there. However, it soon became evident that it would not be possible to find a suitable plot for a Parish and residence in Byculla as the prices were prohibitive. A proposal was then made that the Friars should take over St. Ignatius'church at Jacob Circle. Again difficulties, financial and otherwise, came in the way, so that this idea too had to be dropped. In the meantime Archbishop, now Cardinal, Gracias, allowed the Friars to review their original choice and apply for Sion, which, up to then had only been a chapel, dependent on St. Michael's Church Mahim. The Chapel was separated from Mahim, constituted it into an independent Parish and entrusted it to the Franciscans. Since the Residence of Sion constituted of only two rooms that served as quarters for the Fathers, refectory, library, Parish and school Office, a loan was obtained to extend the Residence and erect new premises for the Our Lady of Good Counsel School. By 1957, The Parish of O.L. of Good Counsel, Sion, consisted of about a thousand Parishioners. One Priest performed all the Parish duties. The other Friars were occupied with special work, such as preaching of Missions, Retreats, Triduums, special sermons and conferences for Sisters. As far as the school is concerned, it had grown to such an extent that it was necessary to extend it still further. Another storey was added in 1957.

It is located on S. K. Bole Road in Dadar. The church was originally built by the Portuguese Franciscans who called it Nossa Senhora da Salva√ß√£o.Greater Bombay District Gazetteer (Portuguese Period) The present structure, designed by famous Indian architect Charles Correa, was constructed between 1974 and 1977.  History The church of Our Lady of Salvation is believed by historians to be the city‚Äôs oldest church, having existed as early as 1512. It was built by the Portuguese Franciscan Missionaries. It was later rebuilt as a larger church in 1651. In 1974, Charles Correa, was commissioned to design the new building. Correa's design consisted of a series of interlinked spaces, some covered and others open to the sky, functionally differentiated in an analogue of Christ‚Äôs life. The old church's steeples, the choir loft, the ascending roof and ornate facade were replaced by conical domes connecting the sanctuary (altar), the nave (central aisle), the baptistery (baptismal font), and the oratory (shrine). The structure featured an exposed concrete exterior, minus the plastering. Correa also invited noted Indian artist M F Husain and Anjolie Ela Menon to contribute to church. M F Husain executed a painting on glass for the central roof. Husain divided the glass into several segments for a stained-glass effect and painted the Biblical story of the five loaves and two fish, and the death and resurrection of Christ. Anjolie Ela Menon got a painting done depicting Christ on the Cross for a side chapel of the church devoted to prayer. It depicts Mother Mary and St. John on the either side of the crucified Christ. She also painted Eve and Adam on both side of Chapel Altar.Gudrun Lowner & Anand Amladass, Christian Themes in Indian Art: From the Mogul Times Till Today, Manohar Publications, 2010, p. 172 see, https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Christian_Themes_in_Indian_Art.html?id=RI_HtwAACAAJ&redir;_esc=y The Church building houses a medical centre, a fitness centre, an Alcoholics Anonymous facility and a separate help group for the spouses of alcoholics.

The term has been invented and popularized by Barney Stinson, a character from the television show How I Met Your Mother. Katherine Connor Martin, head of content creation at Oxford Dictionaries, recognized Stinson as \\"the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro\\". The notion Early references = The notion of an unwritten set of rules that govern the relationship between male friends is present in popular culture at least since 1991. In the Seinfeld episode \\"The Stranded\\", which aired on November 27 that year, Jerry Seinfeld says the following monologue, in one of his stand-up bits: = \\"Bros before hoes\\" = \\"Bros before hoes\\" (that is, \\"friends before women\\") is a well-known, slang expression about how men should not abandon their male friends in order to pursue or embark on relationships with women. The \\"bros before hoes\\" expression is often regarded as the \\"golden rule\\" of male friendship, and it has been common slang at least since 2001. It was used by The Office character Michael Scott in \\"A Benihana Christmas\\", and was later popularized by Barney Stinson. The Bro Code Inspired by the notion of Bro Code that they developed in their sitcom, How I Met Your Mother creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, and one of the show's writers, Matt Kuhn, wrote a book called The Bro Code. Published by Simon & Schuster, the book covers 150 rules written in articles of what \\"bros\\" should or should not do. The book was penned by Barney Stinson and also credited with Kuhn, who also wrote the entries of Barney's blog, mentioned in the series. The book was first shown in the episode \\"The Goat\\". Greig Dymond of CBC.ca calls the book \\"a tongue-in- cheek guide to etiquette for horn-dog dudes.\\" At the end of each episode, a vanity card is used to display a random rule from the Bro Code, similar to what is done on Chuck Lorre-produced shows.

The plot is about a boy, Krabat (played by David Kross), who learns black magic from a sorcerer (played by Christian Redl). A DVD-Video encode of the film is distributed in the United Kingdom as Krabat and the Legend of the Satanic Mill.http://www.peccapics.com/View/id,241 It premiered in the US at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2009. Plot When the Plague sweeps across Europe after the Thirty Years' War a boy named Krabat (David Kross) is left without family, food, or hope. An old Mill Keeper takes him in as an apprentice. There are eleven other boys working at the mill, and Krabat develops a friendship with one of them, a young man named Tonda (Daniel Br√ºhl). Soon, Krabat learns that the apprentices are also taught dark sorcery by the master, and one of the rituals (during Easter) lead to an excursion to the nearby village Schwarzkollm where Krabat meets a young girl and falls in love with her. There, Tonda also talks to one of the girls; both seem to be in love with each other. Later, Tonda warns Krabat that the master must never know the name of his girl. One day, while protecting the nearby village from soldiers, Tonda makes an error and his girl's name (Worschula) is revealed to the master. The next day, Worschula turns up in the creek, dead. Krabat mistakenly blames Lyschko, another apprentice. Tonda becomes a recluse and anticipates the end of the year. Krabat's first Silvester (New Year's Eve) brings to light the true horror of the mill. Every Silvester, one of the boys must be sacrificed so the master may remain young. And so at midnight, Krabat's best friend Tonda is viciously murdered, and when Krabat tries to help him he is stopped by the other boys who tell him that \\"there is nothing we can do\\". Before he dies, Tonda tells Krabat there is another boy in the mill Krabat can confide in. He also tells Krabat to take two sacks of flour to the village. Krabat is distraught over Tonda's death, but does as he is told. Bringing the sacks of flour to a tree near the village, Krabat once again meets the girl he first met while protecting the village. He is in love, but does not let the girl tell him her name, fearing for her life. Instead, he calls her Kantorka (Choir leader). During the ritual at Easter night, he goes to the village to meet her, this time along with a boy called Juro who appears to be mentally disabled and not able to learn the trade or properly do magic. When Juro tells Krabat that they must leave and go back to the mill, Krabat insists that he will stay with Kantorka. Juro then uses powerful magic to convince Krabat to come back with him, revealing that he is in truth highly intelligent and powerful, even able to change the weather. Juro promises Krabat that he will help him escape the master, and tells him that his girl must ask for him on Silvester to set him free. Krabat tells Kantorka that she must do so, and she agrees and gives Krabat a lock of her hair, telling him to have another boy deliver it to her when the time is right. When Krabat returns, a series of climactic events are set in motion.

Population: History It was founded in the late 1940s with the beginnings of petroleum production in the area. It was granted urban-type settlement status in 1960. Some believe that this ethnonym owes its origin to the self- name of one of the clans of the Sakhalin Nivkhs ‚ÄúNoglan‚Äù, and the historical name of their camp is called ‚ÄúNoglvo‚Äù, or in the Russian version of ‚ÄúNogliki‚Äù. Others believe that in its first principle it is a hydronym, and connect the appearance of the name of the settlement with the small river Nogliki - the right tributary of the Imchin river, which flows, in turn, into the Tym river in its lowest reaches. In modern pronunciation, these names, of course, are a distortion of the original, for the Nivkhs called the Nogly-ngi river, and their camp, which was once located on the site of the present regional center, was called Nogl-in. The name of the river is associated with numerous surface oil manifestations in its basin and means ‚Äúsmelling river‚Äù; from the words \\"nogla\\" - odorous and \\"and\\" - the river. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Nogliki serves as the administrative center of Nogliksky District and is subordinated to it.Law #25-ZO As a municipal division, the urban-type settlement of Nogliki and eleven rural localities of Nogliksky District are incorporated as Nogliksky Urban Okrug.Law #524 Economy and transportation Nogliki is a supplier for the oil fields Sakhalin I and Sakhalin II, located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast to the northeast. There is also some logging activity in the area around the settlement. The settlement is also the northern terminus of the Sakhalin Rail Network, with the narrow-gauge line reaching the settlement in 1978. Another railway connecting Nogliki with the town of Okha further to the north was completed in 1953; however, this line closed in to passenger traffic in the 1980s, with only occasional goods traffic thereafter.Website about Okha-Nogliki railway, with photos An airport servicing the nearby oil and gas developments opened in September 2007.Report in the Kommersant Climate The climate is harsh subarctic, with long, very cold winters only marginally moderated by the ocean and very cool, short summers. Nogliki is influenced by the Siberian High and the Russian mainland in winters, resulting in very cold temperatures. Over the course of the year Nogliki sees a massive latitude anomaly in relation to other coastal climates on similar latitudes.

However among his own people he was not without his critics, some of whom felt that he had discovered the perks of being a new-age guru to the white community. Unfortunately he also sometimes upset the actual traditional owners of the land where his ceremonies were held, by not always respecting their sacred sites, and by violating local Aboriginal laws.Geomantica 35 Guboo's accomplishments speak volumes about his commitment to Australia, and his Aboriginal community: * Through his work with the Institute of Aboriginal Studies an invaluable record of sacred sites along the New South Wales coast was established. * In 1979 the then seventy-year-old elder first came to public attention when, largely through his efforts, the New South Wales Premier Neville Wran ordered a cease to logging on the Mumbulla Mountain south of Bermagui.

He took part in a protest at Sandon Point near Wollongong demonstrating against a development threatening Aboriginal sites and the area's natural beauty. Early life Guboo Ted Thomas was born in 1909 under a gum tree at JembaicumbeneAboriginal Cultural Association with Biamanga and Gulaga National Parks in the Braidwood area of the South Coast of New South Wales. He was born into the Yuin people, which he always maintained was a Nation made up of many individual tribes. Ted is a contraction of his birth name Edwin; and Guboo, the name he was best known for, was his tribal name meaning \\"good friend\\". Guboo was son of William \\"Bill\\" Iberia Thomas, a tribal elder, and Mary Gwendoline \\"Linno\\" Ahoy. Although he was the third of 10 children he was recognised as a future spiritual leader by the elders of the Yuin before he was 10. Guboo knew most about his father's family, and it was from his father's family that he drew his strong bonds with the Aboriginal community. His father William \\"Bill\\" Iberia Thomas (1888-?) and his grandfather Peter Thomas were both tribal elders. His grandmother Hannah (Nyaadi) McGrath was a [medicine woman] who took him along on her healing rounds, and told him Dreamtime stories. His father, grandfather and uncles instructed him in sacred rites, male ancestral laws and Yuin customs . He was eventually chosen by them to be given special knowledge and to become the future elder and spiritual leader of the Yuin Nation. From his mother's family Guboo had a very eclectic background that he knew little about. His part- aboriginal mother Mary Gwendoline \\"Linno\\" Ahoy (1887‚Äì1959) had a Chinese father, and is most remembered for this by her children and grandchildren. Guboo also knew that she had French blood as her mother's surname had been de Mestre, his French great-great-grandfather Prosper de Mestre (1789‚Äì1844) was a prominent businessman in Sydney from 1818 to 1844, and whose father Colonel Andre Charles de Mestre (c. 1756‚Äì1794) had been a French soldier whose head had been removed by a cannonball in Martinique; his Australian-born great- grandfather Etienne de Mestre (1832‚Äì1916) was the horse trainer who owned and trained Archer the horse that won the first and second Melbourne Cups in 1861 and 1862; his Aboriginal great-grandmother Sarah Lamb, and his part-aboriginal grandmother Helen (Ellen) de Mestre (c. 1850‚Äì1934) would have been proud to see the part that Guboo has played in Aboriginal affairs during his lifetime; and his Chinese grandfather James Ahoy was a market gardener in the Braidwood area at the time of the gold-rush who moved back to China leaving his family behind. What would Gubbo have thought of his maternal forebears if he had known about them? Given his commitment to the aboriginal land rights struggle his feelings probably would have been ambivalent considering some of them owned large tracts of land in New South Wales that had been taken from his Aboriginal people. Guboo grew up on the Wallaga Lake Aboriginal Reserve where he attended the tiny local school until he was eight. Guboo would say of this time: \\"All I was taught at school was to knit, sew, make little johnnycakes and tend a garden. In those days, no-one bothered to teach the Aboriginal children the three Rs.\\" Withdrawn from school by his parents, his education in his \\"Dreamtime culture\\" then began. When he was nine, his father, uncle and other Yuin elders took him on their Dreamtime walkabout from Mallacoota on the Victorian border to the Hawkesbury River and showed him all the sacred sites for which he would later be responsible.Newstead, Adrian, The Dealer is the Devil: An Insider's History of the Aboriginal Art Trade, Brandl and Schlesinger, 2014, p. 79 During his early years he also watched as his grandfather called in dolphins to help them catch fish, and called in killer whales to help them catch whales,Bega Valley Region Old Path Ways And Trails Mapping Project Indigenous kinship with the Natural World in New South Wales (for which Guboo was interviewed just days prior to his death) his grandfather even being called by the killer whales at night to join a hunt.Video Interviews - Killer whale stories - Kouri Whaling - Guboo Ted Thomas Always hardworking, As a teenager he had toured with a Hawaiian performing troupe. As a teenager and a young man he was a member of the Wallaga Lake Gumleaf Band that toured southern New South Wales and Victoria, and performed at the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932. The Gumleaf Band played at football dances, and on the back of trucks at district shows, gymkhanas, and sports picnics on the beach. He used these trips to visit Aboriginal missions from Victoria, up the New South Wales coast into Queensland, and inland over the Great Dividing Range. He would visit the old people to learn more about their customs and beliefs, tour their sacred sites and talk to them about protecting the land and the Great Spirit that sustained it. The band included 7 of Guboo's family including his father and uncles and 3 of his brothers. It was an Aboriginal group that performed traditional dances with sticks and spears. It also included step dancing, tap dancing, hula dancing, and MƒÅori influences, burlesque, clowning, and singing. They were a dance band that made music with gum leaves, an accordion, ukuleles, guitars, fiddle, and drums.Popular Music: Commemoration, Commodification and Communication Selected bibliography of material on the Yuin languages and people Guboo played the guitar, so very different from the traditional instruments that Guboo played in his later years of the clapping sticks and didgeridoo. Career and later life After his music career Guboo then took work on various jobs around New South Wales including jackarooing, collecting shellac, cutting railway sleepers, working in the timber industry, as leader of an Aboriginal work-crew at Warragamba Dam, and as a union delegate at a Botany foundry. Most of his working life, however, was spent as a commercial fisherman on the South Coast applying that special knowledge given to him by his elders, except that \\"the middleman made all the money\\". 58-year-old Guboo, along with all other Aboriginal Australians, finally became an Australian citizen following the 1967 referendum.The 1967 Referendum After the referendum, the no longer young Guboo Guboo sold his fishing-boat after 25 years to devote himself to the responsibilities handed to him by his beloved elders. He moved back to Wallaga Lake with his family. In the early 1970s Guboo and his wife Ann and other tribal Elders joined Pastor Frank Roberts' New South Wales Aboriginal Lands and Rights Council. This experience strengthened Guboo's commitment to Aboriginal land rights and culture. \\"Land rights, self-determination, and cultural identity\\" became his catch-cry. His activism began by hitchhiking to Canberra to urge the Government to make the Wallaga Lake Aboriginal Mission into a reserve and to seek protection of the sacred sites. Before long he began working with the Institute of Aboriginal Studies, recording all the Aboriginal sites in coastal New South Wales. His work with the Institute of Aboriginal Studies was groundbreaking and became the basis of all future land claims along the South Coast. He attended land rights marches in Wollongong, and land rights meetings in Sydney. In 1977 he played a significant role in the establishment of a New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council to co-ordinated the land rights campaign. In 1978 he helped prepared land claims which were presented to the New South Wales Government. After five years of demonstrations and lobbying, the Wallaga Lake community received its title deeds, and he proudly accepted them. If only Guboo had been alive to see the ownership of a much greater area, of the former Wallaga Lake National Park and the rest of the Gulaga National Park, be restored to the area's original owners, the Yuin people, in May 2006. In 1978 Guboo became alarmed about forestry operations on nearby Mumbulla Mountain threatening sacred sites. The New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service, with the help of Guboo Ted Thomas, commenced an Anthropological and Archaeological investigation of Mumbulla Mountain. This investigation supported the claims of the Yuin people, and determined that Mumbulla Mountain is significant to Aboriginal people.IAA Conference 2001 Yet several politicians still claimed there were no sacred sites and dismissed Guboo's claims as 'idle fantasies'. In 1979 the then seventy-year-old elder first came to public attention when, largely through his efforts, the New South Wales Premier Neville Wran ordered a cease to logging on the Mumbulla Mountain south of Bermagui. However the campaign for Mumbulla Mountain was not yet over. His pertinacity saw him not give up. He knew when to fight, and when to negotiate. He believed that he would win the battle, and he did. After five long years the victory was a significant land rights settlement for the Aboriginal people. Around this time, he began espousing a spiritual message, believing that the noisy protests and marches only aggravated racism. He wanted to build bridges, bringing people together through a mutual love and respect for Mother Earth. His work of restoring people's unity with the land had just begun. He wanted the Dreaming to enrich the lives of all Australians and devoted the rest of his life to being a catalyst for a worldwide return to selfless ancient values. He went to the United Nations, and he asked the World Council of Churches to accept indigenous religions. His teachings took him around the world many times, with not a penny in his pocket, and made him friends among many cultures. He met spiritual and religious leaders, like the Dalai Lama, who would later contact him when passing through Australia. For the next 20 years he held \\"Dreaming camps\\" around Australia and overseas to teach and pass on his knowledge, to renew the Dreaming of these places and restore sacredness to the landscape. He spent each January at Blue Gum Flats, in the Budawangs, behind Pigeon House Mountain (Bulgarn). Thousands of people from around the world came to meet him in the deep wilderness and to seek a spiritual relationship with nature. Many non-indigenous Australians participated in these Dreaming camps and were moved and at times overwhelmed by the experience as well as the rustic conditions.Newstead, Adrian, The Dealer is the Devil: An Insider's History of the Aboriginal Art Trade, Brandl and Schlesinger, 2014, p. 81-83 The gallerist and early Aboriginal art advocate Adrian Newstead, for example, recalls spending a full moon cycle each year at these camps from the late 1980s to early 1990s.Newstead, Adrian, The Dealer is the Devil: An Insider's History of the Aboriginal Art Trade, Brandl and Schlesinger, 2014, p. 81 Back in 1988, the year of the Australian Bicentenary, the seventy-nine-year-old had re- enacted his own childhood 350-kilometre Dreamtime walk of seven decades earlier. The walk went from Mallacoota on the Victorian border to the Hawkesbury River, and took six weeks. Guboo walked with a group of Koori kids from broken homes who still recall the walk with awe. Guboo envisioned a nation that has put internal conflict between white and black Australians behind it in the realisation of a truly unified Australian identity with a respect for Aboriginal culture and love of the land as its bedrock. Apart from those in his immediate family, it was a message that fell flat among his own people. While Guboo went on to work tirelessly to bring black and white together in love and unity, his own people mistrusted him for most of his remaining life. He shared the Dreamtime stories from his childhood with all who would listen. His birthday present for his 90th birthday in 1999 was the performance of a puppet show \\"Dreamtime Stories of the Yuin Tribe\\" performing a Dreamtime story as told to Guboo by his grandmother \\"Granny Tungii\\" the medicine woman.Lenka's puppets Ever the gentle activist, in February 2002 he took part in a protest at Sandon Point near Wollongong demonstrating against a development threatening Aboriginal sites and the area's natural beauty. The ninety-three-year-old will be remembered for sitting in a wheelchair and clapping two sticks together. He also identified some \\"sacred stones\\" in Thomas Gibson Park at Thirroul but Wollongong Council took more almost two years before they arranged for him to come from Wallaga to the site and identify them in early 2002. Guboo was then too unwell to walk the site in order to re-locate and identify them and the site was later approved for residential development. Active in what he saw as his life's work till the very end, in his last days he participated in a study about Indigenous kinship with the Natural World in New South Wales. He died at 93 years of age on 19 May 2002, just before that year's Reconciliation Week celebrated the rich culture and history of Australia's Koori citizens.

He began to work in restaurants in his early teens, and went on to earn his stars at the Lung King Heen restaurant in the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong, after they coaxed him out of retirement and back into the kitchen. Biography Born in Kowloon, Hong Kong, Chan Yan-tak started working in the kitchen out of necessity: after his father died when he was a child, he began working in kitchens at the age of either 13 or 14 at the Dai Sam Yuen restaurant. He didn't have any particular desire to become a chef, but instead took on the job because his family needed the money. He was so young at the time that he wasn't allowed to use a knife, and was limited to tasks such as plucking chickens and washing vegetables. He became a cook, and worked at a number of restaurants during the 1970s in Hong Kong, including Fook Lam Moon. In 1984 he joined a restaurant at the Regent Hotel Hong Kong as sous chef, becoming executive chef the year after, and worked there for the following fifteen years. Yan-tak retired from the catering industry following the death of his wife so that he could care for his daughter, but in 2002 the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong brought him out of his retirement to become executive chef of the Lung King Heen () restaurant. The restaurant was awarded three stars in the 2009 Guide Michelin for Hong Kong and Macau, for his Cantonese seafood dishes. He became the first Chinese chef to obtain this distinction, on the first occasion that Michelin brought out a guide for Asia outside of Tokyo. The only other three star award went to a restaurant by Jo√´l Robuchon in Macau. Personal life Yan-tak has two children, one son and one daughter.

This is a 15th-century temple and a symbol of the ancient heritage of Kalinga. The holy Bay of Bengal is situated in the eastern side of the temple, the temple is situated at the eastern bank holy river \\"The Prachi\\" , the Holy river Prachi was named as Saraswati before. The temple is reachable by the roads from Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Puri, Jagatsinghpur and Paradeep which are approximately 69 km,60 km,55 km,38 km and 83 km respectively and is well connected by roads.The nearest railway station is Bhubaneswar and the nearest airport is also Bhubaneswar.\\"Maa Mangala\\" is a Hindu goddess who is one of the manifestations of \\"SHAKTI\\".The worship of the goddess is a part of the culture of Odisha.Before she was worshiped as goddess \\"Tara\\" by Buddhist monks. But when the deity was established at kakatpur, she was worshiping as the manifestations of Goddess \\"Durga\\".She is worshiping in the hymn of the goddess \\"Vanadurga\\". The curving style of the deity Mangala is typical odiya style, having khilana & prabha back to her sitting place.Also the style of temple is \\"Utkaliya Peedha Vimana Style\\"  History of the Evolution of the Deity  There is no written prove based on the evolution of the Deity. The legend behind the evolution has no base in ancient days. The myth is that before Odisha(Utkala) had a good commercial relationship with different island like singhala, java sumatra etc. Demon Ravana was worshiping goddess \\"Mangala\\" with his great devotion and became the most powerful by the blessing of Deity. After the victory of Lord Ram, goddess was taken to odisha from singhala by an sadhaba pua (one who do business with other country & islands) .At that time the Prachi civilization was getting civilized and developed more day by day & was only path to enter Utkala.That's why he established the Deity Mangala in Prachi valley. But the above legend has no written prove this is only oral prove by local people. So that this thesis has become a myth not a fact. So this can't be acceptable has the goddess was taken from Sri Lanka to Odisha. If we have look to the culture & curving style of Odisha & compare to curving style of goddess no doubt curving style is \\"Utkaliyas\\". Temple architecture & Cult The temple is built in typical Kalinga style and is a major pilgrimage for devotees of Shakti cult. Pilgrims frequent the temple seeking boons from Maa Mangala. There is a bed made of solid stone on which it is said Maa Mangala rests after touring the entire universe every day. As if to attest to this, the bed looks worn out in just the same way it would if it were in use for centuries.  Legend  Maa Mangala Evolution of the name of the deity as 'Maa Mangala' hails from a legend believed by the locals of Kakatpur village people. Goddess Managla kept herself hidden under the deep water of river Prachi. Once a boatman was sailing his boat across river Prachi. At that time the river was outpouring and flooded so he was unable to sail his boat to the middle of the river. He spent whole day and night but not able to sail his boat and during early morning, before the dawn, Goddess Mangala came in his dream and asked him to recover her from the water and to establish her in nearby Mangalapur village. The boatman dived into the water and able to find the deity from the bed of the river. Then as per the direction of the Goddess he established the figure of the deity in a temple in Mangalapur village. After this the boatman saw a black crow dived into the water and did not come out of the water for hours and days, the crow detained inside the water of river Prachi exactly in the same place from where he recovered the figure of Goddess Mangala. In local oriya language 'Crow' means 'Kaka' and 'Detained' means 'Atka'. So by combining the two words it becomes 'Kaka-Atka', so during the course of time the Mangalapur village is known as 'Kakata' (Kaka-Atka) pur and the Goddess is known as Kakatpur Mangala. That time before 500 years ago Local Jamindar Roychudamoni family has made the mandir at Kakatpur with all the Sebak arrangement. This Mandir was Made by Panchanan Mitra(Roychudamoni) on 1548A:D. This goddess is very famous with all the qualities of peace, power, happiness, love, purity, knowledge & truth.  Association with Lord Jagannath  Every twelve to nineteen years when the Idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are replaced during the Nabakalevara rite, Priests of the temple in Puri pray to Maa Mangala in the Kakatpur temple to give them divine guidance. The goddess appears in their dreams and reveals the location of the three divine Daru Bramha trees from which idols of the deities are madeMaa Mangala Mandira \\"Maa Sarba Mangala\\" A book which contains real story of Maa Mangala and the spiritual connection between the Goddess and lord Jagannath (Puri). The 'Bhaktas' who really want to acquire knowledge on lord Jagannath and Goddess Maa Sarba Mangala must read the book which is written by Raghunandan Panda, Sebak of Maa Sarba Mangala. He was a teacher and belongs to Kakatpur. He has spent almost 25 years from his busy schedule in doing research on Kakatpur Mangala. He has shared all his experience in the form of his book which will enlighten the whole story. The book is available only in Kakatpur.

The main gym's floor was completely sanded down, repainted (with a brand new floor-design), and redone in the summer of 2009. There was also a complete renovation of the J. Cameron Maiden Athletic Field that included a new eight lane track, four state-of-the-art lights, and new scoreboard. Additionally, new fencing was installed that surrounds the track. Prior to these recently stated renovations, 50% of the high school roof was redone as a result of massive flooding and leaking in the locker rooms and gyms. Beginning in the summer of 2010 a $3.5 million bond will be put to use to update multiple parts of the district, including new bathrooms and new locker rooms at the high school. The following projects were eventually completed at the high school as part of the bond and from additional fundraising; *Track *Lights *Scoreboard *Bathrooms *Locker rooms *Roof *Gym floor *Concession stands/bathroom  Academics  Glen Cove High School is, and has been licensed to award New York State regents diplomas since its establishment in 1908. There are three different diplomas available at Glen Cove High School: the Local Diploma, the Regents Diploma, and the Advanced Regents Diploma. Two departments of the high school, the foreign language and the fine arts/ music department, have long stuck out as quality departments throughout Nassau County schools. Glen Cove High School offers a wide variety of AP classes, including AP Spanish, AP Literature and Composition, AP World History, and AP Music Theory. = Foreign languages = Like most other high schools on Long Island, there are a variety of different languages available for interested students to study at GCHS. Currently, two Advanced Placement classes are offered in this department, AP Spanish and AP Spanish Literature. In addition, SUPA Italian is offered, which grants both college credit and the opportunity to take the exam in AP Italian Mandarin- Chinese was introduced in the 2008‚Äì2009 school year, and the district hopes to make it a point of interest for students looking for another option when it comes to foreign languages. Languages offered: *Spanish *Italian = Fine arts and music = Although both the fine arts and music at GC are quality areas of study, the music department of Glen Cove High School has been a shining star for the district for years. *Instrumental Studies ‚Äì the Symphonic Band, an audition only band, is for students grades 10‚Äì12, and the Concert Band is typically for students grades 9‚Äì10. All groups are led by Mrs. Brittany Rifkand. Each group performs at the Winter and Spring Concerts in the high school auditorium. The Jazz Ensemble, also an audition only band, generally has multiple performances throughout the school year, performing in between acts during the Winter and Spring concerts as well as local community events. All students, regardless of band, perform at every home football game as the Big Red Pep Band, and are commonly referred to as \\"The best bands North of 25A!\\" *Choral Studies ‚Äì the choral section of Glen Cove High School is led by Mr. Edward P. Norris III, and consists of the open Mixed Chorus, audition only Select Chorale, and the smaller afterschool pop choir, The Treblemakers. The Mixed Chorus of Glen Cove High School is for any student interested in an introduction to choral music. Mixed Chorus performs twice a year, at the Winter and Spring Concerts, and is made up of students grades 9‚Äì12. The Select Chorale, under the direction of Mr. Edward P. Norris III, has become a staple among the best choirs on Long Island, and is audition only for students grades 10‚Äì12. A typical year for the Select Chorale includes multiple performances aside from the Winter and Spring Concerts. Past venues of performance include: Carnegie Hall, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, The United Nations, Queens College, the invitation-only Disney Honors in Orlando, Florida, and the Heritage Festival at Orlando, Florida. In addition to the prestigious locations previously listed, the Select Chorale has been invited by the New York Mets to perform the National Anthem at Shea Stadium and then Citifield, and by the New York Islanders at Nassau Coliseum on multiple occasions. The Chorale under the direction of Mr. Norris has won many music competitions all over the east coast, and has excelled at the NYSSMA Major Organization Festival. They have an unbroken record of Level VI Gold and Gold with Distinction ratings. In the past two years they have performed at prestigious events like the New York American Choral Directors Association fall festival and the Westminster Choir College high school showcase. In addition, the several students are chosen to be members of the NYSSMA Nassau All County Choir and the NYSSMA All State Choir. Athletics The Glen Cove High School's sports teams are known as the \\"Big Red\\", with the mascot a medieval knight on a horse. The school's official colors are recognized as Cardinal Red and Forest Green, with cardinal being the primary color. Originally, Glen Cove High's sports teams were the Glen Cove Knights, but attendance at events was floundering in the 1970s. In an attempt to attract more fans and garner more attention, the nickname \\"Big Red\\" began to be used, thanks in large part to the red jerseys of the athletes. Today, both entities have been combined, and GC's team names are the Big Red with their mascot a medieval knight (Exp. Cornell Big Red). Additionally, the 'Covers' has always been a popular nickname used by many alumni as well. In football, Glen Cove High School is viewed as a \\"medium\\" sized school where it competes in Nassau County Conference III. The Big Red have rivalries with the North Shore Vikings and the Locust Valley Falcons, the two nearest high schools to GCHS. Thanks in large part to the difference in school size between Glen Cove and Locust Valley/North Shore other rivalries have sprung up. = Men's athletics = *Fall Season ‚Äì Soccer, Golf and Football (JV, Varsity) *Winter Season ‚Äì Basketball, Rifle, Winter Track and Wrestling (JV, Varsity) *Spring Season ‚Äì Baseball*, Tennis and Lacrosse (JV, Varsity) The 1986 Men's Varsity Baseball Team is to date the only team in Big Red history to have won a State Championship = Women's athletics = *Fall Season ‚Äì Soccer, Tennis, Volleyball and Cheerleading (JV, Varsity) Kickline (Varsity) *Winter Season ‚Äì Basketball, Cheerleading (JV, Varsity) Kickline (Varsity) *Spring Season ‚Äì Softball, and Lacrosse (JV, Varsity) = Co-ed athletics = *Fall Season ‚Äì Cross Country (JV, Varsity) *Winter Season ‚Äì Rifle (JV, Varsity), Winter Track (Varsity) *Spring Season ‚Äì Spring Track (Varsity) Alma mater The Glen Cove High School Alma Mater is sung and played at the annual graduation ceremony and played by the Big Red Pep Band after every touchdown at home football games. The tune of GCHS's Alma mater is \\"Our Director\\" and the lyrics are as follows; :RAH for Glen Cove High School, :All hail to thee. Dear Alma mater, :We will loyal be. :Ever let thy glory, :Shine for ages long. :Three cheers for Glen Cove High :Will be our song'' The tune of \\"Our Director\\" is quite common.

The missions were established as part of the colonial drive of France and Spain during the period, the \\"saving of souls\\" being an accompaniment of the constitution of Nouvelle-France and early New Spain. The efforts of the Jesuits in North America were paralleled by their China missions on the other side of the world, and in South America. They left written documentation of their efforts, in the form of The Jesuit Relations. Establishment of Nouvelle-France and first missions Toward the end of his reign, Henry IV of France started to look at the possibility of ventures abroad, with both North America and the Levant being among the possibilities. In 1570, the Jesuits attempted to establish a small mission in Virginia: the Ajac√°n Mission. On February 19, 1571, eight missionaries were killed by the local IndigenousJesuit Martyrs of Virginia The Martyrs have become Servants of GodNational Catholic Register In 1604, the French explorer Samuel de Champlain initiated the first important French involvement in Northern America. He founded Port Royal as the first permanent European settlement in North America north of Florida in 1605, and the first permanent French establishment at Quebec in 1608. =First Mission (1609)= Port Royal circa 1612. The Jesuits established a mission on Penobscot Bay in 1609, which was part of the French colony of Acadia. =Second Mission (1611)= The Jesuits wanted to participate in these forays into new lands. On October 25, 1604, the Jesuit Father Pierre Coton requested his General Superior Claudio Acquaviva to send two missionaries to Terre- Neuve. As a result, in 1611 the two first Jesuits, Pierre Biard and Enemond Mass√©, were able to leave for Port Royal in Acadia. The mission failed in 1613 following a raid by Virginians. =Third Mission (1613)= A third mission was built on Mount Desert Island in 1613. =Fourth mission (1625)= The Jesuits conceived plans to move their efforts to the banks of the Saint-Laurent river. A fourth mission was established in 1625, made by Fathers Charles Lalemant (as Superior), Enemond Mass√©, Jean de Br√©beuf, and assistants Fran√ßois Charton and Gilbert Buret. This mission failed following the occupation of Quebec by English forces in 1629. The Jesuit establishment Le Grand Voyage du Pays des Hurons, Gabriel Sagard, 1632. The Jesuit missions would gain a strong foothold in North America in 1632, with the arrival of the Jesuit Paul Le Jeune. Between 1632 and 1650, 46 French Jesuits arrived in North America to preach among the Indians. =Missions= Mission San Xavier del Bac, est. 1692 in the Sonoran Desert, Viceroyalty of New Spain. The mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons. Jean de Br√©beuf and Gabriel Lallemant stand ready for boiling water/fire \\"Baptism\\" and flaying by the Iroquois in 1649. Viceroyalty of New Spain In the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain (colonial M√©xico), from 1683 to 1767 the Jesuits established the first twenty missions in Baja California, on the Baja California Peninsula of present-day Mexico. Also, from 1687 to 1704 the Jesuits established twenty- three missions in the Sonoran Desert, in the Provincias Internas of New Spain, present day northwestern Mexico and southern Arizona. The Suppression of the Society of Jesus by 1767 in the Spanish Empire led to their expulsion from the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Franciscans replaced them in supporting existing and establishing new missions from 1768 to 1822 in Spanish North America. In 1774, on the Baja California Peninsula only, the Dominicans replaced the Franciscans in establishing missions. New France In 1634, the Jesuits established a mission in Huron territory under the direction of Jean de Br√©beuf. The Mission de Sainte-Marie was quite successful, and considered as \\"the jewel of the Jesuit mission in New France.\\" More than a decade later it was destroyed by traditional Huron enemies, the Iroquois, first in 1648 and again in 1649. The Jesuits were killed along with the Huron. Eight Jesuits‚Äîkilled between 1642 and 1649‚Äîbecame known as the North American Martyrs. In 1654, the Jesuits started establishing missions among the Iroquois. In 1656 Sainte Marie among the Iroquois (originally known as Sainte- Marie-de-Ganentaa or St. Mary's of Ganantaa) was the first of these new missions to be established, located among the Onondagas under Father Simon Le Moyne. Within thirteen years, the Jesuits had missions among all five Iroquois nations, in part imposed by French attacks against their villages in present- day New York state. However, as relations between the French and the Iroquois were tense, the missions were all abandoned by 1708. Some converted Iroquois and members of other nations migrated to Canada, where they joined the Jesuit mission village of Kahnawake by 1718. The Jesuit mission at Detroit was moved to Bois Blanc Island in 1742. The mission was later reestablished in the vicinity of present-day Windsor, closer to the defences at Detroit. The Huron mission served both native and European residents, with the arrival of French settlers in the area. In 1767, the mission became the Parish of Assumption, the earliest Roman Catholic parish in present-day Ontario.Ontario Heritage Trust Jesuit Mission to the Hurons In the late 1750s, leaders from Kahnawake led 30 families upriver to create a new settlement at Akwesasne, today the largest Mohawk settlement in Canada. =Seminaries= In order to train young Indians to the Catholic faith, a seminary was opened near Quebec, at Notre- Dame-des-Anges in 1636. The first students were five young Hurons, who were followed by a dozen young Montagnais and Algonquins in 1638‚Äì1639. After first successes, the seminary failed as the young Indians proved reluctant to be educated, and died in great numbers due to infections brought by the Westerners. A second seminary was opened in Trois-Rivi√®res but failed after one year. =Reductions= A more successful endeavour was the establishment of \\"reductions\\", villages where local people were settled under the control of the Jesuits. The reductions in North America were inspired by the Jesuit Reductions of South America, especially those in Paraguay. Reductions were first established for the nomads of the St. Lawrence River valley, at Sillery near Qu√©bec and Conception near Trois-Rivi√®res, and later among sedentary peoples such as the Huron-Wendat at Notre-Dame-de-Foy and later Lorette, and the Iroquois at La Prairie de la Madeleine. One of the most famous reductions was that of Sillery near Quebec, which was established with the financial help of No√´l Br√ªlart de Sillery in 1637. In 1645, there were 167 aboriginal inhabitants in Sillery. The reduction was raided by the Iroquois in 1646. In 1670, Sillery was hit by an epidemic of measles and the Montagnais and Algonquins left the territory. In 1698, the Jesuits abandoned their post there as missionaries and transferred the land to the parish of Notre-Dame-de- Sainte-Foy. =Conflict with the Iroquois= The efforts of the Jesuits in North America would be constantly hampered by the conflict of the French with the Iroquois. The Huron Nation was essentially destroyed by the effects of warfare with the Iroquois following epidemic infectious diseases from 1634‚Äì1640. At last, in 1701, the \\"Grande Paix de Montr√©al\\" would end the conflict. Methods The Jesuits in America used methods which were comparatively respectful of the traditional way of life of the Indians, especially compared to the approach of the Puritans in New England, who required a conformity to their code of dress and behaviour. In a simplification, the 19th-century Protestant historian Francis Parkman wrote: \\"Spanish civilization crushed the Indian; English civilization scorned and neglected him; French civilization embraced and cherished him.\\" Jesuit missionaries learned Indian languages and accepted Indian ways to the point of conforming to them, especially when living among them. According to J√©r√¥me Lalemant, a missionary must first have \\"penetrated their thoughts... adapted himself to their manner of living and, when necessary, been a Barbarian with them.\\" To gain the Indians' confidence, the Jesuits drew parallels between Catholicism and Indian practices, making connections to the mystical dimension and symbolism of Catholicism (pictures, bells, incense, candlelight), giving out religious medals as amulets, and promoting the benefits of the cult of relics. Further expansion Father Jacques Marquette with Indians. By 1667 the Jesuits had established a station near present-day Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Illiniwek whom they met there are reported to have asked the French to send a missionary to them in their home country. In 1668 Father Jacques Marquette was moved by his Jesuit superiors to missions farther up the St. Lawrence River in the western Great Lakes region. He helped found missions at Sault Ste. Marie in present-day Michigan in 1668, St. Ignace in 1671, and at La Pointe on Lake Superior near the present-day city of Ashland, Wisconsin. In 1673, Marquette and French-Canadian explorer Louis Jolliet undertook an additional journey to explore the Mississippi river as far south as the mouth of the Arkansas River. During the late 1690s, the Jesuits expanded along the middle of the Mississippi river, in competition with the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Quebec (a branch of the Paris Foreign Missions Society). In 1700, the Jesuits established themselves at the mouth of the River Des Peres. From 1703 a large Jesuit establishment was based at Kaskaskia in Illinois country, when Jacques Gravier was appointed vicar general of the Illinois Mission. He was located in Fort de Chartres. Many of the missionaries compiled studies or dictionaries of the First Nations and Native American languages which they learned. For instance, Jacques Gravier compiled the most extensive Kaskaskia Illinois-French dictionary among works of the missionaries before his death in 1708. It was not edited and published until 2002, but the work has contributed to the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma's language revitalization project with Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In June 1735, Father Jean-Pierre Aulneau de la Touche received an assignment as chaplain and set out for Fort St. Charles on Lake of the Woods in an area now in Ontario, Canada and Minnesota, United States. He sailed through the Great Lakes to Fort St. Charles along with Pierre Gaultier de La V√©rendrye, commander of the western district. At the time, Father Aulneau was posted farther west than any other missionary in North America. The following year Father Aulneau, Jean Baptiste de La V√©rendrye, and 19 French-Canadian voyageurs were sent from Fort St. Charles to Fort Michilimackinac to pick up supplies for an expedition to the Mandan people in what is today the North and South Dakota. On June 8, 1736, their first night out and within several kilometres of the fort, all members of the expedition were killed by \\"Prairie Sioux\\" warriors on a nearby island in Lake of the Woods. The massacre was allegedly in retaliation for commander La V√©rendrye's practice of supplying guns to Sioux enemies.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/aulneau_jean_pierre_2E.html Great Britain took over colonial rule of Canada and the lands east of the Mississippi River in 1763 after the Seven Years' War. In Quebec they allowed the Jesuits to continue to minister to First Nations villages. The Jesuits maintained a presence until their order was suppressed in France. They were officially expelled from Louisiana in 1763. At that time twenty-seven of them were officiating from Quebec to Louisiana. After the Order was restored by Pope Pius VII in 1814, Jesuits resumed missionary work in Louisiana from around 1830. Several Belgian men came to study at Whitemarsh, near Bowie, Maryland, in the early 1820s. They all had volunteered to be missionaries to Native Americans. Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, who started working in Missouri in 1830, would eventually build strong relationships with leaders of numerous tribes of the West, including Sitting Bull, war chief of the Sioux. Through the nineteenth century, Jesuit priests founded missions and schools among Native tribes in present-day Montana and Idaho.

Early life He was born in Dietzhausen near Suhl, Thuringia and attended the Klosterschule Ro√üleben convent school and the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry. In October 1938, he married in Erfurt Marie-Luise von Einsiedel (born 1913); they had four sons and two daughters. Military service He originally joined the army as a reserve officer. During the Second War he served as special missions officer to Generalfeldmarschall Erwin von Witzleben and in August 1943, Henning von Tresckow arranged for him to be an aide to Generalfeldmarschall Guenther von Kluge in an attempt to gain his support for the conspiracy. When Kluge was injured in a road accident on 27 October 1943, Breitenbuch became an aide to Generalfeldmarschall Ernst Busch. Assassination attempt On 9 March 1944, Busch and his aides were summoned to brief Hitler at the Berghof in Bavaria on 11 March. Following a debate with Tresckow, Breitenbuch agreed to attempt to assassinate the F√ºhrer by shooting him in the head using a 7.65mm Browning pistol concealed in his trouser pocket, having declined a suicide attempt using a bomb. A Condor aircraft was sent to collect Busch and Breitenbuch and he was allowed into the Berghof, but was not able to carry out the plan because SS guards had been ordered - earlier that day - not to permit aides into the conference room with Hitler.

In 2007, the project received the Prix Evenir, the Swiss petroleum industry's CHF 50,000 award for sustainable development. The idea for the greenhouse began in 2002 when it became apparent that the water continuously flowing out of the L√∂tschberg Base Tunnel could not be directly diverted to the local river, the Kander, as its temperature of would disrupt the biological rhythm of the endangered trout there. Rather than cooling the water artificially, wasting its thermal energy, tunnel engineers founded a start-up company to use the warm water to heat a greenhouse.

She was laid down in 1883, and completed by the start of 1884. Operational history HMVS Childers sailed from Portsmouth on 3 February 1884. Later that month, she was in Malta on her delivery voyage to Victoria with HMVS Albert and HMVS Victoria when news of General Gordon's death at Khartoum arrived.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 67 The colony of Victoria immediately offered the three ships for service in the Sudan. The offer was accepted, and Childers was sent ahead, arriving on 19 March at Suakin. By that time, the conflict had moved too far inland for warships to be of any assistance, and the vessels departed three days later. They arrived in Melbourne on 26 June after travelling via Aden, Colombo, the Dutch East Indies and Torres Strait.

Early phase Partisans in the Sulemaniyah region Playing in the snow When the alliance between the Communist Party and the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party ended, a wave of harsh repression against the Communist Party followed. In 1977 the regime launched a crackdown against the communists. A number of communist cadres fled to the Kurdish areas in northern Iraq to escape arrest. By January 1979, the exiled communists had established partisan fighting units. By April 1979, the al- Ansar movement was operational. Headquarters of the partisan units were established in Kirkuk and as-Sulemaniyah, and bases were established in Irbil. Later, bases were also set up in Dohuk and Nineveh. The build-up of al-Ansar did however occur without the full consent of the politburo of the party.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 184, 294 In South Yemen, a number of Iraqi Communist Party cadres began military training before joining the guerrillas in northern Iraq. The training was administered by the South Yemeni government. Communist Party adopts armed struggle as its line of action Cultural programme in the partisan campsIn 1980 partisan newspapers in Arabic, Nahj al-Ansar (ŸÜŸáÿ¨ ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿµÿßÿ±, 'Path of the Partisans'), and Kurdish, Ribazy Peshmerga, were launched. In November 1981 the Communist Party formally adopted armed struggle as a line of struggle of the party and established up a Central Military Bureau as a unified command to lead the partisan movement. By that time the partisan forces operated throughout the Kurdish provinces of Iraq. In 1982 a Central Military Council was held clandestinely. It was attended by the Communist Party general secretary, politburo and partisan commanders. The Council set up the overall strategic line of the armed struggle. By this time a decentralized command structure had been adopted, enabling the partisan forces more flexibility in their confrontations with Iraqi government troops. Pasht Ashan massacre The Communist Party made a deal with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), one of the two main Kurdish factions. However, only two weeks after the deal with PUK, the Communist Party shifted its alliances to the arch-rival of PUK, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). This shift of alliance was motivated by the willingness of PUK to reach an agreement with Saddam Hussein's regime. The immediate result of the shift was that al-Ansar was put in the line of fire between the warring Kurdish factions. In May 1983 al-Ansar forces entered the Pasht Ashan area, a zone that both PUK and KDP claimed as part of their sphere of influence. PUK forces attacked the Communist Party headquarters, and massacred 150 al-Ansar fighters and other Communist Party members. A radio station run by the Communist Party was destroyed by the PUK peshmerga. The PUK peshmerga also seized ammunitions and food supplies of al-Ansar. Several Communist Party members, including members of the party politburo, were captured by PUK. After the attack al-Ansar was no longer en effective guerrilla force.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. pp. 201-202 Within the Iraqi Communist Party (Central Command) (a splinter group that had opposed the alliance between the Iraqi Communist Party and the Ba'ath Party), claims were made that the Pasht Ashan massacre had been deliberately provoked by the Communist Party leadership. According to this version of events, the Communist Party leadership would have used the killings to remove oppositional forces inside the party (who called for the holding of a new party congress).Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 202 End of the movement In June 1987 the movement suffered another severe set-back, as over 150 fighters were killed. The report to the 1998 sixth party congress of the Iraqi Communist Party identified that confusion between the politburo and the local guerrilla forces had been the cause of the defeat. As the partisan forces lost their military capacity, they developed into an appendage to the major Kurdish forces, with whom the Communist Party built alliances. The communist partisan forces had de facto come under control of the Kurdish section of the Communist Party. The June‚ÄìJuly 1987 meeting of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party decided to put the Kurdish section in charge of al-Ansar. In May 1988 the Central Committee decided to dissolve the Central Military Bureau and formalize the transfer of leadership of the partisan forces to the Kurdish section of the party. By this time al-Ansar was largely defunct.Ismael, Tareq Y. The Rise and Fall of the Communist Party of Iraq. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. p. 270, 294 According to estimates from the Communist Party, around 1,200 of its fighters were killed during the nine years of armed struggle.

It was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prize of the Festival (the Golden Palm). The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Plot In 1943, the Allies have landed in southern Italy, so Allied prisoners of war are transported north by train. When the train is bombed from the air at night, some of the prisoners escape. Englishman Lieutenant Halliday and American Sergeant Braddock stumble across each other in the dark and team up. The next day, they are given a ride in a cart carrying sacks of wheat. The driver manages to talk Italian soldiers out of inspecting his cargo, before letting his passengers off in the countryside. When they reach a river, they split up to search for a boat. The Englishman encounters a pretty young woman washing clothes. The two men get a boat and start rowing, but then the woman runs up and tells them that an armistice has been signed, so they turn around. They head to town, but it is strangely quiet, and nobody is in the streets celebrating. Then the Germans arrive and take over. The woman's uncle gives the two men civilian clothes and recommends they try to sneak aboard a freight train, which they do. At one stop, they watch helplessly as a woman is separated from her husband, who is taken away with others by train by the Germans. Afterward, they head into the mountains. They encounter a band of partisans, who let them cross a bridge. One of the Italians warns them not to endanger the people in the town. The pair go to the church, where the priest agrees to help them. Refugees return from trying to cross the mountains, driven back by a snow storm. The priest takes Halliday to the inn and introduces him to Giuseppe, the guide. He promises to try to get the entire party, along with the new additions, across tomorrow. He points out a Polish tailor and his niece, a factory worker from Belgrade, a professor more concerned about his papers than his own life, and Frenchwoman Madame Monnier. As Halliday is leaving, Frau Wittels (the woman who lost her husband earlier) and her son Bernard arrive to join the group. Already hiding in the church is British Major Telford. He persuades Halliday and Braddock to stick around and perhaps join the partisans. A radio broadcast announces that Il Duce, the deposed Italian fascist leader, has been freed by the Germans. A disgruntled former fascist heads to the valley to betray the refugees. That night, shooting is heard coming from the bridge. The people seek the priest for advice. He tells them to hide in the woods, but leave the children and old people in his charge. The priest persuades the three soldiers to lead the refugees to Giuseppe. After they are gone, the fascist informant reluctantly tells the priest that he has to take him to the Germans. When the refugees reach Giuseppe's village, they find the Germans have gotten there first. Giuseppe's mother tells them her son is dead, along with the rest of the men of the village. Another villager asks the soldiers to take some orphans with them too. Reluctantly, the major agrees. The group head up into the mountains during a snowstorm. The aged tailor cannot keep up; he lays down in the snow and prays. The others find shelter in a mountain rescue hut. When the storm ends, a German patrol appears. The soldiers have orders to close the frontier, so they bypass the hut, but now the pass is guarded. Halliday proposes he create a diversion, using the major's pistol (and five bullets), but Telford turns him down. Instead, the entire party set out at night, hoping to escape detection. They have to hide when they spot a ski patrol. Bernard breaks into the open and draws the Germans away, though he is shot dead. The others make it into Switzerland, though Halliday is himself shot. A Swiss officer informs them that only children, people over 65 and political refugees can remain. He manages to get authority from the government to let everyone stay. In the final scene, they attend Halliday's funeral. Cast As listed in opening credits: * Ewart G.

Beer, who was Jewish, fled Austria in 1938 for France while his family remained in Poland and were killed in Nazi extermination camps. He continued composing new works until the end of his life, and left a large number of works for the stage. Early life Beer was born in 1908 in Chodor√≥w near Lviv, a.k.a. Lw√≥w or Lemberg, the second child of Uri Isidore, a wealthy banker, and Amelie Esther Malka Silver; he had an older brother and a younger sister. Beer started composing in his early teens and attended the Lviv Conservatory during his high school years. To please his father, he agreed to a contract: a successful year of law studies at Lviv University against musical education. As he succeeded in the final exam (on the question of Lex Salica), he could therefore apply at the Staatsakademie und Hochschule f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst in Vienna. Not only did he gain admission, he was allowed to skip the first four years and enter directly in the master classes of Joseph Marx.Joseph Marx also first had to study law to appease his father. Following this success, his father set Joseph up in a two-bedroom apartment in central Vienna with his own baby-grand piano. In 1930, he graduated with highest honors. Career thumb Beer joined a Viennese ballet company as conductor and toured with the company extensively in Austria and throughout the Middle East. While on tour, he played some of his compositions to the librettist Fritz L√∂hner-Beda who was so impressed that he became very instrumental in Beer's budding career. Their first collaboration, ', which also included the librettist , premiered on 31 March 1934 at the Z√ºrich Opera House and subsequently toured extensively in Europe and South America. Joseph Marx wrote a congratulatory letter to his former pupil, enthusiastically stating that in his first work, Beer had displayed a knowledge and mastery that \\"few established operetta composers possess.\\" Beer was barely 25 years old. Beer's second work, Die Polnische Hochzeit to a libretto by Fritz L√∂hner-Beda and Alfred Gr√ºnwald, premiered in Zurich in 1937. It saw tremendous success and was performed throughout Europe on some 40 stages (including the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, the Teatr Wielki in Warsaw, and the Teatro Fontalba in Madrid) and translated into eight languages in the space of a couple of years. Following the Anschluss in 1938, Beer had to flee Austria and was granted a visa by the French government and he settled in a hotel room in Paris. He adapted instrumental works for orchestras and received a commission from a conductor at the Z√ºrich Opera House for a work to be performed under the latter's name. He completed this work, including all orchestral and voice parts, in just three weeks, and without the benefit of a piano. After the German invasion of Paris in 1940, Beer, who was enrolled in the Polish army-in-exile, tried to reach his troops in England. But the last boat from Bordeaux was gone. He then escaped to Nice in the south of France where he stayed until the end of the war. While continuing to arrange orchestral works, he also composed his third major work, Stradella in Venedig based on Alessandro Stradella's episode in Venice. When the Nazis completed their occupation of France in 1942, Beer had to go into hiding, using the name \\"Jean Joseph B√©rard\\". During this time, his father, his mother and his sister, who had remained in Lviv, were caught in the Lw√≥w Ghetto. Postcards written under false names from the ghetto to their son Joseph also under a false name as he was in hiding in Nice, may show that they survived the Lviv pogroms of 1941. But the end of any communication in 1942 may show that they had been sent to concentration camps, maybe after the \\"Great Aktion\\" (Gro√üaktion) of August 1942 when between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews were deported from the Lemberg Ghetto to Belzec. Beer always thought his parents had been murdered in Auschwitz and his younger sister Suzanne in Buchenwald. His librettist Fritz L√∂hner-Beda was murdered in Monowitz (Auschwitz III) on 4 December 1942. Following the events of the war, Beer became increasingly withdrawn and refused performance rights to his previous works. Still, ' was performed in Scandinavia without his co-operation or consent ‚Äîeven posthumously up until 2005‚Äî often under the title Masurkka.Joseph Beer biography In 1946 his oratorio Ave Maria premiered at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Nice starring Enzo Seri, Tenor and Lotte Sch√∂ne, Soprano. Stradella in Venedig, composed during his years in hiding, premiered in 1949 at the Z√ºrich Opera House. The music critic Kurt Pahlen called it \\"a comic opera of the highest sort\\" and the member of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise Andr√© Roussin adapted the libretto to the French stage. Beer spent most of his time until his death in 1987 creating two new works: the operas La Polonaise (1975) and ' (1987.) Later life After the war years Beer married a young German Jewish refugee, Hanna K√∂nigsberg, in 1957. They had two daughters, Suzanne and B√©atrice. In 1966, Beer earned a doctorate in musicology from the Sorbonne University under the direction of renowned musicologist Jacques Chailley and the presidency of the French philosopher and musicologist, Vladimir Jank√©l√©vitch. The topic of Beer's thesis was The Evolution of Harmonic Style in the Work of Scriabin for which he received the highest honors (Tr√®s honorable avec f√©licitations du jury). He died in Nice on November 23, 1987. Beer's family founded the Joseph & Hanna Beer Foundation to perpetuate the memory of the composer and to increase his recognition by a worldwide audience and inclusion in the standard operatic repertoire. Beer is the Composer-in-Residence In Memoriam of The Atlantic Coast Opera Festival, a Philadelphia-based international summer opera festival.

FormatCrimes and wanted criminals= The crimes and wanted offenders section of the show usually features up to five crimes or persons wanted for various offences, including burglary, assault, and drug offences. One case is the episode's main case, and involves the host visiting the scene of the crime. A local detective takes the host and the audience through the events preceding, during, and following the offence. The alleged offender or offenders wanted are described, often with security camera footage or IdentiKit images. Other cases are described in smaller detail, and are either crimes with unknown offenders, or known offenders with warrants for their arrest. Viewers are instructed to come forward with any information by telephoning the Police Ten 7 hotline on 0800-10-7-INFO (0800-10-7-4636).

While Measure 47 passed, 46 did not, and the Secretary of State and Attorney General now refuse to enforce Measure 47 despite not having made constitutional challenges in court during cases filed against them to compel enforcement. Measure 46 Oregon Ballot Measure 46 would have amended the Oregon Constitution to allow laws to be passed or amended that would prohibit or limit contributions and expenditures of any kind to influence the outcome of any election. Under the measure, laws could be passed that prohibit or limit how much an individual or entity can give to a candidate for state or local (but not federal) office or other political campaign and how much an individual, entity, candidate or other political campaign can spend to influence the outcome of any state or local election. At present the free speech guarantee in the state Constitution, Article 1, section 8, does not allow laws that prohibit or impose involuntary limits on political campaign contributions or expenditures in elections for state or local public office. Under this measure, the Oregon legislature or voters by initiative would have had the authority to restrict or limit political campaign contributions and expenditures, subject to federal law. If it had passed, the measure would have required a three-fourths (3/4) vote of both the Oregon Senate and the Oregon House of Representatives to amend previously enacted laws, or pass new laws, prohibiting or limiting political campaign contributions or expenditures. Ordinarily, a simple majority vote of both the Oregon Senate and Oregon House is required to amend existing laws or pass new laws. Under the measure, voters by a simple majority could have adopted new laws or amend existing laws prohibiting or limiting political campaign contributions or expenditures. The measure would not have applied to elections for federal offices, which are President of the United States, United States Senator, and United States Representative. Federal law does not currently allow states to prohibit or limit contributions or expenditures for or against ballot measures. The measure would not affect the free speech guarantee under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. =Arguments in favor= Supporters of the measure argued that corporate money and moneyed interests had a corrupting and undue influence on elected officials and the legislative process. Supporters argued that measures 46 and 47 were campaign finance reform that would drive out mostly out-of-state contributions that they felt had corrupted the political system. Among the supporters was FairElections Oregon, a coalition of Oregon groups and people working on campaign finance reform. The coalition included: *Sierra Club of Oregon *OSPIRG (Oregon State Public Interest Research Group) *Alliance for Democracy *Physicians for Social Responsibility *Pacific Green Party *Democratic Party of Clackamas County *Oregon Gray Panthers *Northwest Progressive Community *Health Care for All Oregon *Universal Health Care for Oregon *First Unitarian Church, Economic Justice Action Group =Arguments in opposition= Numerous groups organized in opposition to the measure, even while many supported the overall goal of campaign finance reform. The main arguments against measures 46 and 47 were that measures went too far in amending Oregon's Constitution and would undermine free speech protections. In addition, it was argued that while well-intentioned, it was too unclear what the long-term effects of the measure would be on the electoral system in Oregon. Groups which came out in opposition to the measure were: *Oregon AFSCME *ACLU of Oregon *American Federation of Teachers-Oregon *Basic Rights Oregon *Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon *Eugene Springfield Solidarity Network *NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon *Oregon Action *Oregon AFL-CIO *Oregon Education Association *Oregon School Employees Association *Our Oregon *Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon *SEIU/OPEU Locals 49 and 503 *Stand for Children =Election results= Measure 46 was rejected but Measure 47 passed by 53-47 percent.

The measure would have applied to all elections for state and local offices but not to ballot measures or candidates for federal offices. Current law requires reporting of certain contributions and expenditures, but does not limit contributors, contributions to, or expenditures for public office candidates. Measure limits individual contributions to candidates, political committees, \\"small donor committees,\\" political parties, with annual cap for all contributions; limits political committee, political party contributions to candidates and each other; allows unlimited contributions by \\"small donor committees\\" (accepting only individual contributions not exceeding $50 annually). Prohibits corporate, union, organizational contributions and expenditures except through political committees funded solely by individuals. Prohibits candidate loans.

The streams of Nant y Bryn, Nant y Fedwen and Nant Hir come together to form the Pyrddin which flows south-eastwards for 3 miles (5 km) to its confluence with the Nedd Fechan (sometimes also known historically as the Neath Vaughan).Ordnance Survey Explorer map sheet OL12 'Brecon Beacons National Park: western area'  Waterfalls  Sgwd Gwladys The Pyrddin is best known for two spectacular waterfalls, Sgwd Gwladus (sometimes 'Gwladys') and Sgwd Einion Gam, meaning the 'fall of Gwladus' and the 'fall of crooked Einion' respectively. Both Gwladus and Einion are personal names. Sgwd Gwladus is formed where a band of erosion-resistant gritstone known as the 'Twelve Foot Sandstone' creates a lip over which the river plunges. It is easily accessible by footpath from Pontneddfechan (also known as Pontneathvaughan). A notable feature above the fall is an erratic block of gritstone which was balanced so that it rocked - at least until Victorian times when it was displaced. The ruins of a small building close to the falls are thought to be those of a corn-mill. Sgwd Einion Gam, which is a further half mile, upstream can be accessed only by crossing and re-crossing the river itself. This fall is caused by the presence of a geological fault which brings another hard sandstone known as the 'Farewell Rock' up against softer mudstones.Brecon Beacons National Park / Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog websiteBritish Geological Survey 1:50,000 map no. 231 'Merthyr Tydfil' & accompanying memoir  Habitat protection  The steep and wooded gorge of the Pyrddin ‚Äì like that of its neighbours, the Nedd Fechan, Afon Mellte, and Afon Hepste ‚Äì is home to many rare bryophytes which enjoy the cool humid conditions which exist here.

The southern hemisphere's version of National Novel Writing Month, June (comprising thirty days total, including one long weekend) was selected as the month for this challenge because it is considered the equivalent of the northern hemisphere's November in terms of weather and temperatures. This challenge is hosted by Kiwi Writers, a New Zealand-based writing group which housed members primarily based in New Zealand and Australia but stretched as far as the United States and Canada. SoCNoC was the largest writing competition in the Southern Hemisphere. History June 2007 was the very first SoCNoC Challenge. Originally with 35 participants, the challenge marked 60 participants by the end of the month. The cumulative word count was over 990,000 words. In June 2008, the second SoCNoC Challenge was launched. Although only 97 participants had signed up before the beginning of the month, over 140 participants had joined by the end. The total word count for this year was over 2.6 million words. In June 2009, NaNoWriMo acknowledged SoCNoC in the beginning of week 3. There were already 1,108,663 words written by 164 participants. Total word count at the end of the challenge was 2,313,249 by 167 participants. June 2013 was the last year SoCNoc was run. After that the KiwiWriters became a health writers blog. Rules The rules for SoCNoC are simple. The goal is to write 50,000 words on one or more novels during the thirty days of June, and participants are allowed to work on an existing novel or on multiple novels. Even compilations of short stories or poems are allowed. The challenge runs from 12:00:01am on June 1 until 11:59:59 on June 30, both according to the local time of participants, and any genre and any language are accepted. However, for the best possible experience, the staff does recommend that a new novel is begun for the challenge. They encourage participants to aim to finish their novels at both 50,000 words and at midnight [local time], June 30, when the challenge ends. SoCNoC community The SoCNoC forum on KiwiWriters was the official place to receive advice, information, criticism, and support. The forum is available year- round, but for the most part, members tend to peruse the other forums offered until June begins to approach. At the end of the year, the forums were collected and saved to the database so that members can still see them. The KiwiWriters log offered helpful hints, tips, and ramblings to keep SoCNoC writers on track. The klog was mainly written by the staff members of the site. The KiwiWriters Chatroom was available during the whole year, SoCNoC was when it had the most activity. During that time, there were participants in the chatroom at all hours.  Publications  In July 2009, KiwiWriters put out an ebook collection of stories from the challenge: The KiwiWriters Challenge Collection. It features 7 short stories from participants.

It served as one of the many side projects of former Theatres des Vampires vocalist Alessandro \\"Lord Vampyr\\" Nunziati. The band was formed in 2005. Lord Vampyr left his previous band Theatres des Vampires and started to follow solo career the year prior. In the same year, their first release, the extended play Cult of Lilith, was released via Gothic Slam Records. Their first and only studio album, Bloodcity: The Forgotten Memories, Part I (the first part of a planned but never materialized two-part series), was released in 2006. In 2008, Shadowsreign broke up, so Lord Vampyr could focus more on his solo career. In 2009 though, Lord Vampyr and his guitarist S.K. decided to reform the band (even though S.K. did not partake in the band's reunion), and after some performances, they abruptly disbanded again a year later, with Lord Vampyr quoting the reason as being \\"problems of time and organization\\". Since 2010, Shadowsreign is on an indefinite hiatus period; it is unknown when (and if) the band will return to active.

The valley was inundated by ice during the last glacial period as evidenced by the low mounds of moraine present in the valley and through which the river has since cut.  Historical route  The valley of the Llia provides one of the lower passes--summit height --through the Old Red Sandstone escarpment which stretches from Llandeilo east to Abergavenny. The presence of a standing stone, Maen Llia, presumed to date from the Bronze Age near the valley head suggests that it has been used as an ancient trackway route for several thousand years.

A cigar cutter is a mechanical device designed to cut one end off a cigar so that it may be properly smoked. Although some cigars are cut on both ends, or twirled at both ends, the vast majority come with one straight cut end and one end in a \\"cap\\" which must be cut off for the cigar to be smoked. Most quality handmade cigars, regardless of shape, will have a cap which is one or more small pieces of a wrapper pasted onto one end of the cigar with either a natural tobacco paste or with a mixture of flour and water. The cap end of a cigar is the rounded end without the tobacco exposed, and this is the end one should always cut. The cap may be cut with a knife or bitten off, but if the cap is cut jaggedly or without care, the end of the cigar will not burn evenly and smokeable tobacco will be lost. Types A semi-airtight cigar storage tube and a double guillotine-style cutter There are three basic types : * Guillotine (straight cut) * Punch * V-cut (a.k.a. notch cut, cat's eye, wedge cut, English cut) =Straight cut= The straight cut is the most common, usually used on cigars with a smaller ring gauge. This cut uses a quick straight cut causing both ends of the cigar to be exposed. The double blade guillotine is preferred by many aficionados over the single blade, because it usually makes a cleaner cut. Cigar scissors are also used to make straight cuts, and may be the best choice for cutting the cigar with exactness. However, the guillotines are usually the most practical, the least expensive, and can be easily and safely carried in shirt or trouser pockets. Most prefer this cut because the entire cap end is exposed allowing for maximum smoke to exit with only minimum buildup occurring around the edge. =Punch cut= There are three basic types of cigar punches, a bullet punch, Havana punch, and multi-punch. The bullet punch is a bullet shaped device that fits on a keychain. The punch can be twisted to expose a circular blade, used to cut a hole in the cigar cap. This cut is preferred by some, as it exposes less of the filler and binder and reduces the chance of tobacco ending up in the mouth. Critics of this cut maintain that the smaller hole does not allow as much smoke to come out and the hole is often clogged with a saliva and tobacco buildup. One problem associated with these otherwise handy, durable and inexpensive devices is that the unscrewable top is easy to lose, leaving the blade exposed in the user's pocket. \\"Havana punches\\" offer some of the same convenience but with more safety. Rather than an easy-to-lose top, the blade is recessed and springs out at the push of a button. Multi-punches offer different-sized punch holes for different sizes of cigars. Not Considered a Cigar Cutter, as it does not cut (action) but rather cores or punches. =V-cut= A rosewood sided dual ended cigar cutter by J.A. Henckels capable of making both straight cuts and V-cuts The last of the most common type of cuts is the V-cut. V-cutters look like guillotine cutters, but cut a wedge into the cigar cap rather than completely removing it, creating a clean- looking gash. The V-cutter was originally designed for pyramid shaped vitolas. This type of cut allows the smoker to get a deep cut into the V shaped cigar. Good V-cutters penetrate deeper into the filler than straight cutters, and some smokers prefer them for thicker gauge cigars too. However, cheap V-cutters can result in sloppy cuts too deep into the cigar, which result in an uneven burn. History Frederick William Fairholt, in 1859, describes an early cigar cutter as follows: Fairholt also describes a variation on the cigar cutter watch fob: Danger of injury It is possible to receive a severe injury from a poorly handled cigar cutter. In 1999, basketball star Michael Jordan injured a finger with a cigar cutter which some believe led to his second retirement.Jordan wants out of sponsorship business (22 March 2000) Elliott Harris, \\"Fickle finger of fate: MJ clumsy with cigar\\", Chicago Sun- Times, (January 14, 1999), Sports, pg. 109.

Although it was demonstrated in the early days of Raman spectroscopy it was not exploited in practical settings until much later, probably due to limitations of technology at the time. It was rediscovered in 2006, where the authors showed that it was capable of allowing Raman spectroscopy through many millimetres of tabletted or powdered samples. In addition, this research has also identified several highly beneficial analytical properties of this approach, including the ability to probe bulk content of powders and tissue in the absence of subsampling and to reject Raman and fluorescence components originating from the surface of the sample. Theory Transmission Raman is possible because light scatters through turbid materials that do not significantly absorb or block the light. By a similar mechanism to spatially offset Raman spectroscopy, the light in a diffusely scattering sample spreads through the object randomly (Transmission Raman can be regarded as an extreme example of SORS). As Raman photons can be created at all points that the light passes through the total scrambled Raman signal measured on the opposite face of the object is highly representative of the bulk of the material. This desirable property removes a problem with conventional, widely used back- scattering Raman spectroscopy where the signal tends to be representative of the surface and near-surface composition. Because Raman spectroscopy does not rely on absorption and the light spreads throughout the sample, a large thickness can be measured in the absence of photon absorption. This produces an analysis representative of the entire mixture and is typically insensitive to coatings, or thin containers.  Pharmaceutical applications  Transmission Raman lends itself to rapid, non-invasive and non-destructive analysis of pharmaceutical dosage forms such as capsules and tablets. This addresses several limitations of traditional pharmaceutical assay techniques including limitations due to surface sensitivity (e.g., reflectance NIR), the presence of phase changes due to sample preparation (liquid chromatography) or sub-sampling (conventional Raman, NIR). Transmission Raman is largely insensitive to surface, requires no sample preparation, involves no phase change and is rapid. Transmission Raman spectroscopy of pharmaceutical tablets and capsules was first demonstrated by Matousek and Parker. Subsequent research established the technique‚Äôs accuracy and applicability to quantifying tablet and production-style capsule formulations. Pharmaceutical tablets and capsules are typically composed of a combination of APIs and excipients, each of which will produce a Raman spectral component with a relative intensity proportional to the ingredient concentrations. Analysing Raman spectra to produce assay results requires a method to separate the individual spectral components and correlate their intensity contributions with a relative concentration measure. This is typically facilitated using chemometric analysis methods. Transmission Raman spectroscopy can be used as a process analytical technology (PAT) tool for the detection of physical state of the API and for obtaining qualitative and quantitative information about the composition.  Medical applications  The use of Raman spectroscopy in medical applications has been limited to depths of hundreds of micrometres (confocal Raman). Transmission Raman has been demonstrated as a potential diagnostic tool for lesions in breast tissue.

It is available as a hydrate or dehydrated form, as white powder or colorless crystals. The crystals exist in the high- temperature Œ± phase and low-temperature Œ≤ phase, abbreviated as BBO; both phases are birefringent, and BBO is a common nonlinear optical material. Barium borate was discovered and developed by Chen Chuangtian and others of the Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Properties Crystal structure of BBO viewed nearly perpendicular to the c-axis. Colors: green ‚Äì Ba, pink ‚Äì B, red ‚Äì O BBO viewed along the c axis Barium borate exists in two major crystalline forms: alpha and beta. The low-temperature beta phase converts into the alpha phase upon heating to 925 ¬∞C. Œ≤-Barium borate (BBO) differs from the Œ± form by the positions of the barium ions within the crystal. Both phases are birefringent, however the Œ± phase possesses centric symmetry and thus does not have the same nonlinear properties as the Œ≤ phase. Alpha barium borate, Œ±-BaB2O4 is an optical material with a very wide optical transmission window from about 190 nm to 3500 nm. It has good mechanical properties and is a suitable material for high-power ultraviolet polarization optics.Alpha Barium Borate. Roditi.com. Retrieved on 2012-01-15. It can replace calcite, titanium dioxide or lithium niobate in Glan‚ÄìTaylor prisms, Glan‚ÄìThompson prisms, walk-off beam splitters and other optical components. It has low hygroscopicity, and its Mohs hardness is 4.5. Its damage threshold is 1 GW/cm2 at 1064 nm and 500 MW/cm2 at 355 nm. Beta barium borate, Œ≤-BaB2O4, is a nonlinear optical material transparent in the range ~190‚Äì3300 nm. It can be used for spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Its Mohs hardness is also 4.5. Barium borate has strong negative uniaxial birefringence and can be phase-matched for type I (ooe) second-harmonic generation from 409.6 to 3500 nm. The temperature sensitivity of the indices of refraction is low, leading to an unusually large (55 ¬∞C) temperature phase-matching bandwidth. Synthesis Barium borate can be prepared by reaction of an aqueous solution of boric acid with barium hydroxide. The prepared Œ≥-barium borate contains water of crystallization that can not be completely removed by drying at 120 ¬∞C. Dehydrated Œ≥-barium borate can be prepared by heating to 300‚Äì400 ¬∞C. Calcination at about 600‚Äì800 ¬∞C causes complete conversion to the Œ≤ form. BBO prepared by this method does not contain trace amounts of BaB2O2Ross, Sidney D. \\"Barium borate preparation\\" issued January 30, 1990 BBO crystals for nonlinear optics can be grown from fluxed melt of barium borate, sodium oxide and sodium chloride.Gualtieri, Devlin M.; Chai, Bruce H.

Different phases can be obtained depending on deposition temperatures. Thin films of beta-barium borate can be prepared by sol-gel synthesis. Barium borate monohydrate is prepared from the solution of barium sulfide and sodium tetraborate. It is a white powder. It is used as an additive to e.g. paints as flame retardant, mold inhibitor, and corrosion inhibitor. It is also used as a white pigment. Barium borate dihydrate is prepared from the solution of sodium metaborate and barium chloride at 90‚Äì95 ¬∞C. After cooling to room temperature, white powder is precipitated. Barium borate dihydrate loses water at above 140 ¬∞C. It is used as a flame retardant for paints, textiles, and paper. Applications BBO is a popular nonlinear optical crystal. Quantum linked photons are producible with beta barium borate. Barium borate is a bactericide and fungicide. It is added to paints, coatings, adhesives, plastics, and paper products. Barium borate is resistant to ultraviolet radiation. It can act as UV stabilizer for polyvinyl chloride.Koskiniemi, Mark S \\"Calcium pyroborate as a microbicide for plastics\\" issued 01/09/1996 The solubility of barium borate is a disadvantage when used as a pigment. Silica-coated powders are available. The alkaline properties and the anodic passivation properties of the borate ion enhance the anticorrosion performance. Commonly available barium metaborate pigment comes in three grades; Grade I is a barium metaborate itself, grade II is compounded with 27% zinc oxide, and grade III is compounded with 18% of zinc oxide and 29% calcium sulfate. Barium borate shows synergistic performance with zinc borate. Barium borate is used as a flux in some barium titanate and lead zirconate EIA Class 2 dielectric ceramic formulations for ceramic capacitors, in amount of about 2%. The barium-boron ratio is critical for flux performance; BaB2O2 content adversely affects the performance of the flux. Barium borate-fly ash glass can be used as radiation shielding. Such glasses are superior in performance to concrete and to other barium borate glasses.

It is endemic to Australia. Description Schenkia australis grows as an annual, or rarely biannual, herb, from 2 to 30 centimetres high. Flowers are pink, red or yellow. Taxonomy This species was first published by Robert Brown in his 1810 Prodromus florae Novae Hollandiae, under the name Erythraea australis. In 1917 the name it was transferred into Centaurium as C. australe by George Claridge Druce, on the grounds that Erythraea was an illegitimate later synonym of Centaurium. In 1928 Karel Domin resurrected Erythraea, transferring this species back into it, but at the same time demoting it to a variety of Erythraea spicata (now Schenkia spicata). Eventually it was restored to Centaurium for a second time. In 1996, it was decided that Centaurium australis could not be differentiated from Centaurium spicatum (now Schenkia spicata), and the two were merged under the latter name. This was overturned, however, in 2004, based on strong evidence that Australia specimens of C. spicatum are not the same taxon as European specimens; specifically, all Australian specimens studied were tetraploid, whereas all European specimens studied with diploid. The same study also split Centaurium into four genera, with C. spicatum moving into Schenkia as S. spicata. Thus the Australian specimens were given the name Schenkia australis. Australian herbaria have been slow to take up these nomenclatural changes. As of 2008, the Western Australian Herbarium still attributes their specimens to Centaurium spicatum, and the National Herbarium of New South Wales uses Schenkia spicata. However the most recent update to the Census of Australian Vascular Plants uses Schenkia australis, as does the Australian Plant Census. =Common name= Since Australian specimens were previously ascribed to Centaurium spicatum, they were referred to by that species' common name, Spike Centaury. It remains to be seen whether this common name will continue to be applied in Australia now that the Australian specimens have been segregated into their own species. Distribution and habitat Endemic to Australia, it is widespread on the mainland, occurring in all mainland states. It prefers damp sandy soils.

He was Chairman of the Electoral Commission of Ghana from 1993 to 2015. Early life and education Afari-Gyan was born on 18 June 1945 at Anyimon in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana. He attended Achimota School and Adisadel College for his A Level and also graduated from the University of Ghana in 1967 with a BA degree in Philosophy. He went on to attain a MA degree in African politics in 1969 from the same university. He also studied in the United States where he was awarded a Ph. D. in Political science from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1974. Career Afari-Gyan worked as a lecturer and a professor in Political Science at the University of Ghana. He has also lectured in the United States and Nigeria. He was a member of the Committee of Experts that drafted the Fourth Republican Constitution for Ghana. In 1992, he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Interim National Electoral Commission by the Provisional National Defence Council, which was ruling as a military junta, with the hope of returning the country to civilian rule. His job was to ensure that the November 1992 presidential election and the December 1992 parliamentary elections were free and fair. Jerry John Rawlings, the Chairman of the PNDC, who was also Head of State, stood and won the elections. With the coming into force of the Fourth Republican Constitution, a new Electoral Commission was set up and Afari-Gyan became its first substantive chairman. He has successfully supervised all the elections held under this constitution so far. He has successfully chaired the conduct of presidential and parliamentary elections in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008. In the last of these a number of unofficial institutions attempted to declare the results of these elections, with Afari-Gyan stating that these results could not be trusted. The 2004 general elections were disputed in court by the opposition National Democratic Congress. But the case was lost on technicalities. Again, the 2012 presidential election between President John Dramani Mahama and Nana Akufo- Addo ended up in an 8-month election petition trial at the Supreme Court. The opposition leader lost the case in a 5:4 split decision, which held that the President was validly elected. But, the trial, which was live on television, exposed some fundamental weaknesses in Ghana's electoral process, triggering calls and moves towards comprehensive electoral reforms before the 2016 general elections.Mustapha Abdallah.

In this instance, he even appeared not to be conversant with some of the basic procedural steps and rules that are performed by his so-called temporary staff. So far as I am concerned, Dr. Afari Gyan has cut a very poor figure of himself, and the much acclaimed competent election administrator both nationally and internationally has evaporated into thin air once his portfolio has come under the close scrutiny of the Courts.\\" In 1998, he became the Executive Secretary of the Association of African Election Authorities. He was also member of a committee of experts to advice Nigeria on elections. He retired from his position as Chairman of the Electoral Commission in June 2015.

Career Byles studied law and became a member of the Inner Temple, where he was a pupil of the renowned Joseph Chitty, and became a special pleader.Biography In 1829 he published a seminal work on bills of exchange, A Treatise on the Law of Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes, Bank-Notes, and Cheques, which is commonly referred to as Byles on Bills. He is even said to have named his horse \\"Bills\\", so that when approaching, people would utter \\"Here comes Byles on Bills\\". He was called to the Bar in November 1831. He joined the Norfolk circuit and in 1840 he was appointed recorder of Buckingham, and then in 1843 became a Serjeant-at-law. In 1857 he was appointed Queen's Serjeant. Byles once ran as a candidate for Parliament in the Aylesbury constituency, but lost. In January 1858 he was promoted to the bench and was later made a Knight Bachelor and Justice of the Common Pleas. He often oversaw cases at the Central Criminal Court in London.

Industries do not spring up out of nowhere, and home markets needs protectionism to stave off foreign competition. Byles said, \\"But in truth the natural course of commercial affairs uninfluenced by legislation is impossible.\\" He could not conceive where England could have been at in 1851 without protectionism. He was convinced that new nations as well as old nations needed protectionism. He knew individuals and the private sector did not have the resources to create an immense future. Public wisdom had to do this monumental feat. Moreover, Byles called humanity the most profoundest cause. He stated that those who regard man in high esteem should not be subjected to unbridled foreign commerce. In sum, Byles saw protection as not a source of calamity and peril as free traders depicted it, but as a policy that spread industry and brought water, economic life where there was none. Byles tells his readers what is the best part about Adam Smith. Smith's disciples never thought that it was better to encourage domestic commerce over foreign commerce. This would turn free trade upside down; and shake the very foundation of free trade. For example, in Book II, Chapter V, Adam Smith reveals that encouraging domestic commerce facilitates domestic industry more than foreign commerce. Thus supporting domestic commerce benefited domestic industry the best, and this best showed that an economy was strategically organized. \\"The capital, which is employed in purchasing in one part of the country in order to sell in another, and the produce of the industry of that country generally replaces, by such operation, two distinct capitals that had both been employed in agriculture or manufacture of that country, and thereby enables them to continue that employment ... When both are the produce of domestic industry, it necessarily replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals, which had both been employed in supporting productive labor, and thereby enables them to continue that support. The capital, which sends Scotch manufactures to London, and which brings back English manufactures and corn to Edinburgh, necessarily replaces, by every such operations, two British capitals, which had both been employed in the agriculture or manufactures of Great Britain.\\" \\"The capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption, when this purchase is made with the produce of domestic industry, replaces too by every such operation two distinct capitals, but one of them only is employed in supporting domestic industry, replaces by every such operation two distinct capitals, but one of them only is employed in supporting domestic industry. The capital that which sends British goods to Portugal, and brings back Portuguese goods to Great Britain, replaces by every such operation only one British Capital. The other is a Portuguese one. Though the returns therefore of the foreign trade of consumption should be as quick as those of the home trade, THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN IT GIVE BUT ONE HALF THE ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE INDUSTRY OR PRODUCTIVE LABOR OF THE COUNTRY.\\" These quotations of Adam Smith instruct that foreign trade will just give half the encouragement to domestic industry or the productive labor of the nation, but favoring domestic commerce will assist domestic industry in ways foreign commerce could not. This challenges the system of free trade, which is built upon cheap labor, and foreign commerce is the way to riches. Byles not only used Adam Smith to refute free trade, but he refuted McCulloch as well. McCulloch stated that buying foreign commodities encourages domestic industry as if you bought domestic goods. Byles adopted the foreign policy of ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs Rules for reducing a Great Empire to a small one.‚Äù He called for England to give up all her colonies, but to keep India, and treat Indians the same way British subjects were, and to give India domestic commerce and development. He refuted Malthus, Ricardo, and McCulloch. He sided with Henry Carey‚Äôs view that the least powerful soils are harnessed before the best ones are there by saying Ricardo was wrong. In addition, he echoed Carey‚Äôs calling for having those that consume be nigh of the farmer to give him a home market that is better than a foreign one. Those that consume nigh to the farmer, will have an unfailing market, and like Carey said agriculture will become a science. Domestic commerce will flourish only when the economy is prudently organized and protectionism does this. Byles also quotes a 1727 writing of Dean Swift, Jonathan Swift, and revealed how Swift knew how to organize an economy. Through and Through one can only conclude that Swift should be called a protectionist, Byles quotes Swift saying, ‚Äú One cause of a country‚Äôs thriving is the industry of the people in working up all their native commodities to the last‚Ä¶..The convenience of safe ports and havens to carry out their own goods as much manufactured, and bring those of others as little manufactured as the nature of mutual commerce will allow.‚Äù \\"Sophisms Of Free- Trade And Popular Political Economy Examined\\" Books *A Treatise on the Law of Bills of Exchange, Promissory Notes, Bank-Notes, and Cheques, 1829 *On the Usury Laws, 1846 *Sophisms Of Free-Trade And Popular Political Economy Examined, 1849. *Foundations of Religion in the Mind and Heart of Man, 1875 ReferencesExternal links *Biography *Sophisms of Free-Trade - full text Category:Justices of the Common Pleas Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:1801 births Category:1884 deaths Category:Serjeants-at-law (England) Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People from Stowmarket Category:Knights Bachelor ","title":"John Barnard Byles"},{"id":"20935945","text":"The Japan Weightlifting Association is the official association which takes responsibility for decisions and setting guidelines for the sport of weightlifting in Japan.

Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 147 with New Book of Tang, vol. 169. was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Shunzong and Emperor Xianzong. He was credited for setting the tone for Emperor Xianzong's hardline stance against warlords, leading to the restoration of imperial authority over the entire empire during Emperor Xianzong's reign.  Background  Du Huangchang was born in 728 or 729, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the region of the Tang Dynasty capital Chang'an) and claimed ancestry form the Han Dynasty official Du Yannian (). His grandfather Du Hanzhang () serve as a prefectural official, while his father Du Wan () served as an official at the Jingzhao Municipality government.New Book of Tang, vol. 72  During Emperor Daizong's and Emperor Dezong's reigns  Du Huangchang passed the imperial examinations and did well in a special examination on the use of grand language; he was regarded highly by Du Hongjian. He later served as a secretary to Guo Ziyi, then the military governor (Jiedushi) of Shuofang Circuit (ÊúîÊñπ, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia).Old Book of Tang, vol. 147. In 778, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, there was an occasion when Guo was at Chang'an and left Du in charge of the headquarters. The officer Li Huaiguang wanted to seize control of the army, and therefore forged an imperial edict ordering a number of other officers, including Wen Ruya (). Du discovered that the edict was forged and questioned Li. After Li admitted his plan, Du issued orders in Guo's name to have him and several other officers who were difficult to control sent to various military outposts, to secure the headquarters.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 225. At a later unknown time during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Du Huangchang became an imperial censor with the title Shiyushi (). However, he was disliked by Emperor Dezong's close associate Pei Yanling and therefore stuck at his position for some 10 years without movement.New Book of Tang, vol. 169.  During Emperor Shunzong's reign  Emperor Dezong died in 805 and was succeeded by his severely ill son Emperor Shunzong. Emperor Shunzong's close associate Wang Shuwen became very powerful, and Du Huangchang's son-in-law Wei Zhiyi became chancellor because he was an ally of Wang's. Only thereafter was Du made the minister of worship (). At that time, Wang's partisans were apprehensive of Emperor Shunzong's crown prince Li Chun. On an occasion when Du suggested to Wei that he lead the other officials in suggesting that Li Chun be made regent, Wei stated, \\"You, Father-in-Law, have just received a new position. How would you dare to comment on what happens in the palace?\\" Du angrily replied, \\"I, Du Huangchang, have received the grace from three emperors. How can you buy my silence with an office?\\" He walked out and left his meeting with Wei.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. Later in the year, however, several powerful eunuchs seized control of Emperor Shunzong, and because Wang had to leave governmental service to observe a period of mourning for his mother, Wang's partisans began to lose power. At the instigation of the eunuch Ju Wenzhen (), Li Chun was made regent. Du was made Menxia Shilang (), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and given the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor, along with Yuan Zi. Shortly after, Emperor Shunzong yielded the throne to Li Chun, who took the throne as Emperor Xianzong.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  Most of Wang Shuwen's partisans were immediately purged, but Wei Zhiyi, as Du Huangchang's son-in-law, remained chancellor for several months before he was exiled to Yai Prefecture (Â¥ñÂ∑û, in modern Sanya, Hainan). While Wei was in exile, Du, despite their differences, protected him from further reprisal, and when Wei died in exile, Du requested permission to have his casket returned and given a proper burial. Later in 805, when Wei Gao the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) died, his subordinate Liu Pi seized power and demanded to be officially commissioned as the military governor of Xichuan. Emperor Xianzong initially refused but later decided that he was not ready to fight Liu yet, and so made Liu Pi acting military governor. However, Liu was not satisfied, and demanded two additional circuits ‚Äî Dongchuan (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) and Shannan West (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). When Emperor Xianzong refused, Liu rebelled in spring 806. When Emperor Xianzong consulted his officials as to what they thought he should do, most officials thought that Xichuan was protected by natural barriers and difficult to attack. Du, however, believed that Liu was merely an egomaniacal civilian without military abilities and could be defeated easily. He also recommended the general Gao Chongwen, who was then not well known, to command the operation against Liu. Emperor Xianzong agreed and put Gao in command. It was said that subsequently, Du drafted the strategies against Liu and coordinated them with Gao and the other generals. Knowing that Gao was apprehensive of the abilities of another general, Liu Yong (), Du warned him that if he were not successful, he would be replaced with Liu Yong, so Gao fought particularly hard during the campaign. Later in the year, Gao defeated and captured Liu Pi, allowing the imperial government to take control of Xichuan. When news of the victory reached Chang'an, it was said that Emperor Xianzong looked at Du and stated, \\"This is your achievement, Lord.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. Further, Du advocated a fundamental change in the mindset that the imperial government had toward regional warlords ‚Äî he pointed out to Emperor Xianzong that during Emperor Dezong's reign, to avoid rebellions, he appeased the warlords by giving them what they wanted, but that only caused more contempt for the imperial government. He advocated that the imperial government should assert its authority, and Emperor Xianzong agreed. Traditional historians generally credited Du with this change in mindset that eventually led to Emperor Xianzong's reassertion of imperial authority over the entire realm. Also during 806, when Han Quanyi () the military governor of Xiasui Circuit (Â§èÁ∂è, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi) was at Chang'an, Du, pointing out that Han had previously failed as a general and been disrespectful to Emperor Dezong, ordered Han to retire. Han's nephew Yang Huilin () then tried to seize control of Xiasui Circuit, but was quickly defeated and killed. Thereafter, when Li Shigu the military governor of the powerful Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), who had ruled the circuit even more independently from the imperial government than the other circuits, died, and his brother Li Shidao requested to succeed him, Du advocated using the chance to divide Pinglu, but Emperor Xianzong, as the campaign against Xichuan was still ongoing at that point, agreed to let Li Shidao succeed Li Shigu. Despite Du's accomplishments, however, he was also said to be careless and not particularly clean in his conduct, and therefore unable to retain his position as chancellor for long. In spring 807, Emperor Xianzong, while still letting him carry an honorary chancellor title, made him the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) as well as the mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality. Later in the year, he was created the Duke of Bin. Du died in fall 808, while still serving at Hezhong, and was given posthumous honors. After his death, there were accusations that Du had received a bribe from Gao, and the accusations were confirmed after interrogations of a subordinate of Du's, Wu Ping (), and Du's son Du Zai (). Emperor Xianzong, remembering Du Huangchang's accomplishments, exiled Wu but took no actions against Du Zai and did not strip Du Huangchang of his honors.

Currently it is the longest land tunnel for road traffic in the Netherlands and upon final completion, it will be compliant to the 2014 safety standard for tunnels in the Netherlands. The tunnel is a part of the A73-south highway, connecting the A73-north in Venlo to the A2 near Echt. Since the highway is directly in the path of urban and protected environmental areas in Roermond, the tunnel has been constructed to lead the traffic underneath East Roermond's urban area, the Roerdal environmental protected zone, and the Roer river. The tunnel consists of three tubes. One tube contains the northbound traffic, one tube contains the southbound traffic and a tube in the middle functions as an emergency escape route. The maximum speed inside the tunnels is 100 km/h. A little north of the Roertunnel, a sister tunnel, The Swalmentunnel, has been constructed according to the same construction principles. That tunnel measures 400m in length and leads underneath the urban area of Swalmen, a village in the municipality of Roermond. Once the tunnel is fully opened, one of the entry ramps in Roermond will have to be redesigned, because according to safety regulations the final entry on the highway must be 300m ahead of the tube of a tunnel, and the entry to the southbound tube in the Roertunnel ends only a few meters ahead of the tunnel. The plan is to redirect all highway traffic to the left lane before entering the tunnel, so that all traffic on the entry ramp can use the right lane for the complete length of the tunnel before merging with the rest of the traffic upon exit of the tunnel. Construction Difficulties The estimated opening on 1 January 2008 was delayed as the involved parties constructing the tunnel underestimated the technical challenge. A mere 50 security systems had been installed in the tunnel. The tunnel opened partially (weekdays only) in February 2008 with only 1 carriageway per direction opened and a speed limit of 70 km/h. However on 18 February 2008, the first day of operation, long traffic-jams were caused by technical problemshttp://www.limburger.nl/article/20080218/REGIONIEUWS01/802180426 in the tunnels and in the 10 days after opening, 11 closures had occurred in both tunnels causing many traffic problems. Rijkswaterstaat had to postpone the final openinghttp://www.limburger.nl/article/20080303/VIDEONIEUWS/803030326 and construction of the tunnel due to the many malfunctions and closures of the tunnel. Today, the tunnels are still only partially opened awaiting the final test phase for final opening. This final stage will cause a 9 week closure of the tunnel for extensive testing of all safety measures. The closure was scheduled to take place on 5 January 2009 but has been postponed.http://www.vialimburg.nl/index.php?section=nieuws&status;=view&newsID;=135 ReferencesExternal links * Official site of Rijkswaterstaat on the construction of the A73 and the tunnels Category:Road tunnels in the Netherlands Category:Tunnels completed in 2008 Category:Tunnels in Limburg (Netherlands) Category:Buildings and structures in Roermond Category:Transport in Roermond ","title":"Roertunnel"},{"id":"20935999","title":"Scottish Parliament constituencies and electoral regions 1999 to 2011"},{"id":"20936037","text":"Venerable Mapalagama Wipulasara Maha Thera (3 March 1925 ‚Äì 28 October 2000) was a Theravada Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka.

Biography  Johan Bonny was born in Moere (Gistel) in 1955. He is the oldest of five children from a farmer's family. He is the son of Gustaaf Bonny and Marie-Jeanne Lootens. He went through primary school in Eernegem and Moere. He took the lower secondary education at the Onze-Lieve-Vrouw Gistel College and higher secondary education at in . After his school in 1973 he went to the Bruges seminary.)  Priest  On 20 July 1980, he was ordained priest by Msgr. Emiel-Jozef De Smedt, then Bishop of Bruges. Bonny helped founding the community of l'Arche in Moerkerke and remained attached to it as a priest. In 1982 he obtained a doctorate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Then Msgr. De Smedt appointed him archivist and professor to Bruges seminary, where he taught Church History, Dogmatic theology, Ecumenism and spirituality. At the same time, he worked with the renowned expert in Christian mystics Albert de Blaere. He defended in 1988 a doctorate on the Flemish mystic John of Ruysbroeck, entitled \\"Het ghemeyne leven in de werken van Jan van Ruusbroec\\" (). In 1985 Msgr. Roger Vangheluwe appointed him director of the department of theology and, in 1991, spiritual director of the Bruges seminary. Johan Bonny moved in 1997 to Rome with two new appointments. Firstly, on 5 June, he was appointed collaborator to the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. Johan Bonny was responsible for ecumenical relations between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox churches, mainly in the Middle East. He took part in theological dialogue with the Orthodox church, with the Oriental Orthodox churches (including the Coptic, Syriac, Armenian and Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church) and the Assyrian Church of the East. He also kept the relationship between the council and a number of communities or movements, such as Taiz√© and L'Arche. Secondly, Cardinal Godfried Danneels and the Belgian bishops appointed him rector of the Belgian Pontifical College in Rome in succession to Msgr. Werner Quintens.Werner Quintens On 9 January 2002 he was appointed Chaplain of His Holiness by Pope John Paul II.  Bishop  On 28 October 2008 Pope Benedict XVI appointed Bishop Bonny the 22nd bishop of the Diocese of Antwerp. His bishop's motto is The Lamb will be their shepherd (). On 4 January 2009, Johan Bonny was enthroned to bishop of the Diocese of Antwerp in the Antwerp's Our Lady Cathedral by Cardinal Godfried Danneels, Bishop Paul Van den Berghe and Bishop Roger Vangheluwe in presence of various religious and civil dignitaries, including Cardinal Walter Kasper, Archbishop Wim Eijk and Archbishop Andr√©-Joseph L√©onard. Bishop Bonny has called for ecclesiastical recognition of gay relationships, according to an interview published in De Morgen, a Belgian newspaper, on 27 Dec. 2015. The official teaching that the Catholic church can recognize only male-female committed relationships has to change, Bonny said. \\"There should be recognition of a diversity of forms,\\" he said. \\"We have to look inside the church for a formal recognition of the kind of interpersonal relationship that is also present in many gay couples. Just as there are a variety of legal frameworks for partners in civil society, one must arrive at a diversity of forms in the church. ‚Ä¶ The intrinsic values are more important to me than the institutional question. The Christian ethic is based on lasting relationships where exclusivity, loyalty, and care are central to each other.\\" Bonny made headlines in September when he issued a letter to the Vatican in preparation for the Synod on the family in October. At that time, Bonny stressed that the church urgently needs to connect with contemporary society, showing more respect for homosexuality, divorced people and modern kinds of relationships. Some Catholics argue however that contemporary society urgently needs to connect with the Church, and show more respect for Tradition, holiness, and the spiritual patrimony of the Church. In January 2015 he received an award by √ßavaria, the association of Flemish LGBT organisations, for his call for acceptance. Bonny however said the award was unnecessary.

Charles Fortune and Sarah C. (Lewis) Brown.Leonard 89 His father was a popular Episcopal missionary and priest who authored Christ on the Throne of Power and Antichrist: A Treatise on the Book of Revelation, to St. John the Divine in 1885. Given his Episcopal upbringing, in 1883, Arthur attended and graduated Hobart College,Hobart 249 the oldest Episcopal college in America.Brown 1 In 1896, he assumed a teaching post with Haverford College in Pennsylvania,Haverford xviii where he began his studies of the legends of King Arthur. He returned to school at Harvard, earning his Ph.D in 1900, and continued his post-doctoral work as a Rogers Traveling Fellow of Harvard at Universities of Paris and Freiburg 1900-1901. His doctoral dissertation attempted to find a connection between the story of King Arthur and Celtic folklore. The thesis, ‚ÄúThe Round Table Before Wace‚Äù is still often quoted and argued among scholars and historians. As a graduate student at Harvard, Brown had stated that ‚Äúhe detested the elective system‚Äù in American education, which Harvard President Eliot had indoctrinated, and throughout his career he would maintain that a true liberal education could only be one that embraced ‚Äúthe 'noble' subjects, Latin and Greek, mathematics, and philosophy.‚Äù On June 15, 1907, Arthur married Octavia Crenshaw, from Richmond, Virginia,The Harvard Graduates' Magazine 200 and they settled in Evanston, Illinois where Brown was Professor of English at Northwestern University from 1906-1939. During this tenure, he produced one to two articles annually, most of which pertained to Arthurian legends and Celtic folklore. Brown's one great interest of his scholarly life was the effort to find the origin of the Arthurian romances, resulting in a voluminous outpouring of articles, books and reviews under variations of his name. On June 28, 1946, as he was turning his bicycle from a connecting into a main road, Brown was struck by a passing car. Although he declared himself unhurt, and wanted to remount and continue, he was carried protesting to a Dubuque hospital and died a few hours later of a fractured skull. He was 76 years old.

It was Alther's first published work, and the \\"subject of considerable pre-publication hyperbole.\\" Plot summary The novel starts with a first-person reflection on her life so far by the protagonist, Virginia \\"Ginny\\" Hull Babcock Bliss, as she catches a plane to look after her gravely ill mother. From then on, dated chapters in third person alternate with Ginny's non-linear first-person reminiscences of her childhood, her teenage years, her college years, her marriage, and beyond.

It was \\"the subject of considerable pre-publication hyperbole..., soaring in the slip stream of Fear of Flying, Erica Jong's bestselling hymn to the body electric.

It strikes a blow for the picara by putting a heroine through the same paces that once animated a Tom Jones or a Holden Caulfield.

The initial symptom is typically enlargement of the hands and feet. There may also be an enlargement of the forehead, jaw, and nose. Other symptoms may include joint pain, thicker skin, deepening of the voice, headaches, and problems with vision. Complications of the disease may include type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. Acromegaly is usually caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone. In more than 95% of cases the excess production is due to a benign tumor, known as a pituitary adenoma. The condition is not inherited from a person's parents. Acromegaly is rarely due to a tumor in another part of the body. Diagnosis is by measuring growth hormone after a person has drunk a glucose solution, or by measuring insulin-like growth factor I in the blood. After diagnosis, medical imaging of the pituitary is carried out to determine if an adenoma is present. If excess growth hormone is produced during childhood, the result is the condition gigantism rather than acromegaly. Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor, medications, and radiation therapy. Surgery is usually the preferred treatment; the smaller the tumor, the more likely surgery will be curative. If surgery is contraindicated or not curative, somatostatin analogues or GH receptor antagonists may be used. Radiation therapy may be used if neither surgery nor medications are completely effective. Without treatment, life expectancy is reduced by 10 years; with treatment, life expectancy is not reduced. Acromegaly affects about 6 per 100,000 people. It is most commonly diagnosed in middle age. Males and females are affected with equal frequency. It was first described in the medical literature by Nicolas Saucerotte in 1772. The term is from Greek akron meaning \\"extremity\\" and mega meaning \\"large\\". Signs and symptoms Features that may result from a high level of GH or expanding tumor include: * Headaches ‚Äì often severe and prolonged * Soft tissue swelling visibly resulting in enlargement of the hands, feet, nose, lips and ears, and a general thickening of the skin * Soft tissue swelling of internal organs, notably the heart with attendant weakening of its muscularity, and the kidneys, also the vocal cords resulting in a characteristic thick, deep voice and slowing of speech * Generalized expansion of the skull at the fontanelle * Pronounced brow protrusion, often with ocular distension (frontal bossing) * Pronounced lower jaw protrusion (prognathism) with attendant macroglossia (enlargement of the tongue) and teeth spacing * Hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation and hyperhidrosis may occur in these people. * Skin tags * Carpal tunnel syndrome =Complications= * Problems with bones and joints, including osteoarthritis, nerve compression syndrome due to bony overgrowth, and carpal tunnel syndrome * Hypertension * Diabetes mellitus * Cardiomyopathy, potentially leading to heart failure * Colorectal cancer * Sleep Apnea * Thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer * Hypogonadism * Compression of the optic chiasm by the growth of pituitary adenoma leading to visual problems CausesPituitary adenoma= About 98% of cases of acromegaly are due to the overproduction of growth hormone by a benign tumor of the pituitary gland called an adenoma. These tumors produce excessive growth hormone and compress surrounding brain tissues as they grow larger. In some cases, they may compress the optic nerves. Expansion of the tumor may cause headaches and visual disturbances. In addition, compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones, leading to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and impotence in men because of reduced testosterone production. A marked variation in rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor occurs. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the sinuses, which are located near the pituitary. In general, younger people tend to have more aggressive tumors. Most pituitary tumors arise spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. Many pituitary tumors arise from a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell that leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth but is acquired during life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells; it permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete growth hormones. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research. Pituitary adenomas and diffuse somatomammotroph hyperplasia may result from somatic activating mutations GNAS, which may be acquired or associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. =Other tumors= In a few people, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors, but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and adrenal glands. These tumors also lead to an excess of GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH (growth hormone releasing hormone), the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. In these people, the excess GHRH can be measured in the blood and establishes that the cause of the acromegaly is not due to a pituitary defect. When these nonpituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve. In people with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Therefore, it is important that physicians carefully analyze all \\"pituitary tumors\\" removed from people with acromegaly so as to not overlook the possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder. Diagnosis Frequent serum GH measurements in normal subjects (left panel) demonstrate that GH can fluctuate between undetectable levels most of the time intersperse with peaks of up to 30 Œºg/l (90 mIU/l); in acromegaly (right panel) GH hypersecretion is continuous with no undetectable levels. If acromegaly is suspected, medical laboratory investigations followed by medical imaging if the lab tests are positive confirms or rules out the presence of this condition. IGF1 provides the most sensitive lab test for the diagnosis of acromegaly, and a GH suppression test following an oral glucose load, which is a very specific lab test, will confirm the diagnosis following a positive screening test for IGF1. A single value of the GH is not useful in view of its pulsatality (levels in the blood vary greatly even in healthy individuals).Magnetic resonance image of a pituitary macroadenoma that caused acromegaly with compression of the optic chiasm GH levels taken 2 hours after a 75- or 100-gram glucose tolerance test are helpful in the diagnosis: GH levels are suppressed below 1 Œºg/l in normal people, and levels higher than this cutoff are confirmatory of acromegaly. Other pituitary hormones must be assessed to address the secretory effects of the tumor, as well as the mass effect of the tumor on the normal pituitary gland. They include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), gonadotropic hormones (FSH, LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin. An MRI of the brain focusing on the sella turcica after gadolinium administration allows for clear delineation of the pituitary and the hypothalamus and the location of the tumor. A number of other overgrowth syndromes can result in similar problems. =Differential diagnosis= Pseudoacromegaly is a condition with the usual acromegaloid features, but without an increase in growth hormone and IGF-1. It is frequently associated with insulin resistance. Cases have been reported due to minoxidil at an unusually high dose. It can also be caused by a selective post receptor defect of insulin signalling, leading to the impairment of metabolic, but preservation of mitogenic, signalling. Treatment Site of action of the different therapeutic tools in acromegaly. Surgery, radiotherapy, somatostatin analogues and dopamine agonists act at the level of the pituitary adenoma, while GH receptor antagonists act in the periphery by blocking the growth hormone receptor and thus impairing the effects of GH on the different tissues. The goals of treatment are to reduce GH production to normal levels thereby reversing or ameliorating the signs and symptoms of acromegaly, to relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor exerts on the surrounding brain areas, and to preserve normal pituitary function. Currently, treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor, drug therapy, and radiation therapy of the pituitary. =Medications=Somatostatin analogues The primary current medical treatment of acromegaly is to use somatostatin analogues ‚Äì octreotide (Sandostatin) or lanreotide (Somatuline). These somatostatin analogues are synthetic forms of a brain hormone, somatostatin, which stops GH production. The long-acting forms of these drugs must be injected every 2 to 4 weeks for effective treatment. Most people with acromegaly respond to this medication. In many people with acromegaly, GH levels fall within one hour and headaches improve within minutes after the injection. Octreotide and lanreotide are effective for long-term treatment. Octreotide and lanreotide have also been used successfully to treat people with acromegaly caused by non-pituitary tumors. Somatostatin analogues are also sometimes used to shrink large tumors before surgery. Because octreotide inhibits gastrointestinal and pancreatic function, long-term use causes digestive problems such as loose stools, nausea, and gas in one third of people. In addition, approximately 25 percent of people with acromegaly develop gallstones, which are usually asymptomatic. In some cases, octreotide treatment can cause diabetes due to the fact that somatostatin and its analogues can inhibit the release of insulin. Dopamine agonists For those who are unresponsive to somatostatin analogues, or for whom they are otherwise contraindicated, it is possible to treat using one of the dopamine agonists, bromocriptine or cabergoline. As tablets rather than injections, they cost considerably less. These drugs can also be used as an adjunct to somatostatin analogue therapy. They are most effective in those whose pituitary tumours cosecrete prolactin. Side effects of these dopamine agonists include gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness when standing, and nasal congestion. These side effects can be reduced or eliminated if medication is started at a very low dose at bedtime, taken with food, and gradually increased to the full therapeutic dose. Bromocriptine lowers GH and IGF-1 levels and reduces tumor size in fewer than half of people with acromegaly. Some people report improvement in their symptoms although their GH and IGF-1 levels still are elevated. Growth hormone receptor antagonists The latest development in the medical treatment of acromegaly is the use of growth hormone receptor antagonists. The only available member of this family is pegvisomant (Somavert). By blocking the action of the endogenous growth hormone molecules, this compound is able to control disease activity of acromegaly in virtually everyone with acromegaly. Pegvisomant has to be administered subcutaneously by daily injections. Combinations of long- acting somatostatin analogues and weekly injections of pegvisomant seem to be equally effective as daily injections of pegvisomant. =Surgery= Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor is usually effective in lowering growth hormone levels. Two surgical procedures are available for use. The first is endonasal transphenoidal surgery, which involves the surgeon reaching the pituitary through an incision in the nasal cavity wall. The wall is reached by passing through the nostrils with microsurgical instruments. The second method is transphenoidal surgery during which an incision is made into the gum beneath the upper lip. Further incisions are made to cut through the septum to reach the nasal cavity, where the pituitary is located. Endonasal transphenoidal surgery is a less invasive procedure with a shorter recovery time than the older method of transphenoidal surgery, and the likelihood of removing the entire tumor is greater with reduced side effects. Consequently, endonasal transphenoidal surgery is the more common surgical choice. These procedures normally relieve the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and lead to a lowering of GH levels. Surgery is most successful in people with blood GH levels below 40 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 mm in diameter. Success depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. The success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. Ideally, GH should be less than 2 ng/ml after an oral glucose load. A review of GH levels in 1,360 people worldwide immediately after surgery revealed that 60% had random GH levels below 5 ng/ml. Complications of surgery may include cerebrospinal fluid leaks, meningitis, or damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, requiring lifelong pituitary hormone replacement. Even when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, people must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence. More commonly, hormone levels may improve, but not return completely to normal. These people may then require additional treatment, usually with medications. =Radiation therapy= Radiation therapy has been used both as a primary treatment and combined with surgery or drugs. It is usually reserved for people who have tumor remaining after surgery. These people often also receive medication to lower GH levels. Radiation therapy is given in divided doses over four to six weeks. This treatment lowers GH levels by about 50 percent over 2 to 5 years. People monitored for more than 5 years show significant further improvement. Radiation therapy causes a gradual loss of production of other pituitary hormones with time. Loss of vision and brain injury, which have been reported, are very rare complications of radiation treatments. =Selection of treatment= The initial treatment chosen should be individualized depending on the person's characteristics, such as age and tumor size. If the tumor has not yet invaded surrounding brain tissues, removal of the pituitary adenoma by an experienced neurosurgeon is usually the first choice. After surgery, a person must be monitored long-term for increasing GH levels. If surgery does not normalize hormone levels or a relapse occurs, a doctor will usually begin additional drug therapy. The current first choice is generally octreotide or lanreotide; however, bromocriptine and cabergoline are both cheaper and easier to administer. With all of these medications, long-term therapy is necessary, because their withdrawal can lead to rising GH levels and tumor re-expansion. Radiation therapy is generally used for people whose tumors are not completely removed by surgery, for people who are not good candidates for surgery because of other health problems, and for people who do not respond adequately to surgery and medication. Prognosis Life expectancy of people with acromegaly is dependent on how early the disease is detected. Life expectancy after the successful treatment of early disease is equal to that of the general population. Acromegaly can often go on for years before diagnosis, resulting in poorer outcome, and it is suggested that the better the growth hormone is controlled, the better the outcome. Upon successful surgical treatment, headaches and visual symptoms tend to resolve. One exception is sleep apnea, which is present in around 70% of cases, but does not tend to resolve with successful treatment of growth hormone level. While hypertension is a complication of 40% of cases, it typically responds well to regular regimens of blood pressure medication. Diabetes that occurs with acromegaly is treated with the typical medications, but successful lowering of growth hormone levels often alleviates symptoms of diabetes. Hypogonadism without gonad destruction is reversible with treatment.

Lewis was also part of the Swansea team that beat the touring South Africa team in 1912.  Rugby career  Lewis joined Swansea in 1910 and in 1912 was part of the team that faced the touring South Africa national rugby union team. Swansea won the game by a single try, made more impressive by the fact that Lewis was off the field for a quarter of the match. During the game, Lewis took a blow on the bridge of his nose and when he confronted the perpetrator took another blow to his chest which staggered him. Lewis was removed from play to receive treatment, but no action was taken against South Africa. While Lewis was off the pitch, George Hayward was forced to switch to the wing, as substitutions were not part of the rules. Lewis returned to the pitch after twenty minutes to finish the game.Billot (1974), pg 121. Lewis made his Welsh international debut on 1 February 1913 against Scotland as part of the Five Nations Championship. Lewis was one of five new Welsh caps on the day, after a poor game to England in the opening match of the tournament. The very inexperienced team played well under the captaincy of Billy Trew and Wales won 8-0. Lewis was reselected for the remaining two games of the Championship, both resulting in Welsh wins, away to France and at home to Ireland. Lewis's last game was the opening match of the 1914 Championship, which saw Wales lose narrowly at Twickenham to England. In 1914 Lewis was given the captaincy of Swansea, but the outbreak of World War I halted the regular playing of rugby in Great Britain. In 1915, Lewis was captain of a West Wales team that faced an ANZAC team at St. Helens, During the war, Lewis reached the rank of captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers, returning to yet again captain Swansea in peacetime during the 1919/1920 season. He retired from rugby in 1920. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 468. * 1914 * 1913 * 1913 * 1913  Bibliography   *  References  Category:1888 births Category:1971 deaths Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:People from Pontardawe Category:Royal Welch Fusiliers officers Category:Rugby union wings Category:Swansea RFC players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Welsh rugby union players ","title":"Howell Lewis"},{"id":"20936267","text":"Lev Oskarovich Arnshtam (; 15 January 1905 ‚Äì 26 December 1979) was a Soviet film director and screenwriter.
