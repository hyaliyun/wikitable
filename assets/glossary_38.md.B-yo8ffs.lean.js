Wesley College is under the control of a Board of Governors, appointed each year by the Methodist Church in Ireland. Wesley College was founded on 1 October 1845 and counts two Nobel laureates among its alumni. Strong emphasis is put on religious education for all denominations and both extra-curricular activities and sport play an important part in this school. The college offers pupils an opportunity to explore the humanities, sciences, technology, business studies, English literature, music and the arts. Wesley College offers a range of extracurricular and sporting activities in the belief that these assist a \\"sound general education and contribute to the whole person\\". History =Origins= On 16 May 1844, a gathering of men met in Belfast and agreed to form a Wesleyan Proprietary Grammar School in Ireland \\"for the purpose of affording a thorough literary, scientific and commercial education, with a sound, religious, and moral training, in strict accordance with the principles of Wesleyan Methodism\\". The committee originally proposed a boarding and day school for boys, in the vicinity of Belfast but later decided that the Wesleyan Connexional School should be established in Dublin which was the hub of Ireland's transport system and had a far greater population. A large dilapidated dwelling house, No. 79 St. Stephen's Green, sited on what is now part of the Department of Foreign Affairs, was leased from the trustees of The King's Hospital. The Wesleyan Connexional School was founded in 1845 in St. Stephen's Green, Dublin by a group of Methodist Ministers and other men for the Methodist Community in Ireland. In 1879 the Methodist Conference granted the request of the School's Trustees that it would be named Wesley College. =Development= In June 1911 the Wesley College Trustees put the following proposal to the Methodist Conference, \\"This committee, having had the fact brought under their notice that at the present time there is no school in the three southern provinces under the Methodist Management offering to girls the advantages of an Intermediate education, suggests to the Conference that the present is a suitable occasion for opening Wesley College to girls who desire to secure such training as will fit them for professional and business careers\\". The Conference responded favourably and the Trustees purchased No. 110 St. Stephen's Green as a girls' hostel. It had formerly been known as \\"The Epworth Club\\", a boarding house for young Epworth business men coming to Dublin, which had ceased to serve its purposes. The hostel was called Epworth House. Six boarder girls and fifteen day-girls, together with the new boys, joined the 175 (approximately) boys already in the College in September 1911. Right up to the 1940s co-education was narrowly interpreted and strictly supervised. The boys were always called by their surnames, while the girls had their surnames prefixed by \\"Miss\\". Casual conversation between the boys and girls was discouraged and they did not have meals together until the 1950s.Armitage, Robert Ernest. Wesley College, Dublin, 1845-1995: An Illustrated History =Move to Ballinteer= In 1969 Wesley College moved to its present site in Ballinteer, a suburb of Dublin, at the foothills of the Dublin mountains. The final school activity on the old College site was the end-of-year service in the Large Schoolroom on 14 June 1969, followed by a celebration of Holy Communion in the chapel. The official opening and dedication of the new buildings at Ludford Park took place at 3.00 p.m. on Saturday, 7 June 1969, opened by √âamon de Valera, President of Ireland. The 1969 campus was added to in 1980, 1987, and 1991, a state of the art library and Information Technology building was added in 1999 and a new modern music and arts centre as well as a Materials Technology suite were opened in 2005. In 2019 a state of the art sports centre was opened. School coat of arms Old school coat of arms In 1969 the College obtained from the Chief Herald an official grant of arms, which replaced that previously used. The upper part of the shield has a red ground, and bears the Bible, surmounted by a Maltese cross, an old Wesley College symbol. To the right is an escallop shell from the arms of John Wesley's family. The lower part of the shield has a blue ground and on it a flaming castle from the Dublin City arms. The scroll below the shield contains the College motto in Greek, \\"Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.\\" (I Thessalonians 5.21) Extracurricular activities Extracurricular activities include drama, debating (where speakers have recently achieved international honours), Amnesty International, Christian Union, and many others. In 2010 Carin Hunt, a fifth year, travelled to Qatar as part of the Irish debating team for the World's Debating. Former student Mark Haughton was the Irish Team's debating coach, and had achieved second as part of the Irish team, in the World's Debating while at Wesley. Carin went on to captain the team in the School's finals in Dundee the following year, taking them to the semi-finals. Wesley has won the All Ireland hockey trophy. Wesley not only places an emphasis on activities which solely help students themselves but also to move children is highly important for the teaching staff. Students in Transition year are able to reach out in various ways such as classroom assistance, helping children with special needs and music teaching. In recent years a team from Wesley's Transition year has embarked on a Habitat for Humanity house building trip annually. The students of the college also produce a monthly newspaper, Full Stop which has been providing a voice for students since December 9, 2003. =Rugby= From the beginning, Rugby Union has been the main competitive team sport for boys in the school. The school won the Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup in 1898 and the Senior league final in 2000. The Senior Cup team have played in the Vincent Murray Cup final on five occasions; winning in 2002, 2013, 2015 and 2018 and losing the final in 2009. In 2018 the school won their first junior trophy beating Kilkenny College the Fr Godfrey final. Wesley has produced a number of provincial and international rugby players including Josh van der Flier and Eric Miller .

Hundreds of students from many schools, both primary and secondary level, compete in individual and choral singing as well as individual instrumental and orchestral. In recent years the school built a dedicated Music and Arts Centre. Included in this centre is the purpose built G. B. Shaw Auditorium, named after one of Wesley's most famous past pupils. =Lifelines= In 1992 the College published its fourth, and final, instalment of the Lifelines anthology. The earlier instalments were published in 1985, 1988 and 1990 by The Underground Press Ltd, Wesley College.MacMonagle (1992), p. IV Under format of the anthologies, a panel of students within Wesley write to notable people, such as celebrities, sports people and world leaders, asking them to highlight their favourite poem with a brief explanation for their choosing. Thus far the anthology has raised over ‚Ç¨140,000 for Irish charity Concern. The latest edition itself has raised ‚Ç¨29,000 and was honoured as the Best Irish Published Book of the Year, in the 2007 Irish Book Awards. In 2010, The National Library of Ireland purchased the original letters that were included in the original 1985 edition of Lifelines. Subsequently, Wesley College donated all correspondence, photographs and other related archival material to the Library. The Discover Lifelines exhibition in the Library's main hall showed letters from this archive from writers, poets, actors, artists, media personalities and politician and ran throughout 2010. A collective edition of the anthology was published by Town House, Dublin, in 1992.MacMonagle, Niall, ed. (1992) Lifelines: letters from famous people about their favourite poem. Dublin: Town House =Senior Choir= The Senior Choir at Wesley College Dublin received a number of awards during the term 2011/2012, including the All Ireland School Choir Competition. This was broadcast on live RT√â television. The choir also won both of their competitions in that year's Feis Ceol in Dublin. They have appeared on the Late Late Show on RT√â as well as on RT√â Radio One on Pat Kenny's morning show. Wartime contribution War memorial WW2 memorial Wesley, like many other schools in Ireland, contributed to the effort of the two major world wars. Over 85 students of the college lost their lives in the First World War. Their names are listed on a memorial in the college concourse which reads \\"This building was erected to the honour of all old boys of this College who ventured their lives for defence of home and country in the Great War and especially in loving and grateful memory of those who fell\\". (The building mentioned was the old College Chapel, where the memorial was located before the move to Ballinteer.) 25 students of Wesley, including one German, died between 1939 and 1945 in the Second World War. These are also listed on a memorial in the main concourse. Remembrance Day is marked each year with the laying of a wreath on the memorial.

Of Armenian descent, he joined the NKVD in 1931 while a graduate student at Moscow's Bauman Higher Technical School and went immediately into foreign intelligence. Ovakimian was sent to Germany on an assignment emphasizing scientific- technical espionage. In 1932 he returned to the Soviet Union for advanced technical training at the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Military-Chemical Academy. In 1933 he was sent to the United States as deputy head of the NKVD's scientific-technical intelligence section, operating under the cover of being an engineer for Amtorg. The FBI agent, Robert J. Lamphere, has revealed that Gaik Ovakimian had been under investigation since soon after arriving in the United States.http://spartacus-educational.com/Robert_Lamphere.htm FBI files show that \\"Ovakimian's recruits were scattered as far afield as Mexico and Canada... Americans whom Ovakimian recruited or controlled described him as charming, serious, sympathetic, well read in English literature, knowledgeable in science, and a man who inspired loyalty in his agents. He must also have been agile and politically aware, for he survived the great purges of the late 1930s which decimated the upper ranks of the Russian espionage services.\\" Robert J.

Ovakimian also received material from Klaus Fuchs through Harry Gold. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were recruited by Ovakimian in 1938. In 1939 Ovakimian became chief of scientific intelligence in the United States while at the same time began studying for a doctorate in chemistry at a New York University. Ovakimian was arrested during a meeting on 5 May 1941 with an agent who had been turned by the FBI. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, he was traded back to Moscow for the release of several Americans and left the United States 23 July 1941. Ovakimian then became head of the NKVD's American desk in Moscow, responsible for espionage activities of Soviet agents within the United States and Canada. He was promoted to deputy chief of the NKVD's foreign intelligence in 1943 and attained the rank of major- general.

Tom is perhaps best known for The Last Shanty (A Sailor Ain't A Sailor), which has been recorded by over 30 different groups around the world. He is also thrilled that Ilan Eskeri has used the melody from his song 'A Sailor's Prayer' (Send Down A Dove) as a major theme in the musical score of the recent BBC Films' production of 'Swallows and Amazons'. Biography Lewis was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland and grew up in Gloucester, England. He served in the Royal Navy from 1959 until 1983, mostly in the (diesel) Submarine Service. He developed his interest in sea shanties while frequenting the Howff Folk Song Club of Dunfermline, Scotland, in the 1960s, and began to perform at clubs and festivals in his off-time. On completing his naval service, he emigrated to Salmo, British Columbia, Canada, \\"to be somewhere completely different to a large port city\\". In 1987, he began to record and to tour, due to popular demand. Recordings Lewis' first solo album, issued in 1987, was Surfacing and included two early favorites among his recordings, \\"The Last Shanty\\" and \\"Marching Inland.\\" Those two songs later appeared on the compilation CD, A Taste of the Maritimes (1992), the former tune under the title \\"A Sailor Ain't a Sailor.\\" In 1988 he recorded and toured with William Pint and Felicia Dale. Currently much of his touring happens in the U.K and Europe, giving him more opportunities to perform with his Polish compatriates (QFTRY). His albums have been favorably reviewed in Dirty Linen magazine, Living Tradition magazine and Sing Out! magazine. (The latter calling his song \\"Radio Times\\" the \\"folk equivalent of 'American Pie.'\\") His songs have also been played on The Midnight Special folk music radio show. In 2000, he won the Stan Hugill International Trophy when the competition was held in Douarnenez, France. In 2008, he published his tunes and lyrics as Worth the singin': the Tom Lewis songbook.

Possessing heightened olfactory abilities, dogs are able to detect, track and locate the source of certain odours.Hepper, P. G., & Wells, D. L. (2005). How many footsteps do dogs need to determine the direction of an odour trail?. Chemical Senses, 30(4), 291-298. A deeper understanding of the physiological mechanisms and the phases involved in canine scent tracking has allowed humans to utilize this animal behaviour in a variety of professions. Through domestication and the human application of dog behaviour, different methods and influential factors on tracking ability have been discovered. While tracking was once considered a predatory technique of dogs in the wild, it has now become widely used by humans.  Physiological mechanisms  Close-up picture of a dog's nose.According to zoosemiotics animal communication involves an exchange of information between a sender and a receiver through a transfer of chemical signs. Described as representation and signification, a chemical sign can be produced without the presence of a dog and detected without the presence of the individual who produced it.Gadbois, S., & Reeve, C. (2014). Canine olfaction: scent, sign, and situation. In Domestic dog cognition and behavior (pp. 3-29). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. This means dogs have the ability to leave their own signs and detect previously laid signs without the presence of another dog or individual. It is this theory of zoosemitoics that explains how dogs are able to determine the direction of a seemingly invisible scent track. Although dogs are capable of following both visual and olfactory cues, it appears that scent is their most effective source of information.Steen, J. B., & Wilsson, E. (1990). How do dogs determine the direction of tracks?. Acta Physiologica Scandinavica, 139(4), 531-534.Chicago Equipped with enhanced physical and neurological olfactory structures, a dogs sense of smell is much more advanced compared to that of humans.Weakley-Jones, B., & Rebmann, A. J. (2005). DOGS, USE IN POLICE INVESTIGATIONS. In Editor-in-Chief: Jason Payne-James (Ed.), Encyclopedia of forensic and legal medicine (pp. 221-223). Oxford: Elsevier. Specialized turbinate bones in the canine nasal cavity allows for increased exposure of chemical receptor cells to the air.Taslitz, A. E. (1990). Does the Cold Nose Know--The Unscientific Myth of the Dog Scent Lineup. Hastings LJ, 42, 15. This, paired with a proportionally large segment of brain devoted to olfaction processing, results in the enhanced smelling ability of canines. Both physical and neurological attributes of dogs contribute to their ability to detect extremely small concentrations of specific scents and their ability to differentiate between odours. The accuracy of these detections is determined by the concept of scent groups. A scent group refers to a specific mixture of scents that comprise the overall odour of an individual. A dogs acuity to a scent group is so refined they are able to discriminate humans by odourSettle, R. H., Sommerville, B. A., McCormick, J., & Broom, D. M. (1994). Human scent matching using specially trained dogs. Animal Behaviour, 48(6), 1443-1448. and can even match certain scents to specific body parts of an individual.Berns, G. S., Brooks, A. M., & Spivak, M. (2015). Scent of the familiar: An fMRI study of canine brain responses to familiar and unfamiliar human and dog odors. Behavioural processes, 110, 37-46. Scent discrimination is most proficient while a human odour is fresh and becomes more difficult once an odour starts to fade.  Phases  Tracking behaviour in dogs is exhibited through three separate phases: 1\\\\. Searching Phase * Initial period in which dogs attempt to find a track. Dogs sniff very quickly ten to twenty times between inhalations of breath.Thesen, A., Steen, J. B., & Doving, K. B. (1993). Behaviour of dogs during olfactory tracking. Journal of Experimental Biology, 180(1), 247-251. Sniff frequency is usually 6 Hz and occurs while the dog is in motion looking for a trail. 2\\\\. Deciding Phase * Track identification is apparent when the dog halts and then proceeds to take smaller step and the sniffing frequency of the dog becomes much longer. * Period usually lasts 3-5s 3\\\\. Tracking Phase * Similar to the searching phase. Sniffing behaviour and walking behaviour become quicker.  Methods  Although dogs use physiological methods to detect scent trails, they apply these methods differently depending on the environments in which they are tracking. A scent results from the individual odour of a person being tracked or through an environmental disturbance odour that results from the physical movements of the person being tracked. The ways in which dogs track an individual, vegetative and track scent can vary depending on circumstances. Specifically, scent tracking ability of a dog depends on whether or not an individual deposits their scent in the air or on the ground. An air scent is when human odours of sweat, cells, gland secretions, or toiletries circulate freely in the open air. The bacteria attached to fallen skin cells provide dogs with odorous by-products that enhance the individuality of a trail. While an initial air scent is much stronger than a ground scent, a ground scent remains detectable for a longer period of time. A ground scent is the combined permeations of trampled vegetation, bugs, mud, and soil disturbed by an individuals footprints. The disturbed soil releases moisture and kills plant life which results in a different odorous by-product. Each footprint releases a new odour more potent than the ones of the undisturbed vegetation surrounding it. A track scent is often a mixture of both the air scent and the ground scent being left behind by an individual. Dogs are able to determine a track scent by identifying a combination of both human odours and environmental odours released by an individual. They then use the strength of this overall scent to determine the directionality of a trail and track along that route. Since an initial footstep is much less potent than the last footstep taken by an individual, dogs move in the direction where the scent seems to become stronger. Additionally, dogs have been observed to alternate between visual tracking and scent tracking depending on the circumstances of their environment. For the most part dogs prefer to use olfactory cues even when the target or visual cues are within their line of sight.Gazit, I., & Terkel, J. (2003). Domination of olfaction over vision in explosives detection by dogs. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 82(1), 65-73. However, there has been research conducted where dogs have been shown to rely on visual, social or cognitive cues to identify the tracks of an individual.Dumas, C. (1998). Figurative and spatial information and search behavior in dogs (Canis familiaris). Behavioural Processes, 42(2-3), 101-106.  Factors that influence tracking ability  A member of 279x279pxThere are many different factors which influence a dogs ability to successfully determine the directionality of a track. The age, sex, and even personalitySvartberg, K. (2002). Shyness‚Äìboldness predicts performance in working dogs. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 79(2), 157-174. of a dog can greatly influence tracking behaviour. Male dogs have been described to more accurately determine the direction of a trail than female dogs. It is hypothesized that this is due to the evolutionary history of male dogs. Male olfactory ability of canines is superior to that of females because historically it was their duty to find mates and mark territory. Canine olfactory sensitivity is also found to diminish, therefore younger dogs tend to have superior tracking than older dogs. Personality traits of dogs affect both their ability to be successfully trained and their ability to successfully track. Dogs that are more active and confident tend to perform better during training activities and tracking activities. The mannerisms of the handler working with the dog can also affect tracking ability. It has been discovered that humans and animals share very specific social skills that enable them to bond and work together effectively.Mikl√≥si, √Å., & Top√°l, J. (2013). What does it take to become ‚Äòbest friends‚Äô? Evolutionary changes in canine social competence. Trends in cognitive sciences, 17(6), 287-294 Adaptations of social tolerance and attentiveness has enabled dogs to participate in cooperative problem solving with their human counterparts.Ostojiƒá, L., & Clayton, N. S. (2014). Behavioural coordination of dogs in a cooperative problem-solving task with a conspecific and a human partner. Animal cognition, 17(2), 445-459. Social attentiveness refers to an animals ability to pay attention to their partners actions and behave accordingly.Range, F., & Vir√°nyi, Z. (2015). Tracking the evolutionary origins of dog-human cooperation: the ‚ÄúCanine Cooperation Hypothesis‚Äù. Frontiers in psychology, 5, 1582. It is this factor that explains how dogs are capable of interpreting and reacting to cues from their handler. Pointing, gaze shifting, and facial expressions demonstrated by the handler can be used by the canine to locate objects and follow a certain direction. Although usually purposeful, unconscious signals are also capable of being interpreted by canines while working with humans. Therefore, handlers are trained to be cautious of their actions when working with their canine in order to ensure their demands are being properly perceived by the dog.  Human uses of tracking dogs  Human uses for tracking dogs are dependent on many different factors. Specifically, the demands of a job often influence which kind of dog humans choose to train and employ. There are three different types of scenting dogs based on their affinity for air scents, ground scents and tracking scents. Described as a tracking dog, trailing dog, and point source dogs each one specializes in a different method of tracking. = Tracking dogs = Tracking dogs are known for their ability to detect and follow the vegetative vapours released from disturbances of plant life They stay very close to foot paths and are able to follow considerably aged tracks. = Trailing dogs = Trailing dogs have a stronger affiliation for proponents of human scent near the trail they are tracking. They can be observed deviating slightly from or crossing over the trail they are tracking. Trailing dogs heavily rely on scent because the trails in which they follow often don't have any visual cues for tracking. Tracking and trailing dogs are often used interchangeably for police aid in human, suspect and victim searches. = Point source dogs = Point source dogs are specialized in air scent tracking and tend to ignore ground scents. They utilize increasing intensity of specific odours to identify and track a trail to a certain target object. There are two separate classifications of point source dogs: detector dogs and discrimination dogs. Detection dogs are most often used identify both non- biological and biological scents of a target object while ignoring other non- target environmental scentsBrowne, C., Stafford, K., & Fordham, R. (2006). The use of scent-detection dogs. Irish Veterinary Journal, 59(2), 97. Discrimination dogs are most often employed by police forces to identify the scent of a specific individual being tracked. This differs from detection dogs because they are required to react to a scent that matches or differentiates between other ones instead of identifying that a certain scent is present.The German Shepherd is a breed commonly used by police forces to track human scents.

Michigan, US Mobile hunting blind A duck blind on the Chesapeake Bay A hunting blind (US), hide or machan is a cover device for hunters or gamekeepers, designed to reduce the chance of detection. There are different types of blinds for different situations, such as deer blinds and duck blinds. Some are exceedingly simple, while others are complex. The legality of various kinds of blinds may vary according to season, state and location. Types of blinds Blinds may be stable or mobile. An early blind used by hunters was a cocking- cloth, a piece of canvas stretched on a frame like a kite that would permit hunters to approach pheasants and to shoot them through a hole in the cloth. Ground blinds are an alternative to the traditional tree stand; movements in a well-designed ground blind can virtually be undetectable by the game. Duck blinds in the grain fields in south central Oregon and north central California can be as simple as a hunter walking two or three miles out into a grain field, stopping at a dike, a raised area, two feet (60 cm) or so high, 10 or 12 feet (3.0-3.6 m) wide and usually a half mile or so long on a side. The hunter simply sits down on the top and pushes dirt away with both feet, front and back. In two to three minutes a shallow depression is created. Then additional stubble from cut grain can be placed around the edges, enough to provide cover when the hunter lies down when birds are spotted, sitting up when they come in range. The blind can be deepened to allow sitting upright, if desired, by using a digging tool. In other areas duck blinds can be quite elaborate. More substantial structures are common in the midwestern United States, and their purpose often extends beyond concealment to include protection from the elements, particularly from rain and cold. In some areas, blinds can approach small cabins in their size and amenities. A sinkbox is another elaborate form of duck blind, designed for partial submersion in a body of water; sinkboxes are illegal to use in the United States. Also for hunting waterfowl in fields, hunters will use a layout blind. A layout blind is a low profile blind that a person can lay down in and stubble in to hide from waterfowl. Deer blinds may not be legal in all areas, so hunters are obligated to check hunting laws before constructing them. Alternatives include simply sitting still at the base of a tree. It may be illegal is adding to a natural condition to improve upon it and conceal a hunter's presence, or actually constructing something with sides and a roof. In some states, hunting from a camouflaged blind may be prohibited during rifle/shotgun season. In such cases, a hunter is required to add orange patch on blind such that the orange is visible from all angles. Other simple blinds include climbing a tree, usually with special climbing equipment and with some kind of seat, or with a burlap enclosed frame. In India, a hunting platform on a tree during shikar is known as machan.

Wildlife management can include gamekeeping, wildlife conservation and pest control. Wildlife management draws on disciplines such as mathematics, chemistry, biology, ecology, climatology and geography to gain the best results. Wildlife management aims to halt the loss in the Earth's biodiversity,M. E. Soul√© and B. A. Wilcox. 1980. Conservation Biology: An Evolutionary-Ecological Perspective. Sinauer Associates. Sunderland, Massachusetts.M. E. Soule. (1986). What is conservation Biology? BioScience, 35(11): 727-734 by taking into consideration ecological principles such as carrying capacity, disturbance and succession, and environmental conditions such as physical geography, pedology and hydrology.Hunter, M. L. (1996). Fundamentals of Conservation Biology. Blackwell Science Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts., .Groom, M.J., Meffe, G.K. and Carroll, C.R. (2006) Principles of Conservation Biology (3rd ed.). Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA. Most wildlife biologists are concerned with the conservation and improvement of habitats; although rewilding is increasingly being undertaken. Techniques can include reforestation, pest control, nitrification and denitrification, irrigation, coppicing and hedge laying. Gamekeeping is the management or control of wildlife for the well-being of game and may include the killing of other animals which share the same niche or predators to maintain a high population of more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book Game Management, Aldo Leopold, one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as \\"the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use\\". Pest control is the control of real or perceived pests and can be used for the benefit of wildlife, farmers, gamekeepers or human safety. In the United States, wildlife management practices are often implemented by a governmental agency to uphold a law, such as the Endangered Species Act. In the United Kingdom, wildlife management is undertaken by several organizations including government bodies such as the Forestry Commission, Charities such as the RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts and privately hired gamekeepers and contractors. Legislation has also been passed to protect wildlife such as the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The UK government also give farmers subsidies through the Countryside Stewardship Scheme to improve the conservation value of their farms. History =Game laws= The history of wildlife management begins with the game laws, which regulated the right to kill certain kinds of fish and wild animal (game). In Britain game laws developed out of the forest laws, which in the time of the Norman kings were very oppressive. Under William the Conqueror, it was as great a crime to kill one of the king's deer as to kill one of his subjects. A certain rank and standing, or the possession of a certain amount of property, were for a long time qualifications indispensably necessary to confer upon any one the right of pursuing and killing game. The Game Act of 1831 protected game birds by establishing close seasons when they could not be legally taken. The act made it lawful to take game only with the provision of a game licence and provided for the appointment of gamekeepers around the country. The purposes of the law was to balance the needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both environment and populations of fish and game. The Game Act 1831 protects game birds in England and Wales Early game laws were also enacted in the US; in 1839 Rhode Island closed the hunting season for white-tailed deer from May to November.Bolen, Eric G., Robinson, William. (1999). Wildlife Ecology and Management. Prentice Hall. Other regulations during this time focused primarily on restricting hunting. At this time, lawmakers did not consider population sizes or the need for preservation or restoration of wildlife habitats. =Emergence of wildlife conservation= The late 19th century saw the passage of the first pieces of wildlife conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869 was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world after extensive lobbying from the Association for the Protection of Seabirds. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds was founded as the Plumage League in 1889 by Emily Williamson at her house in Manchester as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing. The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB. The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the ornithologist Professor Alfred Newton. The National Trust formed in 1895 with the manifesto to \\"...promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the nation, of lands, ...to preserve (so far practicable) their natural aspect.\\" On 1 May 1899, the Trust purchased two acres of Wicken Fen with a donation from the amateur naturalist Charles Rothschild, establishing the first nature reserve in Britain.. Rothschild was a pioneer of wildlife conservation in Britain, and went on to establish many other nature reserves, such as one at Woodwalton Fen, near Huntingdon, in 1910.Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Peterborough During his lifetime he built and managed his estate at Ashton Wold in Northamptonshire to maximise its suitability for wildlife, especially butterflies. Concerned about the loss of wildlife habitats, in 1912 he set up the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the forerunner of The Wildlife Trusts partnership. During the society's early years, membership tended to be made up of specialist naturalists and its growth was comparatively slow. The first independent Trust was formed in Norfolk in 1926 as the Norfolk Naturalists Trust, followed in 1938 by the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which after several subsequent changes of name is now the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that more Naturalists' Trusts were formed in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire and Cambridgeshire. These early Trusts tended to focus on purchasing land to establish nature reserves in the geographical areas they served. =Wildlife management in the US= The profession of wildlife management was established in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s by Aldo Leopold and others who sought to transcend the purely restrictive policies of the previous generation of conservationists, such as anti-hunting activist William T. Hornaday. Leopold and his close associate Herbert Stoddard, who had both been trained in scientific forestry, argued that modern science and technology could be used to restore and improve wildlife habitat and thus produce abundant \\"crops\\" of ducks, deer, and other valued wild animals. The institutional foundations of the profession of wildlife management were established in the 1930s, when Leopold was granted the first university professorship in wildlife management (1933, University of Wisconsin, Madison), when Leopold's textbook 'Game Management' was published (1933), when The Wildlife Society was founded, when the Journal of Wildlife Management began publishing, and when the first Cooperative Wildlife Research Units were established. Conservationists planned many projects throughout the 1940s. Some of which included the harvesting of female mammals such as deer to decrease rising populations. Others included waterfowl and wetland research. The Fish and Wildlife Management Act was put in place to urge farmers to plant food for wildlife and to provide cover for them. In 1937, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act) was passed in the U.S.. This law was an important advancement in the field of wildlife management. It placed a 10% tax on sales of guns and ammunition. The funds generated were then distributed to the states for use in wildlife management activities and research. This law is still in effect today. Wildlife management grew after World War II with the help of the GI Bill and a postwar boom in recreational hunting. An important step in wildlife management in the United States national parks occurred after several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park. In 1963, United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management. In a paper known as the Leopold Report, the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended active management of Yellowstone's elk population.Leopold, A. Starker, et al. 1963. \\"The Goal of Park Management in the United States\\". Wildlife Management in the National Parks. National Park Service. Retrieved on September 19, 2009. Elk overpopulation in Yellowstone is thought by many wildlife biologists, such as Douglas Smith, to have been primarily caused by the extirpation of wolves from the park and surrounding environs. After wolves were removed, elk herds increased in population, reaching new highs during the mid-1930s. The increased number of elk apparently resulted in overgrazing in parts of Yellowstone. Park officials decided that the elk herd should be managed. For approximately thirty years, the park elk herds were culled: Each year some were captured and shipped to other locations, a certain number were killed by park rangers, and hunters were allowed to take more elk that migrated outside the park. By the late 1960s the herd populations dropped to historic lows (less than 4,000 for the Northern Range herd). This caused outrage among both conservationists and hunters. The park service stopped culling elk in 1968. The elk population then rebounded. Twenty years later there were 19,000 elk in the Northern Range herd, a historic high. Since the tumultuous 1970s, when animal rights activists and environmentalists began to challenge some aspects of wildlife management, the profession has been overshadowed by the rise of conservation biology. Although wildlife managers remain central to the implementation of the Endangered Species Act and other wildlife conservation policies, conservation biologists have shifted the focus of conservation away from wildlife management's concern with the protection and restoration of single species and toward the maintenance of ecosystems and biodiversity. Types of wildlife management There are two general types of wildlife management: * Manipulative management acts on a population, either changing its numbers by direct means or influencing numbers by the indirect means of altering food supply, habitat, density of predators, or prevalence of disease. This is appropriate when a population is to be harvested, or when it slides to an unacceptably low density or increases to an unacceptably high level. Such densities are inevitably the subjective view of the land owner, and may be disputed by animal welfare interests. * Custodial management is preventive or protective. The aim is to minimize external influences on the population and its habitat. It is appropriate in a national park where one of the stated goals is to protect ecological processes. It is also appropriate for conservation of a threatened species where the threat is of external origin rather than being intrinsic to the system. Feeding of animals by visitors is generally discouraged. Opposition The control of wildlife through killing and hunting has been criticized by animal rights and animal welfare activists. Critics object to the real or perceived cruelty involved in some forms of wildlife management. They also argue against the deliberate breeding of certain animals by environmental organisations‚Äîwho hunters pay money to kill‚Äîin pursuit of profit. Additionally, they draw attention to the attitude that it is acceptable to kill animals in the name of ecosystem or biodiversity preservation, yet it is seen as unacceptable to kill humans for the same purpose; asserting that such attitudes are a form of discrimination based on species-membership i.e. speciesism. Environmentalists have also opposed hunting where they believe it is unnecessary or will negatively affect biodiversity. Critics of game keeping note that habitat manipulation and predator control are often used to maintain artificially inflated populations of valuable game animals (including introduced exotics) without regard to the ecological integrity of the habitat. Gamekeepers in the UK claim it to be necessary for wildlife conservation as the amount of countryside they look after exceeds by a factor of nine the amount in nature reserves and national parks.National Gamekeepers' Organisation Charitable Trust Management of hunting seasons Wildlife management studies, research and lobbying by interest groups help designate times of the year when certain wildlife species can be legally hunted, allowing for surplus animals to be removed. In the United States, hunting season and bag limits are determined by guidelines set by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for migratory game such as waterfowl and other migratory gamebirds. The hunting season and bag limits for state regulated game species such as deer are usually determined by State game Commissions, which are made up of representatives from various interest groups, wildlife biologists, and researchers. Open and closed season on deer in the UK is legislated for in the Deer Act 1991 and the Deer Act (Scotland) 1996. =Open season= Open season is when wildlife is allowed to be hunted by law and is usually not during the breeding season. Hunters may be restricted by sex, age or class of animal, for instance there may be an open season for any male deer with 4 points or better on at least one side. =Limited entry= Where the number of animals taken is to be tightly controlled, managers may have a type of lottery system called limited. Many apply, few are chosen. These hunts may still have age, sex or class restrictions. =Closed season= Closed season is when wildlife is protected from hunting and is usually during its breeding season. Closed season is enforced by law, any hunting during closed season is punishable by law and termed as illegal hunting or poaching. =Type of weapon used= In wildlife management one of the conservation principles is that the weapon used for hunting should be the one that causes the least damage to the animal and is sufficiently effective so that it hits the target. Given State and Local laws, types of weapon can also vary depending on type, size, sex of game and also the geographical layout of that specific hunting area.

Typhoon Shelter. Public housing estate in Yau Tong. Old industrial buildings will be demolished and redeveloped as a high- income residential zone. Yau Tong () is an area of Hong Kong, located in the southeastern end of Kowloon, between Lei Yue Mun and Lam Tin, at the east shore of Victoria Harbour, west of Tseung Kwan O. Administratively, it is part of Kwun Tong District, the most densely populated district in Hong Kong. The northern part of Yau Tong is mainly residential, consisting of public housing, while the sea-facing location in the south is mainly used for industrial development. The southern area has been planned by the government as a private residential area, but there are still sporadic industrial buildings. Yau Tong is served by the MTR station Yau Tong station. This station is on the eastern end of the Kwun Tong line and the Tseung Kwan O line, and therefore serves as an interchange point for travelling to and from Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.  Etymology  The name \\"Yau Tong\\" literally means \\"oil pond\\" in Cantonese. It was once known as , a homophone, which simply meant \\"pond\\". The English transliteration was first recorded in 1924 on a map on Devil's Peak by the government's military department. In the Hong Kong Annual Report of 1963, two different names were used on two separate maps. The two names were \\"Ma Yau Tong\\" and \\"Yau Tong\\"; Ma Yau Tong was written on the reclamation bay, while Yau Tong was used on the zoning boundary. However, the text in the book only mentions Yau Tong, saying that the local area is only used for ship repairing and shipbuilding purposes. Because of its near-shore water storage, the government sold land to wood mills. These are special cases of political planning at that time. The origin of \\"Ma Yau Tong\\" is disputed. One possible origin is \\"‚Äú, meaning \\"horse pond\\", named after a village of the same name on Lam Tin Mountain; However, the two places are not close. It is more likely that the name comes from the location's association with the petroleum industry. In 1947, Asia Petroleum purchased 200,000 square feet of land near the tea green to build an oil depot.  History  Yau Tong was largely undeveloped before 1940, and was considered a rural or suburban area. In the 1950s, an oil depot was built in Cha Kwo Ling, north of Yau Tong. In the 1960s, Yau Tong was zoned as a public housing estate along the Lei Yue Mun Road by the Hong Kong government. In 1964, a number of public housing estates such as Yau Tong Estate and Ko Chiu Road Estate were built. There was an industrial zone along the coast. Although Yau Tong is located in Kwun Tong District, it was considered a remote area. When the MTR Kwun Tong line was opened in 1979, a plan to have a station in Yau Tong was not initially implemented. This contributed to the image of Yau Tong as a remote location. The Eastern Harbour Crossing was opened in 1989, while Yau Tong station itself opened on 4 August 2002, along with the Tseung Kwan O line in which it is included on the same date. The increase of transport and rail links improved the connectivity of Yau Tong with Kowloon, Hong Kong Island, and the rest of Hong Kong. With the completion of large-scale housing estates and other residences, the area became more integrated with Kowloon and was no longer seen as remote. The increase in population has led to the establishment of several primary and secondary schools in the area, including Fukien Secondary School Affiliated School and Saint Antonius Primary School.  Shopping  Yau Tong has several shopping centres. Lei Yue Mun Plaza was opened in 2001 on Lei Yue Mun Road. It is located near the MTR station. Subsequently, two more shopping centres have opened. Yau Lai Shopping Mall () is connected to Exit B of Yau Tong station and mainly serves residents of Yau Lai Estate. =Lei Yue Mun Plaza= The mall seen from Lei Yue Mun Road Lei Yue Mun Plaza atrium in 2011. Lei Yue Mun Plaza () is a shopping centre in Yau Tong, on the southeastern side of Kwun Tong District, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Its name comes from the nearby Lei Yue Mun channel and the surrounding area in Yau Tong, also called 'Lei Yue Mun'. At the time of its completion, Lei Yue Mun Plaza was the largest mall by floor space in Yau Tong. Lei Yue Mun Plaza is connected physically to Domain through a series of bridges, allowing visitors to traverse between them easily. The mall is located above exit A1 of Yau Tong station on the Kwun Tong line of the MTR, and is easily accessible from there.  History  Lei Yue Mun Plaza was developed as part of a masterplan around the development of the fifth phase of Yau Tong Estate. The development of Lei Yue Mun Plaza was managed by the Hong Kong Housing Authority. The shopping centre was originally planned to be developed in two phases. However, the property rights to the first phase were given to the Link Real Estate Investment Trust. The plaza opened in 2001. The Housing Authority retained rights to the second phase of the project, in what would later become Domain. Disney's Magical Moments, co-produced by the Walt Disney Company (Asia Pacific) Limited and the Hong Kong Housing Authority ran from December 21, 2002 to January 5, 2003. The event was the largest function held by the HKHA to this date, networking 131 of the HKHA's shopping centres. Four shopping malls were decorated with large sets and models that served as stages for Disney characters: Stanley Plaza, Tsz Wan Shan Shopping Centre, Lok Fu Shopping Centre and Lei Yue Mun Plaza.  Design  The plaza consists of three floors, including the ground floor. The main exhibition venues are located in the 1st floor, above the ground floor. The plaza has a floor area of around 5,600 square meters. A market for fresh food is available on the ground floor. Bridges on both the first and second floors allow connections to neighbouring Domain. More bridges from the first floor connect to nearby housing estates. = Logo = The logo for the mall consists of three fish, referencing the fishing industry practiced in Lei Yue Mun, and the names of the shopping centre in Chinese and English. Tenants In 2016, 57% of the shops in Lei Yue Mun Plaza were chain stores. = Domain = Domain opening in 2012, is connected to Exit A of Yau Tong station, and is the largest one owned by Hong Kong Housing Authority. It serves about 80,000 people in Yau Tong Estate, Yau Lai Estate, Yau Chui Court, Yau Mei Court and Lei Yue Mun Estate.

The protagonist in the obscene versions is typically portrayed as well- endowed and hypersexualized. The opening line is so well known that it has been used as a stand-alone joke, implying upcoming obscenities.  History  The earliest published version appeared in 1902 in the Princeton Tiger written by Prof. Dayton Voorhees: Other publications seized upon the \\"Nantucket\\" motif, spawning many sequels Among the most well known are: Followed later by:  Ribald versions  The many ribald versions of the limerick are the basis for its lasting popularity. Many variations on the theme are possible because of the ease of rhyming Nantucket with certain vulgar phrases. The following example comes from Immortalia: An Anthology of American Ballads, Sailors' Songs, Cowboy Songs, College Songs, Parodies, Limericks, and Other Humorous Verses and Doggerel, published in 1927.NOTE: An echo or \\"copy\\" of that example, can also be found at: << >> ... even though the poems there are not really all Limericks, and some of them do not even contain the word \\"Nantucket\\", so ... the only connection most of them (except for the first one, which is the Limerick quoted here) seem to have with [the word] \\"Nantucket\\", is: that they are (at least, most of them are) ribald.  In popular culture  The poem has become a staple of American humor, both as an iconic example of dirty poetry and as a joking example of fine art, whose vulgarity and simple form provide a surprise contrast to an expected refinement. Some examples: * In Woody Allen's 1966 film What's Up, Tiger Lily?, the protagonist Phil Moskowitz reads the opening line of \\"ancient erotic poetry\\": \\"There once was a man from Nantucket\\".IMBD: quotes from 'What's Up, Tiger Lily?' * The animated sitcom The Simpsons makes numerous references to the limerick, such as \\"Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo\\", where Homer comments that he \\"once knew a man from Nantucket\\" but \\"the stories about him are greatly exaggerated\\". * Garrison Keillor quoted the first line to laughter during his last episode of 42 years of hosting the radio show A Prairie Home Companion. * On the Gilmore Girls season 3, episode 8, Lorelai Gilmore jokes about carving something dirty into a bathroom wall on a tour of Yale, saying, \\"What rhymes with Nantucket?\\" * In the Hey Arnold episode New Teacher, Herold Berman volunteers to recite a poem for his schoolmates. He begins to say, \\"There once was a man from Nantucket\\" before being shushed by Mr. Simmons. Nickelodeon repeated this joke fourteen years later in the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \\"Squidward's School for Grown-Ups\\", SpongeBob, impersonating an opera singer, begins his act by producing a sheet of paper and reading the same line. The audience is aghast as he realizes he has the wrong sheet. * In That '70s Show season 2 episode 24, Hyde begins a joke with \\"There once was a girl from Nantucket...\\" * In The Bad News Bears season 2 episode 12 \\"The Good Life\\" Tanner enters a poetry contest with \\"There once was a man from Nantucket...\\" before the principal cuts him off. * In Will & Grace (season 8, episode 3), Grace criticizes her date's poem due to the lack of rhymes, and as an example she recites the first two lines of the ribald version: \\"There once was a man from Nantucket...

The station is broadcast to Adelaide, South Australia from studios in Franklin Street. History The station commenced broadcasting in 1980, on the frequency of 107.5 MHz, with a call sign of 5SSA and an original on-air branding of \\"Double SA-FM\\" which was very short-lived and soon replaced by \\"SA-FM\\". It was the first commercial radio station to broadcast on the FM band in Adelaide started by Paul Thompson of the Austereo Network. The first song played on air was \\"Sultans of Swing\\" by Dire Straits. Initially, SA-FM was somewhat of a fringe operation, hampered largely by the fact that many houses, and more importantly most contemporary cars, did not have the ability to receive FM radio broadcasts. In 1982 it changed its name to \\"SAFM\\" and in 1989 altered its frequency slightly to 107.1 MHz. A second frequency, 91.1 MHz, was added as what was the first of many repeater frequencies in Adelaide, required due to Adelaide's sometimes problematic television and radio reception idiosyncrasies. The frequency was later changed to 90.3 MHz and it continues to operate on that frequency. Between 1984 until 1993 it was the highest rating station in Adelaide and achieving its best survey results in the late '80s, spearheaded by the \\"Morning Zoo\\" breakfast show. SAFM became number one again in 1999, holding that position until 2005, when it dropped back to third, behind the talk station FIVEaa and the music station Mix 102.3. From its inception SAFM was an adult rock-based format, before switching to a contemporary hit radio (CHR) format in March 1996. In November 2003, the station adopted an adult contemporary music format, reverting to CHR in December 2004 following the launch of rival station Nova 919. On 20 October 2014, the station was relaunched as Hit 107, but reverted back to SAFM on 27 July 2020 as part of a network-wide relaunch, shifting to a \\"pop-based\\" music format in an attempt to target a 30‚Äì54 year old audience. Programming Local programming is produced and broadcast from the station's Franklin Street studios from 6am‚Äì3pm weekdays. The station's local output consists of a three- hour breakfast show presented by Rebecca Morse, Andrew Costello and Anthony Lehmann, a three-hour mornings show presented by Sean Craig Murphy, and a three-hour afternoons show presented by English Chris. In addition, the station's breakfast show is also broadcast on its Mount Gambier sister station. Networked programming originates from studios in Melbourne and Sydney. Digital radio SAFM is simulcast on DAB+ Digital radio in Adelaide.

It is native to southern Europe and northern Africa, but it is cultivated worldwide as an ornamental plant in gardens. The woody vine bears fragrant white flowers and small green achenes. When the flowers are newly opened they have a strong sweet almond fragrance. The vine grows in a tangled mass that is heavily sprinkled with flowers throughout the warmer months. It is popular with gardeners as a decoration along fences and trellises, or as ground cover. If the vine has no other plants or structures to climb on, it will climb on itself, forming a large, densely tangled bush. The plant sends out many shoots and can reach over five metres in height. It is sweet-smelling but poisonous. In some areas, this species has become a nuisance after its introduction. It is a weed outside of gardens and landscaped areas. Clematis flammula var. maritima is a hardier variety that is adapted to sand dunes. It is currently being studied as an agent of soil stabilization on eroded sandy beaches.

Earthsiege 2 is set in the Earthsiege universe, which contains its predecessors Earthsiege (1994) and Battledrome (1995), as well as the action game Hunter Hunted (1996), strategy games MissionForce: CyberStorm (1997) and Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars (1998), simulation Starsiege (1999), and first-person shooters Starsiege: Tribes (1999), Tribes 2 (2001), Tribes Aerial Assault (2002), Tribes: Vengeance (2004) and Tribes: Ascend (2012). As a simulation, Earthsiege 2 gives players the opportunity to pilot massive bipedal war machines known as HERCULANs (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or 'HERCs' for short). Set in 2624In-game intro cinematic, Earthsiege 2 features advanced weapons and technology for waging war. Earthsiege 2 takes place across North America, South America, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the moon. Earthsiege 2 features a more advanced engine than Earthsiege, increasing the game's maximum resolution to 640*480. Additionally, the game features much more detailed terrain than its predecessor. Earthsiege 2 has 3D rolling terrain rather than the flat landscape of Earthsiege. Furthermore, video briefings and debriefings, along with included squadmate voices, add to the atmosphere of the game. In 2015, Earthsiege 2 was released as freeware by Hi-Rez Studios. Plot For twenty years, the remnants of the human race, fought against the Cybrid oppressors aided by pre-Cybrid Hercs. After the destruction of the Cybrid army, the humans maintained their control on Earth, but another Cybrid army came from space colonies for another attack. The humans were able to prevent initial landings, but were about to face the Cybrids as they built their strength on the moon. Gameplay Earthsiege 2 features more advanced terrain =Mechanics= The player controls a \\"Herc\\" with the keyboard and/or joystick, while the mouse can be used to interact with buttons in the cockpit. Eight Hercs are available for piloting, each with its own unique characteristics. As in Earthsiege, the player is allowed up to three squadmates per mission. Squadmate Hercs are assigned and outfitted by the player, and squadmates gain experience as they complete missions. =Salvage= Destroyed Hercs and buildings leave behind salvage metal, weapons, and equipment that are added to the player's inventory for use in later missions. =Missions= Missions in Earthsiege 2 include a branching mission structure. Failure in a mission does not always mean failure of the overall game. In many cases, the player can continue, albeit on a different mission than if the player had succeeded. Also, missions can have varying degrees of success. For example, if the player is assigned to protect several bases that are under attack, the loss of one or two bases may not indicate failure. The degree of success can also indicate what the next mission will be. Certain missions give various bonuses for success. These are usually access to a new kind of weapon or piece of equipment, but in a few cases, the player is rewarded for victory with a new type of Herc chassis. In some cases, the equipment is made available later in the game if the player fails the mission, but in other cases, failure means never being able to access the equipment. Some missions are terminal if failed. The last sequence of missions, leading to the fight with Prometheus on Luna, must be won or the game ends. But in most cases, failure only leads to ending the game if the player has already failed one or more missions previously. =Herc construction= Hercs are customizable in the game. Each individual Herc chassis has its own properties, including armor, shield output, speed, and how many hardpoints it has for mounting equipment. Weapons and other equipment are mounted directly to hardpoints, and each hardpoint has a list of equipment that can be mounted there. One of the principal advantages of the larger Hercs is the greater availability of hardpoints for mounting more weapons and more equipment. Reception Chris Hudak of GameSpot praised the game's graphics and mission difficulty versus MechWarrior 2. Computer Gaming World also praised the game's graphics, stating it was the best-looking on the market, but noted there was \\"nothing that will leave a lasting impression or a hunger for Earth Siege 3.\\" The magazine also criticized the lack of a printed manual and likened it to buying a console game. A Next Generation critic said the game offers solid improvements over the first Earthsiege in the form of graphics, enemy AI, and the strategic element of looting disabled enemy units for parts (which he noted had been lifted from MechWarrior 2). He criticized the missions as lacking in variety, but concluded that \\"if you want fast action, good pacing, and incredible gameplay and graphics, EarthSiege 2 shines in all the right places.\\" References External links *Tribes Universe - A website with a download link to the game * Category:1996 video games Category:Freeware games Category:Video games about mecha Category:Single- player video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Asia Category:Video games set in Europe Category:Video games set in North America Category:Video games set in South America Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Earthsiege 2"},{"id":"2603330","text":"The Gomantong Caves are an intricate cave system inside Gomantong Hill in Sandakan Division, Sabah, Malaysia. The hill is the largest limestone outcrop in the Lower Kinabatangan area. Situated in a Sabah Forestry Department forest reserve, the caves and the surrounding area are a protected area for wildlife, especially orangutans. The limestone hill is also the only known site for the endangered land snail Plectostoma mirabile. Investigation of the guano deposits were first made in 1889 by J.H. Allard of the China Borneo Company, and the caves were first mapped by P. Orolfo in 1930. Detailed re-mapping and laser-scanning of the caves was conducted in 2012 and July 2014. The bat population is dominated by a colony of the wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat, Chaerephon plicatus, whose nightly exodus is a popular tourist attraction. The population size, which has been widely exaggerated in the past, was counted at between 275,000 and 276,000 in 2012. There are also bat hawks that linger not far from the scene and prey specifically on the bats as they leave their roost.  Bird nest harvesting  Bird nest from a black-nest swiftlet (Aerodramus maximus). For centuries, the caves have been renowned for their valuable edible swiftlet nests, which are harvested for bird's nest soup. The most valuable of the nests, the white ones, can sell for very high prices. The birds' nest collection is an ancient tradition, and the trading of these nests has been done since at least 500 AD. Twice a year, from February to April and July to September, locals with licenses climb to the roof of the caves, using only rattan ladders, ropes, and bamboo poles, and collect the nests. The first collection takes place early in the breeding season before the swiftlets lay their eggs. The birds then make another nest in which they finally lay their eggs. After the young have fledged, the second collection is made. Care must be taken to assure that the nests are collected only after the young swiftlets have abandoned these nests. These individuals are very much in demand by the people and communities that hold the Government's harvesting licenses. Edible birds' nests are protected under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment of 1997. Heavy fines and penalties are imposed on unlicensed collectors.  Caves accessibility  Inside the caves. The main cave system is divided into two parts: the more accessible Simud Hitam (Black Cave), and the larger Simud Putih (White Cave) which lies above. The names refer to the main type of nests produced by swiftlets in each cave. The cave system is home to many other animals, including massive populations of cockroaches and bats. Outside one can see many raptors including crested serpent eagles, kingfishers, and Asian fairy-bluebirds.

The most common genus is Vannella. Description Vannellidae tend to be flattened and fan-shaped during motion, although some are long and narrow, and have a prominent clear margin at the anterior. In most amoebae, the endoplasm glides forward through the center of the cell, but vannellids undergo a sort of rolling motion with the outer membrane sliding around like a tank tread. These amoebae are usually 10-40 Œºm in size, but some are smaller or larger. Vannellidae are surrounded by an outer covering called the glycocalyx, which is generally 10-20 nm across, though the thickness varies among species. In some species, a layer of hair-like filaments called glycostyles protrudes from the glycocalyx. Taxonomy Molecular phylogenies include them in the class Flabellinia as a sister group to the others, which have subpseudopodia.

Born in the Hunter Region at Sawyers Gully, near Maitland, New South Wales to parents George and Emily, Betteridge became blind at the age of two from suspected meningitis. Her mother took her to the Institution for Deaf and Dumb and Blind in 1904, but she was thought to be too young, and was sent home after a few months. She returned to the school in 1908, aged 7, to begin her education as the school's first deafblind student. In a story that echoes that of Helen Keller, Betteridge's teacher Roberta Reid fingerspelled words into her pupil's hand, until Betteridge made the connection between the words spelled and the objects she was touching. The breakthrough came when Reid spelled the word \\"shoe\\" while placing a shoe in Alice's hand. Her education then progressed rapidly, and in a few short months she knew 200 nouns and several verbs, including \\"run,\\" \\"jump,\\" and \\"laugh,\\" and soon began learning to read braille. In 1920 when she graduated, she was dux of the school. After graduating she remained at the school as a teacher for 9 years, before leaving Darlinghurst and returning to the family farm in Denman. In 1939, Betteridge married Will Chapman (also deafblind), with whom she had been corresponding by mail for some time, and moved to live with him in Melbourne. They were married for nine years before he died of a heart attack in 1948. Betteridge returned to Sydney, and was well regarded for her intelligence, good nature and her independence, even travelling overseas. She died from cancer aged 65. The Alice Betteridge School at the RIDBC for students with a sensory and intellectual disability is named in her honour. References *Thompson, V. (1990).

It is located on U.S. Route 211 about halfway between Warrenton and the small town of Washington, Virginia. The Locust Grove/R.E. Luttrell Farmstead and Meadow Grove Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The land on which the village of Amissville is now situated was part of the 5.3 million acre Northern Neck Proprietary owned in the 1700s by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. In 1649 King Charles II of England, then in exile in France after the execution of his father, Charles I, had given this unmapped and unsettled region to seven loyal supporters. By 1688 the proprietary was owned solely by Thomas Lord Culpeper whose only child married Thomas 5th Lord Fairfax in 1690. They acquired the proprietary on the death of Lord Culpeper and the region became synonymous with the Fairfax name. In 1719, Thomas 6th Lord Fairfax inherited the land (1). During 1747 to 1766, Lord Fairfax granted land that encompassed the area of today's Amissville to five individuals: Thomas Burk received 200 acres (2), Samuel Scott received 270 acres and 470 acres (3), James Genn received two grants of 400 acres each (4), Gabriel Jones received 380 acres (5), and Philip Edward Jones received 452 acres (6). It is widely believed that individuals with surnames Amiss and Bayse received land grants from Lord Fairfax in the Amissville area. However, there are no grants to anyone with these surnames recorded in the Virginia Colonial land grant books maintained by the Library of Virginia. Rather, Joseph Amiss and Edmond Bayse purchased existing land grants. On 14 July 1766 Joseph Amiss purchased, for 40 pounds, the 380 acres that had been granted to Gabriel Jones (7). On 15 October 1770 Edmond Bayse purchased, for 90 pounds, the 800 acres that had been granted to James Genn (8). On 1 July 1794, Joseph Amiss distributed his land and slaves as gifts to his three living sons William, Philip, and Thomas, and his grandsons William (son of William) and John (son of Thomas) (9). In return, Joseph and his wife Constant were given a life estate to the property (10). The sons and grandsons and their children purchased additional land in the Amissville area. On 20 April 1778, Edmond Bayse gave his son Elijamon 190 acres of the 800 acres that Edmond had acquired in 1770 (11). This was the northern part of the 800 acres, located adjacent to today's Route 211. Although Elijamon sold this land in 1789 (12), he and his children acquired other land in the Amissville area and became major landowners. The post office was established on 2 October 1810, with Thomas Amiss as its first postmaster. In 1854, Amissville was described as a small post-village with about 75 inhabitants (13).

Custer's Michigan Brigade of cavalry following the Confederate loss at Gettysburg. Longstreet's corps and Gen. A. P. Hill's corps were retreating from Pennsylvania through the Chester Gap and south on the Richmond Road towards Culpeper. Custer and his troops traveled from their headquarters and camp near Amissville and attacked with cavalry and artillery from the southern slope of Battle Mountain (about 5 miles southwest of the village), but his forces were vastly outnumbered and after a brisk and severe fight, forced to retreat north and east over Battle Mountain back to Amissville. Two of Custer's men were awarded the Medal of Honor in 1893 for their part in capturing Confederate artillery at Battle Mountain. Battle Mountain and Little Battle Mountain were named not for the military engagement but for the Bataille family which lived near the two elevations in the 1700s. Bataille was later corrupted to Battle Mountain and Little Battle Mountain, the names they bear today. Post office in Amissville Amissville was also the site of a sharp cavalry fight in November 1862, at Corbin's Crossroads, when Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's Confederate cavalry were heading to Culpeper County following the Battle of Antietam in Maryland. At Corbin's crossroads, during the fight, Gen. Stuart narrowly escaped death when he turned his head and a Union bullet clipped off half of his moustache. The site of the engagement is about 3/4 of a mile south of the present village of Amissville. In late August 1862, Gen. Stuart and his cavalry were scouting around Maj. Gen. John Pope's Federal Army of Virginia, elements of which were moving towards Thoroughfare Gap in Fauquier County. Gen. Stuart and his cavalry reached Amissville on August 22, and turned back to surround Pope's army. In an attack near Catlett's Station, Gen. Stuart's men captured Gen. Pope's overcoat and military papers. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Amissville has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \\"Cfa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for Amissville, Virginia Geology Geological map of Rappahannock County, with the village of Amissville shown on the far right The geology of Amissville and the surrounding vicinity consists of several units.

Battle Mountain and Little Battle Mountain are the only mountains in Rappahannock County which are known to be volcanic in origin, and are among the oldest visibly intact extinct volcanoes in Virginia. White quartz boulders and smaller fragments are common on and around Battle Mountain, a result of molten silica that was contained in the rhyolite lava and granitic magma that formed the volcano. The Robertson River Igneous Suite extends from south of Laurel Mills (originating near Charlottesville) and runs north-northeast through Hackleys Crossroad and beyond in a band approximately four kilometers wide. Precambrian coarse leucogneiss and fine-grained gneiss prevails from the eastern edge of the Amissville, Rappahannock County area from north of the Amissville post office and U.S. Route 211 and south to Viewtown. Flint Hill Gneiss, a light to dark- gray quartz monzonite gneiss is predominate from Ben Venue and west to Massies Corner and extending further into Rock Mills and the town of Washington, Virginia. A fine-grained Precambrian arkosic sandstone and conglomerate, which Aaron Mountain is composed of, occurs on the contact between the Flint Hill Gneiss starting approximately two kilometers west of Laurel Mills and running north-northeast along a narrow band (starting out at approximately 1 kilometer wide and tapering down to 100 meters) in contact with the Robertson River Igneous Suite, terminating just south of U.S. Route 211. The creeksides and river bottoms of the Thorton River, Battle Run and the Rappahannock River and their smaller tributaries are all composed of Quaternary Period alluvium including stratified, unconsolidated gray to grayish-yellow sand, silt and local gravels.

The sexual assault and murder of Jaques sparked outrage in Toronto, resulting in the conviction of three men: Saul Betesh, Robert Kribs, and Joseph Woods for murder, and the regeneration of the city's Yonge Street downtown area. Murder Emanuel Jaques was born in October 1964, the son of impoverished Portuguese immigrants from the Azores, and worked daily as a shoeshine boy on the then-seedy Yonge Street Strip in downtown Toronto. On July 28, 1977, 12-year-old Jaques was lured into an apartment above the Charlie's Angels massage parlour at 245 Yonge Street with the promise of $35 for help moving photographic equipment, when he was then restrained and repeatedly sexually assaulted over a period of twelve hours before being strangled and drowned in a kitchen sink. Several days after Jaques's disappearance, well-known Toronto gay activist George Hislop received a late-night call from Saul David Betesh, a sex worker who confessed to the murder, and told Hislop that Jaques's body had been hidden under a pile of wood on the roof of the building at which he had been abducted.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat;=19780313&id;=3JIuAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=UqEFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1214,3321989 Hislop arranged for Betesh to hire a lawyer, contacted Metropolitan Toronto Police and then persuaded Betesh to turn himself in.Obituary: \\"George Hislop, 78: 'Canada's official homosexual,'\\" The Toronto Star, Dec. 20, 2005. On a tipoff from Betesh, three other men ‚Äî Robert Wayne Kribs (41), Joseph Woods (26) and Werner Gruener (28) ‚Äî were arrested on the Super Continental train to Vancouver as it passed through Sioux Lookout Ontario. The three were employed as security doormen at Charlie's Angels.Kingston Whig-Standard, 4 August 1977, p 3. The four were charged with Jaques's murder. According to evidence introduced at trial, Betesh held the boy in the kitchen sink until he drowned while Kribs restrained Jaques's legs. In 1978, Kribs pleaded guilty to first- degree murder and a jury found Betesh guilty of the same charge, while Woods was convicted of second-degree murder, and Gruener, who had held open the door of the body-rub parlour to allow Betesh to bring the boy in, was acquitted. Aftermath Numerous protests and marches occurred, demanding that the city clean up the Yonge Street area. Alderman Ben Nobleman of York sent telegrams to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the media encouraging the return of capital punishment. These protests became a catalyst for shutting down the numerous adult stores, body rub parlours, and shoeshine stands along Yonge Street. Over time, Yonge Street would become a more upscale conventional district, and new developments such as Dundas Square would revitalize the area. In October 2002, twenty-five years after the murder, Robert Kribs was denied parole. Woods died in prison in April 2003, after being denied parole four times. Kribs and Betesh remain incarcerated.

The two Spains () is a phrase from a short poem by Spanish poet Antonio Machado. The phrase, referring to the left- right political divisions that later led to the Spanish Civil War, originated in a short, untitled poem, number LIII of his Proverbios y CantaresProverbios y Cantares, LIII, Antonio Machado. (Proverbs and Songs). Antonio Machado himself is an example of this split. While he wrote a poem to honor the Communist General Enrique L√≠ster,A L√≠ster, jefe en los ej√©rcitos del Ebro, Antonio Machado, June 1938. his brother Manuel Machado dedicated another poem to the saber of the rebel Generalissimo Francisco Franco. The idea of a divided Spain, each half antagonistic to the other half, dates back at least to 19th-century Spanish satirist Mariano Jos√© de Larra, who, in his article \\"All Souls' Day 1836\\" [\\"D√≠a de difuntos de 1836\\"] wrote \\"Here lies half of Spain.

She disappeared in Kings Cross, Sydney, in early July, 1975. The people responsible for her disappearance have never been identified and no trace of her has ever been found.  Personal life  Nielsen was born Juanita Joan Smith in New Lambton, New South Wales, to Neil Donovan Smith and Vilma Grace Smith (n√©e Meares) (1905‚Äì1978). Her parents separated soon after her birth and she was raised by her maternal grandmother at Killara, Sydney. Her father, Neil was an English-born heir to the Mark Foy's retail fortune via his parents, John Joseph Smith (1862‚Äì1921), who was a Chairman and Managing Director of Mark Foy's Ltd, and his wife, Kathleen Sophie Foy (1870‚Äì1919). Kathleen Smith was a sister of Mark Foy and Francis Foy.Morris, Richard. \\"Nielsen, Juanita Joan (1937‚Äì1975)\\" Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition Nielsen was educated at Ravenswood School for Girls, Gordon, Sydney. She worked at Mark Foy's from 1953 until she travelled abroad in 1959. In 1962, she married a Danish merchant seaman Jorgen Fritz Nielsen at Kobe, Japan although the marriage only lasted for around three years. Nielsen returned to Sydney in 1965 and returned to work at Mark Foy's for about five years. In the early 1970s, she was the publisher of NOW, an alternative newspaper in the Sydney suburb of Kings Cross. She lived in a terrace house at 202 Victoria Street (now heritage-listed as Juanita Nielsen's House), and she became involved in a campaign against a proposed development project in her street and across the suburb. Nielsen disappeared on 4 July 1975 and it is generally believed that she was kidnapped and murdered because of her anti-development and anti-corruption stances. A coronial inquest determined that Nielsen had been murdered, and although the case has never been officially solved, it is widely believed that Nielsen was killed by agents of the developers. The circumstances of her disappearance were fictionalised in the films Heatwave, The Killing of Angel Street and The Beehive. Victoria Point development In the early 1970s, property developer Frank Theeman (1913‚Äì1989) planned to construct a A$40 million apartment complex in Kings Cross. Theeman, who had initially made his fortune in lingerie, moved into property development in 1972 after he sold his Osti company to Dunlop for A$3.5 million. The plan involved evicting dozens of people from their houses in Victoria Street, an area which the National Trust compared to Montmartre in Paris. Built along a steep sandstone escarpment east of the city centre and lined with rows of large 19th-century terrace houses, Victoria Street had commanding views of the city, the harbour and The Domain. The houses were to be demolished and replaced with three high-rise apartment towers. The local community campaigned against the development, and successfully lobbied the Builders Labourers' Federation (BLF) to impose a green ban on the site in 1972. Supported by the BLF, the residents of Victoria Street, including Nielsen, refused to leave their houses. Nielsen used her newspaper, NOW, to publicise the issue. In July 1973, resident Arthur King was kidnapped by two unidentified men, who put him in the boot of their car. King was then driven to a motel on the South Coast of New South Wales and held for three days before being released under threat of death. King quit as the head of the residents' action group, and immediately moved out of Kings Cross. It was suspected, though never proved, that the men had been hired by Theeman. Other residents of the street were regularly harassed by men employed by Theeman, as he attempted to have them evicted from their houses. The men were led by Fred Krahe, a former detective with the New South Wales Police. Krahe had been sacked amidst allegations of organising bank robberies and he was suspected of murdering whistleblower and prostitute Shirley Brifman and other Sydney crime figures. Police officers did not intervene as Krahe's men worked. Residents would move into each other's houses so that no house was left unattended. On one occasion, when merchant seaman and jazz musician Mick Fowler returned from a period working at sea, he found that his house had been broken into, and all of his belongings taken. Fowler fought a protracted court battle to stay in his home but the strain of the struggle reputedly led to his early death in 1979, aged 50. Eventually the green ban was broken in 1974 when the conservative federal leadership of the BLF, under pressure from New South Wales politicians, dismissed the leaders of the New South Wales branch, and replaced them with more conservative people. Nielsen and the residents were left as the only significant opposition to Theeman. Nielsen then convinced the Water Board Union to impose their own green ban. By early 1975, Theeman's company had spent about A$6 million (about A$37 million ) purchasing property in Kings Cross, and interest payments on loans were costing about A$3,000 a day.  Disappearance  Juanita Nielsen memorial, South Head Cemetery, Vaucluse, New South Wales On 4 July 1975, Nielsen, 38, went to the Carousel Club in Kings Cross in order to discuss advertising for the club in her newspaper, NOW. She had been invited there by Edward Trigg, an employee of the club. The club was one of a number of bars and strip clubs owned by Abe Saffron, who was a major figure in Sydney organised crime, and it was managed by James Anderson, who, as a later investigation revealed, owed A$260,000 (about A$1.6 million ) to Frank Theeman, and according to a 2008 book by Saffron's son Alan, Abe Saffron lent large sums of money to several prominent Sydney businessmen including Theeman. Before June 1975 the Carousel had no connection with Nielsen or NOW, but that month Anderson initiated contact by sending Nielsen an invitation to attend a press night at the club on 13 June. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, she would not normally have been invited because NOW did not give free publicity to commercial ventures. In the event, Nielsen did not attend and both Trigg and the Carousel's receptionist Loretta Crawford have claimed that Anderson was \\"furious\\" about her non- appearance. A few days later Trigg instructed the Carousel's PR man Lloyd Marshall to invite Nielsen to a meeting at the Camperdown Travelodge, supposedly to discuss advertising related to landscaping, but Nielsen's boyfriend later recounted that Nielsen became suspicious and refused to attend. On 30 June, four days before the Carousel appointment, Trigg and another man, Carousel barman Shayne Martin-Simmonds, phoned Nielsen's house on the pretext of inquiring about advertising the Carousel's businessmen's lunches in NOW. It was later claimed that Trigg and Martin-Simmonds intended to seize Nielsen when she opened the door, but their plan was foiled when her friend David Farrell answered the door instead. The two men played out their cover story, but Nielsen was listening in an adjoining room and after they left she complimented Farrell on his handling of the query, teasing him by saying she might send him out on the road to sell advertising in NOW. When interviewed by police on 6 November 1977, Martin-Simmonds confirmed that the advertising story was a ruse and that their actual intention was to kidnap Nielsen if she was alone and take her to see \\"people who wanted to talk to her\\". He said that he and Trigg intended to: :\\"... Just grab her arms and stop her calling out, no real rough stuff, no gangster stuff. We thought that just two guys telling her to come would be enough to make her think if she didn't come she might get hurt ... we talked about when she came into the room, one of us would be standing there and the other one would come up behind her and just quietly grab her by the arms and maybe put a hand over her mouth or a pillowslip over the head.\\" According to her friend David Farrell, Nielsen was by then seriously concerned that her activism was putting her in danger. She mentioned her fears to Farrell about two weeks before her disappearance and she arranged to keep him regularly informed of her whereabouts. Receptionist Loretta Crawford claims that Trigg instructed her to call Nielsen on the night of Thursday 3 July to set up a meeting at the club for the following morning. Crawford now claims that she knew that the advertising story was \\"bullshit\\", since the club did not advertise in \\"local rags\\", that she was doubtful that Nielsen would attend, and that she was surprised that Nielsen kept the appointment. At 10:30am on Friday 4 July, Nielsen telephoned David Farrell to tell him that she was running late for the meeting. According to Crawford, when Nielsen arrived she proceeded to the landing on the first floor where Crawford's reception desk was located. Crawford offered her a seat and a cup of coffee, after Nielsen remarked that she had had a \\"hard night\\" (i.e. she was hung over), but that Nielsen didn't get to drink the coffee because Trigg arrived. Crawford said that she noted that he was on time, which she thought unusual since he was often late. He and Nielsen exchanged greetings on the landing and went upstairs to Trigg's office. At this point in her account, given to the Sydney Morning Herald in 2001, Crawford made a new claim: that she then made a phone call to Jim Anderson at his home in Vaucluse, told him that Nielsen had arrived and that he was \\"quite pleased\\" by the news. Crawford was adamant that she was in no doubt whatsoever that Anderson was at his home in Vaucluse‚Äînot in Surfers Paradise, Queensland, as he has always claimed. In statements given to police, Trigg and Crawford said that Nielsen had left the club alone, although in 1976 Crawford changed her story to say that Nielsen and Trigg left together. Nielsen was not seen again. Her handbag and other effects were discovered on 12 July, abandoned near a freeway in Sydney's western suburbs. New Zealand born transvestite Marilyn King (also known as Monet King), the former girlfriend of Trigg, told one journalist that Trigg had returned home on 4 July with blood on his clothes. A piece of paper in his pocket, which was later used by police as evidence before the coronial inquest, also had blood on it. This was supposedly a receipt signed by Nielsen for advertising money paid by Trigg. King said that Trigg threw out the shirt, and the portion of the paper with blood on it. King never gave testimony to the police or the coronial inquiry. In late 1977, Trigg and two other employees at the Carousel Club were arrested and charged with conspiring to kidnap Nielsen. Trigg was imprisoned for three years, one other man was imprisoned for two years and the third was acquitted. However, it was still unclear what had actually happened to Nielsen. After the death of James Anderson in 2003,Neil Mercer. \\"To the end, 'Big Jim' insisted it was all lies\\" www.smh.com.au. 22 July 2003. Retrieved 21 March 2014. Crawford changed her story again. She claimed that she had seen Nielsen's body in the storeroom below the club, with Trigg and two other men standing over her. She saw that one of the men was holding a gun, and Nielsen's body had a small bullet wound. Nielsen's body has never been found. The obvious motive for Nielsen's presumed murder was her opposition to the Victoria Street development. However, there have also been claims that she was working on an expos√© about vice, corruption and illegal gambling in the Cross. Her then boyfriend John Glebe gave evidence that Nielsen had told him about receiving telephone threats and he also testified that she carried cassette tapes in her handbag. According to Glebe, Nielsen had told him that the tapes could \\"blow the top off\\" an issue she was working on. An article in The Bulletin in 2005 ran claims by journalist Barry Ward that Nielsen had been given dossiers on \\"prominent Sydney identities\\" by private detective Allan Honeysett, and speculated that these documents would reputedly have exposed the principals involved in Sydney's illegal gaming industry. In 2004 ABC-TV's The 7:30 Report broadcast a new interview with Loretta Crawford, who had been the receptionist at the Carousel Club at time of Nielsen's disappearance. Speaking with journalist Emma Alberici, Crawford claimed her previous testimony regarding Nielsen was false and had been concocted to protect her former boss, James Anderson, but that Anderson's recent death meant she was now free to reveal the truth. Crawford's new claim was that Nielsen had indeed been killed in the basement of the club in the presence of Trigg and Martin-Simmonds, that she had seen Nielsen's body on the floor, bearing a single small gunshot wound, and that she saw a third man, whom she did not name, standing over Nielsen's body, holding a pistol. In March 2013 The Australian newspaper reported that, prior to his death in February 2013,Neil Mercer. \\"Trigg takes truth behind murder to grave\\" www.smh.com.au. 3 March 2013. Retrieved 21 March 2014. Edward Trigg had written a \\"deathbed\\" manuscript which allegedly revealed the true facts of Trigg's involvement in the Nielsen case, that it \\"named names\\" of those involved in the Nielsen conspiracy, and that it revealed the resting place of Nielsen's remains. NSW police spokesperson confirmed that police from Redfern Local Area Command had searched Trigg's residence after his death, but they refused to comment on the outcome. An unnamed friend of Trigg's (a retired Kings Cross bouncer) told reporter Ean Higgins that the police visited Trigg's hotel room twice after his death: :\\"The cops came here on Sunday after he died, then they came back today (Tuesday) and spent half a day going through his room, taking the place apart, looking for the book. But Eddie was too smart, he didn't leave anything, and it's all with his lawyer. His son and his nephew have been told.\\" The report also stated that two individuals claimed to have seen Trigg's manuscript, and that it was to be published after his death in the hope of providing an inheritance for his descendants. Coroner's inquest A coronial inquiry with a jury was held in 1983, which determined that Nielsen had probably been killed, although there was not enough evidence to show how she died or who killed her. The inquest did note that police corruption may have crippled the investigation into her death at the time. A Joint Committee of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia was formed in 1994 to further investigate her disappearance. It also concluded that corruption impeded the police investigation. She was declared as deceased by an inquest. =Suspects= Although it has never been established who killed Nielsen, there are several major suspects in the conspiracy to silence her. * Frank Theeman, the 'Victoria Point' developer, was considered by a number of journalists to be the prime suspect in the conspiracy to silence Nielsen. The costly delays to his development offer a highly plausible motive for Theeman wanting to get Nielsen 'out of the way'. Although no direct evidence has been uncovered conclusively linking Theeman to the presumed murder, there is clear circumstantial evidence of business links between the three main suspects, Theeman, Saffron and Anderson. * Abe Saffron, who owned and operated several 'businesses' in Kings Cross, had numerous circumstantial connections with the case. Throughout his life Saffron (often dubbed \\"the Boss of the Cross\\" or \\"Mr Sin\\") was accused of having masterminded a wide range of criminal activities including gambling, prostitution, drug dealing and \\"sly grog\\" sales, and to have co-ordinated a network of bribery and official corruption that (according to his son Alan) included former New South Wales Premier Robert Askin and Police Commissioner Norman Allan. Although no evidence has yet surfaced to reliably link Saffron to Nielsen's disappearance, there are significant circumstantial connections‚ÄîSaffron owned the Carousel club, where Nielsen was last seen, Saffron associate (and Carousel manager) Jim Anderson reportedly borrowed large sums from Frank Theeman, and Alan Saffron's 2008 book about his father claims that Theeman was one of several prominent Sydney business identities to whom Saffron lent money through a loan sharking operation, a claim which links to earlier reports that Theeman had tried to borrow money from Saffron to cover his 'loans' to Jim Anderson. Also, as well as her campaign against Theeman's development, Nielsen was also reportedly investigating vice and corruption in Kings Cross. * James Anderson has long been considered a prime suspect, although he protested his innocence right up until his death in 2003, and the recent book by Alan Saffron supports the allegations that Anderson organised Nielsen's abduction. Like his boss Abe Saffron, Anderson's circumstantial connections to the Nielsen case are numerous: he reportedly borrowed a considerable sum of money from Theeman; he had business links to both Theeman and Theeman's \\"drug troubled\\" son, and he was a known associate of the three men charged with conspiring to kidnap Nielsen. Anderson always insisted that he was in Surfers Paradise, Queensland with another person on the day of Nielsen's disappearance, and that he flew there with another man on 4 July and stayed for about three days in a room booked in his wife's name at the Chevron Hotel. However, Loretta Crawford later claimed that Anderson was at his home in the eastern Sydney suburb of Vaucluse that day and that she spoke to him by telephone. Police did not fully investigate Anderson's alibi, and they only determined that his car, which was left at Sydney Airport, had received two parking tickets. Police reportedly failed to contact the man that Anderson claimed had accompanied him to Surfers Paradise, nor did they verify whether Anderson actually flew there on that day or checked into the hotel. * Det. Sgt Fred Krahe, the former detective, has been named on several occasions by investigative journalists and experts on the case as Juanita's killer. He was a regular customer at the Venus Room, a nightclub owned by Abe Saffron, who also owned the Carousel Club, and it has been repeatedly alleged that Krahe organised the \\"heavies\\" hired by the developers to intimidate stubborn residents and force them out. The 1994 parliamentary Joint Committee identified Anderson and Krahe as significant suspects in Nielsen's disappearance. Alleged hit-man James Bazely named Krahe as the killer of Griffith anti-drugs campaigner Donald Mackay, and it has also been claimed that another allegedly corrupt detective, Supt. Don Fergusson, who was reported to have killed himself with his service pistol in the toilets at police headquarters, had in fact been executed by Krahe.

Each chapter is governed by a local board of directors. Since 1958, the Montana Wilderness Association has worked to protect Montana's wilderness, wildlife habitat, and traditional recreation opportunities.\\"Montana Wilderness Association\\" Montana Wilderness Association (last visited May 2019), http://wildmontana.org/ The organization was instrumental in the passage of the 1964 Wilderness Act and in the designation of every Wilderness area in the state, like the Bob Marshall, Scapegoat, and Absaroka-Beartooth Wildernesses. It also helped win National Wild and Scenic Rivers System designations for the Missouri and Flathead rivers, and National Monument status for the Upper Missouri River Breaks. Origin Montana Wilderness Association was founded in 1958 by Ken and Florence Baldwin. The grassroots organization's mission was and is to preserve wilderness and influence policy on public land management. MWA began as a group of individuals sharing the goal of protecting the heritage of Montana's wildlands and securing the proper management of public lands. The group was inspired by similar wilderness oriented individuals and associations around the nation at the time. John Muir had recently founded the Sierra Club and was very active in protecting Yosemite; Aldo Leopold wrote about the ethics involved in conservation and was a co-founder of the Wilderness Society; Bob Marshall wrote several essays about conservation in forestry publications and was also a founder of the Wilderness Society. MWA is the nation's premiere Wilderness grassroots organization and was significantly influential in the passing of the Wilderness Act by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. With the passing of this Act came the designation of the first Wilderness areas: The Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, Cabinet Mountains, the Gates of the Mountains, the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, and Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness.  Major campaigns  * Badger-Two Medicine: The 130,000-acre Badger-Two Medicine lies on Montana's Rocky Mountain Front, bounded on the north by Glacier National Park and the east by the Blackfeet Reservation. The Great Bear and Bob Marshall Wilderness Areas lie to the west and south. The Badger-Two Medicine is a designated Traditional Cultural District under the National Historic Preservation Act because of its significance to and ongoing use by the Blackfeet Nation. In June 2013, Mountain States Legal Foundation filed a lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of lessee Sidney Longwell of Solenex, LLC to lift the suspension on the Hall Creek lease. In response to the lawsuit and as a result of the incredible outpouring of support for the Badger-Two Medicine, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell cancelled Sidney Longwell's lease and two other illegally issued leases; however, Sidney Longwell and the Mountain States Legal Foundation ‚Äì along with another former leaseholder, W.A. Moncrief Jr. ‚Äì continue to challenge the cancellations in court and pursue their desire to drill in the Badger-Two Medicine. MWA is working with the Blackfeet Nation to prevent drilling in the Badger-Two Medicine and permanently protect it.\\"The Fight for the Badger-Two Medicine Continues\\" Montana Wilderness Association, April 9, 2019, http://wildmontana.org/wild-word/the-fight-for-the-badger-two-medicine- continues * Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Project: On March 2, 2017, Senator Jon Tester introduced the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act, a grassroots proposal hammered out by the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Project (BCSP), which would add 80,000 acres to the Bob Marshall, Scapegoat, and Mission Mountains Wilderness Areas and forever safeguard Grizzly Basin, Monture Creek, the North Fork of the Blackfoot River, and the West Fork of the Clearwater. The BCSP is a coalition of local loggers, ranchers, outfitters, conservationists, snowmobilers, business owners, and outdoor recreationists in the Ovando and Seeley Lake area. Montana Wilderness Association is a member of the BCSP. Permanent protection of the Blackfoot River's most important tributaries will help preserve the health of the entire Blackfoot River watershed, as explained in a five-minute film MWA produced called \\"Hallowed Waters: The Legacy and Lifeblood of the Big Blackfoot.\\" MWA is encouraging Senator Jon Tester to reintroduce the bill in 2019, and is also asking Senator Steve Daines and Congressman Greg Gianforte to support the bill.\\"The Fight to Protect a Sacred Wildland\\" Montana Wilderness Association (last visited May 2019) http://wildmontana.org/our-work/protecting-wild-places/badger-two- medicine-campaign * Custer Gallatin National Forest: The Custer Gallatin National Forest, which includes the Gallatin Range, recently began the process of revising its forest management plan, which will determine how these lands are managed for the next 15 to 20 years. Congress designated the Hyalite- Porcupine-Buffalo Horn Wilderness Study Area in 1977, but Bozeman, Belgrade, and Big Sky have nearly tripled in size since then. In 2016, MWA joined a diverse group of stakeholders called the Gallatin Forest Partnership (GFP), which is committed to crafting recommendations for the Custer Gallatin National Forest management plan revision. * Lewistown area: In May 2019, the Bureau of Land Management released a second version of a resource management plan (RMP) draft directing how the agency's Lewistown Field Office will manage 650,000 surface acres of public lands in central Montana over the next 20 to 30 years. The Lewistown area is also known as \\"the wild heart of Montana,\\" because it's one of America's last and largest intact prairie ecosystems, supporting one of the most productive populations of ungulates in North America and a thriving host of grassland bird species. The preferred management option United States Department of the Interior presented in the draft RMP would protect none of this area, and instead would open up almost all of it to oil and gas development and other uses that would diminish the wild character, and wildlife habitat. MWA is encouraging Montanans to comment on the RMP. Programs * MWA offers Wilderness Walks each summer so members and the public can explore new trails and meet new people. Free hikes, field trips, backpacking adventures, and snowshoe outings are led by experienced volunteers. * The Volunteer Trail Crew program allows members and the public to assist land management agencies across the state through boots-on-the- ground service. Typical project work includes constructing new trail, signage installation, \\"logging out\\" or opening trails for the season, and maintaining existing trail. * MWA maintains hikewildmontana.org, an online hiking guide, with information about trails around the state, nearby restaurants, and descriptions of hikes. * Get Out the Vote: in 2018 MWA created the Public Lands in Public Hands campaign to keep America's public lands from being transferred to individual states and sold off to private interests and to build public support for the protection and expansion of Montana's outdoor way of life. Of pledges collected, 55 percent came from 18-24 year olds, 19 percent came from 25-34 year olds, and 26 percent came from Montanans 35 and older.\\"Civic Engagement\\" Montana Wilderness Association (last visited May 2019), http://wildmontana.org/our-work/protecting-public-lands/civic- engagement  Highlights  1958 ‚Äì Ken and Florence Baldwin found Montana Wilderness Association.

Overview Languages differ within this parameter, some languages such as Italian and Spanish have constant pro-drop, Finnish and Hebrew for example are partial pro-drop languages and Japanese and Tamil fall into the category of discourse or radical pro-drop languages.Hannukainen, E-A. 2017. Third person referential null subjects in Finnish and Hebrew. Undergraduate thesis, Newcastle University. There are also languages such as English, German and Swedish that only allow pro-drop within very strict stylistic conditions. A pro-sentence is a kind of pro-form and is therefore anaphoric. In English, yes, no and okay are common pro-sentences. In response to the question \\"Does Mars have two moons?\\", the sentence \\"Yes\\" can be understood to abbreviate \\"Mars does have two moons.\\" Pro-sentences are sometimes seen as grammatical interjections, since they are capable of very limited syntactical relations. But they can also be classified as a distinct part of speech, given that (other) interjections have meanings of their own and are often described as expressions of feelings or emotions. = Yes and no = In some languages, the equivalents to yes and no may substitute not only a whole sentence, but also a part of it, either the subject and the verb, or the verb and a complement, and can also constitute a subordinate clause. The Portuguese word sim (yes) gives a good example: :Q: Ela est√° em casa? A: Acredito que sim. ‚Äî Q: Is she at home? A: I believe that she is (literally, that yes). :Ela n√£o saiu de casa, mas o John sim. ‚Äî She didn't leave home, but John did (literally, John yes). In some languages, such as English, yes rebuts a negative question, whereas no affirms it. However, in Japanese, the equivalents of no (iie, uun, (i)ya) rebut a negative question, whereas the equivalents of yes (hai, ee, un) affirm it. :Q: Wakarimasen deshita ka (Did you not understand?) :A: Hai, wakarimasen deshita (No, I didn't ‚Äî Literally That's right, I didn't understand) Some languages have a specific word that rebuts a negative question. German has \\"doch\\"; French has \\"si\\"; Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish have jo, Hungarian has \\"de\\". None have a clear English translation. :Q: Bist du nicht m√ºde?

H. Johnsen in command. History David W. Taylor escorted a convoy of merchantmen from Charleston, South Carolina to Pearl Harbor arriving on 20 January 1944. Three days later she got underway to screen a support convoy to the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, returning to Pearl Harbor on 29 February. After escorting the aircraft carrier to San Francisco, she sailed from Pearl Harbor 1 April to patrol in the Marshall Islands until 12 May. Returning to Pearl Harbor 18 May, she had training duties there until 7 June. From 15 June to 4 August 1944 David W. Taylor sailed in the screen of escort carriers and fleet oilers supporting the Marianas operation. On 4 July she and the destroyer escort attacked and sank the Japanese submarine at . The destroyer joined the 3d Fleet 19 August, and sailed out of Manus screening the logistics group supporting the fast carrier task forces in their raids preparing for and accompanying the capture and occupation of the southern Palaus. With her base of operations at Ulithi from 29 October, David W. Taylor continued to screen the logistics group until 22 November when she joined the carriers for air attacks on Luzon in support of the invading troops on Leyte. On 29 December 1944 she sailed from Ulithi for the air raids on the Bonins, bombarding Chichi Jima 5 January 1945. At 07:45 that day an underwater explosion, probably a mine, heavily damaged the ship and killed four men, but damage control brought her safely to Saipan 7 January under her own power. The ship continued to Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard, California, for an overhaul and repairs from 13 February to 7 May. Sailing from San Diego 15 May 1945 David W. Taylor bombarded Emidj Island on 18 June on her way to Okinawa, arriving 30 June. The destroyer operated with a task group off Okinawa. After Japan surrendered, the ship arrived at Takasu, Ky≈´sh≈´, 4 September, as escort for a convoy carrying occupation troops. She covered the landings at Wakanoura Wan and Nagoya until sailing 31 October for San Diego, arriving 17 November. David W. Taylor was placed out of commission in reserve there 17 August 1946.  Almirante Ferrand√≠z (D22)  On 15 May 1957, the destroyer was leased to Spain where she served in the Armada Espa√±ola as Almirante Ferrand√≠z (D22). Spain purchased the destroyer on 1 October 1972. The ship remained in service until 17 November 1987, when she was stricken and scrapped. Honors David W. Taylor received eight battle stars for World War II service.

Several vessels among the fleet of the Holy League bore the same name. Whilst this is not unheard of among ships belonging to different nationalities, some of the said ships belong to the same nation. These did not seem to be of great importance to Christian commanders at that time. In order to avoid confusion, those vessels bearing the same name were suffixed with ordinal number according to nationality (i.e. Christ of Candia I, Christ of Candia II; Christ of Venice I, Christ of Venice II, etc.). 2\\\\. In contrast to their Western contemporaries, Turkish records only show the names of commanders of the ships instead of the names of the ship themselves. 3\\\\. In Italian use, various flagships were called by the rank of their commander. A reale (\\"royal\\") was personally commanded by a king or his agent; a capitana (\\"captainess\\") by a captain general; a padrona (\\"master\\") by a padrone.

The organization developed independently out of a radio ministry begun by Jacob O. Meyer in 1966.History of Bethel and Tulpehocken Townships, pg. 227. Published by Bethel and Tulpehocken Townships, Berks County PA, 1976, Boyer Printing Co., Lebanon PA The Assemblies of Yahweh is the largest sacred name group, but it is not part of the Sacred Name Movement. Origin The Assemblies of Yahweh consider themselves to be the reconstituted Apostolic Assembly that went into dormancy in AD 70. The sect's founder, Jacob O. Meyer, learned about the name Yahweh while he was taking a biblical theological course. As a result, he became convinced of the importance of exclusively employing the names Yahweh for God and later, Yahshua for Jesus. Meyer went on to found the Assemblies of Yahweh in 1969.

Tyndale Press, Wheaton, IL, USA. , p. 319 entry \\"Elijah\\") also alluding to and concerning the return of the worship of Yahweh in the \\"latter days\\". The Assemblies leaders call their faith 'True Worship', rather than Christianity or Judaism. They are less commonly known as Messianic (or Spiritual) Israelites, possibly based on .SNB, 9/14, p.16 Mission statement In 1969 the Assemblies of Yahweh received its charter from Berks County, Pennsylvania. The core of this charter reads: Beliefs The Assemblies of Yahweh profess to follow the Old and New Testaments as closely as possible. This causes the group to be viewed as an admixture of Judaism and Christianity, although they do not actually mix Christian or Jewish doctrines with the teachings of the Scriptures.Encyclopedia of American Religions, 6th edition, page 553. Melton, J. Gordon. Detroit: Gale Research c1999 LCCN: 00702484 They believe that in order to understand the will of Yahweh, the Bible must be harmonized and adhered to as infallible. Members believe it is integral to keep the commandments of Yahweh including the seventh day Sabbath from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown (), the holy days as defined in Leviticus 23 and Deuteronomy 16, and a diet of clean foods as defined in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14. =Eschatology= The Assemblies of Yahweh believes in a Great Tribulation, a Beast System which is interpreted to mean a world ruling government and synchronistic religion on this earth opposed to Yahweh's commandments () and finally, a millennial 1,000 year Kingdom of Yahweh () on this earth which will usher an era of productivity, miracles, love, peace and tranquillity through the universal keeping of the commandments with Yahshua the Messiah ruling as King over this world.. Organizational structure Leadership consists of: * A \\"Directing Elder\\", responsible for the spiritual direction of the Assembly. * \\"Teaching Elders\\", ordained to serve as instructional leaders. * \\"Deacons\\", ordained to serve in the needs of the assemblies. * \\"Senior Missionaries\\", consecrated to serve Yahweh in local areas; many times used as local leader and (or) a new-inquirer contact point. * \\"Missionaries\\", consecrated to serve Yahweh in local areas to help spread their Faith. The Assemblies of Yahweh is led by a Directing Elder, originally Jacob O. Meyer. In accordance with his will and last testament, the Assemblies of Yahweh has since been led by two followers: Teaching Elder Jonathan S. Meyer and Deacon Nathaniel A. Meyer. They are assisted by a group of individuals called \\"the Work of the Ministry\\" who assist in practical matters and provide counsel on questions of doctrine. Educational The Assemblies of Yahweh has two educational institutions located in Bethel, Pennsylvania, Obadiah School of the BibleDNB Company Report on Dalet School and Dalet School. =Obadiah School= Begun in 1973 as Obadiah Assembly, a class concentrating on public speaking, Obadiah School has continued to grow and today has an extensive biblical curriculum. Centered on the Bible class, each course is biblical in nature. Today the graduates form the core of the Assemblies of Yahweh with many of the graduates going on to lead local Assemblies. =Dalet School= From its rudimentary beginnings in 1976, Meyer designed the Dalet School in the reflection of a one-room schoolhouse. The students are given the ability to hear the instruction of underclassmen (as a review) and overclassmen (as a preview). The school today teaches over 40 children and contains classes from kindergarten through 12th grade. Witnessing The Assemblies of Yahweh witness in nearly every format available to them. They believe that radio station WMLK will be instrumental in reaching people all over the world and especially those countries that censor their networks or resist religious programs. The Assemblies of Yahweh uses many tools to spread their message across the world and contact individuals. =Monthly= * The Sacred Name BroadcasterReligions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, pg. 88.

The vessel was completed in December 1969 and entered service with the Canadian Coast Guard. Bartlett is named after Captain Robert Bartlett who made over 40 expeditions to the Arctic. The vessel was initially assigned to serve in the Newfoundland and Great Lakes regions before transferring to the West Coast. The vessel is currently based at Victoria, British Columbia. On 15 February 1982, the mobile offshore drilling unit Ocean Ranger capsized and sank in bad weather east of Newfoundland in the worst naval disaster in Canadian waters since World War II. Bartlett was among the vessels sent to the site and directed the surface search for the crew. Only debris, liferafts and the bodies of 22 of the 84 crew of Ocean Ranger were recovered. Bartlett was modernized in 1988 at Halifax Shipyards, Halifax, Nova Scotia which saw new propulsion and navigation equipment installed. The ship underwent a $16.9 million vessel-life extension at the Allied Shipbuilders yard in North Vancouver in 2010. The refit extended the buoy tender's life by ten years, revamping the vessel's electric systems. In October 2016, after the tugboat Nathan E.

Prior to 2002, the school was known as the Education Laboratory School or University High School (when referring to grades 9 through 12) when it was a part of the College of Education at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa. It is not to be confused with Punahou School, which occupied some of the buildings at the university when they were displaced from their campus by the U.S. military during World War II. History The school was founded as the laboratory school to the Teacher's College at the University of Hawai ªi and dates back to 1895 when a teacher training department was formed at Honolulu High School, located in Princess Ruth's former mansion. Between 1939 and 1941, an elementary school was built to give elementary and pre-school education students hands-on experience. A permanent building for this purpose, Castle Memorial Hall, was constructed at this time. It was a gift of Mary and Samuel Castle, who was one of the founders of Castle & Cooke. Punahou School occupied Castle Memorial Hall and other buildings at the college during World War II (1942‚Äì1945). However, the college continued to operate. Buildings for the high school were constructed after the war with University High School Building 1 opening in 1943 and University High School Building 2 opening in 1948. University High School Building 3 opened in 1957. Finally, the Multipurpose Building is opened in 1963. In the meantime the school graduated its first high school class in 1951. In 1966, the school's focus changed to testing curriculum developed by the college for use in the Hawai'i Public School system under what is now called the Curriculum Research and Development Group (CRDG). Since this time, admission to the school is based on creating a cross section of the state's socio-economic groups to meet the needs of the testing of the curriculum materials. Over the years CRDG increased its marketing area of the materials they develop to across the United States and then internationally. The university stopped funding the school in 1999 due to major budget cuts from the state of Hawai'i in the university's budget. Alumni and friends raised enough money to cover the loss of revenue for two years. In 2001, University Laboratory School became the charter school, Education Laboratory School. The Hawai'i State Department of Education now contracts the CRDG to run the school and the university allows the use of the facilities on campus in exchange for use to test CRDG materials.

This has caused some to question the use of public moneys to fund this school including former Governor Benjamin Cayetano who essentially left the school with no funds. Some view his actions as a retaliatory act since his children were not among the aforementioned individuals admitted. =Use of University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa facilities= When the Educational Laboratory School became a separate entity from the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa in 2001, there was an understanding that the school would become self-sufficient within two years. This meant being able to pay for its maintenance and not need any more university assistance. In 2003 the chancellor of the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa Chancellor, Peter Englert, suggested that the university concentrate solely on research and cease managing the school. He also suggested giving them a one-year contract to prepare to pay rent or move out. Fire On June 13, 2006, a fire erupted on campus in the University Elementary School building. The fire spread rapidly, causing a devastating amount of damage to the building. Among the sections lost were the orchestra room (along with newly refurbished orchestra equipment), the choir room, the performing arts room, the gym, and the athletic office. Arson is believed to be the cause of the fire. School officials are waiting on test results to decide how to clean up the rubble. Findings of lead may hamper and increase the cost of clean-up.

Alexander carried aloft by griffins, Otranto Cathedral floor mosaic, 12th century. The Alexander Romance is an account of the life and exploits of Alexander the Great. Although constructed around a historical core, the romance is largely fictional. It was widely copied and translated, accruing legends and fantastical elements at different stages. The original version was composed in the Greek language before 338 AD, when a Latin translation was made. Several late manuscripts attribute the work to Alexander's court historian Callisthenes, but the historical person died before Alexander and could not have written a full account of his life. The unknown author is still sometimes known as Pseudo-Callisthenes. Between the 4th and the 16th centuries the Alexander Romance was translated into Coptic, Ge'ez, Byzantine Greek, Arabic, Persian, Armenian, Syriac, Hebrew and most medieval European vernaculars. The romance was also put into verse, as in a Byzantine recension of 1388. Owing to the great variety of distinct works derived from the original Greek romance, the \\"Alexander romance\\" is sometimes treated as a literary genre and not a single work.See, e.g., Alexander romance at Encyclopaedia Britannica. Versions of the romance Armenian illuminated manuscript of 14th century of 5th century translation Alexander was a legend during his own time. In a now-lost history of the king, the historical Callisthenes described the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing after Alexander's death, another participant, Onesicritus, invented a tryst between Alexander and Thalestris, queen of the mythical Amazons. (According to Plutarch, when Onesicritus read this passage to his patron Lysimachus, one of Alexander's generals who later became a king himself, Lysimachus quipped \\"I wonder where I was at the time.\\"Plutarch, Life of Alexander, XLVI.) Throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages, the Romance experienced numerous expansions and revisions exhibiting a variability unknown for more formal literary forms. Latin, Armenian, Georgian and Syriac translations were made in Late Antiquity (4th to 6th centuries). The Latin Alexandreis of Walter of Ch√¢tillon was one of the most popular medieval romances. A 10th-century Latin version by one Leo the Archpriest is the basis of the later medieval vernacular translations in all the major languages of Europe, including Old French (12th century), Middle English, Early Scots (The Buik of Alexander) (13th century), Italian, Spanish (the Libro de Alexandre), Central German (Lamprecht's Alexanderlied and a 15th-century version by Johannes Hartlieb), Slavonic, Romanian, Hungarian and Irish.Kuno Meyer, Eine irische Version der Alexandersage, 1884. The Syriac version generated Middle Eastern recensions, including Arabic, Persian (Iskandarnamah), Ethiopic, Hebrew (in the first part of Sefer HaAggadah), Ottoman Turkish (14th century), and Middle Mongolian (13th-14th century). In addition to the Alexander Romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes, the Syriac version also includes a short appendix now known as the Syriac Alexander Legend. This original Syriac text was written in north Mesopotamia around 629-630 AD, shortly after Heraclius defeated the Persians. It contains additional motifs not found in the earliest Greek version of the Romance, including the episode where Alexander builds a wall against Gog and Magog. Greek versions The oldest version of the Greek text, the Historia Alexandri Magni (Recensio Œ±), can be dated to the 3rd century. It was subjected to various revisions during the Byzantine Empire, some of them recasting it into poetical form in Medieval Greek vernacular. Recensio Œ± is the source of a Latin version by Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius (4th century), and an Armenian version (5th century). Most of the content of the Romance is fantastical, including many miraculous tales and encounters with mythical creatures such as Sirens or Centaurs. *Recensio Œ± sive Recensio vetusta: W.

Thessalonica, 1974] French versions There are several Old and Middle French and one Anglo-Norman Alexander romances: #The Alexandre of Alb√©ric de Brian√ßon was composed around 1120. #Fuerre de Gadres by a certain Eustache, later used by Alexandre de Bernay and Thomas de Kent #Decasyllabic Alexander, anonymous from 1160‚Äì70. #Mort Alixandre, an anonymous fragment of 159 lines. #Li romans d'Alixandre (c.1170), attributed to clergyman Alexandre de Bernay (also known as Alexandre de P√¢ris), is based on the translations of various episodes of the conqueror's life as composed by previous poets (Lambert de Tort, Eustache and more importantly Alb√©ric of Besan√ßon). Unlike other authors of the era who undertook the Alexander saga, he did not base his work on the Pseudo-Callisthenes or on the various translations of Julius Valerius' work. As is common in medieval literature, the project results from the desire to improve on the work of others and to offer the complete life of the hero to the public, a theme that is also very present in the cycles of the chansons de geste at the time. Thomas de Kent also penned (probably) the very same decade a version of the saga, Le roman de toute chevalerie, which is independent of Alexandre de Bernay's poem: Alexander's influence on the medieval imagination is thus shown as being as great as, if not greater than, that of other pagan figures such as Hercules or Aeneas. #Thomas de Kent (or Eustache), around 1175, wrote the Anglo-Norman Roman de toute chevalerie, which became the basis for the Middle English King Alysaunder. #La Venjance Alixandre by Jehan le Nevelon. #The Alixandre en Orient of Lambert de Tort was composed around 1170. #Le Vengement Alixandre by Gui de Cambrai, before 1191. #The Roman d'Alexandre en prose was the most popular Old French version. Anonymous. #Prise de Defur, from Picardy c. 1250. #The Voyage d'Alexandre au Paradis terrestre is a French adaptation (c. 1260) of the Latin Iter ad paradisum #The Vow Cycle of Alexander romances includes the Voeux du paon by Jacques de Longuyon, Restor du Paon by Jean le Court, and Parfait du paon by Jean de Le Mote. #The Faicts et les Conquestes d'Alexandre le Grand by Jean Wauquelin c. 1448. #The Fais et concquestes du noble roy Alexandre is a late medieval prose version. #The Faits du grand Alexandre by Vasque de Luc√®ne is a prose translation (1468) of Quintus Curtius Rufus' Historiae Alexandri Magni. English versions In medieval England the Alexander Romance experienced a remarkable popularity. It is even referred to in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, where the monk apologizes to the pilgrimage group for treating a material so well known. There are five major romances in Middle English which have been passed down to us and most remain only in fragments. There are also two versions from Scotland, one which has sometimes been ascribed to the Early Scots poet John Barbour which exists only in a sixteenth-century printing, and a Middle Scots version from 1499: #King Alisaunder from c. 1275. In medieval orthography, \\"king\\" could be \\"kyng\\" and \\"Alisaunder\\" could be \\"Alysaunder\\". #The Romance of Alisaunder (or Alexander of Macedon), sometimes referred to as Alexander A, is a fragment of 1247 lines and written in alliterative verse. It was probably written between 1340 and 1370, soon before the beginning of the Alliterative Revival, of which it is believed to be one of the oldest remaining poems. It has been preserved in a school notebook dating from 1600. Alexander A deals with the begetting of Alexander by Nectanebus, his birth and early years and ends with the midst of the account of Philip's siege of Byzantium. It is likely that the source for this fragment has been the I¬≤-recension of the Historia de Preliis. Beside that it has been expanded with additional material taken from Paulus Orosius' Historiae adversum paganos, the adverse remarks, which are typical of Orosius, however have been omitted by the poet, whose main concern is Alexander's heroic conduct. #Alexander and Dindimus, sometimes referred to as Alexander B, is also written in alliterative verse. This fragment is found in the and consists of five letters which are passed between Alexander and Dindimus, who is the king of the Brahmins, a people of philosophers who shun all worldly lusts, ambitions and entertainments. In this respect their way of life resembles the ideal of an aescetic life, which was also preached by medieval monastic orders, such as the Franciscans. The source of Alexander B again is the I¬≤-recension of the Historia de Preliis. #The Wars of Alexander, sometimes referred to as Alexander C, is the longest of the alliterative versions of the Middle English Alexander Romances. It goes back to the I¬≥-recension of the Historia de Preliis and can be found in the MS Ashmole 44 and in the Dublin Trinity College MS 213. Although both manuscripts are incomplete they supplement each other fairly well. In this version much space is given to letters and prophecies, which often bear a moralizing and philosophical tenor. The letters are an integral part of the Pseudo-Callisthenes tradition. The dominant theme is pride, which inevitably results in the downfall of kings. In The Wars of Alexander the hero is endowed with superhuman qualities, which shows in the romance insofar as his enemies fall to him by the dozens and he is always at the center of action. #The Prose Life of Alexander copied by Robert Thornton, c. 1440. #The Buik of Alexander, anonymous, attributed to John Barbour, dates to 1438 according to its first printed edition from 1580. #The Buik of King Alexander the Conquerour by Gilbert Hay, 1499. This work is in Middle Scots. Jewish versions Josephus in his Antiquities of the Jews mentions that Alexander visited Jerusalem and saluted the high priest, saying that he had seen him in his dreams back in Macedonia.Flavius Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XI The Talmud also has many legends relating to Alexander, For example, it mentions that the Samaritans conspired for the destruction of the temple, but Alexander prostrated himself at the feet of the high priest Simon the Just. It also mentions many other legends on Alexander, such as: The Ten Questions of Alexander to the Sages of the South, his Journey to the Regions of Darkness, the Amazons, the Gold Bread, Alexander at the Gate of Paradise, his ascent into the air, and Descent into the Sea.Jewish Encyclopedia, Alexander The GreatChabad, Alexander in Jerusalem There is also the legend of the Egyptians suing the Jews before Alexander.Chabad, Egyptians Sue the Jews Syriac, Arabic, Persian, Armenian and Ethiopic versions The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance is preserved in five manuscripts, the oldest was compiled in 1708-09. It is largely based on the Greek Pseudo- Callisthenes, with slight modifications, like the addition of Alexander's journey to China. In Syriac literature in particular, there are other works originally written in Syriac that are often attached to the Alexander Romance manuscripts. These works include the Syriac Legend of Alexander, written in north Mesopotamia around 629-630 AD, shortly after Heraclius defeated the Persians. The Syriac Legend contains additional motifs not found in the earliest Greek Romance, including the episode where Alexander builds a wall against Gog and Magog. There is also a poem wrongly attributed to Jacob of Serugh based on the Syriac Legend but written slightly later. Finally, there is a shorter version of the Legend and an original brief biography of Alexander. The Syriac Alexander Legend, currently dated around 629-630 AD, has been found to closely resemble the story of Dhu al-Qarnayn in the Qur'an (see Alexander the Great in the Quran). There exist two later Persian varieties which are the Iskandarnameh and the A‚Äôina-yi Sikanderi of Amir Khusrow. The Armenian edition can be found in \\"San Lazzaro MS 424 - Alexander romance\\" (see https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:San_Lazzaro_MS_424_-_Alexander_romance. The Ethiopic version, dated between the 14th and 16th centuries, while ultimately based on the Syriac original, is said to be a translation from a presumed intermediary Arabic version from the 9th century. The Ethiopic version also integrates motifs from the Syriac Alexander Legend within the Romance narrative. Slavonic versions In the Middle Ages and later, on the Balkans and in Eastern Europe, also appeared many translations of the novel in Old-Slavonic and Slavonic languages.

Founded in 1964 by Lorraine Cooke, it moved to the current La Pietra campus in 1969. Barbara Cox Anthony chaired the school's board of trustees until her death in 2007. The school is at the foot of Diamond Head. The main building was designed by Chicago architect, David Adler and was modeled after an Italian villa in Florence, Italy of the same name. History =Heiau site= The site was near or partially on an ancient Hawaiian heiau (temple) called Papaenaena. Referred to by early writers as \\"Leahi\\" (the Hawaiian name for Diamond Head) heiau, it was quadrangular, about across with ocean facing terraces leading into the structure and several altars located near the back wall. Papaenaena was arguably built by Maui King Kahekili to commemorate his conquest of Oahu. This heiau was destroyed by Kanaia about 1856 and its stones were carted off to Waikiki for use as rock walls and driveways. Papaenaena figured Kamehameha I's conquest of the Hawaiian Islands. In 1804, when Kamehameha was on his way to invade Kauai he halted at Oahu with an army of 8000 men. An epidemic killed more than two- thirds of his army. During the epidemic Kamehameha, upon the advice of his priests, instituted a ten-day kapu (restriction) and sacrificed three humans and many hogs and edible plants. The men sacrificed were accused of eating tabu coconuts. Kamehameha also is reported to have sacrificed his nephew, Kanihonui, who broke the tabu with Kamehameha's Queen, Kaahumanu, at Papaenaena.\\"Tales of Temples,\\" in All About Hawaii, 1904 University of Michigan Press \\" It overlooked what is today First Break, the beginning of Kalehuawehe, a surfing course famous for hundreds of years.

After the king's death this site was sold to James Campbell, in 1883. Walter F. Dillingham bought the land from Campbell and built a home for his bride, Louise Gaylord. Dillingham was the son of Benjamin Dillingham, of Oahu Railway and Land Company. The Dillinghams were married in Florence, Italy, at Villa La Pietra, the 600-year-old villa of Louise's aunt Hortense Mitchell Acton. After selecting the Diamond Head site as their home, Louise Dillingham and her husband hired Chicago architect David Adler to draw up plans for a villa that would draw its inspiration from Villa La Pietra in Florence, but not copy it. When completed in 1922 for $400,000 the main building included five bedrooms. These rooms, 47 years later, became the classrooms of the school. For 40 years La Pietra was the social center of Honolulu. The Dillinghams hosted many notable visitors, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Walt Disney.J Gilmar, Historic Hawai'i News, November 1983 The portion which is now the school was left by Dillingham to Punahou School. Unable to use the building, Punahou was anxious to sell it. After a period in which there were few interested buyers (Punahou was asking $1 million for the estate), Lorraine Day Cooke (wife of Richard Aexander Cooke Jr., who was grandson of Charles Montague Cooke and great-grandson of Amos Starr Cooke, co-founder of Castle & Cooke) and Mrs. Garner Anthony raised the funds. They had started a Hawaii School for Girls at Central Union Church. Plans were developed by architect John Tatom and his assistant Tom Fanning. Work to convert the estate into a school was done by parent volunteers and the Dillingham's Hawaiian Dredging Company. Hawaii School for Girls moved into the site at the start of the 1969-1970 school year. In 1976 a new six-classroom building was constructed on the site of the old swimming pool. This building, designed by Leo Wou, was intended to mirror the architecture of the Dillingham villa. The school is located at 2933 Poni Moi Road, .  Kapiolani Park  La Pietra is just a few hundred yards above Honolulu's Kapiolani Park. As swamp land in a desert, the land became a park specifically because it wasn't considered suitable for anything else. It is one of the few places on Oahu where rain rarely falls. Because La Pietra has limited space for athletics, Kapiolani Park is used for physical education classes and training for soccer and cross country running teams.

Divine Wind, is an arcade fixed shooter developed by Konami, and the first arcade game published by Stern Electronics. Astro Invader was ported to the Emerson Arcadia 2001 in 1982. Description Screenshot The player controls a small spaceship at the bottom of the screen. Like most Space Invaders-type games of the period, the ship can move left and right (but not up or down), and can fire one bullet at a time. The ship may not fire again until its previous shot has detonated. The playfield above the player's ship contains 13 columns. Three of them, on the far left, far right, and in the center, are wide columns. The other 10, five on either side of the center, are much narrower. At the beginning of each wave, a flying saucer enters at the top of the screen and begins dropping small aliens into the ten narrow columns. The columns are open on the bottom, allowing the player to shoot the aliens as they descend. Each column holds a maximum of four aliens. If a column is full, the next alien dropped into it will release the bottommost alien, which falls straight down. Aliens can also be dropped into either of the two wide columns on the far left and right, in which case they fall straight down immediately. If the alien reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot by the player, it explodes - the explosion extends slightly to each side of the alien. Collision with a falling alien or its explosion destroys the player's ship. The small aliens are worth 20 points when moving (falling into or out of a column), and 10 points at rest. Aliens remain in their columns until shot or released; any aliens at rest in a column, either at the end of a wave or when the player's ship is destroyed, are still there when play resumes. At regular intervals, a small flying saucer descends from one of the three wide columns. Unlike the small aliens, the saucer absolutely must be killed - if it is allowed to reach the bottom of the screen, the player's ship is immediately destroyed. Saucers are worth anywhere from 100 to 400 points. A counter on the large saucer tells the player how many aliens it has left to drop for that wave. When the counter reaches 000 the wave is over. Everything freezes at this point, including the player's ship and bullets and all descending saucers and aliens, and the large saucer flies away. A new large saucer carrying more aliens then flies in to take its place and begin the next wave. When the new saucer reaches the top- center, the game unfreezes and everything resumes exactly as it was before play was interrupted, with the new saucer continuing the job of dropping aliens. Legacy An Astro Invader machine appears in the music video for the 1982 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song \\"You Got Lucky\\". The band finds a working one buried under some junk in an old barn, and eventually Petty knocks the machine over.

Brutalist fountain, Freeway Park, circa 1970s. First Hill, offering both a staircase and wheelchair-accessible ramps. Freeway Park is an urban park in Seattle, Washington, United States, connecting the city's downtown to the Washington State Convention Center and First Hill. The park sits atop a section of Interstate 5 and a large city- owned parking lot; 8th Avenue also bridges over the park. An unusual mixture of brutalist architecture and greenery, the park, designed by Lawrence Halprin's office under the supervision of Angela Danadjieva, opened to the public on July 4, 1976. A later addition to the park opened in 1982 winds several blocks up First Hill, with a staircase and wheelchair ramp. A series of crimes, notably a January 18, 2002 murder, briefly gave the park a reputation as a haven for crime and led to calls for a radical redesign. Many at first attributed the dangers to the design of the park. A neighborhood group formed under the name Freeway Park Neighborhood Association (FPNA) collaborated with the city's parks and recreation department to produce an \\"activation plan\\" for the park, published in 2005 as \\"A New Vision for Freeway Park\\". The report concluded that the park's problems could be remedied by numerous small changes: increased security patrols, better lighting, pruning back of certain plants, and above all increased use, both in terms of organized events and simply encouraging more convention center visitors to use the park. The strategy, only partly implemented , seems to be succeeding: according to David Brewster of the FPNA, crime in the park is down 90% compared to that of 2002. The park was renovated in 2008 and renamed to honor civic leader Jim Ellis. The park is also a cultural landscape and a precedent setting park that defines a new land-use typology for American cities. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019.

He used his training from \\"Institut National Agronomique\\" in Paris, from which he graduated in 1938.See for instance ‚ÄúAnnuaire des dipl√¥m√©s AgroParisTech 2014‚Äù, p. 379. to develop in Madagascar the rice cultivation method known as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI). Life Henri de Laulani√© de Sainte- Croix was trained as an agronomist at Institut National Agronomique in Paris and gained knowledge of the physiology of rice tillering from a document capitalising on rice yield components analysis published by the French NGO Groupe de Recherches et d'Echanges Technologiques (GRET), which mentioned the work of the Japanese scientist Katayama on the rice phyllochrones Page 66. The GRET document's title is ‚ÄúL‚Äôanalyse de l‚Äô√©laboration du rendement du riz‚Äù and was edited in January 1987 by a young French agronomist, himself from the same institution as de Laulani√©, promotion 1983 published in 1951. He arrived on Madagascar in 1961, at the age of 41. As rice was the staple food of the Malagasy people, he set about trying to help farmers increase their rice production. He continued his efforts at improving rice cultivation until his death 34 years later at the age of 75. System of Rice Intensification (SRI) was first developed in 1983, but was not fully tested until some years later. His discovery of SRI was publicized in his book Rice in Madagascar. SRI is based on four principles: 1\\\\. Establishing plants early and quickly, to favor healthy and vigorous root and vegetative plant growth. 2\\\\. Maintaining low plant density to allow optimal development of each individual plant and to minimize competitions between plants for nutrients, water and sunlight. 3\\\\. Enriching soils with organic matter to improve nutrient and water holding capacity, increase microbial life in the soil, and to provide a good substrate for roots to grow and develop, 4\\\\. Reducing and controlling the application of water, providing only as much water as necessary for optimal plant development and to favor aerobic soil conditions. The System of Rice Intensification was later adopted by over 55 countries around the world and has improved food security for millions of small holder rice farmers.http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/images/global/SRI_World_Map_2016.png De Laulanie died in Madagascar in 1995. His grave is located in the cemetery at Ambohipo, Madagascar.  Agricultural school SRI field In 1981 de Laulanie founded the agricultural school General Training Course for Rural Adults (Cours de Formation Generale pour Adultes Ruraux ‚Äì CFGR) at Antsirabe to help educate the young. Laulani√© had earlier taught agriculture at the Institut National d'Horticulture et de Paysage in Angers, France. After arriving in Madagascar he set to work at devising courses suited to the local farmers, and implemented his vision through CFGR after 19 years of experience, devising a course plan that included physics, chemistry, economics, and sociology. He had acquired experience for such an effort while in Angers, training those released from military service to pass the entrance exam at the university. He founded CFGR to train rural youth and adults to be proud of their peasant identity and rural origins. This was in response to the curriculum in other such schools which he believed to be insensitive to the farmers' difficult situation. The school now offers correspondence courses for adults who lack the opportunity for an education, especially in the areas of Antananarivo, Mahitsy, Fihaonana, Andriampamaky, Mampikony, Ambohibary-Sambaina, Tsaravavaka-Antsirabe, Ambositra, Ivato, and Anjom√†-Nandihizana, Madagascar.

It is bordered in the north by the Hill District and located across the Monongahela River from South Side. The predominant area zip code is 15219. This area is home to Mercy Hospital as well as Duquesne University. It also includes a residential community that was once flourishing during the first half of the 20th century. Uptown is also the home of the Pittsburgh Fire Bureau 4 Engine and 4 Truck. History The area was known to American frontiersmen and colonists as Ayer's Hill in honor of a fortification built by the English commander Ayers in the mid-1700s. Sometime near the Revolutionary War and throughout the 19th century the area was referred to as Boyd's Hill in the expanding frontier and then industrial city. The name is said to have been given to the neighborhood after a newly arrived businessman swayed by Hugh Brackenridge, left his downtown office and hanged himself on the hill. Uptown was first developed by James Tustin, an eccentric English √©migr√© who built an estate in the area in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. His home featured an English taste in architecture and a fruit orchard, and was acknowledged at the time to have been \\"the most beautiful place in Pittsburgh,\\" according to a 1915 article in the Pittsburgh Gazette‚ÄìTimes. Tustin named his estate \\"Soho\\" after his previous residence in Britain, and the name came to be generally applied to the neighborhood. The neighborhood was originally part of Pitt Township, but was annexed in 1846. The addition was precipitated by the city's efforts at regrowth following a cataclysmic fire in 1845, which destroyed and 1,000 buildings. A 1922 guidebook, A History of Pittsburgh and Environs, noted that the area's houses were \\"old and not attractive, and are largely populated by foreign mill workers and their families\\", and a 1977 guide remarked that it was once \\"a pleasant residential area for many wealthy Pittsburghers\\" but \\"as industry moved in, the wealthy moved out\\". The neighborhood was adversely affected by Pittsburgh's urban renewal campaign in the 1960s, and in the estimation of some, \\"has never been reassembled\\". Construction projects in the area include expansion by Duquesne University, and development surrounding the newly completed arena for the Pittsburgh Penguins. Neighborhood character Fifth Avenue is home to law offices such as nationally recognized Schiffman Firm, LLC and a few restaurants and bars, but vacant storefronts and small street parking lots for Downtown commuters are prevalent as well. Brick rowhouses are common in the neighborhood. There are significant efforts in the community to reassert a sense of identity, and residents range from Downtown workers and long-time residents to university students and health professionals. City Steps While the Bluff / Uptown neighborhood only has two distinct flights of city steps - it is home to one of the oldest and most striking. Connecting Bluff Street to Second Avenue is a 170 steps flight that also includes a walkway overpass above the Boulevard of the Allies. It is a very popular way to connect Duquesne University students, faculty, and staff to the 10th Street Bridge and the Southside. These City Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and provide an easy way to travel through this densely populated area. Surrounding and adjacent Pittsburgh neighborhoods Uptown has four land borders with Downtown Pittsburgh to the west and northwest, the Crawford-Roberts section of the Hill District to the north, West Oakland to the northeast and South Oakland to the east. The entire Bluff runs adjacent to the western section of the South Side Flats across the Monongahela River; the two neighborhoods are accessible to each other by the South Tenth Street and Birmingham Bridges.

It is their debut release for the Fat Possum record label, although in the UK and Europe it was co-released by Epitaph Records. Background The band's debut album The Big Come Up had been tremendously successful for an independent rock band and Thickfreakness further increased their profile. It continues The Black Keys' tradition of raw, heavy blues- influenced garage rock. Songs such as \\"Set You Free\\" won the pair some mainstream success as being featured in the soundtrack of the 2003 film School of Rock. Heavy comparisons to another American blues-influenced garage rock duo, The White Stripes, were often made by the music media. Recording Most of the album was recorded in December 2002 during a single 14-hour session in Patrick Carney's basement using an early 1980s Tascam 388 8-track recorder. This approach was necessary because the group spent its small advance payment from Fat Possum Records on rent. The liner notes claim this is Carney's \\"patented recording technique called 'medium fidelity'\\". The result is a more vintage sound. The song \\"Midnight in Her Eyes\\" is one of the few Black Keys songs that used a bass guitar; Dan Auerbach dubbed a bassline by playing a Guild SG-style bass through a guitar amp into the song. Part of \\"Set You Free\\" was recorded by Jeff Saltzman. The album included two covers: \\"Have Love, Will Travel\\" by Richard Berry and \\"Everywhere I Go\\" by north Mississippi bluesman Junior Kimbrough. The cover art was made by Carney's brother Michael, who was responsible for the whole graphical process after the layout of The Big Come Up ended up done by Patrick Boissel of Alive Records. As the Carneys drove around Akron trying to think of an idea, they ended up in a Super K-Mart and eventually found a concept upon finding a can of pomade. Then they moved all of the lamps in his house into one room to light up the picture, where Patrick handled the pomade.Behind the Artwork: Michael Carney & The Heartless Bastard‚Äôs The Mountain Reception Thickfreakness was The Black Keys' first breakthrough album, as it established them as an indie-rock blues band. Their recognition from Thickfreakness led them on a rigorous tour schedule including opening for singer/songwriter Beck (on his Sea Change summer tour) in the summer of 2003. According to The Boston Globe, \\"Thickfreakness is an album that's meant to be felt as much as heard, rigged with plunging riffs, Auerbach's charcoal-smoke singing voice, and rhythmic pockets as deep as quicksand\\". It was during this time that Auerbach began writing material for their next album. When the two returned from touring, Auerbach's landlord had sold his house where the duo wrote Thickfreakness in the basement.

Its gameplay is modelled on the Apple II game Rescue Raiders. Player can compete against the computer or other humans in a LAN environment. The game supports cooperative multiplayer of up to two players per side. The player controls a helicopter armed with a limited number of munitions, such as missiles, bombs, machine guns, and napalm. As the player requisitions computer-controlled tanks, infantry, engineers. Mobile missile platforms, and vans round out available firepower.  Gameplay  = Objective = The objective is to destroy an opposing base at the opposite end of the play area. Various units are deployed for this purpose, which can be assisted by the player's helicopter. The enemy has the same arsenal as the player, so tactics and convoy composition are vital. Only the van, which contains electronic warfare equipment, can achieve victory by coming into contact with the enemy base. Its armor is quite weak, so these units must be protected at all times. The two-dimensional battlefield is a long strip of ground, with the player's base on the left end and the enemy's base on the right. Every map has these two bases, but each map has a different pattern of fixed terrain features. The game ends when one of these two bases is captured. The player's view is always focused on the central unit, the helicopter. The helicopter carries 2 guided missiles, 10 bombs and has a machine gun with 64 rounds of ammunition (at higher levels the machine gun is replaced by 6 unguided missiles). The helicopter's fuel is limited, so each player has to return to base before there's insufficient fuel left for the trip back. The helicopter is very vulnerable to enemy fire and so relies on its agility and the player's control to survive on the battlefield. = Budget = War funds slowly trickle into a spending account that allows purchase of units. Each unit has an associated cost. A helicopter costs 20, tanks 4, mobile missile launchers 3, vans 2, infantry and engineers 5. The player must spend carefully to ensure the purchase of equipment as needed. The farther the helicopter is from its landing pad, the higher the rate of funding. The more assets you have on the ground at the end of a battle the more funds you have to start the next battle. All units must be purchased by the player, but once bought, they blindly advance to the right towards the enemy base. Extra lives may be purchased by buying more helicopters.  Reception  The game was reviewed in 1991 in Dragon #166 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. 1992 and 1994 Computer Gaming World surveys of wargames with modern settings gave the game one and a half stars out of five, describing it as \\"a short entertaining diversion, but little of serious import\\".

The South Side is officially divided into two neighborhoods, South Side Flats and South Side Slopes. Both the Flats and the Slopes are represented on Pittsburgh City Council by Bruce Kraus. The business district stretches along East Carson Street, which is home to many small shops, restaurants and bars. In 2006, more than 80 bars and pubs operated in the South Side Flats. The neighborhood has an urban fabric with rowhouses. The South Side is well- connected with public transit. Its proximity and public transit connections also have attracted professionals who work downtown. Pittsburgh Fire Station #24 is located on Mary Street in the neighborhood. History The South Side, most of which was originally the village of Birmingham that was annexed to the city in 1872, was settled primarily by German then later Eastern European immigrants who came to Pittsburgh to work in heavy industry. Dr. Nathaniel Bedford planned a large part of Birmingham and named many streets after his friends and family, thus the predominance of streets named after people such as Jane, Sarah, and Carson. For many years, much of the South Side was dominated by heavy industry and associated service businesses. The Jones and Laughlin Steel Company was located on the South Side but closed in the 1980s and has since been redeveloped. The Pittsburgh Terminal Properties building is located on the west end of Carson Street, next to the Liberty Bridge. When construction finished in 1906, it was the largest warehouse between New York and Chicago. Connections to river, rail, and road transport made it an ideal facility for merchants who sold goods and needed temporary storage. It has since been redeveloped into River Walk Corporate Centre and houses a mix of office and service businesses including Paper Products Company and City Center Self Storage. In more recent years, the South Side has become home to a larger student population. Many students at Duquesne University, University of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Mellon University either live in the South Side or spend a portion of their nightlife there. A walk over the South Tenth Street Bridge that crosses the Monongahela River takes students to Duquesne University. Due to the large number of college students and young professionals, in addition to the thriving bar scene, South Side has developed into a nightlife destination for young people in Pittsburgh. Economy Important streets in South Side are E. Carson Street, Josephine Street, and S. 18th street. The business district is located along E. Carson Street, which runs the length of South Side. The Birmingham Bridge makes South Side easily accessible from Oakland, which is around 2 miles away from South Side. Station Square is about 1.5 miles west of South Side, and Mt. Washington is 2.5 miles away. The average South Side family income in 2003 was $41,353. East Carson St. has restaurants, bars, and shops that help support the economy of the South Side. The large variety of shopping along E. Carson Street and SouthSide Works is also a factor in the South Side's economy. There are a variety of locally owned stores such as Pittsburgh Jeans Co. and widespread stores such as American Eagle, H&M;, and Nine West. The Urban Redevelopment Authority started the SouthSide Works project hoping to create over 6,000 jobs.\\"Columbia To Serve Old Steel Site\\", Pasha Publication, 24,Aug,1998, Lexis Nexis Academic Database,Retrieved 2010-11-20 Today, SouthSide Works has over 10 shopping stores and over 10 restaurants & bars. The restoration of the business district has improved South Sides economy dramatically and house sales have jumped $75,000 in the past 10 years along with vacancy dropping below 10%. The South Side is also home to a variety of service businesses and reconverted office buildings. Many businesses locate here because rents are less than in Downtown Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Terminal Properties building has been converted into River Walk Corporate Center. Tenants are a mix of light industrial (The Paper Company), professional (LDA Architects), and storage for Pittsburgh businesses and residents (City Center Self Storage). South Side Local Development Company (LDC) helps the economic development in the neighborhood. Under LDC, the Neighborhood Assistance Program was created. The NAP is partners with PNC bank and able to fund programs to create jobs and housing production with their $2.5 million grant. Since 1982, LDC has created over 250 new businesses, renovated over 200 stores, and built over 700 new homes. South Sides redeveloped downtown has increased apartment sales and attracted a lot of nightlife in the neighborhood.O'toole, Christine, \\"Arts and Science remake the steel city\\" The New York Times, July 20, 2005.Web. 20 Nov.2010 South Side Flats Narrow street The Flats has one of the largest Victorian main streets in the United States. The entire length of East Carson Street is designated as a historic district. Strict rules dictate what the exterior of the buildings can look like. This neighborhood is a prime example of adaptive reuse of historic structures to spur community revitalization. One of the famous steel mills of Pittsburgh, the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company was located on the South Side but closed in the 1980s and today the land is home to the SouthSide Works shopping and entertainment complex. In the 1980s, this neighborhood was rapidly declining but historic preservation propelled it to a new and bright future. Today, the South Side is a desirable city neighborhood and is known for its multitude of bars and restaurants. The South Side is a popular destination for Pittsburgh residents who seek an entertaining nightlife. The popularity of the neighborhood has costs. Older, lifelong residents often clash with the values of the young urban professionals and students moving in. Also, parking in the South Side is among the tightest in the city, as narrow streets and high density of buildings leave little empty street space. Nuisance crime has also been a growing issue, but in mid-2018, city leaders announced that crime in the South Side bar district dropped by roughly 30 percent from the previous year, possibly because of the addition of new outdoor security cameras and a larger police patrol presence. South Side Slopes The South Side Slopes is the very steep neighborhood located just south of what is traditionally thought of as the South Side but is more appropriately the South Side Flats. Sections of the Slopes are so steep that special fire trucks have to be used to navigate the zigzagging maze of narrow streets. Some spots are so steep that public staircases actually serve as the street. These public steps have street signs and houses located along them. Public steps are not rare in the hilly city of Pittsburgh. The city has over 700 sets of steps providing access to otherwise unreachable neighborhoods.

Jeffson's fianc√©e, the Countess Clodagh, poisons her own cousin to secure a place on the ship for Jeffson, because the expedition was known to be one of the best ever planned. A millionaire, who died some years previously, had provided in his will for the payment of millions of dollars to the first person to reach the Pole. Before Jeffson leaves, he hears a priest speaking against polar research, calling the failure of all previous expeditions the will of God, and prophesying a terrible fate for those who attempt to go against God's will. Jeffson remembers meeting with a man who claimed that the universe is a place of strife between vague \\"powers\\", \\"The White\\" and \\"The Black\\", which vie for dominance. Throughout the polar journey, Jeffson discovers that his course has been guided by these mysterious forces. He finds a huge lake of spinning water, with a rocky island inlaid with inscriptions. Upon seeing this, Jeffson faints. When he returns to his camp he feels nauseated after having smelled a peculiar peach-like odour. He also notices a moving purple cloud, spreading in the heavens. During the journey, he discovers dead animals, all without injury, and he learns of the death of his crew. The ship being fairly easy to operate,John D. Squires, \\"Shiel's Liquid Air Engines in The Purple Cloud\\",The New York Review of Science Fiction, December 2009, # 256, Vol 22, No 4 (Dec 2009), 6. he sets out by himself. First, he travels towards northern islands, but upon seeing the death of all various races from around the Earth there (the result of an exodus, escaping the death-bringing cloud), and meeting ships crowded with corpses, he comes instead to the dead continent, walking through London, searching for news of the cloud. He looks for any survivors, but finds all barricades broken through by mad crowds. Later, he goes to the house of Arthur Machen (a close friend of Shiel's), whom he finds dead, having been writing a poem until the very end. There, he finds the notebook into which he writes his whole narrative. The later parts of the book describe Jeffson's descent into mad pompousness: adopting Turkish attire, he declares himself monarch and burns down cities (including Paris, Bordeaux, London, and San Francisco) for pleasure. He then commits his life to one task, the construction of a huge and colossal golden palace on the isle of Imbros, which he means to dedicate as an altar to God and a palace to himself. He spends seventeen years on the palace, several times abandoning the work, until its completion, when he recognises the vanity of it. While travelling through Constantinople, which he also burns down, he meets a twenty-year-old naked woman who is without the slightest knowledge of anything in the world. She continues to follow him, no matter how he mistreats her. Gradually, he accepts her, but forces her to wear a veil over her mouth. Her speed at learning astonishes him, so he teaches her to speak, read, cook, fish, and dress. The girl (who is unable to pronounce \\"r\\", instead saying \\"l\\") reveals that she had lived her whole life in a cellar below the royal palace of Turkey, and that she knew nothing of the world until she was freed when Jeffson burned down Constantinople. She becomes absorbed in the Bible and declares the humans who sought for riches as \\"spoiled\\". Jeffson struggles mightily against his growing affection towards the girl, wishing to end the human race. At the end, when he leaves to go to England, she telephones him about the re-appearance of the Purple Cloud over France. He rushes to her, embracing her as his wife and now hoping to find a way to escape the cloud. She tells him to trust that God will not allow her to die. He concludes his writing by saying that he has accepted his role and that after three weeks have passed no purple cloud has appeared, and he looks forward to the two of them becoming the progenitors of future humanity.

Description Panama City The pale-vented pigeon is 30‚Äì32 cm long and weighs normally 230‚Äì250 g. Adult males have a mainly dull purple head, breast and upperpart plumage, with copper glossing on the nape and a whitish throat. The lower back and tail are dark grey and the lower underparts are pale grey. The bill is black and the legs, iris and eyering are red. The female is similar, but duller than the male, and immatures are greyish-brown, very dull, and mainly greyish brown. The southern subspecies P. c. andersoni has white lower underparts, rather than the pale grey of nominate P. c. cayennensis. The call is a row of soft kuk kuk croo-ooos; the initial short kuk is characteristic for the \\"cayennensis group\\" of Patagioenas. Altogether, this species' song is intermediate between that of its close relatives the plain (P. inornata) and red-billed pigeons (P. flavirostris).Mahler, Bettina & Tubaro, Pablo L.

(HTML abstract) It may in the field resemble a scaled pigeon (P. speciosa), which has a similar display flight. These two large species are also the only pigeons in their range which are often seen flying in the open away from forests. But of course P. cayennensis lacks the scaly appearance, and the calls and appearance from close by indicate that the two are not particularly close relatives among their congeners. Ecology The pale-vented pigeon is common at forest edges, riverbanks, and other partially open areas with some trees. It feeds mainly on small fruits, berries and seed. This is a fairly solitary bird, but may form small flocks at drinking areas. Its flight is high, fast and direct, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. It also has a breeding display with a semi-circular glide down to its original perch. It builds a small twig nest in a small tree, and normally lays one white egg. Widespread and common, it is classified a species of least concern by the IUCN.

Usually, mattes are used to combine a foreground image (e.g. actors on a set or a spaceship) with a background image (e.g. a scenic vista or a starfield with planets). In this case, the matte is the background painting. In film and stage, mattes can be physically huge sections of painted canvas, portraying large scenic expanses of landscapes. In film, the principle of a matte requires masking certain areas of the film emulsion to selectively control which areas are exposed. However, many complex special-effects scenes have included dozens of discrete image elements, requiring very complex use of mattes, and layering mattes on top of one another. For an example of a simple matte, we may wish to depict a group of actors in front of a store, with a massive city and sky visible above the store's roof. We would have two images‚Äîthe actors on the set, and the image of the city‚Äîto combine onto a third. This would require two masks/mattes. One would mask everything above the store's roof, and the other would mask everything below it. By using these masks/mattes when copying these images onto the third, we can combine the images without creating ghostly double-exposures. In film, this is an example of a static matte, where the shape of the mask does not change from frame to frame. Other shots may require mattes that change, to mask the shapes of moving objects, such as human beings or spaceships. These are known as traveling mattes. Traveling mattes enable greater freedom of composition and movement, but they are also more difficult to accomplish. Compositing techniques known as chroma keying that remove all areas of a certain color from a recording - colloquially known as \\"bluescreen\\" or \\"greenscreen\\" after the most popular colors used - are probably the best- known and most widely used modern techniques for creating traveling mattes, although rotoscoping and multiple motion control passes have also been used in the past. Computer-generated imagery, either static or animated, is also often rendered with a transparent background and digitally overlaid on top of modern film recordings using the same principle as a matte - a digital image mask.  History  Mattes are a very old technique, going back to the Lumi√®re brothers. Originally, the matte shot was created by filmmakers obscuring the background section on the film with cut-out cards. When the live action (foreground) portion of a scene was filmed, the background section of the film wasn't exposed. Then a different cut-out would be placed over the live action section. The film would be rewound, and the filmmakers would film their new background. This technique was known as the in-camera matte and was considered more a novelty than a serious special effect during the late 1880s. A good early American example is seen in The Great Train Robbery (1903) where it is used to place a train outside a window in a ticket office, and later a moving background outside a baggage car on a train 'set'. Around this time, another technique known as the glass shot was also being used. The glass shot was made by painting details on a piece of glass which was then combined with live action footage to create the appearance of elaborate sets. The first glass shots are credited to Edgar Rogers. The first major development of the matte shot was the early 1900s by Norman Dawn ASC. Dawn had seamlessly woven glass shots into many of his films: such as the crumbling California Missions in the movie Missions of California, and used the glass shot to revolutionize the in- camera matte. Now, instead of taking their live action footage to a real location, filmmakers would shoot the live action as before with the cut-out cards in place, then rewind the film and transfer it to a camera designed to minimize vibrations. Then the filmmakers would shoot a glass shot instead of a live action background. The resulting composite was of fairly high quality, since the matte line ‚Äì the place of transition from the live action to the painted background ‚Äì was much less jumpy. In addition, the new in-camera matte was much more cost-effective, as the glass didn't have to be ready the day the live action was shot. One downside to this method was that since the film was exposed twice, there was always the risk of accidentally overexposing the film and ruining the footage filmed earlier. The in-camera matte shot remained in use until the film stock began to go up in quality in the 1920s. During this time a new technique known as the bi-pack camera method was developed. This was similar to the in-camera matte shot, but relied on one master positive as a backup. This way if anything was lost, the master would still be intact. Around 1925 another method of making a matte was developed. One of the drawbacks of the old mattes was that the matte line was stationary. There could be no direct contact between the live action and the matte background. The traveling matte changed that. The traveling matte was like an in-camera or bi-pack matte, except that the matte line changed every frame. Filmmakers could use a technique similar to the bi-pack method to make the live action portion a matte itself, allowing them to move the actors around the background and scene ‚Äì integrating them completely. The Thief of Bagdad (1940) represented a major leap forward for the traveling matte and the first major introduction of the bluescreen technique invented by Larry Butler when it won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects that year, though the process was still very time-intensive, and each frame had to be hand-processed. Computers began to aid the process late in the 20th century. In the 1960s, Petro Vlahos refined the use of motion control cameras in bluescreen and received an Academy Award for the process. The 1980s saw the invention of the first digital mattes and bluescreening processes, as well as the invention of the first computerized non-linear editing systems for video. Alpha compositing, in which digital images could be made partially transparent in the same way an animation cel is in its natural state, had been invented in the late 1970s and was integrated with the bluescreen process in the 1980s. Digital planning began for The Empire Strikes Back in 1980, for which Richard Edlund received the Academy Award for his work to create an aerial-image optical printer for combining mattes, though this process was still analog. The first fully digital matte shot was created by painter Chris Evans in 1985 for Young Sherlock Holmes for a scene featuring a computer-graphics (CG) animation of a knight leaping from a stained-glass window. Evans first painted the window in acrylics, then scanned the painting into LucasFilm's Pixar system for further digital manipulation. The computer animation blended perfectly with the digital matte, something a traditional matte painting could not have accomplished. In the modern era, nearly all modern mattes are now done via digital video editing and the compositing technique known as chroma key - an electronic generalization of the bluescreen - is now possible even on home computers. Technique =In-camera matte shot= The in-camera matte shot, also known as the Dawn Process(3)http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/digital-matte-painter1.htm is created by first mounting a piece of glass in front of the camera. Black paint is applied to the glass where the background will be replaced. The actors are then filmed with minimal sets. The director shoots several minutes of extra footage to be used as test strips. The matte painter then develops a test strip (with the blacked out areas in the shot) and projects a frame of the 'Matted' shot onto the easel mounted glass. This test footage clip is used as the reference to paint the background or scenery to be matted in on a new piece of glass. The live action part of the glass is painted black, more of the test footage is then exposed to adjust and confirm color matching and edge line up. Then the critical parts of the matted live action scene (with the desired actions and actors in place) are threaded up for burning the painted elements into the black areas. The flat black paint put on the glass blocks light from the part of the film it covers, preventing double exposure over the latent live action scenes from occurring. =Bi-pack process= To begin a bipack matte filming, the live action portion is shot. The film is loaded and projected onto a piece of glass that has been painted first black, then white. The matte artist decides where the matte line will be and traces it on the glass, then paints in the background or scenery to be added. Once the painting is finished the matte artist scrapes away the paint on the live action portions of the glass. The original footage and a clean reel are loaded into the bi-pack with the original threaded so it passes the shutter in front of the clean film. The glass is lit from behind, so that when the reels are both run, only the live action is transferred to the clean film. The reel of original footage is then removed and a piece of black cloth is placed behind the glass. The glass is lit from the front and the new reel is rewound and run again. The black cloth prevents the already exposed footage from being exposed a second time; the background scenery has been added to the live action. =Rotoscoping= The rotoscope was a device used to project film (namely live-action footage) onto a canvas to act as a reference for artists. This was used perhaps most famously in older Disney animated movies, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs which had notably realistic animations.\\"Reviving an ancient art\\" The Times (London), August 5, 2006, FEATURES; The Knowledge; Pg. 10. Weblink, see bottom of page The technique had a few other uses, such as in 2001: A Space Odyssey where artists manually traced and painted alpha mattes for each frame. Rotoscoping was also used to achieve the fluid animations in Prince of Persia, which were impressive for the time. Unfortunately, the technique is very time-consuming, and trying to capture semi-transparency with the technique was difficult. A digital variant of rotoscoping exists today, with software helping users avoid some of the tedium; for instance, interpolating mattes between a few frames.McGuire, M. 2005.Computational Videography with a Single Axis, Multi-Parameter Lens Camera. Digitally extracting mattes from a single image  Often, it is desirable to extract two or more mattes from a single image. This process, dubbed \\"matting\\" or \\"pulling a matte,\\" is most commonly used to separate the foreground and background elements of an image, and these images are often individual frames of a video file. Compositing techniques are a relatively simple way of pulling a matte - the foreground from a greensceen scene could be imposed on an arbitrary background scene, for instance. Attempting to matte an image that doesn't use this technique is significantly more difficult. Several algorithms have been designed in an effort to address this challenge. Ideally, this matting algorithm would separate an input video stream Irgb into three output streams: a full-color, foreground-only stream Œ±Frgb with a pre-multiplied alpha (alpha compositing), a full-color background stream Brgb, and a single-channel stream of partial coverage of the pixels in the foreground stream. This ideal algorithm can take any arbitrary video as input, including video where the foreground and background are dynamic, there are multiple depths in the background, there exist overlaps between background and foreground share the same color and no texture, and other various features that such algorithms traditionally have some difficulty in dealing with. Unfortunately, achieving this algorithm is impossible due to the loss of information that occurs when translating a real-world scene into a two-dimensional video. Smith and Blinn formally proved this in 1996. Matting also has some other fundamental limitations. The process cannot reconstruct parts of the background that are occluded by the foreground, and any sort of approximation will be limited. Additionally, the foreground and background of an image still have an effect on each other due to shadows being cast and light being reflected between them. When compositing an image or video from mattes of different origin, missing or extra shadows and other details of light can ruin the impact of the new image. The process of matting itself is a difficult problem to solve. It has been under research since the 1950s, and yet its most popular use - filmmaking - resorts to the classic but constrained compositing method. Specifically, they use a kind of global color model. This technique is based on a global color assumption; for instance, that the entire background is green. (Incidentally, this is why weather forecasters sometimes appear to have invisible ties - the color of the tie is similar to that of the background, leading the algorithm to classify the tie as part of the background stream.) Any color in theory could be used, but the most common are green and blue. Luminance matting (also called black-screen matting) is another variation of the global color model. As opposed to color, it assumes that the background is darker than a user-defined value. Another approach is using a local color model. This model assumes the background to be a static, previously-known image, so in this case the background stream is given. A simple matte can be pulled by comparing the actual video stream with the known background stream. Lighting and camera angle requirements are very strict unlike in global color models, but there is no restriction for possible colors in the foreground stream. There also exist machine learning tools that can pull mattes with the assistance of a user. Often, these tools require iteration on the part of the user - an algorithm provides a result based on a training set, and the user adjusts the set until the algorithm provides the desired result. An example of this is using a manually-created coarse matte with a trimap segmentation, so called because it separates the image into three regions: known background, known foreground, and an unknown region. In this case, the algorithm attempts to label the unknown region based on the user's input, and the user can iterate through multiple trimaps for better results. Knockout, a plug-in tool for Adobe Photoshop, is an implementation of this process. Another digital matting approach was proposed by McGuire et al. It makes use of two imaging sensors along the same optical axis, and uses data from both of them. (There are various ways to achieve this, such as using a beam-splitter or per-pixel polarization filters.) The system simultaneously captures two frames that differ by about half the dynamic range at background pixels but are identical at foreground pixels. Using the differences between the backgrounds of the two images, McGuire et al. are able to extract a high-resolution foreground matte from the scene. This method still retains some of the shortcomings of compositing techniques - namely, the background must be relatively neutral and uniform - but it introduces several benefits, such as precise sub-pixel results, better support for natural illumination, and allowing the foreground to be the color that a compositing technique would identify as part of the background matte. However, this means that intentionally masking something in the foreground by coating it in the same color as the background is impossible. A third approach to digital matting is using three video streams with different focusing distances and depths of field. As with the previous method, all three image sensors share a common optical axis, though now the algorithm uses information about what part of the image is in focus in which video feed to generate its foreground matte. With this technique, both the foreground and background can have dynamic content, and there are no restrictions on what colors or complexity the background has. All of these approaches share one notable weakness: they cannot take arbitrary videos as inputs. In video, distinct from film, Chroma key requires the background of the original video to be a single color. The other two techniques require more information in the form of synchronized but slightly different videos.  Mattes and widescreen filming  Another use of mattes in filmmaking is to create a widescreen effect. In this process, the top and bottom of a standard frame are matted out, or masked, with black bars, i.e. the film print has a thick frame line. Then the frame within the full frame is enlarged to fill a screen when projected in a theater. Thus, in \\"masked widescreen\\" an image with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 is created by using a standard, 1.37:1 frame and matting out the top and bottom. If the image is matted during the filming process it is called a hard matte due to its sharp edge. In contrast, if the full frame is filled during filming and the projectionist is relied upon to matte out the top and bottom in the theater, it is referred to as a soft matte, as the aperture plate is not on the focal plane and causes a soft edge. In video, a similar effect is often used to present widescreen films on a conventional, 1.33:1 television screen. In this case, the process is called letterboxing. However, in letterboxing, the top and bottom of the actual image are not matted out. The picture is \\"pushed\\" farther back on screen and thus made \\"smaller\\", so to speak, so that, in a widescreen film, the viewer can see, on the left and right of the picture, what would normally be omitted if the film were shown fullscreen on television, achieving a sort of \\"widescreen\\" effect on a square TV screen. In letterboxing, the top of the image is slightly lower than usual, the bottom is higher, and the unused portion of the screen is covered by black bars. For video transfers, transferring a \\"soft matte\\" film to a home video format with the full frame exposed, thus removing the mattes at the top and bottom, is referred to as an \\"open matte transfer.\\" In contrast, transferring a \\"hard matte\\" film to a home video format with the theatrical mattes intact is referred to as a \\"closed matte transfer.\\" Garbage and holdout mattes A \\"garbage matte\\" is often hand-drawn, sometimes quickly made, used to exclude parts of an image that another process, such as bluescreen, would not remove. The name stems from the fact that the matte removes \\"garbage\\" from the procedurally produced image. \\"Garbage\\" might include a rig holding a model, or the lighting grid above the top edge of the bluescreen. Mattes that do the opposite, forcing inclusion of parts of the image that might otherwise have been removed by the keyer, such as too much blue reflecting on a shiny model (\\"blue spill\\"), are often called \\"holdout mattes\\", and can be created with the same tool.

It is located about 25 km from the provincial capital of S√ºkhbaatar, on the border with Russia opposite the town of Kyakhta. Altanbulag is the location of the Altanbulag Free Trade Zone (, Altanbulag khudaldaany Ch√∂l√∂√∂t b√ºs). History Altanbulag began as a trading outpost across the Kyakhta River from the Russian town of Kyakhta during Qing rule of Mongolia in 1730. The name of that city was called Maimaicheng (Mongolian: –•—É–¥–∞–ª–¥–∞–∞—á–∏–Ω, English: City of Buying and Selling) at the first and later renamed to Kyakhta (Mongolian: Khiagt). Also people used other names such as \\"Mongolian Khyahta\\" and \\"Southern Kyakhata\\". The twin towns of Kyakhta and Maimaicheng can be seen on this 1851 map, on the shortest route from Irkutsk to Peking Following the Treaty of Kyakhta in 1727 each side built a trading post on its side of the border. Construction began in 1730. It was perhaps 500 to 700 feet south of Kyakhta, upstream on the small Kyakhta River. The town was square, with wooden walls and, after 1756, a three-foot wide ditch. Each wall had a gate which led to two major streets which intersected in the center. Each gate had a 25-foot watchtower manned by members of the Mongol garrison. The main avenues were about 25 feet wide, but the other streets and alleys were narrow. The larger houses had interior courtyards where trading was done. These courtyards were generally better kept than the public areas. The southwestern quarter of town was occupied by \\"Bukharans\\" as the Russians called traders from Central Asia. Women were forbidden to live in the town, apparently to keep Chinese merchants from becoming permanent residents. The rule was evaded but still in force in 1908. The post was administered by the 'Dzgarguchei' who was replaced by the Lifanyuan every two years. For some purposes the Dzarguchei dealt with the Tushetu Khan in Urga who was partly supervised by a Manchu resident. On 13 March 1921, a Soviet-backed People's Provisional Government of Mongolia was established at Altanbulag. This government went on to oust the government of Roman Ungern von Sternberg and later formed the Mongolian People's Republic in 1924. Names Today, the town is known as Altanbulag in both the Mongolian and Buryat languages. During the Qing dynasty, the town was known as Maimachen (, , , , , , , , etc.; in Russian), City of Buying and Selling in English) which derived from the Chinese name . In Mongolian, it was known as √ñv√∂r Khiagt (”®–≤”©—Ä –•–∏–∞–≥—Ç, South Kyakhta). See also *Kyakhta trade  References *Clifford M.

There are almost 5,000 RTOs in Australia, providing training across a wide range of subject areas including traditional trades, advanced technical training, para-professional and professional studies, as well as pre- employment and basic skills programs. RTOs may be government (state or territory) or privately owned organisations. All RTOs in Australia and the qualifications they are registered to deliver are listed on the training.gov.au website, a national register that replaced the National Training Information Service (NTIS) in 2011. To become registered as an RTO, an organisation must apply to the regulatory body in the jurisdiction it falls. Depending on the organisation's main location and the student cohorts to whom it intends to provide training and assessment services, its regulatory body will be: * the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) * the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority (VRQA), or * the Training and Accreditation Council (TAC).

It is chartered with assisting economic and social growth in developing countries, and the promotion of international cooperation. The OECD‚Äôs Development Assistance Committee published a peer review of Japan‚Äôs development co-operation in October 2020. http://www.oecd.org/dac/oecd-development-co-operation-peer- reviews-japan-2020-b2229106-en.htm In October, 2003, Sadako Ogata, former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, became the President. It has been led by Professor Shinichi Kitaoka, the former President of the International University of Japan. History JICA's predecessor, the previous Japan International Cooperation Agency (also known as \\"JICA\\"), was a semigovernmental organization under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, formed in 1974. The new JICA was formed on October 1, 2003. A major component of the comprehensive overhaul of Japan's ODA decided by the National Diet on November, 2006, is that the merger in 2008 will be between JICA and that part of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) which currently extends concessional loans to developing countries. Since its completion on 1 October 2008, the new JICA has become one of the largest bilateral development organizations in the world with a network of 97 overseas offices, projects in more than 150 countries, and available financial resources of approximately 1 trillion yen ($8.5 billion). The reorganized agency is also responsible for administering part of Japan's grant aid which is currently under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and so all three major ODA components‚Äîtechnical cooperation, grant aid, and concessional loans‚Äîare now managed \\"under one roof.\\" The new JICA will also strengthen research and training capacity in the years ahead, acting as a kind of ODA think tank, contributing to global development strategies, strengthening collaboration with international institutions, and being better able to communicate Japan's position on major development and aid issues. The forthcoming changes will be an extension of a series of JICA reforms which began in October 2003 when it became administratively independent. The organization's domestic establishments including international centers where JICA helps train some 8,000 foreign public officials, researchers, engineers, instructors and community leaders annually in Japan are being streamlined. The organization is also undergoing operational and organizational change in its country offices. Greater emphasis is being placed on a field-based approach to programs/projects, decentralizing staff, and delegating increased authority from Tokyo headquarters to overseas offices, reducing bureaucracy, and fast tracking programs/projects. An increasing number of JICA programs/projects focus on what JICA's President, Mrs. Sadako Ogata describes as providing \\"human security\\". The recently developed concept of \\"human security\\" will empower local communities to have a greater say in their own futures by strengthening grassroots programs, such as improving education and health projects. =Timeline= * 1954 Apr - Japan joins Colombo Plan and initiates technical cooperation programs * 1962 Jun - Overseas Technology Cooperation Agency (OTCA) established * 1963 Jul - Japan Emigration Service (JEMIS) established * 1965 Apr - Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers (JOCV) program launched * 1974 Aug - OTCA and JEMIS merge to form the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) * 1987 Sep - Disaster Relief Team formed * 1989 - Total official development assistance (ODA) contributions exceed that of the United States to become the highest in the world * 1990 Apr - Senior Cooperation Specialist (Senior Overseas Volunteer) dispatch program begun * 2003 Oct - JICA established as an Independent Administrative Institution Activities JICA is part of Japan's official development assistance effort, with a role in providing technical cooperation, capital grants and yen loans.

It lies in Villupuram District, from the state capital, Chennai, and is close to the Union Territory of Puducherry. The fort is so fortified, that Chhatrapati Shivaji, the Maratha king, ranked it as the \\"most impregnable fortress in India\\" and it was called the \\"Troy of the East\\" by the British. The nearest town with a railway station is Tindivanam and the nearest airport is Chennai (Madras), located away. Originally built by Ananta kon of the konar Dynasty around 1190 AD and later fortified by Krishna Konar, it was later modified in the 13th century to elevate it to the status of an unbreachable citadel to protect the small town of saenji. It was also the headquarters http://www.thehindu.com/arts/crafts/Ancient- Futures/article16894623.ecehttp://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/where-eagles- dare/article4619668.ece domination in northern Tamil Nadu. The fort was built as a strategic place of fending off any invading armies. As per one account, the fort was further fortified during the 15‚Äì16th century, the lieutenants of the and who later became independent kings. The fort passed to the Marathas under the leadership of Shivaji in 1677 AD, Bijapur sultans, the Moghuls, Carnatic Nawabs, French and the British in 1761. The fort is closely associated with Raja Tej Singh, who unsuccessfully revolted against the Nawab of Arcot and eventually lost his life in a battle. Gingee Fort Hill view from road The Gingee Fort complex is on three hillocks: Krishnagiri named after Krishna Kon to the north, Rajagiri or Anandagiri named after Ananda kon to the west and Chandrayandurg to the southeast. The three hills together constitute a fort complex, each having a separate and self-contained citadel. The fort walls are and the three hills are connected by walls enclosing an area of . It was built at a height of and protected by an wide moat. The complex has a seven-storeyed Kalyana Mahal (marriage hall), granaries, prison cells, and a temple dedicated to its presiding Hindu goddess called Chenjiamman. The fortifications contain a sacred pond known as Aanaikulam. On the top of the hillock, there are minor fortifications. The fort, in modern times, is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India. The fort is one of the prominent tourist destinations in Villupuram district. Legend and etymology Throne on the Krishnagiri The Bijapur Nawabs who held the fort from about 1660 to 1677 AD called it Badshabad, while the Marathas who succeeded them called it Chandry or Chindy. The Mughals, on their capture of the fort in 1698 A.D., named it Nusratgadh in honour of Nawab Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung, the commander-in-chief of the besieging army. Later, the English and the French called it Gingee or Jinji. The early Madras records of the English give the spelling Chingee or Chengey.Hiltebeitel 1991, p. 19 As per Tamil legend, the tragic tale of Raja Tej Singh, popularly known in Tamil as Thesingu Raasan, is associated with the fort. The true life story of Tej Singh and his general, Mehboob Khan (aka Maavuthukaran), who were friends, has inspired many poems, street plays, and countless other stories. He was the son of Swarup Singh and revolted against the Nawab of Arcot, and was defeated and killed in the war that followed. Though Gingee became a part of the Nawab's territory in 1714, the young and courageous Tej Singh became a legend and his life, love and brave but tragic end were eulogised in various ballads. History Gingee Fort History Board The main source for the first two hundred years of the history of the place is the \\"Complete History of the Carnatic Kings\\" among the Mackenzie manuscripts. According to historian Narayan, a small village called Melacerri, located away from Gingee is called \\"Old Gingee\\" has traces of fortifications from about 1200 AD.Hiltebeitel 1991, p. 4 The earliest mention of the hill fort of Gingee is found in an Inscription of Vikrama Chola (1120‚Äì63) dated in his 10th YearARE 159 of 1930 and a Kadava feudatory calls himself the Lord of Senjiyar of the strong embattled fort. Gingee came into the hands of various ruling dynasties of South India, starting from the Cholas.Hiltebeitel 1991, p. 17 Throne in Gingee Fort Hill Originally the site of a small fort built by the Chola dynasty during the 9th century AD, Gingee Fort was modified by Kurumbar while fighting the Cholas and again by the Vijayanagar empire during the 13th century. As per one account, the fort was built during the 15‚Äì16th century by the Gingee Nayaks, the lietunants of the Vijayanagara Empire and who later became independent kings. The fort was built at a strategic place to fend off any invading armies. It was further strengthened by the Marathas under the leadership of Shivaji in 1677 AD. He recaptured it from the Bijapur sultans who had originally taken control of the fort from the Marathas. In 1691, it was besieged by Moghul generals Zul Fikar Khan, Asad Khan & Kam Baksha but was successfully defended by Santaji Ghorpade.https://archive.org/stream/rukaatialamgirio00aurarich#page/113/mode/2up During Aurangzeb's campaign in the Deccan, Shivaji's second son who had assumed the throne, Chhatrapati Rajaram, escaped to Ginjee and continued the fight with Moghuls from Ginjee. The fort was the seat of the Maratha Empire for a few months. The Moghuls could not capture the fort for seven years in spite of laying siege. The fort was finally captured in 1698, but not before Chhatrapati Rajaram escaped. It was later passed on to the Carnatic Nawabs who lost it to the French in 1750 before the British finally took control in 1761 despite losing it to Hyder Ali for a brief period. Raja Desingh ruled Gingee during the 18th century. Architecture Kalyana Mahal at Gingee fort The Gingee Fort complex is on three hillocks: Krishnagiri to the north, Rajagiri to the west and Chandrayandurg to the southeast. The three hills together constitute a fort complex, yet each hill contains a separate and self- contained citadel. Connecting them ‚Äî forming an enormous triangle, a mile from north to south, punctuated by bastions and gateways giving access to the protected zones at the heart of the complex. The fort walls are and the three hills are connected by walls enclosing an area of . It was built at a height of and protected by a wide moat. It has a seven-storeyed Kalyana Mahal (marriage hall), granaries, prison cells, and a temple dedicated to its presiding Hindu goddess called Chenjiamman. The fortifications contain a sacred pond known as Aanaikulam. The walls of the fort are a mixture of the natural hilly terrain comprising the Krishnagiri, Chakkilidrug and Rajagiri hills, while the gaps were sealed with the main wall that measures in thickness.Manchanda, p. 149 On the top of the hillock, there are minor fortifications. Water resources are usually sparse in South Indian forts, while it was well managed in the Citadel. There are two sweet water sources on the summit and below it there are three reservoirs for storage of rain water. Water for Kalyana Mahal was brought through earthenware pipes from reservoir located from it. =Rajagiri= Gingee fort as seen from the entrance The first hill, where the main fort is, is called Rajagiri. Originally it was known as Kamalagiri as well as Anandagiri. The fort was historically considered most impregnable. It is about in height. Its summit is cut off from communication and is surrounded by a deep, natural chasm that is about wide and deep. To gain entry into the citadel one had to cross the chasm with the help of a small wooden draw bridge. The naturally strong rock where the fortress is located, is further strengthened by the construction of embrasure walls and gateways along all possible shelves and precipitous edges. The citadel is reached by traversing through seven gates. This citadel contains important buildings apart from the living quarters of the royalty, like the stables, granaries, and meeting halls for the public, temples, mosques, shrines and pavilions. Kamalakanni Amman temple is present atop the Rajagiri hills. As per Hindu legend, the presiding deity, Kamalakanni, is believed to be the widow of demon king Acalamaccuran. Draupadi, a Hindu goddess, beheaded the hundred heads of the demon and Kamalakanni is believed to have protests that she would become a widow. Draupadi explains her similarities that she has no sexual relations, though married. This resulted in the ambiguous kanni suffix.Hiltebeitel 1991, p. 214 Ranganathar Temple, bell tower, watch tower, cannon and draw bridge are located atop the hill. The lower fort consists of Arcot Gate, Pondicherry Gate, which was probably improved by the French during their occupation (1751‚Äì1761), the Prison on top of Pondicherry Gate, Royal Battery, Venkataramanaswami Temple, Pattabhi Ramaswami Temple, Sadatulla Khan's mosque, Chettikulam and Chakrakulam tanks, platform where Raja Desingh was killed in a war, large stone image of Hanuman, prisoner's well where the prisoners condemned to death were thrown and left to die of starvation. The inner fort consists of Kalyana Mahal, the royal stables, the ruined royal palace, Anaikulam tank, granaries, magazine and the shrine of Venugopalaswami. There is a site museum at the entrance of the fort set up by the Archaeological Survey of India containing sculptures pertaining to periods and many dynasties that ruled Gingee. There are also guns and cannonballs made of stone, strewn about the fort. =Krishnagiri= Queen fort as seen from Rajagiri The second important hillock with an imposing citadel is known as Krishnagiri. It is also known as the English Mountain, perhaps because the British residents occupied the fort here, for some time. The Krishnagiri fort lies to the North of Tiruvannamalai road. It is smaller in size and height compared to the Rajagiri fort. A flight of steps of granite stones leads to its top. Another fort connected with Rajagiri with a low rocky ridge is called Chandrayan Durg, Chandragiri or St. George's Mountain. The military and strategic value of this fort has been relatively less, but it has some interesting buildings of later period. =Chakkiliya Durg= The third fort for some reason is called Chakkiliya Durg or Chamar Tikri ‚Äî meaning the fort of the Chamars. It is not known why it had acquired the name. Probably the royal Chamar warriors used to stay here, as Gingee obviously was a military encampment. There is a smaller and less important fourth hill, the summit of which is also well fortified. There is nothing much left of Chandrayan Durg and Chakkilli Durg. Their flanks are now completely covered with thorny shrubs and stone pieces. Culture After the fort passed into British hands, it did not see any further action. The fort at Gingee was declared a National Monument in 1921 and was under the Archaeological Department. The Tourism Department of India has tried to popularize this remote and oft-forgotten fort. Gingee today, with its ruined forts, temples and granaries, presents a different picture from the glorious splendor of its bygone days.

He is the former bassist of seminal Swedish metal band Opeth. De Farfalla originally joined Opeth in 1991 when its lineup was David Isberg on vocals, Mikael √Ökerfeldt and Kim Pettersson on guitar, and Anders Nordin on drums. He replaced Nick D√∂ring on bass for one show and quit immediately afterwards. Opeth recruited Peter Lindgren to replace him for their next show, and then Stefan Guteklint after Lindgren moved to guitar. In 1994, Opeth was approached for signing by Candlelight Records, and fired Guteklint. De Farfalla rejoined Opeth initially as a session bassist for their first album Orchid (1995), but subsequently became an official member again. After touring in support of their second album Morningrise (1996), De Farfalla was fired by √Ökerfeldt who cited that De Farfalla was not a good fit. De Farfalla wanted the bass to have a more prominent role in the music of Opeth, something √Ökerfeldt felt uncomfortable with. Departure from the general mix, aesthetic, and overall sound of Opeth's first two albums is often attributed partly to the recruitment of bassist Martin Mendez and drummer Martin Lopez, although Mendez did not contribute or record any basslines for Opeth's next release (1998's My Arms, Your Hearse). (Anders Nordin quit Opeth to move to Brazil days after De Farfalla was fired.) If Opeth's sound is describable as having jazz influence, it is most prevalent on their first two albums (those De Farfalla and Nordin contributed to), their fourth (Still Life) being an exception. Johan De Farfalla used to work as a teacher at Storviks Folkh√∂gskola until 27 January 2012, continued as principal at Tollare Folkh√∂gskola until June 2015. He lives with his 3 children in Stockholm.  Trivia  According to the Metal Archives, De Farfalla now works for the Christian Democratic Party of Sweden.

It is a one-half square mile area of land northeast of the central business district bordered to the north by the Allegheny River and to the south by portions of the Hill District. The Strip District runs between 11th and 33rd Streets and includes four main thoroughfares‚ÄîRailroad Street/Waterfront Place, Smallman Street, Penn Avenue, and Liberty Avenue‚Äîas well as various side streets. Once home to many mills and factories, today the Strip District is home to dozens of tech and robotics companies including a rapidly growing residential population. History In the early 19th century, the Strip District was home to many mills and factories as its location along the Allegheny River made for easy transportation of goods and shipping of raw materials. It was the home of the Fort Pitt Foundry, source of large cannons before and during the American Civil War, including a bore Rodman Gun. Early industrial tenants of the Strip District included U.S. Steel, Westinghouse, The Pittsburgh Reduction Company (ALCOA), and later The H.J. Heinz Company, famous ketchup and condiment manufacturer. The shipping infrastructure built around the manufacturing companies attracted other types of merchants to set up shop in the Strip. By the early 20th century, the Strip District became a vibrant network of wholesalers‚Äîmostly fresh produce, meat, and poultry dealers. Soon, auction houses rose around the wholesale warehouses. Many restaurants and grocery stores opened to feed hungry shift workers at any hour of the day. By the 1920s, the Strip District was the economic center of Pittsburgh. By the mid-to-late 20th century, fewer of the Strip's products were being shipped by rail and boat, causing many produce sellers and wholesalers to leave the area for other space with easier access to highways, or where there was more land available for expansion. In the early 21st century, there are still several wholesalers and produce dealers in the Strip District, but some estimates say more than 80% of the produce industry left the area, preceded by the manufacturing plants and mills in the mid to late 20th century restructuring of industry. Today, many of the abandoned warehouses have been renovated as small specialty shops, restaurants, nightclubs, and bars. The historic St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, an 1891 landmark built in the ornate Polish Cathedral style, lies in the heart of the Strip District and served early generations of Polish immigrants. Today Since the late 20th century, the area has developed into a historic market district with many ethnic food purveyors, some art studios, antique dealers, unique boutiques, and other businesses setting up shop where trains once delivered produce by the ton. The lack of weekday activity is in someways compensated by retail and leisure facilities which are used primarily on weekends. Particularly in the summer months, there are open-air farmers' markets, a range of street vendors and facilities to enjoy open air drinks. Residential developers have begun to convert old factory and warehouse buildings into apartments and lofts. Examples include the Armstrong Cork Factory, Brake House Lofts, and the Otto Milk Building. More recently, the area has attracted a number of technology companies and become a hotbed for autonomous vehicle and robotics technology. The area is home to Uber's Advanced Technology Group, which leads the company's vehicular automation efforts, as well Argo AI and Aurora Innovation.Aurora Innovation Other technology companies with offices in the Strip District include Apple, Facebook, Robert Bosch GmbH, Target Corporation, Wombat Security, JazzHR, Petuum, and BossaNova Robotics. Surrounding and adjacent Pittsburgh neighborhoods The Strip District has five land borders, including Downtown to the southwest, Crawford-Roberts, Bedford Dwellings and Polish Hill to the south, and Lower Lawrenceville to the northeast. Across the Allegheny River, the Strip runs adjacent with the North Shore and Troy Hill with direct links to both neighborhoods via 16th Street and 31st Street Bridges, respectively.

It is located about 3 miles south west of Swansea city centre. It falls within the Mayals ward and the Mumbles community council area (MCC). The ward of Mayals lies within the constituency of Swansea West, the only MCC ward not in the Gower constituency. The suburb of Mayals consists mainly of higher value privately owned housing. Located on Clyne Common near the suburb in the area is the Craig-y-Nos School, an independent school for children, whilst the well performing Mayals Primary School lies within the area. Actress Catherine Zeta-Jones once lived in the Mayals, on St Andrews Close and singer Bonnie Tyler maintains a home in Blackpill. Much of the Mayals area is accounted for by Clyne common, upon which is the prestigious 18-hole Clyne golf club. The renowned botanical gardens at Clyne also account for a significant amount of Mayals. The gardens include many rare, tropical and notable plans, including Britain's largest Magnolia, and many hybrids. Notable constructions include a Japanese bridge, the Admirals Tower, Gazebo, and the neo-Gothic Victorian Church. There is also a small lake, an unused quarry, family Pet Cemetery, and many hidden and secluded areas with Victorian paving and red-brick steps. However, the most notable building of all is Clyne Castle, built in 1791 by Richard Phillips a wealthy landowner. The castle and grounds were bought by the wealthy Swansea Vivian family in 1860, who made many changes to the castle and grounds. During that time the Castle hosted many notable guests, including Adelina Patti, Neville Chamberlain, Queen Victoria, Winston Churchill, and King Edward VIII and later on Jon and Carys Richards. In 1952 the Castle came under the ownership of Swansea University, becoming student accommodation. In 2003 the Castle was sold to become high value luxury apartments. There is also a smaller Mayals Park, next to Mayals Primary School which unlike Clyne, has play-facilities for children as well as a small basketball court, footpaths and streams, and an unmaintained wooded area. In the local council elections in 2008 Mayals (electoral ward) was won by Conservative Candidate Rene Kinzett, who stood for Swansea West in the 2010 national election. In the 2012 local council elections Linda Tyler-Lloyd retained the seat for the Conservative Party after Rene Kinzett decided to stand down.

They provide a range of diagnostic, technical, therapeutic, and support services in connection with health care.  Definition  In 2012, the International Chief Health Professions Officers defined the allied health professions:  Professions  Depending on the country and local health care system, a limited subset of the following professions (professional areas) may be represented, and may be regulated: The precise titles, roles and requisites of allied health professionals may vary considerably from country to country. A generic definition for USA is in the Public Health Service Act. Training and education Some allied health professions are more specialized, and so must adhere to national training and education standards and their professional scope of practice. Often they must prove their skills through degrees, diplomas, certified credentials, and continuing education. Other allied health professions require no special training or credentials and are trained for their work by their employer through on-the-job training (which would then exclude them from consideration as an allied health profession in a country like Australia). Many allied health jobs are considered career ladder jobs because of the opportunities for advancement within specific fields. Allied health professions can include the use of many skills. Depending on the profession, these may include basic life support; medical terminology, acronyms and spelling; basics of medical law and ethics; understanding of human relations; interpersonal communication skills; counseling skills; computer literacy; ability to document healthcare information; interviewing skills; and proficiency in word processing; database management and electronic dictation. History The explosion of scientific knowledge that followed World War II brought increasingly sophisticated and complex medical diagnostic and treatment procedures. Increasing public demand for medical services combined with higher health care costs provoked a trend toward expansion of service delivery from treating patients in hospitals to widespread provision of care in physician's private and group practices, ambulatory medical and emergency clinics, and mobile clinics and community- based care. In the developing world, international development assistance led to numerous initiatives for strengthening health workforce capacity to deliver essential health care services. What followed has been an increase in the need for skilled health care delivery personnel worldwide. Changes in the health industry and emphasis on cost-efficient solutions to health care delivery will continue to encourage expansion of the allied health workforce. The World Health Organization estimates there is currently a worldwide shortage of about 2 million allied health professionals (considering all health workers aside from medical and nursing personnel) needed in order to meet global health goals.World Health Organization (2006), The World Health Report 2006. Geneva: World Health Organization. In recognition of the growth of the number and diversity of allied health professionals in recent years, the 2008 version of the International Standard Classification of Occupations increased the number of groups dedicated to allied health professions. Depending on the presumed skill level, they may either be identified as \\"health professionals\\" or \\"health associate professionals\\". For example, new categories have been created for delineating \\"paramedical practitioners\\"‚Äîgrouping professions such as clinical officers, clinical associates, physician assistants, Feldshers, and assistant medical officers‚Äîas well as for community health workers; dietitians and nutritionists; audiologists and speech therapists; and others.Dal Poz MR et al. (2009), Boundaries of the health workforce: definition and classifications of health workers. In: Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health. Geneva: World Health Organization. Employment projections Projections in the United States and many other countries have shown an expected long-term shortage of qualified workers to fill many allied health positions. This is primarily due to expansion of the health industry due to demographic changes (a growing and aging population), large numbers of health workers nearing retirement, the industry's need to be cost efficient, and a lack of sufficient investment in training programs to keep pace with these trends. Studies have also pointed to the need for increased diversity in the allied health workforce to realize a culturally competent health system in the United States and elsewhere. Workforce and health care experts anticipate that health services will increasingly be delivered via ambulatory and nursing care settings rather than in hospitals. According to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the health care industry consists of four main sub-sectors, divided by the types of services provided at each facility: * Hospitals: primarily provides inpatient health services and may provide some outpatient services as a secondary activity. * Ambulatory health care settings: primarily provides outpatient services at facilities such as doctors' offices, outpatient clinics and clinical laboratories. * Nursing and residential care facilities: provides residential care, such as community care for the elderly or mental health and substance abuse facilities. * Social Assistance: provides services for the elderly and/or disabled, services for the homeless and poor, vocational rehabilitation, or child day care services. In the US, a larger proportion of the allied health care workforce is already employed in ambulatory settings. In California, nearly half (49.4 percent) of the allied health workforce is employed in ambulatory health care settings, compared with 28.7 percent and 21.9 percent employed in hospital and nursing care, respectively. One source reported allied health professionals making up 60 percent of the total US health workforce. In the United Kingdom there are 12 distinct professions who are considered allied health professionals; in combination they account for about 6% of the NHS workforce. In 2013 the annual expenditure on services provided by allied health professionals amounted to around ‚Ç§2 billion, although there is a lack of evidence around the extent to which these services improve the quality of care. Advancements in medical technology also allow for more services that formerly required expensive hospital stays to be delivered via ambulatory care. For example, in California, research has predicted the total consumption of hospital days per person will decline from 4 days in 2010 to 3.2 days in 2020 to 2.5 days in 2030. In contrast, the number of ambulatory visits per person will increase from 3.2 visits per person in 2010 to 3.6 visits per person in 2020 to 4.2 visits in 2030. In developing countries, many national human resources for health strategic plans and international development initiatives are focusing on scaling up training of allied health professions, such as HIV/AIDS counsellors, clinical officers and community health workers, in providing essential preventive and treatment services in ambulatory and community-based care settings. With this growing demand for ambulatory health care, researchers expect to witness a heavier demand for professions that are employed within the ambulatory sector and other non- hospital settings‚Äîin other words, allied health.

He also became notably involved in the defense of evolutionary science against creationist rejection of evolution.  Early life  Elsberry was born in Lakeland, Florida. He was brought up in the Evangelical United Brethren church, which merged with the Methodists in 1968 to form the United Methodist Church. He attended a public elementary school, an evangelical junior high, and a Catholic high school. He received a National Merit Scholarship and earned a B.S.(Bachelor) in zoology from the University of Florida in 1982. During that period, he worked as a staff photographer for the Independent Florida Alligator newspaper.  Career  After graduating from the University of Florida, he worked for Media Image Photography in Gainesville, Florida. In 1983, he became a lab technologist for the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Florida and in 1985 became a biologist in the Department of Physiological Sciences of the College of Veterinary Medicine. He worked with Professor Richard H. Lambertsen on the histology, physiology, and epidemiology of fin whales. He then entered a program in artificial intelligence, obtaining an M.S.C.S. in computer science from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1989. Following graduation, he was employed by General Dynamics Data Systems Division, programming fire-control computers for F-16 fighters. In 1991, he became a research scientist at the Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, working on a mapping system for the U.S. Air Force. In 1993, he began his doctoral studies in wildlife and fisheries sciences at Texas A&M; University with Professor William Eugene Evans as his major advisor. He collaborated with the U. S. Navy Marine Mammal Program in 1995 to investigate marine mammal hearing at depth. He periodically traveled to San Diego to continue collaboration on temporary threshold shift in marine mammals, until he was employed as a Behavioral Research Programmer for Science Applications International Corporation. He collaborated with Ted W. Cranford on a study of dolphin biosonar sound production in 1999. In 2001, he was awarded the Society for Marine Mammalogy's Fred Fairfield Award for Innovation in Marine Mammal Research. He completed his Ph.D. in 2003. Elsberry was a visiting researcher at Michigan State University from 2007 to 2009. There, he worked on the Avida artificial life project and extended the Avida- Ed software system.  Creationism  Elsberry became interested in the political controversy between creationism and science in February 1986, when he attended a lecture by a Young-Earth Creationist geologist. He found it superficially convincing and the lecturer gave him a copy of The Scientific Case for Creation by Henry M. Morris. Elsberry later recalled; \\"As I read that book, I started highlighting things that were pretty obviously counterfactual\\", and by 1977 only about five pages lacked highlighting. He said \\"I was just appalled at what I was reading. I came to believe that to stand by and not say anything about what he was doing to science and to religion would have made me complicit in that.\\" Using his knowledge of biology and computer science, Elsberry became heavily involved in online discussions on the topic. He took up criticizing antievolution claims in letters to the editors of newspapers and in online forums. His stance in these matters has been one of theistic evolution, with the concern that science be taught in science classes, and non-science be taught elsewhere. He participated in Fidonet echoes, particularly the Science Echo, from 1988 to 1994. In 1989, he began operating his own BBS, first as an RBBS-Net node and later as a Fidonet node. He started the Neural-Net Echo in 1989, and the Evolution Echo in 1991. He became a participant in the Usenet talk.origins newsgroup in 1991. By 1995, he had contributed a FAQ on punctuated equilibria to the TalkOrigins Archive, as well as the Jargon and Biographica compilations. He also created his own set of web pages dealing with scientific creationism in 1995. In 1997, he presented at the \\"Naturalism, Theism, and the Scientific Enterprise\\" conference held by intelligent design advocates in Austin, Texas, giving a defense of methodological naturalism. He also assisted the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) that year with regard to the review of science textbooks undertaken by the state of Texas. In 2001, he presented opposite William A. Dembski at the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences/American Association for the Advancement of Science \\"Interpreting Evolution\\" conference at Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania. Brett Vickers turned over care and maintenance of the TalkOrigins Archive to him late in 2001. He established a group of about a dozen volunteers, the TalkOrigins Archive Delegation, to handle needed maintenance and updates of the site. He also established the Antievolution.org site in 2001 as a place to collect critical information on the antievolution movement. In 2002, he presented at the \\"Evolution and Intelligent Design\\" session of the CSICOP 4th World Skeptics conference in Burbank, California, along with Massimo Pigliucci, Kenneth Miller, Paul Nelson, and William A. Dembski. In 2003, he took the position of Information Project Director at NCSE. In 2004, he helped establish the Panda's Thumb weblog and founded The Austringer. The Austringer The Austringer is the personal blog of Elsberry, initiated during a 2004 hospitalization as a convenient way to keep friends and family updated on developments. The title derives from falconry jargon for a person who flies a short-wing hawk. While posts cover falconry, science, wildlife, computation, and media issues, the most notable posts concern science education and the antievolution movement. These have included substantial materials concerning Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns, the Sternberg peer review controversy, and Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed. This blog has figured significantly in the ongoing defense of science against anti-evolutionism. For example, The Austringer is a major contributor to the Florida school science curricula debate.

When the victim's card (green) is inserted, it pushes aside a small flap which falls back into place, trapping the card so that the ATM is unable to eject it. A Lebanese loop is a device used to commit fraud and identity theft by exploiting automated teller machines (ATMs). In its simplest form, it is a strip or sleeve of metal or plastic which blocks the ATM's card slot, causing any inserted card to be apparently retained by the machine, allowing it to be retrieved by the fraudster when the card holder leaves. Its name comes from its regular use amongst Lebanese financial crime perpetrators, although it has since spread to other international criminal groups.Schreiber, Barry. ATM Security Forecast at Forefront of 1996 Plans. EFT Report, vol. 19 issue 2, Jan 18 1996 The scam has been reported in countries with high numbers of ATMs such as the UK, the United States,ATM Security  Landscaper admits to Lebanese loop scam at ATMs in 4 states and D.C.  ATM Marketplace Germany TU Berlin - Hoax- Info - Extra-Blatt: Ausspionieren von EC-Karten-Daten and France. Google cache of Detroit Free Press article  Process  A Lebanese loop device viewed from the back: a loop of plastic holds the card in place while allowing it to be read by the ATM. Double-sided tape (yellow) holds the device in place over the ATM's card slot. The term ‚ÄúLebanese loop‚Äù is applied to any number of similar devices that are used to perpetrate ATM fraud by retaining the user's card. In their simplest form, Lebanese loops consist of a strip or sleeve of metal or plastic (even something as simple as a strip of video cassette tape) that is inserted into the ATM's card slot. Some loops have a covering fascia which appears superficially to be part of the ATM, while others are simply a length of dark-coloured tape with glue strips to hold it temporarily inside an ATM slot.http://www.ssrichardmontgomery.com/atmtheft.htm Lebanese Loop devices are relatively simple to construct, requiring less technical skill than a card skimming technique. When the victim inserts their ATM card, the loop is long and narrow enough that the ATM machinery can still fully draw the card in and read it. The victim then enters their personal identification number (PIN) as normal, and requests the funds. The ATM then tries to eject the card, the loop device prevents the card from being ejected, either with a flap covering the fascia's slot, or a diagonal slit in the tape which catches against the card. The machine senses that the card has not been ejected, and draws the card back into the machine. The cash drawer does not open, and the money that has been counted is retained by the machine. In most cases, the victim's account is not debited. The victim believes the machine has malfunctioned or genuinely retained their card.Nettleton, Philip. Lebanese loop is new cashpoint con. Evening Standard (London), February 5 2001 In a typical scam, the perpetrator will obtain the victim's PIN either by watching them enter it the first time (shoulder surfing), or by approaching the victim under the pretense of offering help and suggesting they re-enter their PIN (and again, watching them do so). More sophisticated variants of the Lebanese loop scam have developed. In some cases, the fraudsters attach a small camera to the ATM to record the victim entering their PIN. The video from this camera is then transmitted to the fraudsters, who may be waiting near the machine and viewing the video on a laptop computer, meaning they need not approach the victim directly. There have been cases where a fake keypad is fitted to the machine over the top of the real one, and this records the PINs entered. Once the victim has left the area, the perpetrator retrieves the loop and the trapped card, and uses it, along with the stolen PIN, to withdraw cash from the victim's account.http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/scams/atmtheft.htm Since the Lebanese Loop is only able to capture one card at a time and the card holder will usually react quickly to the loss of the card, the technique must be widely deployed to net a useful number of cards in a short amount of time. This may require a large workforce to accomplish the task.  Countermeasures  ATM manufacturers have resorted to several methods to counteract the Lebanese Loop, generally consisting of adding various sensing mechanisms to the card readers. Various network activity profiling processes can be applied to attempt to detect this activity. Fraud fight gets more proactive at ATMs  ATM Marketplace Often ATM vestibules have video surveillance equipment installed in them, which can make identification of the perpetrator and method easier.SiliconRepublic.com: Attack of the clones ATM industry groups counsel cardholders to take precautions when entering their PIN into any device. Customers are also advised to avoid an ATM if strangers are standing next to it (especially if they do not move after being asked), be careful of ATMs which appear out of the ordinary (such as having unusual instructions attached), to never enter a PIN more than twice (to prevent the card from being retained by the machine), and to ignore advice from \\"helpful\\" strangers who may approach when they see a customer is having difficulty.Lebanese Loop at Snopes.com.  Other forms of card fraud  Other variants of fraud may use a ‚Äúskimming‚Äù technique, where an electronic device is fitted over the ATM's card slot and which reads the information encoded into the magnetic strip on the back of the victim's card as it is inserted. This variant does not require the card to be retained; the transaction runs normally, and the data recorded from the original card is copied to another blank magnetic stripe card, which is then used to withdraw cash. At their most sophisticated, scams can involve the construction and installation of fake fascias built to fit particular ATMs or other card reading devices. These false fronts can house any of the above devices to gather data from the user and allow the perpetrators to acquire or clone cards and their associated PINs. These fakes can often be indistinguishable from unmodified devices to the untrained eye.

It is commonly known as sapele or sapelli ( ) or sapele mahogany,Wood database as well as aboudikro, assi, and muyovu. Origin of the name The name sapele comes from that of the city of Sapele in Nigeria, where there is a preponderance of the tree. African Timber and Plywood (AT&P;), a division of the United Africa Company, had a factory at this location where the wood, along with Triplochiton scleroxylon, Obeche, mahogany, and Khaya was processed into timber which was then exported from the Port of Sapele worldwide. The name of the city itself is said to be an anglicization of the Urhobo word Uriapele, commemorating a local deity. It is believed the British colonial authorities changed the name of the then hamlet to Sapele as it was easier to pronounce. Description Entandrophragma cylindricum is native to tropical Africa.Entandrophragma cylindricum - World Forestry There are protected populations and felling restrictions in place in various countries. The species grows to a height of up to 45 m (rarely 60 m). The leaves are deciduous in the dry season, alternately arranged, pinnate, with 5-9 pairs of leaflets, each leaflet about 10 cm long. The flowers are produced in loose inflorescences when the tree is leafless, each flower about 5 mm diameter, with five yellowish petals. The fruit is a pendulous capsule about 10 cm long and 4 cm broad; when mature it splits into five sections to release the 15-20 seeds.Sapele - The Wood Database Uses An array mbira made of sapele wood This commercially important hardwood is reminiscent of mahogany, and is a part of the same Meliaceae family. It is darker in tone and has a distinctive figure, typically applied where figure is important. Sapele is particularly prized for a lustrous iridescence with colors that range from light pink to brown and gold to red. It has a high density of 640 kg/m and interlocked grain, which can make machining somewhat difficult. Demand for sapele increased as a mahogany substitute in recent years due to genuine mahogany becoming a CITES Appendix II listed species.Mahogany Mixups: the Lowdown - The Wood Database It is used in the manufacture of furniture, joinery, veneers, luxury flooring, and boat building. Among its more exotic uses is in musical instruments. It is used for the back and sides of acoustic guitar bodies, as well as the bodies of electric guitars. It is also used in manufacturing the neck piece of ukuleles and 26- and 36-string harps. In the late 1990s, it started to be used as a board for Basque percussion instruments txalaparta.

It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina ≈ªmigr√≥d. Geography The town lies in the historic Lower Silesia region on the Barycz River, approximately north-west of Trzebnica, and north of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. Its name is derived from Old Polish ≈ªmij, \\"dragon\\" () and gr√≥d, \\"castle\\" (), displayed in the town's coat of arms. As of 2019, the town had a population of 6,435. History The oldest sources say the settlement existed in the third period of the Bronze Age. The first records of a former Slavic settlement named Zunigrod (present-day ≈ªmigr√≥dek) on the north bank of the Barycz River, then held by the Bishop of Wroc≈Çaw, appear in the library of Pope Adrian IV in 1155. The current city on the other side of the river was invested according to German town law by one Tydricus dictus Deysenberc at the behest of the Piast duke Henry III the White in 1253, in a place where there was a ford. The castle near the border with Greater Poland was fortified, surrounded by a strong palisade, ramparts and a moat, there were built two gates, which were abolished only in 1819. The German name Trachinburg first appeared in 1287. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it was part of various Polish duchies of Lower Silesia: the Duchy of Silesia until 1290, the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w until 1312 and the Duchy of Ole≈õnica afterwards, held by the Piast dynasty until 1492. The Hatzfeld Palace c. 1860, edition by Alexander Duncker In 1492, Trachenberg was elevated to an autonomous state country of the Bohemian Crown. About 1555 the population turned Protestant. After a fire in 1579 a new castle with a tower was built and later upgraded under the rule of the House of Schaffgotsch, who had acquired the estates in 1592. During the Thirty Years' War, the owner Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch, a loyal supporter of the assassinated generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein was executed in 1635 and his estates seized by Emperor Ferdinand II. Trachenberg Castle was enfeoffed to the Imperial field marshal Count Melchior von Hatzfeldt in 1641. It was besieged several times and finally captured by the Swedish army under the command of General Lennart Torstensson in 1642. The Swedes occupied the castle until 1650. After the war, the area was subjected to stern Counter-Reformation measures. Another expansion of the castle took place in the years 1655-1657 on the initiative of Count Hatzfeld. In 1691, new fortifications were erected. In the mid- seventeenth century, the Polish-German language boundary ran near Trachenberg, including the city, to the territory of Polish language dominance.Dorota Borowicz: \\"Mapy narodowo≈õciowe G√≥rnego ≈ölƒÖska od po≈Çowy XIX wieku do II Wojny ≈öwiatowej\\". Wroc≈Çaw: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wroc≈Çawskiego, 2004, s.33. In the mid-18th century the town was annexed by Prussia. During the Napoleonic Wars, the town was captured by Bavarians, the French and Prussians. In 1813, in the baroque palace of the House of Hatzfeld, there was a meeting of the Prussian king Frederick William III of the Russian Tsar Alexander I, in which the Trachenberg Plan was agreed on, to avoid major battles in the struggle with Napoleon Bonaparte. In the 19th century, many Jews settled in the town (then called Trach(t)enberg), however, from the late 19th century, they emigrated, mainly to the west, and in 1939 there were no more Jews in the town. The 19th-century synagogue was destroyed by the Germans during the Kristallnacht in 1938. During World War II, the Germans established the 5/111 forced labour camp in the town. The victims of the camp are commemorated by a monument at the local cemetery. On January 23, 1945, the 10th Guards Tank Corps of the 4th Guards Tank Army commanded by General Dmitry Lelyushenko defeated the German garrison of Trachenberg and captured the town. The town was destroyed, except for the castle, which was set afire after the battle. After Germany's defeat in the war, the town under the restored Polish name ≈ªmigr√≥d came under Polish administration. End of June 1945, the German population was ordered to leave their home for Germany west of the Oder-Neisse line, in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. About 20 of the men were interned. ≈ªmigr√≥d was repopulated by Poles, many of whom were expelled from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union. The first transport of Poles from those territories arrived in June 1945 from Vilnius.Kalendarium historii niepodleg≈Çej Polski i ≈ªmigrodu (in Polish) Already in 1945 a forestry, a fire brigade and a scout troop were founded. Further establishments include the Piast ≈ªmigr√≥d football club in 1946, a cooperative bank in 1950, and a culture centre in 1953. In 1966, ≈ªmigr√≥d took part in the nationwide celebrations of the 1000th anniversary of the Baptism of Poland, and in 1980 local workers joined the Solidarity protests. In the 1990s, the Test Track Centre near ≈ªmigr√≥d was built as the only railway test track in Poland and one of just eight such facilities in the world. In 2018 a monument commemorating the 100th anniversary of regaining independence by Poland was unveiled.

They mostly inhabit wetlands and damp locations. Taxonomy The taxonomy of the genus is complex, and under review by botanists. Recent studies by taxonomists of the Cyperaceae have resulted in the creation of several new genera, including the genera Schoenoplectus and Bolboschoenus; others (including Blysmus, Isolepis, Nomochloa, and Scirpoides) have also been used. At one point this genus held almost 300 species, but many of the species once assigned to it have now been reassigned, and it now holds an estimated 120 species. Description Scirpus are rhizomatous perennial herbs, with 3-angled stems and flat grass-like leaves. The flowers are in clusters of small spikelets, often brown or greenish brown. Some species (e.g. S. lacustris) can reach a height of 3 m, while S. sylvaticus is about 1.2 m and others, such as S. supinus, are much smaller, only reaching 20‚Äì30 cm tall. Distribution The genus has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, found on every continent except Africa and Antarctica. Ecology Many species are common in wetlands and can produce dense stands of vegetation, along rivers, in coastal deltas and in ponds and potholes. Although flooding is the most important factor affecting its distribution, drought, ice scour, grazing, fire and salinity also affect its abundance. It can survive unfavourable conditions like prolonged flooding, or drought, as buried seeds Scirpus species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including Chedra microstigma and Scirpophaga nivella.

Geography Korfant√≥w is located in the Niemodlin Plain (R√≥wnina Niemodli≈Ñska), in the historical region of Silesia. The total area inside the town's boundary is 10,23 km¬≤. Etymology The former name for the settlement was Hurtlanth or Hurthland. Other documents relate to the town as: Fredland, Fredelant, Fredlandt, Fridland, Freijland, Stadt Friedland and Friedland. Over time, the locality's Polish name was remodelled to its German counterpart, and was namely referred to as: FerlƒÖd, Ferlondt, FrydlƒÖd, FyrlƒÖd, and officially as FrylƒÖd. After World War II, due to the town's German etymology, the settlement was renamed after Wojciech Korfanty. History Holy Trinity church Until 1532 the area was in the possession of Polish princes of the Silesian Piast Dynasty. Simultaneously, an influx of German settlers caused the town to develop; it became the property of wealthy German and Silesian nobles. In 1632, the Swedes plundered Friedland and surrounding villages during the Thirty Years' War. Over the next decades the town also suffered due to plagues and fires. At that time, Friedland was part of the Kingdom of Bohemia within the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1645 it returned to Poland under the House of Vasa, and in 1666 it fell to Bohemia again, however, it was ceded to Prussia after Frederick II the Great emerged victorious in the mid-18th century Silesian Wars. In the 19th century, despite Prussian and German rule, Catholic services were still held in Polish alongside German.S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom II, Warszawa, 1881, p. 425 (in Polish) It was part of Germany from 1871 until the end of World War II in 1945, when, under the Potsdam Agreement, it was reassigned to Poland. During World War II, the Polenlager 85 Nazi German concentration camp for Poles was based in the town in 1942‚Äì1943. A mass grave of its prisoners is located at the local parish cemetery. Economy Korfant√≥w city budget income sources as of 2015 In the interwar period, there were 152 registered businesses in Korfant√≥w, namely: services, trade and food production. After World War II, the town lost its former importance as the agricultural centre in the Nysa County. This was largely the effect of war losses, requisitioning, plunder and the Red Army's war commissar's rule over the locality in 1945, as well as poor political decisions. Later, the regime of the Polish People's Republic caused much impoverishment and financial instability, therefore, it was not until the reintroduction of the free market in 1989 that economic growth began to return.

This process is mainly carried out by microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria found in aquatic environments such as salt marshes, seawater, and freshwater lakes . By sensing the magnetic field, the bacteria are able to orient themselves towards environments with more favourable oxygen concentrations. This orientation towards more favourable oxygen concentrations allows the bacteria to reach these environments faster as opposed to if the bacteria were to move randomly to find these environments through Brownian motion . After orienting, the bacteria use flagella to swim along the magnetic field, towards the more favourable environment . Magnetotaxis has no impact on the average speed of the bacteria. Once these bacteria die, they are able to orient themselves to the Earth's magnetic field but they are incapable of migrating along the field . These bacteria are now simply called magnetic bacteria . Magnetic bacteria (e.g. Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum) contain internal structures known as magnetosomes which are responsible for the process of magnetotaxis. Magnetosomes contain crystals - often magnetite (Fe3O4). Some extremophile bacteria from sulfurous environments have been isolated with greigite (an iron-sulfide compound Fe3S4) . These crystals are contained within a bilayer membrane called the magnetosome membrane which is embedded with specific proteins. There are many different shapes of crystals however, crystal shape is usually consistent within a bacterial species . Most common arrangement of magnetosomes is in chains which allows a maximum magnetic dipole moment to be created . Within bacteria, there can be many chains of magnetosomes of different lengths that tend to align along the long axis of bacterial cell . The dipole moment created from the chains of magnetosomes allows the bacteria to align with the magnetic field as they move . By orienting towards the Earth's poles, marine bacteria are able to direct their movement downwards, towards the anaerobic/micro aerobic sediments. In the northern hemisphere, north seeking bacteria move downwards while in the southern hemisphere, south seeking bacteria dominate and move downwards. It was originally thought by scientists that south seeking bacteria would move upwards in the north hemisphere, towards very high concentrations of oxygen, and will be negatively selected for so that north seeking bacteria dominate in the northern hemisphere and vice versa. However, south seeking bacteria have been found in the northern hemisphere. Also, magnetic bacteria, both north and south seeking, are found even at the Earth's magnetic equator, where the field is directed horizontally. Some aspects of magnetotaxis are still not completely understood .

During the Thirteen Years' War it was defended against the Teutonic Knights in 1455, but it was later lost again.S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom II, Warsaw, 1881, p. 417 In 1461 the town was recaptured by King Casimir IV Jagiellon, but later it fell again to the Teutonic Knights. In 1464 the Teutonic Knights left the city, previously plundering and burning it. In the peace treaty signed in Toru≈Ñ in 1466, the town was recognized by the Teutonic Order as part of Poland, and after twelve years King Casimir IV of Poland confirmed the municipal rights of Debrzno. Administratively it was part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship until the Partitions of Poland. In 1627 the town was plundered by the Swedes. Former military Debrzno Airfield is located nearby.

Regarded as one of the fiercest generals of his time, he succeeded Artemio Ricarte as the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. He sought to apply his background in military science to the fledgling army. A sharpshooter himself, he organized professional guerrilla soldiers later called the \\"Luna Sharpshooters\\" and the \\"Black Guard\\". His three-tier defense, now known as the Luna Defense Line, gave the American troops a hard campaign in the provinces north of Manila. This defense line culminated in the creation of a military base in the Cordillera. Despite his commitment to discipline the army and serve the Republic which attracted the admiration of people, his temper caused some to abhor him, including people from Aguinaldo's Cabinet. Nevertheless, Luna's efforts were not without recognition during his time, for he was awarded the Philippine Republic Medal in 1899. He was also a member of the Malolos Congress. Besides his military studies, Luna also studied pharmacy, literature and chemistry.  Family background  Antonio Luna de San Pedro y Novicio Ancheta was born on 29 October 1866 in Calle Urbiztondo (renamed Barraca Street), Binondo (now part of San Nicolas), Manila. He was the youngest of seven children of Joaqu√≠n Luna de San Pedro y Posadas (1829‚Äì1891) from Badoc and Spanish mestiza Laureana Novicio y Ancheta (1836‚Äì1906) from Luna, La Union (formerly Namacpacan). His father was a traveling salesman of the government tobacco monopoly. The tobacco monopoly was formally established in 1782. After their family moved to Manila in 1861, his father became a merchant in Binondo. =Siblings= His older brother, Juan, was an accomplished painter who studied in the Madrid Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. His Spoliarium garnered one of the three gold medals awarded in the Madrid Exposici√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1884. Another brother, Jos√©, became a doctor. Yet another brother, Joaqu√≠n, fought with Antonio in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and later served as governor of La Union from 1904 to 1907. Joaqu√≠n would also serve as senator from 1916 to 1919. His three other siblings were Numeriana, Manuel, and Remedios.  Education  At the age of 6, Luna learned reading, writing, and arithmetic from a teacher known as Maestro Intong. He also memorized the Doctrina Christiana, believed to be the first book printed in the Philippines. The title of the work literally means \\"Christian Doctrine\\", and thus the primary goal of the book was to propagate Christian teaching across the Philippine archipelago. The book consists of 38 leaves and 74 pages of text in Spanish, Tagalog transliterated into roman letters, and Tagalog in its original Baybayin script, under a woodcut of Saint Dominic, with the verso originally blank, although in contemporary versions bears the manuscript inscription, \\"Tassada en dos reales\\", signed by Juan de Cuellar. After a syllabary comes the basic prayers: the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary, Credo, and the Salve Regina. Following these are Articles of Faith, the Ten Commandments, Commandments of the Holy Church, Sacraments of the Holy Church, Seven Mortal Sins, Fourteen Works of Charity, and points on Confession and Catechism. After his education under Maestro Intong, he studied at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1881. He went on to study literature and chemistry at the University of Santo Tomas, where he won first prize for a paper in chemistry titled Two Fundamental Bodies of Chemistry (Dos Cuerpos Fundamentales de la Quimica). He also studied Pharmacy. Meanwhile, his background on swordsmanship, fencing, and military tactics came from his studies under Don Martin Cartagena, a major in the Spanish Army. In addition, he acquired skill to become a sharpshooter. Upon the invitation of his elder brother Juan in 1890, Antonio was sent by his parents to Spain. There he acquired a licentiate (at Universidad de Barcelona) and doctorate (at Universidad Central de Madrid). = Scientific achievements = Antonio Luna poses with a microscope at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. Luna was active as a researcher in the scientific community. After receiving his doctorate in 1893, he published a scientific treatise on malaria entitled On Malarial Pathology (El Hematozorio del Paludismo), which was favorably received in the scientific community. He then went to Belgium and France, and worked as an assistant to Dr. Latteaux at the Pasteur Institute and to Dr. Laffen. In recognition of his ability, he was commissioned by the Spanish government to study tropical and communicable diseases. In 1894, he returned to the Philippines where he took part in an examination to determine who would become the chief chemist of the Municipal Laboratory of Manila. Luna came in first and won the position.  Propaganda Movement  Luna with fellow reformists Eduardo de Lete (center) and Marcelo H. del Pilar (right), Spain, 1890 In Spain, he became one of the Filipino expatriates who mounted the Propaganda Movement and wrote for La Solidaridad, headed by Galicano Apacible. He wrote a piece titled Impressions which dealt with Spanish customs and idiosyncrasies under the pen-name \\"Taga- ilog\\". Also, like many of the Filipino liberals in Spain, Luna joined the Masonry where he rose to being Master Mason. He and his brother Juan also opened the Sala de Armas, a fencing club, in Manila. When he learned of the underground societies that were planning a revolution and was asked to join, he scoffed at the idea and turned down the offer. Like other Filipino √©migr√©s involved in the Reform Movement, he was in favor of reform rather than revolution as the way towards independence. Besides affecting their property, the proponents of the Reform Movement saw that no revolution would succeed without the necessary preparations. Nevertheless, after the existence of the Katipunan was leaked in August 1896, the Luna brothers were arrested and jailed in Fort Santiago for \\"participating\\" in the revolution. His statement concerning the revolution was one of the many statements used to abet the laying down of death sentence for Jos√© Rizal. Months later, Jos√© and Juan were freed but Antonio was exiled to Spain in 1897, where he was imprisoned in Madrid's C√°rcel Modelo. His more famous and yet controversial brother, Juan, who had been pardoned by the Spanish Queen Regent Maria Christina of Austria herself, left for Spain to use his influence to intercede for Antonio in August 1897. Soon enough, Antonio's case was dismissed by the Military Supreme Court and he was released. Luna, repenting for his blunder during the end of the first phase during Philippine Revolution, which ended at the Pact of Biak- na-Bato, then prepared himself for the second phase. Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Li√®ge. He also read extensively about the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The second phase of the revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo and the Dictatorial Government of the Philippines by the US Navy to Cavite in 1898. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he was given a letter of recommendation to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo. He returned to the Philippines in July 1898.  Personal life  Luna courted Nellie Boustead, a woman who was also courted by Jos√© Rizal, between 1889 and 1891. Boustead was reportedly infatuated with Rizal. In a party held by Filipinos, a drunk Antonio Luna made unsavory remarks against Boustead. This prompted Rizal to challenge Luna to a duel. However, Luna apologized to Rizal, thus averting a duel between the compatriots.  Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War  = Prior to the war = Luna was one of the first to see action in Manila on 13 August 1898, when the Americans landed troops in Intramuros. Since June 1898, Manila had been surrounded by the revolutionary troops. Colonel Luciano San Miguel occupied Mandaluyong, General P√≠o del Pilar, Makati, General Mariano Noriel, Para√±aque, Colonel Enrique Pacheco, Navotas, Tambobong and Caloocan. General Gregorio del Pilar marched through Sampaloc, taking Tondo, Divisoria, and Azc√°rraga, Noriel cleared Singalong and Paco, and held Ermita and Malate. Luna thought the Filipinos should enter Intramuros to have joint occupation of the walled city. But Aguinaldo, heeding the advice of General Wesley Merritt and Commodore (later Admiral) George Dewey, whose fleet had moored in Manila Bay, sent Luna to the trenches where he ordered his troops to fire on the Americans. After the chaos following the American occupation, at a meeting in Ermita, Luna tried to complain to American officers about the disorderly conduct of their soldiers. To silence Luna, Aguinaldo appointed him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898 and assigned the rank of brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing the envy of the other generals who were fighting since the first phase of the Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were being thrown his way when all he wanted was to organize and discipline the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill- trained troops into a real army. On 15 September 1898, the Malolos Congress, the constituent assembly of the First Philippine Republic, was convened in Barasoain Church. Luna would be one of the elected representatives, and was narrowly defeated by Pedro Paterno as President of the Congress with a vote of 24‚Äì23. Seeing the need for a military school, in October 1898, Luna established a military academy at Malolos, known as the Academia Militar, which was the precursor of the present Philippine Military Academy. He appointed Colonel Manuel Bernal Sityar, a mestizo who was formerly a lieutenant serving the Civil Guard, as superintendent. He recruited other mestizos and Spaniards who had fought in the Spanish army during the 1896 Revolution for training. However, the academy had to be suspended indefinitely by March 1899 due to the outbreak of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Group showing some of Luna's aides: General Manuel Tinio (seated, center), General Benito Natividad (seated, 2nd from right), General Jose Alejandrino (seated, 2nd from left) A score of veteran officers became teachers at his military school. Luna devised two courses of instruction, planned the reorganization, with a battalion of tiradores and a cavalry squadron, set up an inventory of guns and ammunition, arsenals, using convents and town halls, quartermasters, lookouts and communication systems. He built trenches with the help of his chief engineer, General Jose Alejandrino, and had his brother Juan design the school's uniforms (the Filipino rayadillo). He also insisted on strict discipline over and above clan armies and regional loyalties, which prevented coordination between various military units. Envisioning one united army for the Republic, clan armies, and regional loyalties presented a lack of national consciousness. It was also a condition that the Spanish utilized to keep the native contingent of their armed forces within the check. Soldiers of one region were used to fight revolts in other regions. Convinced that the fate of the infant Republic should be a contest for the minds of Filipinos, Luna turned to journalism to strengthen Filipino minds with the ideas of nationhood and the need to fight the Americans. He decided to publish a newspaper, La Independencia. This four-page daily was filled with articles, short stories, patriotic songs and poems. The staff was installed in one of the coaches of the train that ran from Manila to Pangasinan. The paper came out in September 1898 and was an instant success. A movable feast of information, humor, and good writing, 4,000 copies were printed, which was more than all the other newspapers in circulation put together. When the Treaty of Paris, under which Spain was to cede the Philippines to the United States, was made public in December 1898, Luna quickly decided to take military action. He proposed a strategy that was designed to trap the Americans in Manila before more of their troops could land by executing surprise attacks (guerrilla warfare) while building up strength in the north. If the American forces penetrated his lines, Luna determined that he would wage a series of delaying battles and prepare a fortress in northern Luzon, particularly the Cordillera. This, however, was turned down by the High Command, who still believed that the Americans would grant full independence. = Outbreak of the war = Battle of Manila The Americans gained the time and the opportunity to start hostilities with the Filipinos at the place and time of their choice. On the night of 4 February 1899, when most of the Filipino generals were at a ball in Malolos to celebrate the success of the American anti-imperialists delaying the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the Americans staged an incident along the concrete blockhouses in Santa Mesa near the Balsahan Bridge. An American patrol fired on Filipino troops, claiming afterward that the Filipinos had started shooting first. The whole Filipino line from Pasay to Caloocan returned fire and the first battle of the Filipino-American War ensued. Two days later, in response to the incident, the US Senate voted for annexation. In doing so, the conflict became the war of conquest, occupation, and annexation that Luna, Mabini, and others had predicted and about which they had warned Aguinaldo and his generals previously. Luna, after receiving orders from Aguinaldo, rushed to the front lines from his headquarters at Polo (present-day Valenzuela City) and led three companies to La Loma to engage General Arthur MacArthur's forces. Fighting took place at Marikina, Caloocan, Santa Ana, and Paco. The Filipinos were subjected to a carefully planned attack with naval artillery, with Dewey's US fleet firing from the Manila Bay. Filipino casualties were high, amounting to around 2,000 killed and wounded. Luna personally had to carry wounded officers and men to safety; of these rescues, the most dramatic was that of Commander Jos√© Torres Bugall√≥n. After being hit by an American bullet, Bugall√≥n had managed to advance another fifty meters before he was seen by Luna to collapse by the side of the road. As the Americans kept up their fire on the road, Luna had to gather an escort of around 25 men to save Bugall√≥n, who Luna declared was equivalent to 500 men. Surviving the encounter, Luna tried to encourage Bugall√≥n to live and gave the latter an instant promotion to lieutenant colonel. However, Bugall√≥n died thereafter. On 7 February, Luna issued a detailed order to the field officers of the territorial militia. Containing five specific objects, it began \\"under the barbarous attack upon our army on February 4\\", and ended with \\"war without quarter to false Americans who wish to enslave us. Independence or death!\\" The order labeled the US forces \\"an army of drunkards and thieves\\" in response to the continued bombardment of the towns around Manila, the burning and looting of whole districts, and the raping of Filipino women by US troops. When Luna saw that the American advance had halted, mainly to stabilize their lines, he again mobilized his troops to attack La Loma on 10 February. Fierce fighting ensued but the Filipinos were forced to withdraw thereafter. Caloocan was left with American forces in control of the southern terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway, along with five engines, fifty passenger coaches, and a hundred freight cars. After consolidating control of Caloocan, the obvious next objective for American forces would be the Republic capital at Malolos. However, General Otis delayed for almost a month in hopes that Filipino forces would be deployed in its defense. Nevertheless, with their superior firepower and newly arrived reinforcements, the Americans had not expected such resistance. They were so surprised that an urgent cable was sent to General Lawton who was in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), with his troops. Illustrating the concern that the Americans had, the telegram stated, \\"Situation critical in Manila. Your early arrival great importance.\\" = Luna Sharpshooters and the Black Guard = The Luna Sharpshooters was a short-lived unit formed by Luna to serve under the Philippine Revolutionary Army. On 11 February, eight infantrymen, formerly under Captains M√°rquez and Jaro, were sent by then-Secretary of War Baldomero Aguinaldo to Luna, then-Assistant Secretary of War. The infantrymen were disarmed by the Americans. So, they journeyed to be commissioned in the regular Filipino army. Seeing their desire to serve in the army, Luna took them in and from their group grew and emerged as the Luna Sharpshooters. The sharpshooters became famous for their fierce fighting and proved their worth by being the usual spearheading unit in every major battle in the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. After the Battle of Calumpit on 25‚Äì27 April 1899, only seven or eight of them remained in the regular Filipino army. In the Battle of Paye on 18 December 1899, a Filipino sharpshooter, Private Bonifacio Mariano, under the command of General Licerio Ger√≥nimo killed General Henry Ware Lawton, making the latter the highest ranking casualty during the course of the war. Luna also formed other units similar to the sharpshooters. One was the unit, which would later be named after Bugall√≥n, commanded by Rosendo Sim√≥n de Pajarillo. The unit emerged from a group of ten men wanting to volunteer in the regular Filipino army. Luna, still thinking of the defeat at the Battle of Caloocan, sent the men away at first. However, he soon changed his mind and decided to give the men an initiation. After taking breakfast, he ordered a subordinate, Colonel Queri, to prepare arms and ammunition for the ten men. Then, the men boarded a train destined towards Malinta, which was American-held territory. After giving orders to the men, he let them go and watched them with his telescope. The men, succeeding their mission, eventually returned unharmed. Admiring their bravery, he organized them into a guerrilla unit of around 50 members. This unit would see action in the Second Battle of Caloocan. Another elite unit was the Black Guard, a 25-man guerrilla unit under a certain Lieutenant Garc√≠a. Garc√≠a, one of Luna's favorites, was a modest but brave soldier. His unit was tasked to approach the enemy by surprise and quickly return to camp. Luna had admired Garc√≠a's unit very much that he wanted to increase their size. However, Garc√≠a declined the offer. He believed that a larger force might undermine the efficiency of their work. Jose Alejandrino, the chief army engineer and one of Luna's aides, stated that he never heard of Garc√≠a and his unit again after Luna's resignation on 28 February. = Further operations during the war = General Tom√°s Mascardo, military commander of Pampanga A Filipino counterattack began at dawn on 23 February. The plan was to employ a pincer movement, using the battalions from the North and South, with the sharpshooters (the only professionally trained troops) at crucial points. The sandatahanes or bolomen inside Manila would start a great fire to signal the start of the assault. Troops directly under Luna's command were divided into three: the West Brigade under General Pantaleon Garc√≠a, the Center Brigade under General Mariano Llanera, and the East Brigade under General Licerio Ger√≥nimo. Luna even requested the battle-hardened Tinio Brigade from Northern Luzon, under the command of General Manuel Tinio. It had more than 1,900 soldiers. However, Aguinaldo gave only ambiguous answers and the Tinio Brigade was unable to participate in the battle. It was only partly successful because of two main reasons. Firstly, some of the successful Filipino sectors ran low on ammunition and food and were thus forced to withdraw to Polo. Secondly, Luna failed to relieve the Kapampangan militia, already past their prime, when the battalion from Kawit, Cavite, refused to replace the former, saying that they had orders to obey only instructions directly from Aguinaldo. Such insubordination had become quite common among the Filipino forces at that time as most of the troops owed their loyalty to the officers from their provinces, towns, or districts and not to the central command. As a result, the counterattack soon collapsed, and Luna placated himself by disarming the Kawit Battalion. 1st Nebraskan Volunteers advancing during the Battle of Santo Tomas Luna, however, proved to be a strict disciplinarian and his temper alienated many in the ranks of the common soldiers. An example of this occurred during the Battle of Calumpit, wherein Luna ordered General Tom√°s Mascardo to send troops from Guagua to strengthen the former's defenses. However, Mascardo ignored orders by Luna insisting that he was going to Arayat to undertake an \\"inspection of troops\\". Another version of Mascardo's reasoning emerged and it was probably that which reached Luna. This version was that Mascardo had left to visit his girlfriend. Luna, infuriated by Mascardo's actions, had decided to detain him. However, Major Hernando, one of Luna's aides, tried to placate the general's anger by convincing Luna to push the case to President Aguinaldo. Aguinaldo complied to detain Mascardo for twenty-four hours. Upon returning to the field, however, the Americans had broken through his defenses at the Bagbag River, forcing Luna to withdraw despite his heroic action to defend the remaining sectors. Luna resigned on 1 March, mainly in resentment for the rearmament of the Kawit Battalion as the Presidential Guard. Aguinaldo hesitantly accepted the resignation. As a result, Luna was absent from the field for three weeks, during which the Filipino forces suffered several defeats and setbacks. One such defeat would be at the Battle of Marilao River on 27 March. Receiving the depressing reports from the field through his La Independencia correspondents, Luna went to Aguinaldo and asked to be reinstated with more powers over all the military heads, and Aguinaldo promoted him to Lieutenant General and agreed making him Commander-in-Chief of all the Filipino forces in Central Luzon (Bulacan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Zambales). The Luna Defense Line was planned to create a series of delaying battles from Caloocan to Angeles, Pampanga, as the Republic was constructing a guerrilla base in the Mountain Province. The base was planned to be the last stand headquarters of the Republic in the case the Americans broke through the Defense Line. American military observers were astonished by the Defense Line, which they described as consisting of numerous bamboo trenches stretching from town to town. The series of trenches allowed the Filipinos to withdraw gradually, firing from cover at the advancing Americans. As the American troops occupied each new position, they were subjected to a series of traps that had been set in the trenches, which included bamboo spikes and poisonous reptiles. Earlier in May 1899, Luna almost fell in the field at the Battle of Santo Tomas. Mounted on his horse, Luna then charged into the battlefield leading his main force in a counterattack. As they advanced, the American forces began firing upon them. Luna's horse was hit and he fell to the ground. As he recovered, Luna realized that he had been shot in the stomach, and he attempted to kill himself with his revolver to avoid capture. He was saved, though, by the actions of a Filipino colonel named Alejandro Avecilla who, having seen Luna fall, rode towards the general to save him. Despite being heavily wounded in one of his legs and an arm, with his remaining strength Avecilla carried Luna away from the battle to the Filipino rear. Upon reaching safety, Luna realized that his wound was not very deep as most of the impact of the bullet had been taken by a silk belt full of gold coins that his parents had given him, which he had been wearing. As he left the field to have his wounds tended, Luna turned over the command to General Venacio Concepci√≥n, the Filipino commander of the nearby town of Angeles. Meanwhile, in recognition of his work, Luna was awarded the Philippine Republic Medal. By the end of May 1899, Colonel Joaqu√≠n Luna, one of Antonio's brothers, warned him that a plot had been concocted by \\"old elements\\" or the autonomists of the Republic (who were bent on accepting American sovereignty over the country) and a clique of army officers whom Luna had disarmed, arrested, and/or insulted. Luna shrugged off all these threats, reiterating his trust for Aguinaldo, and continued building defenses at Pangasinan where the Americans were planning a landing. Assassination and the aftermath Colonel Francisco Rom√°n, Luna's aide-de-camp, was assassinated with him. On 2 June 1899, Luna received two telegrams (initially four, but he never received the last two) ‚Äì one asked for help in launching a counterattack in San Fernando, Pampanga; and the other, sent by Aguinaldo himself, ordered him to go to the new capital at Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija to form a new cabinet. In his jubilation, Luna wrote Arcadio Maxilom, military commander of Cebu, to stand firm in the war. Luna set off from Bayambang, first by train, then on horseback, and eventually in three carriages to Nueva Ecija with 25 of his men. During the journey, two of the carriages broke down, so he proceeded with just one carriage with Colonel Francisco Rom√°n and Captain Eduardo Rusca, having earlier shed his cavalry escort. On 4 June, Luna sent a telegram to Aguinaldo confirming his arrival. Upon arriving at Cabanatuan on 5 June, Luna alone, proceeded to the headquarters to communicate with the President. As he went up the stairs, he ran into an officer whom he had previously disarmed for insubordination, Captain Pedro Janolino, commander of the Kawit Battalion; and an old enemy whom he had once threatened with arrest for favoring American autonomy, Felipe Buencamino, Minister of Foreign Affairs and a member of the Cabinet. He was told that Aguinaldo had left for San Isidro in Nueva Ecija (He actually went to Bamban, Tarlac). Enraged, Luna asked why he had not been told that the meeting was cancelled. Both exchanged heated words as he was about to depart. In the plaza, a rifle shot rang out. Still outraged and furious, Luna rushed down the stairs and met Janolino, accompanied by some elements of the Kawit Battalion. Janolino swung his bolo at Luna, wounding him in the head. Janolino's men fired at Luna, while others started stabbing him, even as he tried to fire his revolver at one of his attackers. He staggered out into the plaza where Rom√°n and Rusca were rushing to his aid, but as he lay dying, they too were set upon and shot, with Rom√°n being killed and Rusca being severely wounded. Luna received more than 30 wounds, and uttered \\"Cowards! Assassins!\\" He was hurriedly buried in the churchyard, after which Aguinaldo relieved Luna's officers and men from the field, including General Venacio Concepci√≥n, whose headquarters in Angeles, Pampanga Aguinaldo besieged the same day Luna was assassinated. Immediately after Luna's death, confusion reigned on both sides. The Americans even thought Luna had taken over to replace Aguinaldo. Luna's death was publicly declared only by 8 June, and a circular providing details of the event released by 13 June. While investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon Garc√≠a said that it was he who was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness at the time prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would be firm in his stand that he had nothing to do with the assassination of Luna. Felipe Buencamino succeeded Apolinario Mabini as Secretary of Foreign Affairs during the First Philippine Republic. The death of Luna, the most brilliant and capable of the Filipino generals at the time, was a decisive factor in the fight against the American forces. Despite mixed reactions on both the Filipino and American sides on the death of Luna, there are people from both sides who nevertheless developed an admiration for him. General Frederick Funston, who received the credit of capturing Aguinaldo at Palanan, Isabela, stated that Luna was the \\"ablest and most aggressive leader of the Filipino Republic.\\" For General James Franklin Bell, Luna \\"was the only general the Filipino army had.\\" General Robert Hughes remarked that \\"with the death of General Luna, the Filipino army lost the only General it had.\\" Meanwhile, Apolinario Mabini, former Prime Minister and Secretary of Foreign Affairs, had this to say: \\"If he was sometimes hasty and even cruel in his resolution, it was because the army had been brought to a desperate situation by the demoralization of the soldiers and the lack of ammunitions: nothing but action of rash courage and extraordinary energy could hinder its dissolution.\\" Of the Filipino armed forces organized during Luna's service in the army, Major General Henry Ware Lawton commented, \\"Filipinos are a very fine set of soldiers, far better than the Indians... Inferior in every particular equipment and supplies, they are the bravest men I have ever seen... I'm very well impressed with the Filipinos!\\" Lawton later recanted this statement. Subsequently, Aguinaldo suffered successive, disastrous losses in the field, as he retreated northwards. On 13 November 1899, Aguinaldo decided to disperse his army and begin conducting a guerrilla war. General Jos√© Alejandrino, one of Luna's remaining aides, stated in his memoirs that if Luna had been able to finish the planned military camp in the Mountain Province and had shifted to guerrilla warfare earlier as Luna had suggested, Aguinaldo might have avoided having to run for his life in the Cordillera Mountains. For historian Teodoro Agoncillo, however, Luna's death did not directly contribute to the resulting fall of the Republic. In his book, Malolos: The Crisis of the Republic, Agoncillo stated that the loss of Luna showed the existence of a lack of discipline among the regular Filipino soldiers and it was a major weakness that was never remedied during the course of the war. Also, soldiers connected with Luna were demoralized and as a result eventually surrendered to the Americans. Despite Aguinaldo denying the allegation of his being involved in Luna's death multiple times, an original copy of the telegram he sent to Luna was discovered in 2019 showing his order for Luna to visit Cabanatuan.

Although it received small numbers of juvenile offenders from 1842, it was not formally constituted as a penal colony until 1849. Between 1850 and 1868, 9,721 convicts were transported to Western Australia on 43 convict ship voyages. Transportation ceased in 1868, but it was many years until the colony ceased to have any convicts in its care. Convicts at King George Sound The first convicts to arrive in what is now Western Australia were convicts of the New South Wales penal system, sent to King George Sound in 1826 to help establish a settlement there. At that time, the western third of Australia was unclaimed land known as New Holland. Fears that France would lay claim to the land prompted the Governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling, to send Major Edmund Lockyer, with troops and 23 convicts, to establish the King George Sound settlement. Lockyer's party arrived on 25 December 1826. A convict presence was maintained at the settlement for nearly four years. In November 1830, control of the settlement was transferred to the Swan River Colony, and the troops and convicts withdrew. Free settlement to penal colony In December 1828, the British Colonial Office agreed to establish a colony at Swan River in Western Australia. It then issued a circular outlining the conditions of settlement, which stated, \\"It is not intended that any convicts or other description of Prisoners, be sent to this new settlement.\\"Colonial Office Circular, 5 December 1828 That Swan River Colony would not be a penal colony was highly attractive to many of the potential settlers, and the condition was mentioned often by promoters during the period of Swan River mania. Swan River Colony was established as a \\"free settlement\\" in June 1829. Still, in early September the merchant vessel Anglesea grounded at Gage Roads, at the mouth of the Swan River. She did not break up, as had been expected, but instead survived to become Western Australia's first prison hulk.Goulding (2007), p.14. For the first fifteen years, the people of the colony were generally opposed to accepting convicts, although the idea was in constant circulation almost from the start. Early in 1831, the Colonel Peter Latour asked permission to transport 300 Swing Riots convicts, but was refused. Nonetheless, the idea was under discussion later that year, with the Fremantle Observer editorialising on the need for convict labour,. Republished by Fremantle Arts Centre Press in 1991. . and George Fletcher Moore writing in his diary: Facsimile edition published in 1978 by Nedlands, Western Australia: University of Western Australia Press. In 1834, Captain Frederick Irwin suggested that the colony take in some Indian convicts for use as labour for the construction of public works. Towards the end of that year, a meeting of settlers at King George Sound passed a motion, signed by sixteen persons, that convict labour was needed for land clearing and road works, but this was met with little support in other parts of the colony. Three years later, a similar motion was considered but defeated by the Western Australian Agricultural Society. =Introduction of Parkhurst apprentices= Early in 1839, the Governor of Western Australia, John Hutt, received from the Colonial Office a circular asking if the colony would be prepared to accept juvenile prisoners who had first been reformed in \\"penitentiaries especially adapted for the purpose of their education and reformation\\". After seeking comment from the Western Australian Agricultural Society, Hutt responded that, \\"The Majority of the Community would not object to boys not above 15 years of age....\\" but that the labour market could not support more than 30 boys per year. 234 juvenile prisoners were subsequently transported from Parkhurst Prison to Western Australia between 1842 and 1849. These Parkhurst apprentices were then \\"apprenticed\\" to local employers. As Western Australia was not yet a penal colony, contemporary documents scrupulously avoided referring to the Parkhurst apprentices as \\"convicts\\". Most historians have since maintained this distinction. An opposing view, held for example by Andrew Gill, is that the Parkhurst apprentices were convicts, and that their apprenticeships constituted convict assignment. =Agitation for convicts= The first page of An Ordinance to provide for the due custody and discipline of Offenders transported to Western Australia; and of certain classes of Offenders sentenced therein to Transportation, 13 Vic No. 1 Serious lobbying for Western Australia to become a penal colony began in 1844, when members of the York Agricultural Society brought forward a motion stating: Nothing concrete came of the motion, but James Battye nonetheless identifies it as a turning point: In 1845, no less than three memorials were circulated requesting the establishment of a penal colony in Western Australia. Two of them were aborted, but the third resulted in a petition by the York Agricultural Society to the Legislative Council on the subject. The York Agricultural Society, which consisted mostly of pastoralists, argued that the colony's economy was on the brink of collapse due to an extreme shortage of labour. Pamela Statham has examined these claims, and found that the colony was in fact oversupplied with labour at the time, the main obstacles to progress being a shortage of money capital, and the lack of markets for the colony's produce. Only in the pastoral sector was there a severe labour shortage. The York Agricultural Society can therefore be seen as an influential lobby group representing the interests of a small but influential minority. The York Agricultural Society's 1845 petition was unanimously rejected by the Legislative Council, which stated: Over the following two years, however, the membership of the Council changed substantially. Three new members, Thomas Yule, Edward Barrett-Lennard and Rivett Henry Bland, were pro-convict pastoralists, giving the pastoralists a significant representation in Council. During 1846, the York Agricultural Society began circulating yet another petition. This petition appears to have convinced a substantial proportion of the colony of the merits of becoming a penal settlement. It obtained many signatures, and a number of newspapers began to support the idea.[broken footnote] The petition was debated by the Legislative Council in July and August 1847; it was rejected, but forwarded to the British Colonial Office nonetheless. To address some of the problems raised by the petition, the Legislative Council took a number of decisions, one of which was to ask the British government to send out a small number of convicts for a limited term. When the reports of the Council's debates on the introduction of convicts arrived in Britain in early 1848, the British government took great interest in them. By this time, the only British colonies still willing to accept convicts were Canada and Van Diemen's Land, and these only under protest. A tentative attempt to institute a penal system within England had caused a public outcry, and had been suspended. With nowhere to send its convicts, the numbers in British jails had increased until the situation had become urgent. In July 1848, Charles Fitzgerald was appointed Governor of Western Australia. The issue of convicts was almost certainly discussed with Fitzgerald before he departed for Western Australia, and it is probable that he was instructed to promote convictism, as he took a strongly pro-convict stance throughout his governorship. On his arrival in Western Australia in August 1848, he presented the Colonial Office's reply to Western Australia's request. Britain had refused to send convicts for a fixed term, but offered to send out first offenders in the final years of their terms. This was readily agreed to by the original petitioners, and also attracted some wider public support. Implicit in Britain's offer was the understanding that the Swan River Colony would not become a regular penal settlement, in which Britain retained responsibility for managing and funding the penal system. Rather, it would take full responsibility for the convicts that it accepted. In February 1849, a public meeting was held to discuss the issue, from which a majority view emerged in support of an alternative proposal put forward by Lionel Samson. Samson argued that the colony needed both labour and capital, and pointed out that under Britain's proposal the colony would effectively become a penal colony but would not receive the usual investment of capital from Britain. In March, Fitzgerald was able to tell the Colonial Office* Fitzgerald's message was received by the Colonial Office in July 1849. By that time, the Colonial Office had already acted to formally constitute Western Australia as a penal settlement. After receiving Fitzgerald's missive, the Colonial Office decided to send out about 100 convicts under the conditions of the original proposal. When news of this reached the Swan River Colony, the colonists protested that the original proposal was never agreed to by the majority of settlers. They demanded that the British Government either agree to fund the colony's convict establishment, or cancel altogether their plans to send convicts. Eventually the British Government agreed to the colonists' demands for funding, but since the expenditure was not warranted for only 100 convicts, it was decided to greatly increase the number of convicts sent. Convict era The first 75 convicts arrived in Fremantle on 1 June 1850. Daniel Scott, the harbour-master was able to rent out his wool warehouse as the only secure place to keep them.Behind Bars , Jen Hamilton, Construction in Focus, accessed August 2013 The convicts that had arrived on the Scindian used Scott's warehouse as their only home until they had constructed their own convict establishment.The Convict Era , Fremantle Prison, accessed 15 August 2013 Between 1850 and 1868, 9721 convicts were transported to Western Australia on 43 convict ship voyages. At the request of the colony, convicts were initially selected for transportation in accordance with three conditions: * that no female convicts be transported; * that no political prisoners be transported; and * that no convicts convicted of serious crimes be transported. The first of these was honoured throughout the convict era; and the second until 1868, when the last convict ship to Western Australia, the Hougoumont, was sent out with 62 Fenian prisoners on board. The third condition, that convicts not be convicted of serious crimes, was observed only for the first couple of years, and then only because the absence of a suitable jail would have made management of such convicts difficult. Later, more serious offenders were sent. It is a tradition that Western Australia's convicts were of a \\"better class\\" than those of Australia's other penal colonies, but Sandra Taylor has shown that this was not the case. Indeed, as Britain's penal system gradually reformed, it began to deal with more of its minor offenders at home, and therefore transported a higher proportion of serious offenders to Western Australia. From 1851-1853, as the number of convicts arriving in the colony increased the mood of the free population changed from popular support to one of great concern: In November 1857, John Hutt, representing a number of business interests wrote to British Government to suggest the colony as a place to transport sepoys who had rebelled during the Indian Mutiny of that year.IOLR IPP 188/49 John Hutt, to Governor General in Council, London 26 Nov 1857 A number of public meetings were held in the colony to discuss the proposal which supported the proposal.Reported in Perth Gazette, 12 February 1858 The idea and the reaction of the colony to it received attention all over Australia and was ultimately rejectedPerth Inquirer, 11 June 1858 by the British Government. =Convict life= The Fremantle Prison whipping post Most convicts in Western Australia spent very little time in prison. Those who were stationed at Fremantle were housed in the Convict Establishment, the colony's convict prison, and misbehaviour was punished by stints there. The majority of convicts, however, were stationed in other parts of the colony. Although there was no convict assignment in Western Australia, there was a great demand for public infrastructure throughout the colony, so that many convicts were stationed in remote areas. Initially, most convicts were set to work creating infrastructure for the convict system, including the construction of the Convict Establishment itself. Later, they were set to work on other public works, especially roads. In Perth, for example, convicts built the Perth Gaol between 1854 and 1856, and some were then housed there to provide labour for capital works in the city and surrounds.

LePage Building A State: The Story of the Public Works Department of Western Australia 1829-1985 Water Authority of Western Australia, Leederville, 1986, pp.211- are several of the notable landmarks built by convicts. Since many convicts were stationed in work parties in remote locations, there were many opportunities for escape, and escapes did occur reasonably often. However, since the colony was surrounded by ocean and desert, it was almost impossible to leave the colony, and few escapees remained at large within the colony for long. On some occasions escapees surrendered to avoid starvation. Notable exceptions include Moondyne Joe, who remained at large in the colony for two years, and John Boyle O'Reilly with six fellow Fenian prisoners who escaped to the United States. Convicts who were well-behaved could look forward to obtaining a ticket of leave well before the completion of their sentence. Ticket of leave men were permitted to work for money, but could not leave their assigned district and had few legal rights. After serving a period of time as a ticket of leave man, the convict might obtain a conditional pardon, which meant complete freedom except that they could not return to England. The social stigma of conviction generally remained with ex-convicts throughout their lives, and to some extent affected their children too. Ex-convicts and their children rarely married into free settler families, for example. Although ex-convicts sometimes attained a position of social respectability by successful self-employment, for example as farmers or merchants, it was rare for them to obtain paid work other than unskilled menial labour. Government appointments were generally closed to them, with the notable exception of school teaching. A substantial number of ex-convict school teachers were appointed because educated free settlers were not attracted to the low salaries on offer.  End to transportation  Western Australia's convict era came to an end with the cessation of penal transportation by Britain. In May 1865, the colony was advised of the change in British policy, and told that Britain would send one convict ship in each of the years 1865, 1866 and 1867, after which transportation would cease. In accordance with this, the last convict ship to Western Australia, the Hougoumont, departed Britain in 1867 and arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868. Western Australia objected strongly to the cessation of transportation, and, once it became clear that the decision would not be altered, pushed for compensation. Governor Weld wrote to the Secretary of State for the Colonies: Despite the colony's objections, Britain gradually began to wind the colony's penal system up, by reducing its expenditure and disposing of its assets. One by one the country convict depots were closed, and in 1872 the office of Comptroller General of Convicts was abolished. Much of the penal system's infrastructure was handed over to the colony, including the Convict Establishment, which became Fremantle Prison. Although transportation ended in 1868, there were still 3,158 convicts in the system by the end of that year, and it took many years for these remaining convicts to die or receive their freedom. One of the best known events of Western Australia's convict era, the Catalpa rescue, did not occur until 1876, eight years after the cessation of transportation.  Later years  Effects of the convict era continued to be felt for many years. In 1874, Western Australia's Legislative Council lobbied the British government for responsible government but were refused, the grounds for refusal including that the proportion of ex-convicts in the colony was too high. For many years following the cessation of penal transportation to Western Australia, that period of Western Australia's history was systematically ignored. Few historians chose to study the era, and some historians actively avoided it. For example, Hal Colebatch's centenary history of Western Australia, A Story of a Hundred Years, contains no mention of Western Australia's convict era. Moreover, the possession of convict ancestry was for many years considered shameful; persons with convict ancestry tended not to speak of it, so that later generations were often ignorant of this aspect of their ancestry. In recent times, however, the stigma associated with convict ancestry has evaporated, and for some people has even become a source of pride. There has been a surge in interest in convict history and genealogy throughout Australia.

It was released in October 1975. Track listing =Side one= #\\"Police Street\\" ‚Äì 21:30 =Side two= #\\"We've Lost Our Big Kabloona\\" ‚Äì 22:30Firesign Theatre. In the Next World, You're on Your Own. Columbia Records, 1975. Detailed track information and commentary The first side of the album, \\"Police Street\\", features a group of sketches interconnected by the kind of police show satire reminiscent of Phil Austin's detective fiction (Austin being best known as the detective character Nick Danger). The highlight sketch is \\"Give It Back,\\" a mock game show in which losing contestants have to surrender their parents' material possessions to the Native Americans. In surreal fashion, the police satire also plays out a family drama. In this drama the main characters are: the hard-boiled Lieutenant Detective Random Coolzip; his wife, Peggy, who is also his dispatcher; their son, Skip Coolzip, a junior policeman; and their daughter, Kim, a pornographic film actress. Several side sketches are interwoven with the police drama. In the first, a commercial for Dead Cat Soap segues into a soap opera spoof, starring Peggy. We learn that Random is rarely home, Peggy is having an affair, and Skip's (\\"Skipper\\" to his mother) sexual orientation is a scandal. In the second, Kim Coolzip presents a seductive commercial for liquid meat, which segues into her appearance on a charity fund-raising telethon. The third is the game show, in which Skip Coolzip \\"gives back\\" to Native Americans his family's car, then his father's squad car (\\"the black screamer\\"), and finally, \\"everything.\\" He is also assigned, with his sister, to take over the Academy Awards celebration \\"with these stirring words: 'Eat flaming death, fascist media pigs.'\\" The second side of the album, \\"We've Lost Our Big Kabloona\\", culminates in the hostage situation, on stage during the live broadcast of the Academy Awards. While accepting an award for a police/family drama called \\"Squat!,\\" which stars their parents and seems identical to the show on the first side of the album, Skip and Kim Coolzip reveal a gun. They demand that the President of the United States appear in Hollywood \\"with a plane full of cash and all those broken treaties,\\" or they will shoot the nominees one by one in alphabetical order. This sketch was inspired by Sacheen Littlefeather's appearance at the 1973 Academy Awards. In the liner notes, thanks are given to authors Jorge Luis Borges and Raymond Chandler. This album was the only commercial album during the group's Columbia Records period that was released under the group name but not crediting all four members as writers. The script is formally credited only to Phil Austin and David Ossman, although the other two members, Peter Bergman and Philip Proctor, honed their parts further during recording. The result did not sell well, and the label declined to renew the group's contract.

It is formed by the confluence of the Black (Imfolozi emnyama) and White Umfolozi (Imfolozi emhlope) Rivers near the southeastern boundary of the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve. The isiZulu name imFolozi is generally considered to describe the zigzag course followed by both tributaries, though other explanations have been given. The river flows in an easterly direction to the Indian Ocean at Maphelana, a coastal resort just south of the St Lucia River mouth. It originally meandered over the Monzi Flats, where it split into numerous slow-flowing channels before entering the St. Lucia Estuary at Honeymoon Bend. The slow-moving water and reed beds in channels operated as a natural filtering system that removed silt from the Umfolozi floodwaters and created a rich habitat for numerous species. Ecology During the 1950s, the Umfolozi Landowners Association contained and artificially channeled the river through the Monzi Flats to develop sugarcane farms. The new Umfolozi canal resulted in the unfiltered water depositing its silt load after entering the slower moving St. Lucia Estuary. This caused the estuary mouth to rapidly silt up. There had only been one record of this occurring until that time, during the sustained drought during the 1930s. At the Black Umfolozi River and the White Umfolozi River, join to form the Umfolozi. = Characteristics = It is a meandering river, with a catchment area of 11,068 km¬≥. Near, its mouth it is 38 metre wide, with a slope gradient of 0.36 metre per kilometre. The average diameter of the bed material is 0.35 mm (sand). = Sediment problems = The river transports carries annually 1.4 million tonnes of suspended sediment to the ocean. The government started a costly dredging operation in the estuary mouth area, but it proved ineffective. After years of dredging, the next plan was to prevent the Umfolozi River from entering the St Lucia estuary. The Umfolozi River was canalized straight out to sea at Maphelana. The impact of this decision continues; the silt plume from the river is often blown by strong south winds as far north as Sodwana Bay, 100 km away. The changes threaten the coral reefs, which provide fish habitat and protect the shore.

For the German-American socialist, see Paul Grottkau. Grodk√≥w () is a town in Brzeg County, Opole Voivodeship in Poland, the administrative seat of Gmina Grodk√≥w. It is located in the Silesian Lowlands of the Oder basin, in the historic Upper Silesia region, about south of Brzeg. In the north it has access to the A4 autostrada. The town has 8,595 inhabitants (2019). History Gothic St. Michael's Church The area was included in the emerging Polish state around 990 by its first historic ruler Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty and after the 12th-century fragmentation of the realm it was part of the Polish duchies of Silesia and Brzeg. The settlement of villa Grodcobichi in the Duchy of Silesia was first mentioned in a 1210 deed. Its name is of Polish origin and comes from the word gr√≥d, which means \\"stronghold\\" in Polish.Heinrich Adamy, Die Schlesischen Ortsnamen ihre entstechung und bedeutung, 1888, p. 10 (in German) The neighbouring settlement of Nowy Grodk√≥w (Neu Grottkau) was laid out by German settlers in the course of the Ostsiedlung, it was granted town rights modeled on ≈öroda ≈ölƒÖska in 1268 by the Silesian duke Henryk IV Probus. Defensive walls were built in 1296. Also in the 13th century the Gothic St. Michael's Church, one of the most distinctive and valuable historic landmarks of Grodk√≥w, was built. The medieval city plan was characterized by a rectangular marketplace and four streets leading to the towers of the city gates and the nearby towns of Nysa, Ziƒôbice, Wroc≈Çaw and Lewin. In 1308 it was granted staple right. Upon the 1311 partition of the Silesian duchy, Grodk√≥w fell to the Duchy of Brzeg ruled by Duke Boles≈Çaw III the Generous, who became a Bohemian vassal in 1327. In 1344 he sold the town to Bishop Przec≈Çaw of Wroc≈Çaw, who attached it to his Silesian Duchy of Nysa. Later their suzerain, the Bohemian king Wenceslaus, granted the Wroc≈Çaw bishops the title of a \\"Duke of Grodk√≥w\\", which they retained until the secularisation of the bishopric in 1810. View of Grottkau, 1819 Grodk√≥w was devastated during the Hussite Wars and again in the Thirty Years' War, after which it was rebuilt under the rule of its native son Bishop Sebastian von Rostock. With the Bohemian kingdom, the town was incorporated into the Habsburg Monarchy in 1526. After the First Silesian War of 1740‚Äì42, it was annexed by King Frederick the Great of Prussia, the Prussian garrison established after the Seven Years' War in 1763 was not disbanded until 1920. From 1815 onwards, under the Germanized name Grottkau, it was part of the Silesia Province. Its population was predominantly Catholic. The town had 4,867 inhabitants in 1939 and was a district seat (Landkreis Grottkau) until 1945. During World War II the Germans established a forced labour camp and two prisoner-of-war labour camps in the town. The town was heavily damaged during the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive of the Red Army and after the war it was finally restored to Poland. Economy Grodk√≥w city budget income sources as of 2015. Grodk√≥w is the centre for commerce, business and industry in the regional locality of Gmina Grodk√≥w. The town's gmina is largely dependent on the agricultural sector, due to the Opole Voivodeship's fertile soil, being a major factor in the town's economy alike. The town has a department for the local shopping chain \\"Wimar Bort\\", located by Henryk Sienkiewicz Street (ul. Henryka Sienkiewicza). The settlement has a major industrial complex located to its north, including: \\"Grodkono\\" waffles food production; \\"Nalewki Kresowe\\" producing the Polish alcoholic beverage nalewka, as well as a vulcanisation plant, all located by Lipowa Street (ul. Lipowa). Transport Grodk√≥w is located south of the Przylesie interchange (Wƒôze≈Ç Przylesie), connecting the Voivodeship Road 401 to the A4 motorway. The town has a railway station, with the Nysa‚ÄìGrodk√≥w‚ÄìBrzeg line crossing through the city. Climate Sports Handball club is based in the town.

It lasted from 2004 to 2009. Kimberly-Clark is the world‚Äôs largest manufacturer of tissue products, most notably the Kleenex brand. According to its annual environmental report, the company purchases over 3.1 million metric tonnes (3.4 million tons) of virgin fiber from logging companies annually. The Kleercut campaign claims that this fiber is derived from wood pulp from old growth forests. Kimberly-Clark claims that the forests in question are largely cut for timber. The Kleercut campaign claims that Kimberly-Clark support the clearcutting of such forests in Canada and the United States, including forests habitat for wolverine and threatened wildlife the woodland caribou. Kimberly-Clark has responded that many of its supplies are certified by the Sustainable Forestry Initiative or the Canadian Standards Association.  Detailed campaign goals  The campaign is asking Kimberly-Clark to: * Stop using wood fiber from endangered forests such as the Boreal forest. * Stop producing tissue products using only virgin wood fibers and instead increase the use of post-consumer recycled fiber in all of its products. * Utilize Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) eco-certified forestry operations for what virgin wood fibers it does use. Outcome The result: On August 5, 2009, Kimberly-Clark and Greenpeace held a joint press conference, where the company announced that it would source 40% of its paper fiber from recycled content or other sustainable sources ‚Äì a 71% increase from 2007 levels. The demand created by Kimberly-Clark for sustainably logged fiber was greater than the supply, enabling the company to convince logging companies to change their practices. The Kleercut website read as follows: > 5 August 2009: Kimberly-Clark releases new environmental policy. The > Kleercut campaign is over. Canada's precious Boreal Forest is better > conserved today. So are ancient forests around the world. At a joint news > conference in Washington DC, Greenpeace and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, > the world‚Äôs largest tissue-product manufacturer, announced an historic > agreement that will ensure greater protection and sustainable management of > Canada's Boreal Forest and other ancient forests around the world. The > agreement also will stand out as a model for forest-products companies > worldwide.  Grassroots efforts in the Kleercut Campaign  The Kleercut campaign was centered around a philosophy that an effective and engaged grassroots is needed for a successful campaign. The majority of grassroots activity pressuring aimed at Kimberly Clark occurred in Canada and the United States. According to Greenpeace the Kleercut campaign is \\"one of the more successful online forest campaigns in recent Canadian history,\\" gaining Greenpeace Canada \\"1,000 new [email] sign-ups each month.\\" Phil Radford of Greenpeace US oversaw the grassroots mobilization efforts on the campaign in the U.S. The campaign included sneaking into Kleenex commercial shoots, convincing twenty-two universities and colleges to take action such as cancelling contracts, recruiting 500 companies to boycott Kimberly Clark, over 1,000 protests of the company, mobilizing volunteers to put flyers in Kleenex boxes, and more. Forest Certification One of the main demands to Kimberly-Clark and other large customers of Canadian logging companies operating in ancient forests is to turn to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), a performance based forest certification program supported by local communities, environmental organizations, aboriginal groups, and industry. Kimberly-Clark currently sources the majority of its pulp (near 3 million tons) from Sustainable Forest Initiative (SFI) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) certified logging operations. Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification has been criticized as well. While the most common criticism is that FSC is overly political, for example in Australia's forest Minister Abetz said \\"a limiting feature of the FSC is the involvement of environmental organisations, particularly WWF and Greenpeace. WWF and Greenpeace formed the FSC in 1994 as a vehicle to further their political objectives and to take control of forest management and its regulation away from Governments.\\" . It has also been pointed out that: \\"The largest certified clearcut in the world is on an FSC certified forest in Ontario.\\" One organization critical of FSC is Greenwood Earth Alliance who point that FSC certified forest \\"cover large industrial-scale operations involving massive clearcutting and even-aged management\\" and that at least one FSC certified company operating in Canada \\"engage in clearcutting, high- grading, even-aged management, overlogging, and very large scale destruction of habitat through industrial logging.\\" http://www.fsc- watch.org/archives/2006/11/08/A_Critique_of_the_Tembec_Certifications__FSC_s_largest_certified_company Sources  External links  * Kleercut campaign website * Metafore Forest Certification * Kimberly-Clark response (PDF) Category:Pulp and paper industry Category:Greenpeace campaigns ","title":"Kleercut"},{"id":"2604032","text":"Knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) describes the outsourcing of core information-related business activities which are competitively important or form an integral part of a company's value chain. KPO requires advanced analytical and technical skills as well as a high degree of specialist expertise. Reasons behind KPO include an increase in specialized knowledge and expertise, additional value creation, the potential for cost reductions, and a shortage of skilled labor. Regions which are particularly prominent in knowledge process outsourcing include India, Sri Lanka, and Eastern Europe, especially Poland, Romania, and the Baltic States. KPO is a continuation of business process outsourcing, yet with rather more of business complexity. To be successful in knowledge process outsourcing, a lot of guide is required from interorganizational system.  Types  KPO services include all kinds of research and information gathering,e.g. intellectual property research for patent applications; equity research, business and market research, legal and medical services; training, consultancy, and research and development in fields such as pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; and animation and design, etc. Importance The developing rivalry has brought about shorter time to market cycles, and clients are getting to be more demanding regarding quality. This has constrained the firms to give operational proficiency and increase the value of their products and services. The customer can launch an item quicker and get to the market immediately. A company can lessen the complexities included in overseeing and constantly constructing information in an extensive pool of human resources. Businesses are constantly in search of reliable KPO service providers who have the ability to drive the best business strategy by analysing the available data and information in a specific case.  Risks and benefits  Benefits * Cost reduction * Shortage of skilled employees * Provides many graduates at very low cost * High end services are provided at a lower cost to decrease unemployment and benefit their economy * Provide flexibility in terms of HRM & time management Risks * Security- Classified information about the company can be lost * Key talent retention * The character of the employee and the quality of the work cannot be assured * KPO is time consuming and cannot provide a quick fix to the company seeking immediate results. * Lack of communication between partners due to legal, language and cultural barriers can lead to complications *Quality of Personnel and Work Cannot Be Guaranteed *Shortage of Skilled Employees *Reduction in Communication due to Language barrier *Inability to protect company's intellect property Differentiation from BPO A KPO firm requires considerably more skilled personnel than a BPO firm. Experts working in KPO keep on learning and accomplished professionals can power their aptitude to produce more income for the KPO firm. The main difference between a KPO firm and a BPO firm is that in a KPO firm, the customer is included amid the whole execution process.  Origin of the term  Ashish Gupta, ex-COO of Evalueserve and co-founder & CEO of Benori Knowledge has often been credited with coining the term. Gupta, an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, is also a Founder & Trustee of Ashoka University and Plaksha University, and serves on the boards of various companies. Published authors have credited him for coining the term in their works.  In India  India has a large number of post-graduates, PhDs and MBAs who are involved in KPO. The Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) estimated the total market size of the KPO sector in India in 2006 to be $1.5 billion. The year before, 2005, it had been $1.3 billion, with Evalueserve predicting that by 2010 it would be some $10 to $15 billion. The Indian government was predicting that by 2010 India would have 15% of the global KPO market. However, the global financial crisis, coupled with domestic economic problems such as the IPO of Reliance Power in 2009, caused people to re-evaluate these predictions, incurring worries that India's IT, BPO, and KPO sectors -- which by then, combined, were $8.4 billion in export revenues -- would be greatly affected by these factors. The worldwide KPO industry is expected to reach about US $17 billion by 2015, of which US $12 billion would be outsourced to India. Furthermore, the Indian KPO area is likewise anticipated that it will utilize more than 2, 50,000 KPO experts by 2015. =Challenges= The KPO area has considerable measure of potential development in India. India confronts various efforts by securing itself as a worldwide KPO pioneer. The real test in setting up a KPO will be to obtain skilled employees. KPO organizations include high risk and confidentiality and the greater part of the work would be outsourced from the US. The area likewise obliges larger amount of control, confidentiality and enhanced risk management. Moreover, legal language and cultural barriers can result in genuine issues. Both organizations need to appreciate each other's corporate and national societies and find common helpful approaches to create successful participation.  In the Philippines  The Philippines Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) services are often called \\"non-voice\\" or back office services, referring to activities outside contact center, customer and IT support services. In 2014, the KPO sector comprised 40 percent of the country's outsourcing industry. The Information Technology and Business Process Outsourcing Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) predicts that the Philippine outsourcing sector will reach $25 billion in revenues and employ about 1.3 million people by 2016. The KPO industry is different from the BPO in the respect of that the former is more resilient to artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. With the 4th Industrial Revolution, it is estimated that most job losses will occur in low value-added contact center (‚Äúvoice‚Äù) and other BPO services. Other services impacted by AI and automation include medical transcription, basic 2D animation services, parts of IT technical support and back-office transactionsLee Kai-Fu (2018), AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order. Advanced functions that are projected to become more in demand include analytics and optimization engines, automation enablement, clinical data analytics, remote health management, Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR)-enabled animation and supply chain optimizationIBPAP (2018), ‚ÄúThe IT-BPM Industry‚Äù. Like India's KPO industry, the Philippine KPO sector has evolved along similar lines. Starting with contact center services and low-value back office work like data entry and IT maintenance, the country is now considered an established destination for animation and design and content/publishing KPO services (Sathe and Aradhana, Sourcingmag.com). Back office and non-voice services contributed $1.1 billion in revenues to the country's outsourcing sector in 2009. Former IBPAP executive director for information research Gillian Virata said that the Philippine KPO industry is expected to reach the same market size as the voice service sector by 2015-2016. Non-voice services are already growing at a faster rate than traditional voice services. =Non-voice services= Banking and Finance Services The banking and financial services industry is leading KPO activity in the country, with global financial institutions providing underwriting, research and analytics, training and consulting, profit and loss, risk mitigation, and other BFSI-related services. KPO vendors also provide strategic research, market research, financial services research, analytics, and competitive intelligence monitoring. Legal Services Companies from the Philippines are expected to compete strongly with Indian providers of legal and paralegal services to the United States. Besides its cultural affinity with the West and excellent English proficiency of its talent pool, the Philippines used to be an American colony, and its laws are patterned after those of the U.S. Integreon is an established legal services provider in the country, specializing in discovery, contract management, compliance, legal research and knowledge management, intellectual property, and due diligence. Medical Services and Research and Development Many Chinese research and development pharmaceutical firms have set up offices in Metro Manila due to relatively lower rental and operating costs compared to traditional destinations. The country also has a pool of 250,000 nursing graduates, about half of which are expected to be employed in the healthcare services sector in 2016. Animation and Design The Philippines has established itself as a successful Animation and Design outsourcing destination. The Animation Council of the Philippines estimates that global animation industry revenues have been growing at 20 to 30 percent over the past few years, increasing demand for low-cost, highly skilled creative labor. The rise of the animation outsourcing industry in the Philippines began in the early 1980s, with FilCartoons, Burbank Animation Inc. and Asian Animation setting up operations in the country and providing animation exports to foreign companies. In 2008, the Philippines had over 50 animation companies, mostly small and medium-sized companies. Larger animation companies include TOEI Animation, Roadrunner and Toon City Animation Inc., which employs about 1,300 animators and artists (about 18 percent of the country's animation labor pool. Overall, the Philippines employed about 7,000 people in the animation sector in 2008 and generated up to US$97 million in 2006 and US$105 million in 2007.  In Eastern Europe  Although India has traditionally been a KPO destination for North American, British, and Australian companies, an increasing number of European companies are looking to Eastern Europe, especially the Baltic countries, to satisfy their KPO needs.\\"Outsourcing market in Eastern Europe heats up\\" Oct. 17, 2012. http://www.bpmwatch.com/columns/outsourcing-market- in-eastern-europe-heats-up/ See also *Outsourcing *Legal outsourcing *Recruitment  References   Further reading    Category:Business process Category:Outsourcing ","title":"Knowledge process outsourcing"},{"id":"2604040","text":"Transmit diversity is radio communication using signals that originate from two or more independent sources that have been modulated with identical information-bearing signals and that may vary in their transmission characteristics at any given instant. It can help overcome the effects of fading, outages, and circuit failures. When using diversity transmission and reception, the amount of received signal improvement depends on the independence of the fading characteristics of the signal as well as circuit outages and failures. Considering antenna diversity, in many systems additional antennas may be expensive or impractical at the remote or even at the base station. In these cases, transmit diversity can be used to provide diversity benefit at a receiver with multiple transmit antennas only. With transmit diversity, multiple antennas transmit delayed versions of a signal, creating frequency-selective fading, which is equalized at the receiver to provide diversity gain. Since transmit diversity with N antennas results in N sources of interference to other users, the interference environment will be different from conventional systems with one transmit antenna. Thus even if transmit diversity has almost the same performance as receive diversity in noise-limited environments, the performance in interference-limited environments will differ.

Khwaja Salimullah at Ramna Racecourse (now Suhrawardy Udyan), early 20th century The place is also etched in history as it was here that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman made his historic \\"This time the struggle is for our freedom\\" speech that inspired Bengalis to prepare for the freedom struggle. The original Flag of Bangladesh was also hoisted here for the second time since it was first unfurled at the University of Dhaka and the first time it was flown at such a large public gathering in Bangladesh. It was also the site of the centuries-old Ramna Kali Mandir, a Hindu temple and Dhaka landmark that was razed to the ground by the Pakistan Army on 27 March 1971 in a massacre that led to the death of over 100 people, mostly Hindus. Incidentally it became the setting for the surrender of the Pakistan Army under Lt. Gen. A. A. K. Niazi on 16 December 1971 after their defeat in the Bangladesh Liberation War to the Indian Army led by Lt. Gen. Jagjit Singh Aurora. The instrument of surrender was signed at this place and the date is celebrated by Bangladeshis as Victory Day. The place is currently maintained as an historic park with an eternal flame set up in 1996 to symbolise freedom.

Geography  Kedron is centred on Gympie Road and Kedron Brook. It is close to Westfield Chermside shopping centre in the neighbouring suburb of Chermside. Kedron is an inner-northern suburb that neighbours Stafford, Chermside, Wavell Heights, Wooloowin, Lutwyche, and Nundah. Despite the similarity in names, the Brisbane suburbs of Kedron and Upper Kedron are 15.3 kilometres apart. History Real estate map of Kedron View Estate, circa 1914 Missionaries originally settled in the Nundah area in 1838. These missionaries were granted alongside the watercourse they named Kedron Brook, after a famous valley near Jerusalem. The suburb takes its name from the brook. The first land sales commenced in 1857. Alexander and Amelia Barron settled in the area in 1856. James and Claude Barron worked as a blacksmiths on the corner of Gympie and Stafford Roads. Alfred Lutwyche, Queensland's first judge, purchased in 1862. He named his residence Kedron Lodge. This heritage-listed residence is located on the border between Kedron and Wooloowin and is now considered part of the affluent Kalinga district of Wooloowin. In 1864/1865, Henry Craig settled on land now occupied by Lutwyche Cemetery. He planted the large bunya pines along Gympie Road and lived there until his death in 1877. The cemetery was established in 1878 and was originally named Kedron Brook Cemetery. It was later renamed Lutwyche Cemetery to commemorate Alfred Lutwyche. William Shaw and family arrived in 1865 and constructed the family residence \\"Shaw Villa\\" overlooking Kedron Brook On 30 November 1866, the locality's first church, St. Andrew's Church of England, was established. When gold was discovered in Gympie in 1868, a bridge was constructed over the Kedron Brook to permit an alternative northerly route. This route would become known as Gympie Road. In 1868, the Edinburgh Castle Hotel was built by George Orr. The hotel was originally situated on the opposite side of Edinburgh Castle Road. A new brick hotel was completed in 1892. It was demolished in 1959 and yet other structure built on the site. The Kedron Park Hotel was established by Frederick Morris in 1881. In 1887, Michael Gallagher and family established the Kedron Tannery, which was very successful and became known Australia-wide. Paul Maggs and family settled in the 1860s. In 1889 he built the Edinburgh Tannery alongside Kedron Creek at the end of Nundah Street. The Kedron Park was set aside along Kedron Brook, adjacent to the Kedron Park Hotel. It once contained the Kedron Park Racecourse. In 1888 shares were offered in the Kedron Park Racecourse and Sports Ground Co Ltd. A formal race program was held in 1889 but saw little use in the following years. James Sharp purchased the racecourse in 1911 and changed many hands before it was finally closed in 1931 following a Royal Commission into racing. In 1955, Kedron Park was resumed for educational building purposes. The Kedron Park Teachers College, then Queensland University of Technology, and now Queensland State Emergency Service has occupied the site. In 1891 John and Abigail King's general store was built on Gympie Road opposite the intersection with Somerset Road. In the early 1890s, King became the first postmaster for Kedron, adopted the name Kedron for the locality. The name was not officially recognised until 1901. In 1904, Part of Kedron, Lutwyche and Wooloowin were incorporated into the Town of Windsor. In 1913, the Presbyterian Church was established and gained full church status in 1945. In 1914, the tram service was extended from Windsor to the Kedron Park Hotel. It was further extended to the Lutwyche Cemetery in 1925. In 1923, the Catholic Church was established. In 1925, the Methodist Church was established. First services were held in the Wintergarden Theatre. In September 1925, approximately 55 to 96 residential allotments of the second section of \\"Kedron View Estate\\" were advertised to be auctioned by Cameron Bros, being subdivisions of portion 87 in the Parish of Kedron. A map advertising the auction includes a locality map of the area and states the allotments were within 5 minutes' walk of the new tram terminus, with electric lights at the corner of Turner and Richmond Roads, and water mains in Richmond Road. In April 1926, approximately 75 allotments of \\"Scriven's Paddock\\" (being subdivisions 1 to 38, 43 to 70, and 75, of portion 141 in the Parish of Kedron), described as \\"parklike blocks,\\" were advertised to be auctioned by Isles, Love & Co Limited. A map advertising the auction includes a local sketch of the area and states the allotments were situated on Kitchener Road, off Main Gympie Road within 3 minutes of the Kedron Tram Terminus. In April 1928, 31 allotments of the \\"Richmond Estate\\" were advertised to be auctioned by Isles, Love, & Co Limited, being resubdivisions of portion 101 in the Parish of Kedron. A map advertising the auction includes a locality map of the area and states the allotments were within a few chains of the Kedron Tramline and close to the shopping center, schools, and churches. On 2 October 1926, the Kedron State School was established. In 1956, Padua College, Mt Alvernia College and Kedron State High School were established. Other notable pioneer families include the Scriven and Robinson families. Many households speak another language other than English, many of these include Chinese, Hindi, Italian and Vietnamese. A notable landmark is the War Memorial in Lutwyche Cemetery on Gympie Road. It contains more than 100 gravestones of servicemen, the majority of whom gave their life in World War II. St James' Anglican Church at 28 Tenth Avenue (corner of Glen Kedron Lane, ) was dedicated on 6 November 1960 by Coadjutor Bishop Horace Henry Dixon. Its closure on 14 March 1987 was approved by Assistant Bishop George Browning. On 20 March 1988 the Brisbane Cantonese Gospel Church took over the church building. It later was renamed Brisbane Cantonese Christian Church. In the , Kedron recorded a population of 8,594 people.  Amenities  The Brisbane Cantonese Christian Church is at 20 Tenth Avenue ().

In the , Windsor had a population of 7,013 people.  Geography  Windsor is located about from the Brisbane central business district. It is largely residential, featuring many old Queenslanders, although there is also considerable retail commercial activity, primarily concentrated along Lutwyche and Newmarket Roads. History Flooding in 1931 Oakwal, 2015 Land was first sold in this remote part of then New South Wales in 1854 and development was slow until the opening of the Bowen Bridge in 1860, named after the newly arrived first Governor of Queensland, Sir George Bowen, allowing easier access to the district. At that time the district was known as Breakfast Creek or Upper Breakfast Creek. Distinctive homes including Rosemount, Oakwal, The Bower, Wilston House and Eildon were built on large portions of land. In 1864, pioneer settlers approached the Queensland Government for aid to establish a local school. The Bowen Bridge Road National School consisted of a simple wooden building and headmaster's house erected on a stone foundation and opened on 17 July 1865 on Bowen Bridge Road, adjacent to Thondley's Farm. Sixteen students enrolled for the first day and by the end of the first year, 112 students were on the register. In 1915, the school transferred across the road and was renamed Windsor State School. After World War I, the original school and headmaster's house was demolished and the land developed as the Windsor Memorial Park upon which a war memorial was constructed. Swan Hill, O'Connell Town, Eildon, Albion, and Lutwyche were locality names before the appearance of the Windsor name when the shire council was formed. The Shire of Windsor was formed in 1887. It was named after Windsor Castle in England as it was Queen Victoria's golden jubilee year. In July 1895 the Council decided to erect permanent chambers and consulted Brisbane-born architect Thomas Coutts, to design a council chambers. The first meeting of the Windsor Shire Council in the new premises was conducted on 9 March 1897. The building, constructed out of Brisbane tuff from the adjacent quarry, now home of the Windsor and Districts' Historical Society, is open every Sunday and Monday from 1‚Äì4 pm. The Methodist Church opened on 13 August 1887 in a house on Nicholls Street in Swan Hill (now in Windsor) which was converted into a Sunday School and chapel. On 18 August 1889 a new church was opened on Swan Terrace. During the 1893 Brisbane flood, Swan Hill was badly flooded and many people took refuge in the church. After the flood, it was decided to relocate the church to higher ground to the present day location in Newmarket Road with the church re-opening there on 23 November 1902. When the Methodist Church amalgamated with the Presbyterian and Congregation Churches to form the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, the church became known as Windsor Uniting Church. In 1904, Windsor Shire Council became the Windsor Town Council. It contained the suburbs of Lutwyche, Wilston, Albion, Swan Hill, Eildon, O'Connell Town, The Grange (now simply Grange) and Wooloowin and portions of Kedron, Newmarket, and Eagle Junction. In 1925, Windsor Town was amalgamated with 19 other shires and towns to form Greater Brisbane and former Windsor Town mayor, William Jolly became Mayor, and in the second term‚ÄîLord Mayor of Greater Brisbane. On 18 August 1925 Archbishop Duhig purchased a property called Grafton Lodge on Bowen Bridge Road (now Roblane Street) for ¬£1,750. Initially services were held in one of the houses on the property. On 1 August 1926 Monsignor James Byrne laid the foundation stone for a building to contain a church and a school. On 10 October 1926 Duhig blessed and opened the building, naming it Holy Rosary (and not St Anthony's as had been previously announced). The building was two storeys with the church above being with the school below being . The architect was James Cavanagh and the builder Denis Cleary. Wilson Ophthalmic Hostel School opened on 28 January 1929. Operated by the Queensland Government at Tenth Street (near Fifth Avenue, approx ). it was a boarding facility where children from outside of Brisbane could be housed and schooled while being treated for opthalmia at the Royal Children's Hospital at Herston. In 1953 it was renamed Wilson Hospital School and its role expanded to children requiring treatment for a range of other conditions. It closed in 1958 as the children could then be accommodated at the hospital itself. Holy Rosary Catholic School opened on 28 January 1929 and was operated by the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. 120 students attended on the opening day. The Windsor Presbyterian Church opened and dedicated on 14 April 1934 by Reverend John Sinclair, Moderator of the Brisbane Presbytery. The church was in King Street (but this was renamed Maygar Street in 1938). On 19 April 1959 a foundation stone for a new extension was laid commemorating 25 years of service. Windsor Infants State School opened on 1 November 1934. It closed on 1971. St Peter's Anglican Mission Hall on the corner of Lutwyche Road and Fuller Street (approx ) was dedicated on 15 December 1935 by Coadjutor Bishop Horace Henry Dixon. It was needed to cope with the growth of the congregation at St Andrew's Anglican Church at Lutwyche. The building was a house converted to provide a chapel and a Sunday School with the intention to erect a purpose- built church at a later stage. On 12 April 1953 by Archbishop Reginald Halse opened a new Sunday school building. St Peter's Anglican Mission Hall closed on 15 March 1987 with the approval of Assistant Bishop George Browning. On Sunday 13 September 1953 Archbishop Duhig laid the foundation stone for a new Holy Rosary Catholic Church costing ¬£40,000. When the new church was completed, the school would expand into the old church. On 22 August 1954 Archibishop Duhig consecrated the new brick church in the presence of a crowd of 2000 people, many of whom listened from outside the church via loud speaker. Wilson Youth Hospital was established in June 1961 at Tenth Street following a refurbishment of the Wilson Hospital School () to create a more secure facility with a focus on detention. In 1983 it was renamed The Sir Leslie Wilson Youth Centre. In 1993 it was renamed the Sir Leslie Wilson Youth Detention Centre. It was operated by the Queensland Government and housed children who were breaking the law, \\"troubled\\" children as well as orphans, although the role of the centre changed over time.

Craigslea is a former name for parts of Chermside West.  Geography  It is located approximately north of the Brisbane central business district. History The name Chermside honours Queensland Governor, Sir Herbert Chermside. In 1864 Edgar Huxtable surveyed the site of the future Chermside area. These surveys marked the final takeover from the Aboriginal owners by establishing legal title to the land. From then on, specific sections of land with specific boundaries belonged to specific persons who bought them from the Queensland Government, replacing the Aboriginal system through which the clan or tribe had a right of occupancy of a section of land. The Aboriginal belonged to the land but, under the European system, the land belonged to the new owners and they had a document to prove it. The bush was cleared, small farms began to appear with the new settlers living in slab huts with bark roofs and surrounded by bush timber fences. The village of Downfall Creek, or Dead Man‚Äôs Gully, grew along the north road, which became Gympie Road, giving access south to the Brisbane market, north to the frontier land and, after 1867, to the Gympie gold field. Not all the land was bought by settlers, as speculators also bought land as an investment to be resold at a profit as the area developed. By 1880 the name Downfall Creek was in use as shown by the Cobb & Co Timetable of that year. In 1903 the name was officially changed to Chermside and the Downfall Creek State School, No. 929, was renamed Chermside State School, No. 929, and the change was approved by the Post Office. West Chermside By the early 1950s the character of West Chermside was beginning to change. The small farm sector was fading, as economies of scale began to drive industries like dairying and poultry farming towards larger production requiring bigger land holdings . However, there was a problem. The Brisbane City Council Town Plan which divided the city into nine zones, involved the development of separate satellite towns and suburbs separated from the main city and each other by continuous open spaces called green belts; these were to be part parkland and part farming areas all zoned as rural. The postwar reconstruction of roads and infrastructure, along with the huge housing boom and the lack of planners, meant that the growth of the city outstripped the development of the plan and it became more of a dream as the future unfolded. In 1956 William Basnett, a dairy farmer of West Chermside, challenged the Council in the Land Court and won the right to subdivide his property into building blocks instead of being part of the proposed Green Belt. This case played a part in ending the Green Belt plan and opened the way to develop his property; others soon followed. Since the new suburb grew out of the small farms and bush that covered most of the area it enabled the Council and developers to make it a completely planned modern suburb depending on the motor car for transport, as automobiles were becoming commonplace by the late 1950s. The Telegraph, Saturday 14 June 1969, reported that the settlement was referred to as Nappy Valley by many people till a more elegant name was chosen; West Chermside was gazetted in 1975. But the colloquial name aptly described not only the new arrivals but also the new area with its modern houses, shopping centre and churches. The writer commented, ‚ÄúIt is not a suburb of corner stores and scattered shops, but has a compact drivein shopping centre offering most of the facilities needed ‚Äì this type of shopping is ideal for the predominance of young families who live in the area.‚ÄùO‚ÄôShea, Patrick (2010), ‚ÄúHistory of Chermside and District‚Äù, (http://www.chermsidedistrict.org.au/chermsidedistrict/01_cms/details.asp?ID=193 ).

Agricultural Education is the teaching of agriculture, natural resources, and land management. At higher levels, agricultural education is primarily undertaken to prepare students for employment in the agricultural sector. Classes taught in an agricultural education curriculum may include horticulture, land management, turf grass management, agricultural science, small animal care, machine and shop classes, health and nutrition, livestock management, and biology. Agricultural education is common at the primary, secondary (including middle and high school in the United States), tertiary (including vocational schools and universities), and adult levels. Elementary agriculture is often taught in both public and private schools, and can cover such subjects as how plants and animals grow and how soil is farmed and conserved. Vocational agriculture trains people for jobs in such areas as production, marketing, and conservation. College agriculture involves training of people to teach or conduct research in order to advance the fields of agriculture and food science. General education informs the public about food and agriculture. Disciplines closely tied to agricultural education include agricultural communications, agricultural leadership, and extension education.  In the United States  The chief sources of agriculture education in the United States are high schools, community colleges, four-year colleges and universities, youth organizations, and the 10x15 program. =History= The rapid growth of agricultural education began during the late 19th century. In 1862, the United States Congress created the Department of Agriculture to gather and distribute agricultural information. The Morrill Act, which provided the land-grant schools, became law that same year. The Hatch Act of 1887 gave federal funds to establish agricultural experiment stations. The first dairy school in the U.S. was created at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1891. * Government support for agricultural education has increased during the 20th century. For example, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created what is now the Cooperative Extension System (1988). The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 and the George-Barden Act of 1946 financed high-school instruction in farming. Woodlawn High School (Woodlawn, Virginia) was the first public high school in the United States to offer agricultural education classes under the Smith-Hughes Act.Worrell, A. (2009, January) Woodlawn School Tabbed for Historical Marker. The Carroll News. Retrieved from http://www.thecarrollnews.com/view/full_story/5528284/article-Woodlawn-School- tabbed-for-historical-marker . The Vocational Education Act of 1963 funded training in other fields of agriculture. * Agricultural science and education expanded after 1900 in response to a need for more technical knowledge and skill in the use of newly-developed agricultural technologies. This development led to the use of modern farming methods that required fewer farmworkers, resulting in larger, corporatized farms and ranches. This development increased the need for more agriculture science and education. Other legislation influenced the development of agricultural education into what the field is today. It has developed throughout the last century from various laws and pieces of legislation. The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 required all public schools to provide a free and appropriate education to all students with disabilities. Under this provision, children with disabilities were now allowed to enroll in agricultural classes. The Americans with Disabilities Act, enacted in 1990, further required public schools to give students with disabilities equal opportunity for education to all other children in the country, and as a result, it increased opportunities for students with disabilities participate in agricultural classes. Educate America Act of 1994 raised benchmark standards for public education at the districts level, increasing curriculum and development requirements for all classes, including agricultural ones. The School-to-Work Opportunities Act, also of 1994, required teachers to teach students tasks and disciplines that would help their students prepare for employment once they graduated, of which practical education in agriculture was a major part. Finally, No Child Left Behind (Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2001) further raised standards for students in public schools and increased requirements of teachers in order to reach these standards, affecting agricultural education as part of the general curriculum of many schools. =Elementary school= In 2006, Walton Rural Life Center in Walton, Kansas was the first public elementary school in the United States to base its curriculum around agriculture.U. S. Department of Education (2011-01-19). \\"Using Agriculture to Spur Achievement - The Walton 21st Century Rural Life Center.\\" Online video. Youtube.com. Retrieved 2016-04-24. Integrating agricultural components into the classroom is one of the challenges that elementary teachers face. They are also expected to teach with outdated teaching substances. John Block, who was a previous Secretary of Agriculture for the United States, encouraged agricultural competence. Agriculture in the Classroom was one of Block‚Äôs achievements to stress agricultural literacy in 1981. Agriculture in the Classroom soon became utilized in each state. Though Agriculture in the Classroom was the beginning of agriculture education in all fifty states, elementary instruction began in some schools possibly before the 1900s. After elementary agriculture education began to grow, twenty-one states began to require it by 1915. The required curriculum was evenly split between urban and rural schools. The states that required agricultural education at the elementary level were all midwestern states or southern states; both of which are rich in agriculture. =High schools= Agricultural education at the high school level focuses on three main categories: classroom instruction, supervised agricultural experience (SAE), and active involvement in the National FFA Organization (Future Farmers of America). Classroom instruction of an agricultural class teaches the students the basic concepts of the particular course through hands on learning and experience. Students will be taught the information in the curriculum in order for them to understand and develop skills in the application and problem solving issues that would occur in an agricultural setting. The Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) portion of the agricultural curriculum is when a student must use the knowledge they have gained in the classroom instruction and use it in real life situations. Several topic choices are available for the student to choose between, whether it is on a farm setting, exploratory setting, entrepreneurship, agribusiness, or research projects. The student will choose a task from one of these topic areas and conduct a research experiment throughout the course of the agricultural class. The teacher is involved in the process and will help guide the student along the way. SAE programs give students the opportunity to take the information learned in the classroom setting and use it on an agricultural topic that interests them. This portion of an agricultural education will give students an idea of how it is working out in the real world and solving problems that will arise in the work field. The FFA is a national organization that all agricultural classes at the high school level are involved in. The agricultural teacher is the leader of that particular schools FFA chapter, and will guide students‚Äô activities and programs held throughout the year. FFA is an educational program designed to teach students leadership skills in both agricultural settings and everyday life, encourages personal growth in students, boosts self-confidence, builds character, encourage healthy lifestyles, and give students opportunities to be a part of the agricultural economy. FFA chapters will volunteer in communities, conduct banquets for FFA members and their families, raise awareness of agriculture, compete in FFA competitions, and attend national FFA conventions. In some states, the agriculture teacher leads a local Young Farmers Association in monthly meetings. The group may comprise local farmers, citizens, and anyone interested in learning about agriculture and new farming methods. The Young Farmers Association is designed to aid the adoption of agricultural technologies, and it gives agriculture teachers the opportunity to meet local citizens and reach out to the community. =Colleges and universities= College of Agriculture at the University of Florida Land- grant universities awarded more than three-quarters of all agricultural degrees in 1988. These state schools receive federal aid under legislation that followed the Morrill Act of 1862, which granted public lands to support agricultural or mechanical education. Land-grant universities have three chief functions: teaching, research, and outreach, or extension.  Teaching  A bachelor's degree in agricultural education generally leads to employment teaching agriculture up to the high school level or in the agricultural sector. Students are required to complete agriculture classes as well as education classes in order to become qualified to teach. A master's degree is required in order to teach at the college level. The Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE), the largest national education association dedicated to the advancement of education that prepares youth and adults for careers, provides resources for agricultural education. An agricultural education degree also gives the qualifications to do extension work for universities and agricultural companies and organizations. The following universities provide pathways to complete certification requirements of their home states in secondary agricultural education: * Alcorn State University * Angelo State University - Texas * Auburn University * Cornell University * Colorado State University, Degree Requirements * Illinois State University, Degree Requirements * Louisiana State University * Delaware Valley University * Michigan State University, * Middle Tennessee State University * Montana State University * North Carolina State University * North Dakota State University * Oregon State University * The Pennsylvania State University, Degree Requirements * South Dakota State University, Degree Requirements * The University of Idaho * Sam Houston State University - Texas * Sul Ross State University - Texas * Texas A & M - Kingsville * Texas A & M - Commerce * Texas A&M; University * Texas State University * Texas Tech University * Tarleton State University -Texas * University of Arkansas * University of Missouri, Degree Requirements * Utah State University * Washington State University * West Virginia University * West Texas A & M - Texas Colleges of agriculture additionally prepare students for careers in all aspects of the food and agricultural system. Some career choices include food science, veterinary science, farming, ranching, teaching, marketing, agricultural communication, management, and social services. Colleges and universities awarded about 21,000 bachelor's degrees in agriculture per year in 1988, and about 6,000 master's or doctor's degrees.  Research  Each land-grant university has an agricultural experiment station equipped with laboratories and experimental farms. There, agricultural scientists work to develop better farming methods, solve the special problems of local farmers, and provide new technology. Research published in scholarly journals about agricultural safety is available from the NIOSH-supported National Agricultural Safety Database. The American Dairy Science Association provides research and education scholarships focused on the dairy farm and processing industries. Extension service The Cooperative Extension System is a partnership of the federal, state, and county governments. This service distributes information gathered by the land-grant universities and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to farmers, families, and young people. County extension agents, located in most countries (1988), train and support about 3 million (1988) volunteer leaders. Agents and volunteers carry out extension programs through meetings, workshops, newsletters, radio, television, and visits. =Related Organizations= Professional organizations in the United States related to agricultural education include the American Association for Agricultural Education (AAAE), the Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE), the National Association of Agricultural Educators (NAAE), and The National Council for Agricultural Education (The Council). 4H Club is considered a youth development program that teaches children about sciences, leadership, research, etc. 4H club has over 6 million members nationwide and is the largest youth development organization in the United States. 4H members use hands on learning to reach goals and help in communities. Members of 4-H carry out group and individual projects dealing with conservation, food and agriculture, health and safety, and other subjects. The 4-H program in the United States is part of the Cooperative Extension service. Somewhat similarly, the FFA is a national organization that teaches students leadership skills and is designed to help members become more well rounded citizens in the agricultural field. The FFA is an integral part of the program of agricultural education in many high schools as a result of Public Law 740 in 1950 (Currently revised as Public Law 105-225 of the 105th Congress of the United States), with 649,355 FFA members (2016-2017). Local chapters participate in Career Development Events (individually and as a team), each student has a Supervised Agricultural Experience program (SAE), and participates in many conferences and conventions to develop leadership, citizenship, patriotism and excellence in agriculture. The National FFA Organization is structured from the local chapter up, including local districts, areas, regions, state associations, and the national level. The FFA Mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through agricultural education. Outside the US Hurlstone Agricultural High School in Australia maintains a dairy with 42 head of cattle. The history of agricultural education predates USA activities and derives from, the development of Scottish, Italian and German colleges. The land grant approach of the USA owes much to the Scottish system in particular. Changes in higher agricultural education around the world today are highlighting implicit approaches that have hampered development and exceptional advances that have fed the world. the process has been described in one text (below) which takes a global perspective. Agricultural education in other countries resembles that in the United States. Canada has its own 4-H program. Agriculture Canada distributes information on new farming methods and maintains experimental farms, research stations, and research institutions throughout the country. BC Agriculture in the Classroom Foundation operates in the province of British Columbia. In Australia, each state has several agricultural research stations and an extension service. Great Britain has a program of youth clubs called Young Farmer's Clubs that resemble 4-H. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations works to train people throughout the world in modern farming methods. The United States gives technical assistance to farmers in developing nations through its Agency for International Development (AID). = Australia = Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School As of February 2015 Agriculture in Australia employs over 235,300 people in the agriculture, fishing and forestry and fishing industry. This industry alone equates to 12% share of the GDP earning close to $155 billion a year. The farmers own a combined 135,997 farms covering approximately 61% of the land mass. Given these figures the agricultural programs in place in school and universities in very important to the future of the county. Several high schools operate across the country specifying in agriculture education. Predominantly these high schools are set in the rural areas with access to land. On the majority of cases the students often travel 1000 km to attend schools, taking up residence at the schools as boarders for the school term. The one of the biggest in Australia is Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School in central New South Wales. The Agriculture in Education programme launched by the Australian government in 2015 helps teachers better understand the products and processes associated with food and fibre production and gives students an opportunity to understand the importance of agriculture in the Australian economy. Topics covered by the materials include: designing and making a financial plan for a market garden, free range chicken farming, food security, and sustainable production practices in food and fibre., The Hon Christopher Pyne MP > New resources to boost student learning in agriculture Monday 18 May 2015 Media Release .

Western Australian is in a precarious position and faces several challenges, fact that agriculture in Australia is affected by an ongoing shortage of labour and of skills. Labour supply is being adversely affected by an ageing workforce, retirements by baby boomers, seasonal nature of the lower skilled workforce and an inability to attract sufficient young people to work in the industry.REVIEW OF POST-SECONDARY AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA Presented to Hon Dr Elizabeth Constable MLA Minister for Education; Tourism by Hon Hendy Cowan21 April 2010.  10x15 Long Range Goal for Agricultural Education in America  \\"By 2015 there will be in operation 10,000 quality agricultural science education programs serving students through an integrated model of classroom/laboratory instruction, experiential learning, and leadership and personal skill development. Further, all students will be members of the FFA and have a supervised agricultural experience that supports classroom and laboratory instruction.' ., Lincoln, Nebraska 2009 American Association for Agricultural Education NORTH CENTRAL REGION CONFERENCE A Philosophical Examination of the Agricultural Education Model and Transformational Leadership for Secondary Agricultural Education Proceedings Monday, September 28, 2009 .-Team Ag Ed The Case for Growth and Quality in Agricultural Education Of the critical issues facing the nation, few are more compelling than improving the academic performance of public schools and ensuring a stable, safe and affordable food supply. Today agricultural education is positioned to contribute substantially in these arenas through a major national initiative. Under the direction of The National Council for Agricultural Education, the \\"10x15 Long Range Goal for Agricultural Education\\" employs a comprehensive strategy engaging eight high-priority initiatives. The focus of the unprecedented effort is twofold: create new programs in communities not yet served by agricultural education and FFA, and ensure the quality and high performance of current programs providing personal, academic and career education in agriculture. While the goal of \\"10x15\\" is to grow the number of agricultural education programs from 7,200 to 10,000 by the year 2015, the clear emphasis is on quality. Several factors make this effort timely and essential. First, the public's expectations for higher student achievement are leading to dramatic increases in accountability, standards, rigor and relevance throughout education. Especially critical is the need to raise math and science proficiency. Second, the industry of agriculture, already concerned about meeting growing domestic and global demands for food and fiber, is eager to identify the future managers, leaders and workers who will ensure the future security and productivity of agriculture. A forecasted shortage of well-educated workers is adding urgency to the issue. Also, concerns about food safety, security and independence are registering at the highest levels of agribusiness and government. Lastly, local communities are intent on cultivating leadership and securing effective participation from their citizens. Through the intra-curricular programs of agricultural education and the FFA, a half-million students are developing skills in leadership, communication, team building and civic engagement. They will be prepared to provide for the social, economic and cultural well-being of small communities and large urban centers alike. The work of \\"10x15\\" is concentrated in eight national task forces operating over the next several years. Their scope of work includes national program and content standards; teacher recruitment and preparation; alternative program design; data reporting; public advocacy; brand communication strategy; and program funding. Driving the work of \\"10x15\\" are more than a hundred top leaders drawn from today's Team Ag Ed, including teachers, students, university educators, state education leaders, the National FFA Organization, alumni, business and industry, and key stakeholders  Agricultural educators  * Otto Frederick Hunziker, Purdue University * John Wrightson, Downton Agricultural College * Raymond A.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a small town near the Snowy Mountains north- west of Cooma, New South Wales, Australia, in the Snowy Monaro Regional Council. The historic town, of 301 people at the , is a trout fishing centre and winter sports destination situated at above sea level. Economic life is built around tourism and agriculture‚Äìthe town serves as a service point for Selwyn Snowfields and the Northern Skifields. It is also a popular destination for horse riders, bushwalkers, fly-fishermen and water sports enthusiasts as well as a base for viewing aspects of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Adaminaby is one of the highest towns in Australia, with regular snowfalls that are occasionally heavy during winter. The historic Bolaro Station and scenic Yaouk Valley are located near the township and Charlie McKeahnie, said to be the inspiration for The Man From Snowy River, a poem by Banjo Paterson, lived and died in the district. Later, Nobel winning author Patrick White wrote about the town. The construction of nearby Lake Eucumbene made it necessary to re- locate the original township of (Old) Adaminaby in 1957. In times of drought, the original township and relics of the old valley re-emerge from under the waters of the lake. The present township is located on the Snowy Mountains Highway and is known as the \\"Home of The Big Trout\\" and the location of the Snowy Scheme Museum. History =Aboriginal history= The Snowy Mountains region was an important gathering point for the Aborigines of the Adaminaby and surrounding districts for many thousands of years, with intertribal summer meetings being held in the High Country involving up to a thousand people for feasting on the Bogong Moth. This practice continued until around 1865.http://www.kiandrahistory.net/indigenous.html =Stockmen, gold diggers, poets and skiers= Agriculture led to the early development of Adaminaby as a township and the Kiandra goldrush and subsequent history of skiing in the Northern Snowy Mountains opened up new opportunities for economic development. A number of noted Australian writers have found inspiration in the Adaminaby district. Man From Snowy River Country Charlie McKeahnie's grave at Old Adaminaby cemetery. McKeahnie, an Adaminaby stockman, is said to have been the inspiration for the famous bush ballad The Man From Snowy River by Banjo Patterson. Europeans penetrated the district from the late 1820s and Adaminaby first began to develop as an agricultural centre from the 1830s, with sheep and cattle becoming an economic mainstay.http://members.ozemail.com.au/~adminaby/admtsm/moving.htm Some historians believe that Banjo Paterson's most famous poem, \\"The Man From Snowy River\\", may have been inspired by the exploits of an Adaminaby stockman, Charlie McKeahnie.http://www.boake.net/display.html McKeahnie died in a riding accident in 1895 and is now buried in the Old Adaminaby Cemetery on the shores of Lake Eucumbene. Paterson's character, the Man From Snowy River, is most likely a composite character, based on various people involved in brumby hunts such as were conducted in the Adaminaby district. Paterson was not the only Australian writer to find inspiration at Adaminaby ‚Äì the poet Barcroft Boake also wrote about McKeahnie's ride in \\"On the Range\\",http://www.boake.net/range.html in which McKeahnie chases down a well- bred horse which had escaped with a brumby mob of wild horses; while Nobel Prize winning author Patrick White worked as a jackaroo at Adaminaby's Bolaro Station in the 1930s. His subsequent and critically acclaimed first novel, Happy Valley was inspired by his time working at Adaminaby and the people he knew in the town. It won White the 1941 Australian Society of Literature's gold medal. Goldrush and skiing in northern skifields Start of championship \\"snow shoe\\" races at Kiandra in 1900. Adaminaby is the main service town for the Northern NSW skifields, where skiing in Australia began in the 1860s The fortunes of the town were affected by the discovery of gold at nearby Kiandra in 1859 and subsequent introduction of recreational skiing to the district around 1861, when Scandinavian gold prospectors are reputed to have strapped fence posts to their boots and slid down the snowbound hills of a landscape too frozen for mining. For around a century, Kiandra remained Australia's highest township and a base for skiers, before the last permanent residents left the township following completion of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Kiandra's ski facilities were permanently shifted \\"up the hill\\" to Selwyn Snowfields in 1978 and Adaminaby remains the main service centre for the Northern skifields of New South Wales‚Äìone of the oldest areas for recreational skiing in the world.http://www.selwynsnow.com.au/templates/sel/page/page_html_standard.php?secID=69 Early graziers used the high country wilderness above Adaminaby as summer pastureland. The area was set aside as a National Chase in 1906 and later became the Kosciuszko National Park. Today the area is renowned for its historic huts and access to unique wilderness areas, including the Mount Jagungal Wilderness Area. =Snowy Mountains Scheme= The creation of Lake Eucumbene made it necessary to re-locate the original town of Adaminaby. Relocation of the original township The most momentous episode in the town's history, came with the construction of the vast network of tunnels and dams of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme, which began at Adaminaby in 1949. A lake nine times the volume of Sydney Harbour eventually flooded the valley in which the original townsite lay. A prolonged drought saw the ruins of the old township begin to resurface in April 2007, attracting the attention of global media ‚Äì and even comparisons to the mythical city of Atlantis.http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2007/06/08/1943592.htm Official launch of the Snowy Mountains Scheme at Adaminaby in 1949. From the left, Prime Minister, Ben Chifley; Governor-General of Australia, William McKell and Minister for Works and Housing, Nelson Lemmon. Lake Eucumbene swallowed the original township of Adaminaby, but has become a tourist drawcard for the district. The remarkable story of Adaminaby's relocation was the subject of film produced by the Snowy Mountains Authority Film Unit in 1958, entitled \\"Operation Adaminaby\\" (to see clips click here). It was also the subject of a 2001 documentary by historian Jeannine Baker, entitled \\"Our Drowned Town\\", which screened on SBS Television. Entire houses, and even the Commercial Bank Building were transported on the back of trucks and over 100 buildings were re-erected at the new townsite. Transportation of the first house from Old Adaminaby to New Adaminaby (a distance of just six miles) took six days.http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/snowy-hydro-adaminaby/clip1/ Today a tourist village has been built around the handful of buildings which were not relocated from the newly created lakeshore at Old Adaminaby. The current town served as a construction hub during the building of the Snowy Scheme. The distinctive 1950s architecture of the buildings in the main street, defined by cost and engineering requirements of the time, is similar to the main street of Tallangatta, Victoria, which was reconstructed around the same time and for similar purposes. A Snowy Mountains Scheme Museum is planned to be constructed in the town. Adaminaby is today a good base from which to view different aspects of the Snowy Scheme, including nearby Lake Eucumbene, Tantangara Dam, Tumut 2 Power Station and Cabramurra, Australia's highest town. In September 2007, Adaminaby recognised the 50th anniversary of its move to the new town site. The weekend of remembrance and celebration recognised the physical and emotional trauma exacted by the relocation. =Development of Tourism= The Big Trout, Adaminaby's tribute to the fishing in Lake Eucumbene The completion of the Snowy Mountains Scheme saw the economic life of the district settle around agriculture and tourism as major sources of income. A number of tourist villages and camping grounds have been established around Lake Eucumbene near Adaminaby, including Anglers Reach and Providence Portal. Old Adaminaby has developed as a tourist village above the site of the old township at Lake Eucumbene, and retains a handful of the original buildings of the township. The Snowgoose Hotel and Snowy Mountains Motel became longstanding providers of accommodation for skiers and fishermen visiting Adminaby, while farmstay resorts and lakeside cottages and caravan parks have been developed to take advantage of the natural environment surrounding Adaminaby. A bowling club and associated golf course and public swimming pool also service locals and tourists. The development of Kosciusko National Park limited agricultural activities and development in the high country above Adaminaby, but preserved large wilderness areas for the protection of wildlife and enjoyment of tourists. The decline of historic Kiandra and the development of Selwyn Snowfields ensured a place for Adaminaby as a ski-hire and accommodation centre. Relics of Australian pioneer history can be found throughout the Adaminaby high country district ‚Äì including a number of mountain huts and the ghost township of Kiandra ‚Äì initially neglected by the National Parks and Wildlife Service but more recently the subject of extensive restoration and heritage work. Home of the Big Trout The Snowy Scheme Museum was opened by the Governor General in 2011. The town is a popular base from which to fish on Lake Eucumbene and surrounding rivers and the town centre features a large sculpture of a trout, standing high. Commonly known as the Big Trout, it was one of the earliest of Australia's Big Things and in May 2006, the lake Eucumbene Chamber of Commerce adopted the tourist attraction as a marketing and promotional 'brand'. The Big Trout was built by Andy Lomnici and was restored and repainted by Skins Alive in January 2007, with funding from the former Snowy River Shire Council. Snowy Scheme Museum The Snowy Scheme Museum located at Adaminaby tells the story of the construction of the Snowy Mountains Hydro Electric Scheme and what life was like on the Scheme. The collection consists of significant examples of the machines and materials used to build the Scheme. Exhibits concentrate on the stories of the Snowy workers and their impact on Australia, especially on modern Australia's migration program. The Museum collection was gathered by enthusiasts over a ten-year period and the Museum was officially opened to the public by Governor General Quentin Bryce on 17 October 2011. Governor General Bryce told those in attendance: \\"\\"It is bringing this powerful component of Australia's history into a museum, for people to come and learn the history of the Snowy, for it to be passed down to generations\\".http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-17/snowy- scheme-museum-opens/3574192 Climate =Rainfall= The Bureau of Meteorology does not host any representative temperature data for the regions surrounding Adaminaby; but, fortunately, precipitation records are found. These records (1969‚Äì2019, taken from Yaouk) show precipitation peaking in August. Jointly with the region's elevation and greater exposure to westerly winds than the rest of the Monaro, snowfall likely comprises a notable quantity of June‚ÄìAugust precipitation. This winter to spring peak closely resembles that of Cabramurra. It is of prominent note that Cooma receives the opposite precipitation pattern; its driest month is August, as opposed to its peak. Such a disparity in precipitation patterns‚Äîdespite relatively short distances‚Äîdemonstrates the local geographical influence(s) sharply dividing the microclimates in the region.

Promos are normally sent directly to broadcasters, such as music radio and television stations, and to tastemakers, such as DJs and music journalists, in advance of the release of commercial editions, in the hope that airplay, reviews, and other forms of exposure will result and stimulate the public's interest in the commercial release. Promos are often distributed in plain packaging, without the text or artwork that appears on the commercial version. Typically a promo is marked with some variation of the following text: \\"Licensed for promotional use only. Sale is prohibited.\\" It may also state that the promo is still the property of the distributor and is to be \\"returned upon demand.\\" However, it is not illegal to sell promotional recordings,...at least not in the U.S., where the UMG v. Augusto case clarified in 2011 that promos are gifts, not the property of the distributor, and that the first-sale doctrine entitles the recipient to dispose of the recording as they wish. and recalls of promos are extremely rare and unenforced.That is, at least in the U.S., the recipient of a promo has no obligation to comply with a recall, unless a separate contract is in effect. Because promos are produced in smaller quantity than releases made available to the general public, they are sometimes considered valuable collectors' items. They are never intended for sale in record stores.  Promotional single  A promotional single is a single that is made available to radio stations, nightclubs, music publications, and other media outlets by a record label to promote a commercial single or album. A song may be released as a promotional single even if no commercial version of the single is available to buy. The promo single is usually recognized by its limited liner notes and cover artwork as well as its unique catalog number (or the occasional lack thereof). Quite often, vinyl records will be issued in a generic cardboard jacket or white paper sleeve while CDs will be issued in a slimline jewel case or cardboard sleeve. There may also be promotion-specific terms stamped on the disc or its cover, most notably \\"For Promotional Use Only\\" and \\"Not For Resale\\". The advance promo single is furnished to DJs sometimes weeks or months in advance of a domestic release to give record labels an opportunity to build interest in the single and gauge response to the single. Unlike a finished promo single, these are commonly test pressings or white labels and thus are manufactured in limited runs. Traditionally, these promotional copies were supplied to DJs through music pools. Despite the good intention, there has been some dispute within the industry whether an advanced promotion is a good thing or not. Building interest is naturally a good thing, but it may have the opposite effect when interested persons are unable to find a new song in the record stores for quite some time. Buzz singles and advance singles In music, a buzz single or advance single is a track or promotional song, released by the label (typically) preceding the album's release. The song(s) are released in order to bring attention to an album's release. Buzz singles are not typically issued to radio as promotional singles, due to the fact that they are only intended to attract minor attention compared to a regular single.  Acetates and test pressings  On rare occasions a special type of demonstration record known as an acetate disc has been distributed to radio stations as a promo. Instead of being mass- produced these records are cut one at a time in the recording studio from a master tape source. They were generally made in very low quantity with hand- written labels. The soft acetate surface of these discs can be played no more than about 10 times before they start to wear out. Another type of rare item which has occasionally been used as a promo is a \\"test pressing\\" or white label. These are the first disc copies pressed at the factory. They are used to check manufacturing quality before mass production begins.  Countdown to album release programs  iTunes and other markets distribute songs for a price on a pre-set schedule; such as one a week in a 'Countdown' to the parent album's release. These pre-sales of album tracks are often called 'promotional singles' by many.  Distribution  = Radio outlets = Promotional recordings are distributed to commercial AM and FM radio stations for airplay. These singles typically feature just the radio edit of the song, but may also include alternate remix edits, the original album version, or even call-out hooks = Nightclub outlets = When it comes to electronic dance music, 12-inch records and CDs still remain the more popular media by which promotional recordings may be distributed to DJs in the nightclub industry. These singles typically feature one or more extended remixes (sometimes dubbed a \\"club mix\\") of the title track that are not generally available to the public as well as the original extended version, which in many cases is itself club-friendly. In some cases, the disc may have anonymous track labeling or lack labels altogether. Often the corresponding CD may also carry radio edits and other alternate cuts that did not make it onto the 12-inch record itself, in which case the CD is referred to as a maxi-single CD. Promotional recordings may also include digital recordings in MP3, MP4, or Windows Media Audio formats to discourage illegal copying and enable effective recall when the promotional period has expired. It is not unusual for a promo single to have no commercially available counterpart particularly in those genres that are predominantly oriented to nightclub applications. = Promotional compilations = Many companies currently offer promotional compilations to DJs, radio use and nightclubs alike. The format is growing on the CD format, but some companies still offer promotional compilations in vinyl also. Most of the compilations are genre-specific (like most of CD Pools' compilations) but there are also compilations that offer a combination of different genres (like compilations from DMC and Music Factory). Such compilations are normally released monthly. In addition to companies that work internationally, there are also many companies that offer national promotions material in the form of compilations. Versions in the compilation are usually either radio edits or extended / 12\\" remixes of the song, depending a bit on the targeted audience. Club scene music is usually in the longer and easier to play format of extended remix, whereas more street targeted music is usually released as radio edits. It normally takes a couple of weeks after the release of the original promo single to be available on promotional compilations. This has the added benefit of having the songs when they're already had some airtime and are thus not the bleeding edge no-one has heard from, but still have usually not been released to the mass markets yet. Some of the internationally established companies are CD Pool and DMC. Many fledgling companies are also available offering both well-known and lesser known releases. = Online promotional distribution = Since the advent of broad-bandwidth Internet access and professional tools such as iPool or Haulix, the online promotional distribution of music has been established. Record companies make their music available as audio files and use the Internet as a distribution channel. In contrast to the conventional way of distributing promotional recordings, this kind of promotional distribution is faster and cheaper.

These are the 4th in Victoria, the 5th in New South Wales, the 9th in South Australia and Tasmania, the 11th in Queensland, the 13th in Western Australia, and the 8th spread across the country. The division is also responsible for the security of Australia's northern borders through its Regional Force Surveillance Units. The division was first formed in Egypt in July 1915 during World War I as part of the First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF). The division took part in the Gallipoli campaign, arriving in the latter stages and then traversed to the Western Front in France and Belgium where it had the distinction of taking part in the final ground action fought by Australian troops in the war. After the war ended and the AIF was demobilised, the 2nd Division name was revived and assigned to a Citizens Military Forces (reserve) unit in 1921. During the inter-war years, the division was based in New South Wales with its headquarters Parramatta. During World War II, the 2nd Division undertook defensive duties on the east coast until mid-1942 when it was sent to Western Australia. In May 1944, the division was disbanded as the war situation no longer required large numbers of garrison troops to be held back in Australia. Post war, the division was re-raised in 1948, and except for a period from 1960 to 1965, the division has existed in one form or another since then. World War I =Gallipoli, 1915= The Australian 2nd Division was formed from reinforcements training in Egypt on 26 July 1915 as part of the Australian Imperial Force, which has been raised to fight in World War I. The division was formed from three brigades - the 5th, 6th and 7th - that had been raised independently in Australia (in February and April 1915), and sent to Egypt (in May and June 1915) for further training. Initially, it was intended that the division's commander would be James McCay, but he was wounded on 11 July, and repatriated back to Australia after the death of both his wife and father. As a result, the command of the division went to Lieutenant-General Gordon Legge. Due to the pressing need for more soldiers for the Gallipoli Campaign, parts of the 2nd Division was sent to Anzac Cove in mid-August 1915, despite the fact that the division was only partially trained. There, they reinforced the 1st Division and the New Zealand and Australian Division. The rest of the division arrived by early September. The 2nd Division held a quiet stretch of the original line (as a majority of the fighting was taking place north of ANZAC Cove), and only a part of the division (the 18th Battalion) saw serious fighting during around Hill 60 on 22 August. The 2nd Division was evacuated from the peninsula in December, returning to Egypt, where it completed its training and formation while the 1st Division was split and used to raise two new divisions (the 4th and 5th) as the AIF was expanded prior to its departure to Europe to fight on the Western Front. A pioneer battalion, designated the 2nd Pioneer Battalion, was added to the division at this time. =Somme, 1916= The 2nd Division started to arrive in France in March 1916. In April, it was sent (as part of the I Anzac Corps with the Australian 1st Division) to a quiet sector south of Armenti√®res to acclimatise to the Western Front conditions. In mid-July, with the British offensive on the Somme dragging on, I Anzac Corps was sent to join the British Reserve Army of Lieutenant General Hubert Gough who intended to use the Australian divisions to take the village of Pozi√®res. Due to the casualties sustained by the Australian 1st Division's attack at Pozi√®res on 23 July, it was replaced by the 2nd Division on 27 July. Continuing the effort started by the 1st Division, the 2nd Division attacked on 29 July. However, due to the hurried preparation, the troops forming up for the attack were detected and the supporting artillery proved inadequate, leaving large segments of wire in front of the German position intact. The division sustained approximately 3,500 casualties for little gain. 7th Brigade fatigue party passing the \\"Gibraltar\\" bunker, Pozi√®res, August 1916. After several days of disrupted preparations, the 2nd Division attacked again in the evening of 4 August, capturing the OG2 trench line and part of the crest. Alarmed by the loss of the defences (including the crest), the Germans initiated a counter-attack the following day, which the Australians repulsed. This was followed by a severe, sustained artillery bombardment that inflicted heavy casualties. The position of the Australian salient meant that the soldiers received artillery fire from the front, flank and rear ‚Äì including from German batteries near Thiepval. After 12 days on the front line and sustaining 6,846 casualties, the 2nd Division was relieved by the Australian 4th Division on 6 August. After a brief rest, the 2nd Division again relieved the Australian 1st Division from its position beyond Pozi√®res (in front of Mouquet Farm) on 22 August (the Battle of Mouquet Farm). Attacking on 26 August, the 2nd Division succeeded in penetrating past the fortifications at Mouquet Farm only to be attacked from the rear as troops from the German Guards Reserve Corps emerged from the fortified underground positions at Mouquet Farm. These counterattacks succeeded in forcing the 2nd Division back from Mouquet Farm. After sustaining another 1,268 casualties, the 2nd Division was relieved by the Australian 4th Division on 26 August. Remnants of the 6th Brigade returning from Pozi√®res, August 1916. On 5 September, I Anzac was withdrawn from the Somme and sent to Ypres for rest. The division anticipated spending winter in Flanders. Throughout early October, the division undertook a number of minor raids in the sector, but in the middle of the month it was relieved by the British 21st Division and was recalled to the Somme for the final stages of the British offensive. This time they joined the British Fourth Army, holding a sector south of Pozi√®res near the village of Flers. Despite heavy mud, the Australians were required to mount a number of attacks around Gueudecourt, with a brigade from the 2nd Division and a brigade from the 1st Division. On 5 November, the 7th Brigade attacking the German series of trenches called \\"The Maze\\". While part of the German trenches were captured and held, the exhausted soldiers were ejected from their gains a few days later. Two battalions of the 7th Brigade, along with two battalions from the 5th, attacked again on 14 November, but they were only partially successful in capturing parts of the \\"Gird\\" and \\"Gird Support\\" trenches immediately to the north of \\"The Maze\\". However, a German counterattack on 16 November succeeded in recapturing all of the trenches captured by the 2nd Division, which had sustained 1,720 casualties in the two attacks. =German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line, 1917= In January 1917, Legge fell ill and was replaced by Major-General Nevill Maskelyne Smyth VC who had formerly commanded the Australian 1st Brigade since during the Gallipoli Campaign. Legge returned to Australia to take up the post of Inspector General. However, until Smyth was available, the division was temporarily commanded by the 6th Brigade commander, Brigadier- General John Gellibrand. During this period, the division took part in the operations on the Ancre, participating in the capture of Thilloys. The 2nd Division was relieved by the Australian 5th Division; however, by late February (during the German withdrawal to the prepared fortifications in the Hindenburg Line), elements of the 2nd Division were active in engaging the German rearguard as it fell back to the first fortified reserve position known to the British as the Loupart-Le Transloy Line, or the R.I. Stellung by the Germans. The Germans had decided to temporarily hold the R.I. position, which was centred on the village of Bapaume, so on 25 February, the 5th and 6th Brigades mounted an unsuccessful attack on the \\"Malt\\" trench ‚Äì an outpost in front of the R.I. position. Continual small attacks were conducted on the Malt Trench through 26 and 27 February, with a larger attack attempted on the 27th and 28th by the 7th Brigade. However, as the wire defences were undamaged, little headway could be made. It was not until 2 March, when a combined attack was put in with the 5th and 7th Brigades, and after sustained artillery fire had cut paths through the wire, that the 7th Brigade captured portions of Malt trench. This brought the 2nd Division close enough to be able to attack the R.I. position. As the 2nd Division was preparing to attack the R.I. position in front of Loupart Wood (the attack was planned to commence on 13 March), it was discovered on 12 March, that the Germans had already withdrawn to the second reserve position R.II. Stellung centred on the crest of the ridge beyond Bapaume. R.II. was evacuated by the Germans on 17 March, as they withdrew to the Hindenburg Line. Starting on 17 March 1917, the 2nd Division was reorganised to pursue the German withdrawal, with the 6th Brigade chosen to lead the pursuit. On 20 March, the 6th Brigade attempted a hasty attack on the fortified village of Noreuil, which was beaten back with over 300 casualties. However, the next attack on the fortified village of Lagnicourt on 26 March was successful, with the German counter-attack on the same day defeated by the Australians. Soon after, the 2nd Division was relieved by Australian 4th Division. This formation conducted a second attack on the fortified village of Noreuil, which was captured on 2 April. With the capture of Noreuil (Louverval and Doignies were also taken by the Australian 5th Division on 2 April), the I Anzac Corps was within striking distance of the main Hindenburg defences. 2nd Division troops in Bapaume, March 1917 =Hindenburg Line, 1917= The 2nd Division was in support during the First Battle of Bullecourt, which was the Fifth Army's main contribution to the Arras offensive. Once the first attempt on Bullecourt had failed, the 2nd Division relieved the Australian 4th Division from in front of Bullecourt (a front of approximately on 13 April. As such, when the Germans launched a counter-stroke on 15 April in front of the village of Lagnicourt (the Battle of Lagnicourt), part of it fell on the 17th Battalion (which was holding the right flank of the 2nd Division), with the remainder falling on the 1st Division. The attack was strongest along the divisional boundary between the 1st and 2nd Divisions, and as a result the Germans managed to penetrate between the 17th Battalion and the neighbouring 12th Battalion and capture the village of Lagnicourt. Counterattacks by the 5th Brigade (2nd Division) and 3rd Brigade (1st Division) managed to drive off the attacking Germans, and re- establish the original front line. During this battle, the 2nd Division experienced 305 casualties (of the 1,010 casualties experienced by the I Anzac Corps). On 3 May, the Second Battle of Bullecourt commenced with the 2nd Division ‚Äì committing the 5th and 6th Brigades ‚Äì attacking the two trench lines east of Bullecourt. The 5th Brigade made little progress, but the 6th Brigade seized parts of both trench lines. Heavy counter attacks then fell against the 6th Brigade. In order to secure the 6th Brigade's left flank, the 7th Brigade, as the divisional reserve attacked. The 6th Brigade held its position against numerous counterattacks, until relieved by elements of the 1st Division on 4 May. As they were withdrawn, a fourth counter-attack fell on the area, at which point the 6th rejoined the battle, helping to blunt this assault before finally departing. Further attacks were conducted on 4 May and 6 May by brigades of the Australian 1st Division that were attached to the 2nd Division, supported by elements of the 2nd Division, resulted in the capture of most of the first line of trenches. After repulsing a total of six German counterattacks, the 5th Division arrived on 8/9 May, continuing the fighting until 17 May. For its part, the fighting around Bullecourt had cost the 2nd Division 3,898 casualties. =Third Battle of Ypres, 1917= The 2nd Division was then sent to rest areas in the Somme region for reorganisation and training. The 2nd Division's artillery was in action from the start of the Third Battle of Ypres on 22 July 1917, supporting the British 24th Division, but the infantry were not called upon until the second phase of the battle commenced on 20 September with the Battle of Menin Road. Attacking along an front with ten other divisions, including the Australian 1st Division on their right and the 9th (Scottish) Division on their left, the 2nd Division advanced an average of , with the 5th Brigade on the left, and the 7th on the right. The division sustained 2,259 casualties, and was relieved on 22 September by the Australian 4th Division, which then continued the offensive in the next the Battle of Polygon Wood. Relieving the British 3rd Infantry Division between 29 September and 1 October, the 2nd Division's task in the Battle of Broodseinde was to advance , and to capture one of the ridgelines which dominated the Ypres Salient. On 4 October, as the division was forming up for its attack, a heavy German bombardment fell on their assembly area, causing heavy casualties. A German attack then started at almost the same time as the Australian attack, resulting in the two attacking forces engaging each other in no-man's land. After gaining the upper hand, the 2nd Division captured all of its objectives, sustaining 2,174 casualties. This battle marked the peak of British success during 3rd Ypres, and with rain starting to fall on 3 October, was the last successful action of the battle. With the rain becoming heavier, the conditions on the ground deteriorated. When the next attack (the Battle of Poelcappelle) started on 9 October the ground became difficult to traverse, resulting in difficulty bringing artillery and ammunition forward, and the troops becoming exhausted moving up to their starting positions prior to the start of the attack The 2nd Division's role was for the left brigade to advance to protect the flank of the 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division. With the 6th and 7th Brigades heavily understrength (just 600 and 800 men each), and supported by a weak artillery barrage, the advance quickly stalled, and resulted in only small gains at a cost of 1,253 casualties. As a result of the exhaustion of the troops, the 2nd Division was relieved for the final effort around Passchendaele on 12 October. The 2nd Division relieved the Australian 5th Division on 27 October, and continued to hold the line along the Broodseinde Ridge, conducting patrols into no man's land, until all of the Australian divisions (grouped into an all Australian Corps from November 1917) were transferred south to Flanders, centred on the town of Messines, where they spent the winter. During this period, the 2nd Division occupied the front around Ploegsteert, in the southern part of the Australian line, during December 1917 ‚Äì January 1918, and then again in March ‚Äì April 1918. On 3 April, the division was relieved by the British 25th Division. =German Spring Offensive, 1918= On 21 March, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive, focused on the Somme. As the offensive, began to threaten the vital rail hub of Amiens, the Australians were hurriedly brought south to help restore the British line in the Somme. Upon reaching the Somme on 4 April, the leading brigade (the 5th) was detached to relieve the troops around Villers- Bretonneux, while the rest of the division (under the command of the British Third Army) relieved the Australian 4th Division, which had just fought the First and Second Battles of Dernancourt. The detached 5th Brigade (under the command of the British Fourth Army) was initially put into a reserve line (the \\"Aubigny Line\\") under the 14th Division, before it was sent to support (and later relieve) the 18th Division south of Villers-Bretonneux. After the 5th Brigade had relieved the 18th Division on 5 April, it was decided that the 5th would recapture the lost parts of Hangard wood, and so reduce a salient that threatened the southern flank of the Australian forces at Villers-Bretonneux. The attack by two battalions ‚Äì the 19th and 20th ‚Äì was conducted on 7 April, and while it succeeded in clearing Hangard Wood (at a cost of 151 casualties), the position that the attacking troops were expected to fortify was poorly sited, and as a result the attacking troops retreated to their starting positions. Another attack was planned, this time in conjunction with the French First Army, with the objective of eliminating the entire salient south of Villers-Bretonneux. However, when the next stage of German offensive (the Battle of Lys) started on 9 April, it drew off the British forces required to mount the attack. In addition, German attacks on 7 and 12 April had captured of the village of Hangard, and led to the abandonment of the Allied attack. However, it was decided that a small local attack would be mounted on 15 April, with the intention of capturing the cemetery and a copse north of Hangard village. One battalion ‚Äì the 18th ‚Äì from the 5th Brigade was to capture the copse, while the French secured the cemetery. In the end, the failure of the French attack ultimately undermined the Australian position in the copse, which eventually fell to German counterattacks (with a total of 84 casualties). The 5th Brigade returned to the Australian Corps on 19 April. =Peaceful penetration operations, 1918= 3rd Medium Trench Mortar Battery in action, Ville-sur-Ancre 29 May 1918 As the Spring Offensive ground to a halt, the 2nd Division was relieved by the 47th Division on 2 May, and became the reserve division for the Australian Corps. After resting, the division relieved the Australian 3rd Division opposite Morlancourt on 11 May, and continued the peaceful penetration operations that had been started by the 3rd Division during the Second Battle of Morlancourt. On 19 May, elements of the division (mostly from 6th Brigade) attacked the Germans on either side of the village of Ville-sur-Ancre (an advance of approximately ). Despite coming up against fresh troops who were anticipating the attack, the Australians succeeded in capturing the village, albeit at cost of 418 casualties. Against this, the Germans suffered 800 casualties, as well as 330 prisoners and 45 machine guns. On 22 May, Major General Charles Rosenthal, who had previously commanded the 9th Brigade, replaced Smyth as the 2nd Division commander. On 10 June, the 7th Brigade conducted an attack over a frontage between Morlancourt and Sailly-Laurette during the Third Battle of Morlancourt, and succeeded in advancing an average depth of , with approximately 350 casualties and the capture of 325 Germans, 30 machineguns and six trench mortars. This attack revealed the ease in which a well-planned attack could be conducted, and also revealed that there was no major offensive planned on the Amiens front. As a result of the advances by the Australian Corps in front of Morlancourt, the southern flank was exposed to artillery fire from near the village of Hamel. In response to this and to provide support for a French attack south of Villers-Bretonneux, it was decided to attack the German salient and capture the village of Hamel as well as the Hamel and Vaire Woods. In preparation, the 2nd Division relieved the Australian 3rd Division on 28/29 June. The Australian divisions were heavily depleted, so it was decided that the upcoming Battle of Hamel would involve units from three Australian divisions (the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Australian Divisions), with the 2nd Division temporarily placing its left brigade (the 6th) under the command of the 4th Division for the attack. The 25th Battalion, detached from the 7th Brigade, also assisted. The attack at Hamel, conducted on 4 July, was a complete success, with the battle completed in only 93 minutes. The 2nd Division troops temporarily attached to the Australian 4th Division suffered only 246 casualties (out of a total of 1,380 Australian and American casualties). The total German casualties for the battle were approximately 2,000, of which approximately 1,600 were captured), and included 177 machineguns and 32 trench mortars. Hamel and the surrounding wood burning following the initial bombardment on 4 July 1918 The division continued peaceful penetration operations on its front and by 11 July had advanced its front line by approximately . This aided a planned offensive whose objective was to capture more of the Villers- Bretonneux plateau. The continued peaceful penetrations on the northern flank of the salient below Villers-Bretonneux caused the Germans to withdraw by , leaving only outposts and sentries behind to deceive the Allies that the front was still being held. This withdrawal meant that the Australians were able to capture Monument Farm and parts of Monument Wood. The 26th Battalion also secured a German tank (\\"Mephisto\\"), which had been disabled on 24 April. The withdrawal also meant that the planned offensive was now superseded, as peaceful penetration had already achieved the objectives. Further patrols were conducted; this time with the objective of advancing the Australian 7th Brigade's front by , and capturing the remainder of Monument Wood and \\"The Mound\\" (spoil from a nearby railway cutting). However, this would then expose the southern flank of the division. To counter this, Rosenthal approached the French commanders with a deal: the Australians would capture the ground, which would then be defended by French units. As the Germans were now starting to dig stronger fortifications, peaceful penetration was becoming more difficult to conduct. As a result, a small-scale attack was carried out on 17 July by only two battalions ‚Äì the 25th and 26th ‚Äì advancing the line by with 129 casualties, and inflicting at least 303 German casualties. Due to their vulnerable southern flank, no further advances were possible until the French forces south of the 2nd Division advanced. French patrols on 18 July advanced their line, but it remained a mile behind the neighbouring 2nd Division. The peaceful penetration conducted over the previous two weeks had pushed the line forward by an average of over a frontage of , at a cost of 437 casualties, and had achieved all of the objectives set down for the offensive that was to occur after the Battle of Hamel. Between 26 July and 5 August, elements of the US 65th Infantry Brigade (from the 33rd Division) were assigned to the Australian Corps. Of these troops, two battalions of the US 129th Infantry Regiment were assigned to the 2nd Division, joining it around Villers- Bretonneux. One US company was allocated to each Australian battalion, and as some of the battalions were extremely under strength (for example, the front line strength of the 24th Battalion was only 193 men), it meant that there were equal numbers of Australians and Americans in the front line. =Hundred Days, 1918= In August, the Allies launched their own (the start of the offensive, which ultimately ended the war. On 8 August, the 2nd Division commenced the Battle of Amiens, attacking (with the Australian 3rd Division) from its position near Villers-Bretonneux. The 2nd Division reached its objective (the \\"Green Line\\") between 6:25 and 7 am, and started to dig in. The second wave of Australian troops (the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions) moved through the 2nd and 3rd Divisions at 8:20 am, and continued on to the \\"Red Line\\". The soldiers of the 2nd Division held their positions (one brigade in the original front line, the other two brigades on the \\"Green Line\\"), digging in until released at 11:15 to rejoin the attack. On 9‚Äì11 August, as part of the advance from Harbonnieres towards Lihons, the division continued its attack. Relieving the 5th Division, which had carried the first phase, the 5th and 7th Brigades, reinforced by the 2nd Brigade (from the 1st Division), carried the advance in the second phase. Over the course of several days, Vauvillers, Framerville and Rainecourt were captured at a cost of 1,295 casualties or the division. The attacks post 9 August were hastily planned, with limited knowledge of the tactical situation, and lacked co-ordination between neighbouring units and supporting artillery. While supporting tanks made up for some of this, their use was hampered by opposing artillery, resulting in a subsequent increase in casualties. Between 16 and 18 August, another peaceful penetration operation was carried out by the 6th Brigade (then the only unit of the 2nd Division on the front line) around Herleville, culminating in an attack on 18 August to the edge of Herleville itself. By this stage the 6th Brigade had been heavily depleted ‚Äì particularly from gas shelling around Villers-Bretonneux ‚Äì to the extent that the 22nd Battalion's four companies were each at platoon strength; nevertheless, it attacked over a large frontage of , losing a further 117 men. The 2nd Division was relieved on 19 August by the 32nd British Division. After a short rest, the 2nd Division relieved the 1st Division on 26 August. As the Battle of Arras was to be the main effort of the British Expeditionary Force, General Henry Rawlinson (4th Army commander) ordered the Australians to maintain contact with the Germans while not being too aggressive. Nevertheless, the 2nd Division kept advancing along the south bank of the Somme River capturing various villages such as Herb√©court, Flaucourt, Barleux and ‚Äì despite a stiff defence ‚Äì Biaches. With German morale declining, the division was ordered to advance towards P√©ronne and Mont St. Quentin, with the intention of capturing Mont St. Quentin. The latter dominated the surrounding terrain, and was heavily fortified. Capture of Mont Saint Quentin painting by Fred Leist (1920) The initial plan for the Battle of Mont St. Quentin was for the 2nd Division, along with the Australian 3rd and the British 32nd Divisions, to attack to the east, and cross the Somme River near P√©ronne, before the 2nd Division continued on to take Mont St. Quentin. However, it was discovered that the defences along the river were too strong, and so the 2nd Division's front was taken over by the Australian 5th Division. The 2nd Division then moved north behind the Australian 3rd Division (which was to take Cl√©ry and continue east to protect the 2nd Division's flank), approaching Mont St. Quentin on the northern side of the Somme River, before attacking Mont St. Quentin from the west. The offensive succeeded, with the Australian 5th Brigade (consisting of 1,340 men, supported by five brigades of field artillery, and four brigades of heavy artillery) securing Mont St. Quentin on the morning of 31 August, and capturing over 700 German prisoners. The 5th Brigade was then subjected to several counterattacks. Eventually, in the afternoon of the 31st one of these succeeded in recapturing the crest, although the Australians managed to hold on to a position just below the summit. The effort to take the Mont was later described by Rawlinson as \\"a magnificent performance...\\". Mont St. Quentin was attacked a second time in the morning of 1 September, this time by the Australian 6th Brigade, with its right flank protected by the Australian 14th Brigade (5th Division) capturing part of P√©ronne. Attacking against troops of the German 38th Division), the 6th Brigade succeeded in capturing Mont St. Quentin. The attack continued on 2 September, with the 7th Brigade attacking east from Mont St. Quentin, extending the Allied lines beyond the high ground while elements of the 5th Division took the remaining part of P√©ronne. By 4 September, the 2nd Division was relieved by the 3rd Division for the pursuit beyond Peronne. It subsequently began a rest period that lasted until late September. On 23 September, the 19th, 21st and 25th Battalions were ordered to disband to make up the strength of the other battalions in their brigades, as the division moved towards the nine battalion structure used by the British. The decision proved unpopular with the troops, who wished to maintain their battalion identities, and the soldiers refused to obey the order to disband. As a result, the units remained in existence until October, after the Australians had fought their final battles of the war. By early October, Allied forces had succeeded in capturing the main Hindenburg defences in the first part of the Battle of St. Quentin Canal, and the supporting defences; however, this left the third line of defences, the \\"Beaurevoir Line\\". Relieving the Australian 5th Division on 1 October, the 2nd Division's was to attack, along with the Australian 1st Division and the American 27th and 30th Divisions, and breach the Beaurevoir Line, opening a gap for the cavalry to exploit. Aftermath of the fighting at Montbrehain, the final action of the war for the Australians The 2nd Division attacked the Beaurevoir Line on 3 October, with two brigades (the 5th and 7th) totalling 2,500 men on an frontage of . Starting out from Estrees, the objectives called for a advance. Attacking before sunrise, the soldiers managed to capture the fortified positions at the la Motte Farm and Mushroom Quarry (at a cost of 989 casualties), but were stopped short of their final objective: the village of Beaurevoir. Continuing the attack on 4 October, the 2nd Division approached the village of Beaurevoir, and conducted further attacks the next day to capture Montbrehain. After much hard fighting by two battalions of the 6th Brigade (reinforced by the 2nd Pioneer Battalion, which attacked as infantry) (against the German 241st (Saxon), 24th and the 34th Divisions), the village was captured, along with nearly 400 German prisoners. This drove a mile long salient into the German lines, and was described by Charles Bean as \\"one of the most brilliant actions of Australian infantry in the First World War\\". However, this action cost the Australians an additional 430 casualties. The 2nd Division was relieved by the US 30th Division on the evening of 5 October, with the intention of allowing it to rest until the start of the campaigning season in 1919; however, as the Armistice was signed in November 1918, the 2nd Division was the last Australian division to see combat in World War I. With the end of the war, Australian forces were not involved in occupation duties, and were quickly disbanded, and the soldiers transported back to Australia. As a result, the 2nd Division merged with the Australian 5th Division in March 1919 (as a single division of four brigades). Throughout the war, the division lost over 12,000 killed in action or died of wounds or other causes, and nearly 38,000 wounded, while 13 members of the division received the Victoria Cross. Inter-war years and World War II On 1 April 1921, the AIF was officially disbanded. After this, Australia's part-time military forces were re-organised to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF. As a result , the division was reformed as a Citizens Military Forces/Militia (reserve) formation, consisting of the 5th, 9th and 14th Brigades, each of four infantry battalions: 4th, 20th, 36th, and 54th (5th Brigade); 1st, 19th, 34th, and 45th (9th Brigade); and 3rd, 53rd, 55th and 56th (14th Brigade). Defence spending was limited during this time, and while initially it was planned to maintain a strong Reserve element through compulsory training, this scheme was only partially implemented in the 1920s, and was suspended following the Great Depression. Defence spending remained low throughout the 1930s, and voluntary recruitment proved inadequate. As a result, the inter-war years were characterised by limited equipment and reduced manning levels. During World War II, the division was composed primarily of infantry units from New South Wales and its headquarters was based initially in Sydney, around Parramatta. When the war broke out in September 1939, the 2nd Division was commanded by Major General Iven Mackay. Soldiers of the CMF 56th Battalion, part of the 14th Brigade, in 1937 In 1940, the division's component brigades were reduced from four battalions to three, and units undertook short period of training to improve readiness as the division was partially mobilised. As the Militia was barred from overseas service, many members left the division to join the Second Australian Imperial Force. In July 1940, Major General James Cannan assumed command of the division until October when he handed over to Major General Herbert Lloyd. Following Japan's entry into the war, the Militia was called up for home defence. At this time, the division's main role was the defence of Sydney; however, after training around Bathurst, Walgrove and Greta, the division's brigades relieved those of the 1st Division in defence of Newcastle, so that those units could undertake collective training. This lasted until March 1942. In May 1942, the 14th Brigade (3rd, 36th, and 55th Battalions) was transferred to New Guinea Force, where they joined the garrison around Port Moresby. Initially assigned to II Corps, in July, the 2nd Division was transferred to III Corps, for the defence of Western Australia, relieving the 4th Division around Guildford, Western Australia. The 5th Brigade (54th, 56th and 44th Battalions, the latter being a Western Australian unit) and 8th Brigade (4th, 30th and 35th Battalions) were joined by the 13th Brigade (the 11th, 16th, and 28th Battalions, all from Western Australia). As the Allies assumed the offensive in the Pacific, the threat to Australia diminished, allowing for a reduction in garrison forces. Subsequently, the division prepared for active service in the Australian territory of New Guinea. In early 1943, the 13th Brigade was detached, and the 2nd Brigade became part of the division until August 1943, when it was sent to Darwin. Following this, the 8th Brigade was transferred to Sydney and then north Queensland, eventually joining the 5th Division in September 1943, for service in New Guinea. The 3rd Motor Brigade joined the division. In early 1944, the 5th Brigade was sent to Queensland and in May of that year the 2nd Division was disbanded. The division's final commander was Major General Horace Robertson who commanded the division from September 1943. Post-war An 8th Brigade soldier during Exercise Southern Jackaroo in 2016 In 1948, the Citizen Military Forces were re-formed, firstly by voluntary enlistment but then by a mixture of voluntary and compulsory national service from 1951 to 1957, and then 1965 to 1972, when national service was abolished. The 2nd Division was formed again as the main CMF formation in New South Wales, initially consisting of the 5th, 7th and 8th Brigades, although in 1953 it was reorganised and consisted of the 5th, 8th and 14th Brigades. In 1960, the division was disbanded with the advent of the Pentropic organisation scheme that was based around the five element battle group. The division was revived in 1965 when the Pentropic organisation was abandoned. Upon being re-raised, the division consisted of two brigade-level formations: the 5th and 8th Task Forces; these reverted to brigade-designations in 1982. In the 1990s, following the disbandment of the 3rd Division, the 2nd Division became the main Army Reserve formation, assuming command of several other brigade-level elements. The 7th Brigade transferred its Reserve personnel to the division (mainly to the 11th Brigade) in 2011 as that brigade became a completely Regular formation of Forces Command. In September 2014, the division received the three Regional Force Surveillance Units from the 6th Brigade, and as of late 2014, the division included over 11,000 Reservists. In January 2015, Major General Stephen Porter took over command of the division. Under the Army's Plan Beersheba reforms, the 4th and 9th Brigades were paired with the regular 1st Brigade; 5th and 8th Brigades with the regular 7th Brigade; and the 11th and 13th Brigades with the regular 3rd Brigade, tasked with providing a battle group to each Regular manoeuvre brigade during the ready phase of the force generation cycle: Battle Groups Cannan (11th and 13th Brigades), Jacka (4th and 9th Brigades) and Waratah (5th and 8th Brigades). On 24 July 2015, members of the 2nd Division marked 100 years of service with a national parade at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. In 2017‚Äì2018, the 8th Brigade became responsible for the management of training delivered to Reserve soldiers within the 2nd Division. During the period since 2011, the division has deployed forces and provided individual troops to deployments to the Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, Afghanistan, and South Sudan as well as supporting ongoing border protection operations. Memorial The original 2nd Division memorial Positioned at Mont St Quentin (), where the Australian 2nd Division captured one of the most formidable defensive positions on the Western Front, the 2nd Division's memorial was unconventional. Instead of an obelisk such as at the other four AIF divisional memorials, the original memorial which was unveiled in 1925 was a statue of an Australian soldier bayoneting a German eagle sprawled at his feet. However, this statue was removed and destroyed by German soldiers in 1940 during World War II, leaving only the stone plinth. A replacement statue, consisting of an Australian soldier standing in full kit was installed in 1971. The memorial lists the battle honours of the 2nd Division as: Pozieres, Mouquet Farm, Flers, Malt Trench, Lagnicourt, Bullecourt, Menin Road, Broodseinde Ridge, Passchendaele, Ville-sur-Ancre, Morlancourt, Hamel, Villers-Bretonneux, Herleville, Herb√©court, Biaches, Mont St. Quentin, Beaurevoir Line, and Montbrehain.

Cover illustration by Thomas Theodor Heine for the magazine Simplicissimus in 1910 Simplicissimus () was a satirical German weekly magazine started by Albert Langen in April 1896 and published until 1967, with a hiatus from 1944‚Äì1954. It became a biweekly in 1964.Harvard University Library Catalog, Hollis number 006013229. It took its name from the protagonist of Grimmelshausen's 1668 novel Der Abenteuerliche Simplicissimus Teutsch. The headquarters were in Munich. Combining brash and politically daring content, with a bright, immediate, and surprisingly modern graphic style, Simplicissimus published the work of writers such as Thomas Mann and Rainer Maria Rilke. Its most reliable targets for caricature were stiff Prussian military figures, and rigid German social and class distinctions as seen from the more relaxed, liberal atmosphere of Munich. Contributors included Hermann Hesse, Gustav Meyrink, Fanny zu Reventlow, Jakob Wassermann, Frank Wedekind, Heinrich Kley, Alfred Kubin, Otto N√ºckel, Robert Walser, Heinrich Zille, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Heinrich Mann, Lessie Sachs, and Erich K√§stner. Although the magazine's satirical nature was largely indulged by the German government, an 1898 cover mocking Kaiser Wilhelm's pilgrimage to Palestine resulted in the issue being confiscated. Langen, the publisher, spent five years' exile in Switzerland and was fined 30,000 German gold marks. A six-month prison sentence was given to the cartoonist Heine, and seven months to the writer Frank Wedekind. All the defendants were charged with \\"insulting a royal majesty\\". With the abdication of the German emperor and the German princes following World War I, the law became invalid (the paragraph incorrectly referred to in the article did not penalize the insult of the German head of state, but the defamation of organs and representatives of foreign states; it was abolished in 2017). Again in 1906 the editor Ludwig Thoma was imprisoned for six months for attacking the clergy. These controversies only served to increase circulation, which peaked at about 85,000 copies. Upon Germany's entry into World War I, the weekly dulled its satirical tone, began supporting the war effort and considered closing down. Thereafter, the strongest political satire expressed in graphics became the province of artists George Grosz and K√§the Kollwitz (who were both contributors) and John Heartfield. The editor Ludwig Thoma joined the army in a medical unit in 1917, and lost his taste for satire, denouncing his previous work at the magazine, calling it immature and deplorable. During the Weimar era the magazine continued to publish and took a strong stand against extremists on the left and on the right. As the National Socialists gradually came to power, they issued verbal accusations, attacks, threats and personal intimidation against the artists and writers of Simplicissimus, but they did not ban it. The editor Thomas Theodor Heine, a Jew, was forced to resign and went into exile. Other members of the team, including Karl Arnold, Olaf Gulbransson, Edward Th√∂ny, Erich Schilling and Wilhelm Schulz remained and toed the Nazi party line, for which they were rewarded by the Nazis.Klaus Mann: Der Simplicissimus. In: Das Neue Tagebuch, V. Jahrgang 1937, p. 214 (in German) It continued publishing, in declining form, until finally ceasing publication in 1944. It was revived from 1954‚Äì1967. Other graphic artists associated with the magazine included Bruno Paul, Josef Benedikt Engl, Rudolf Wilke, Ferdinand von Reznicek, Joseph Sattler, and Jeanne Mammen.

It is owned by Anacostia Rail Holdings. The 106-mile (171 km) line was purchased from Conrail in March 1994. Previously, it was owned by Penn Central, and before that, the Pennsylvania Railroad. It serves the cities of Franklin, Sellersburg, Seymour and Columbus, Indiana, and also serves the former Clark Maritime Center, now Port of Indiana, Jeffersonville. In Louisville, the LIRC interchanges with the Paducah and Louisville Railway, CSX Transportation and the Indiana Rail Road, former Canadian Pacific Railway (via trackage rights over CSX's former Monon line). Traffic from them mostly is potash. In Indianapolis, the line interchanges with INRD at Senate Avenue Terminal. Louisville & Indiana train entering Louisville, KY via the Louisville and Indiana Railroad bridge (Fourteenth Street Bridge) The LIRC was briefly home to the Amtrak passenger train Kentucky Cardinal, a failed attempt to capture express business from the United Parcel Service air hub in Louisville. Inconvenient departure and arrival times, coupled with jointed track which limited speeds to 30 mph (48 km/h), led to the train's demise in 2003. The former express facility is now run by A&R; Transport, which is a plastics transload facility. Plastics make up the majority of the online business with the railroad. CSX negotiated trackage rights over portions of the LIRC in 2004. This enabled CSX to abandon a portion of former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad trackage from New Albany, Indiana to Jeffersonville, and access the remainder of the line to Charlestown, Indiana and the former Indiana Ammunition Plant using LIRC trackage over its Ohio River bridge. Additionally, CSX has used rights over the LIRC as far north as Seymour, where it connects with another former B&O; line (now the CSX Indiana Subdivision at Seymour) from Cincinnati, Ohio to St. Louis, Missouri. These trains have been used to bypass the congested CSX LCL Subdivision between Cincinnati and Louisville. The line's power includes GP39-2, GP38-2, and SD40-3's.

Nasr, Islamic Philosophy from its Origin to the Present: Philosophy in the Land of Prophecy (2006), SUNY Press, passim. Overview The expression al-hikmat al-muta‚ÄôƒÅliyah comprises two terms: al-hikmat (meaning literally, wisdom; and technically, philosophy, and by contextual extension theosophy) and muta‚ÄôƒÅliyah (meaning exalted or transcendent). This school of Mulla Sadra in Islamic philosophy is usually called al-hikmat al- muta‚ÄôƒÅliyah. It is a most appropriate name for his school, not only for historical reasons, but also because the doctrines of Mulla Sadra are both hikmah or theosophy in its original sense and an intellectual vision of the transcendent which leads to the Transcendent Itself. So Mulla Sadra‚Äôs school is transcendent for both historical and metaphysical reasons. When Mulla Sadra talked about hikmah or theosophy in his words, he usually meant the transcendent philosophy. He gave many definitions to the term hikmah, the most famous one defining hikmah as a vehicle through which ‚Äúman becomes an intelligible world resembling the objective world and similar to the order of universal existence‚Äù. Mulla Sadra's philosophy and ontology is considered to be just as important to Islamic philosophy as Martin Heidegger's philosophy later was to Western philosophy in the 20th century. Mulla Sadra brought \\"a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of reality\\" and created \\"a major transition from essentialism to existentialism\\" in Islamic philosophy. Existentialism A concept that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's philosophy is the idea of \\"existence precedes essence\\", a key foundational concept of existentialism. This was the opposite of the idea of \\"essence precedes existence\\" previously supported by Avicenna and his school of Avicennism as well as Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and his school of Illuminationism. Sayyid Jalal Ashtiyani later summarized Mulla Sadra's concept as follows: For Mulla Sadra, \\"existence precedes the essence and is thus principle since something has to exist first and then have an essence.\\" This is primarily the argument that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's philosophy. Mulla Sadra substituted a metaphysics of existence for the traditional metaphysics of essences, and giving priority Ab initio to existence over quiddity.Corbin (1993), pp. 342 and 343 Mulla Sadra effected a revolution in the metaphysics of being by his thesis that there are no immutable essences, but that each essence is determined and variable according to the degree of intensity of its act of existence.Corbin (1993), pp. 342-3 In his view reality is existence, in a variety of ways, and these different ways look to us like essences. What first affects us are things that exist and we form ideas of essences afterward, so existence precedes essence. This position referred to as primacy of existence ().Leaman (2007), p. 35 Mulla Sadra's existentialism is therefore fundamentally different from Western, i.e. existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because, there is no Creator, no God. This is the meaning of \\"existence precedes essence\\" in Sartre's existentialism.Existentialism and Humanism, page 27 Substantial motion Another central concept of Mulla Sadra's philosophy is the theory of \\"substantial motion\\" (al-harakat al- jawhariyyah), which is \\"based on the premise that everything in the order of nature, including celestial spheres, undergoes substantial change and transformation as a result of the self-flow (fayd) and penetration of being (sarayan al-wujud) which gives every concrete individual entity its share of being. In contrast to Aristotle and Ibn Sina who had accepted change only in four categories, i.e., quantity (kamm), quality (kayf), position (wad‚Äô) and place (‚Äòayn), Sadra defines change as an all-pervasive reality running through the entire cosmos including the category of substance (jawhar).\\" Heraclitus described a similar concept centuries earlier ( - panta rhei - \\"everything is in a state of flux\\"), while Gottfried Leibniz described a similar concept a century after Mulla Sadra's work.

Although Prospect Hill is considered to be the official planning name of the area, it has also gone by many other names. Locals commonly refer to it as Little Germany because of its narrow roads; it resembles a residential neighborhood that could be found somewhere in Europe. Prospect Hill is highly educated and very wealthy, with large houses and a more rural atmosphere. The area borders on Yakama Gulch to the west, overlooks Commencement Bay to the north, and has sweeping views of Old Tacoma to the east. The few houses with views of the waterfront - mostly located on North and Orchard Roads - are some of the most expensive properties in the city and often sell for well over $1 million as of April 2006.

It is located in B.B.D. Bagh, Kolkata, West Bengal. It has jurisdiction over the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The High Court building's design is based on the Cloth Hall, Ypres, in Belgium. The court has a sanctioned judge strength of 72. History Calcutta High Court in the 1860s The Calcutta High Court is one of the three High Courts in India established at the Presidency Towns by Letters patent granted by Queen Victoria, bearing date 26 June 1862, and is the oldest High Court in India. It was established as the High Court of Judicature at Fort William on 1 July 1862 under the High Courts Act, 1861, which was preceded by the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort William. Calcutta High Court in the 1890s Despite the name of the city having officially changed from Calcutta to Kolkata in 2001, the Court, as an institution retained the old name. The bill to rename it as Kolkata High Court was approved by the Union Cabinet on 5 July 2016 along with the renaming of its two other counterparts in Chennai and Mumbai.Change of name of Madras, Bombay and Calcutta HC The Bill called High Courts (Alternation of Names) Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 19 July 2016 and is yet to be passed by both Houses of Parliament. Hence, the High Court still retains the old name. Principal seat and benches The seat of the Calcutta High Court is at Kolkata, capital of West Bengal. As per the Calcutta High Court (Extension of Jurisdiction) Act, 1953, the Calcutta High Court's jurisdiction was extended to cover Chandernagore (now called Chandannagar) and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as of 2 May 1950. The Calcutta High Court extended its Circuit Bench in Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and in Jalpaiguri, the divisional headquarters of the North Bengal region. On 7 February 2019, President Ram Nath Kovind finalised the opening of the other circuit bench in Jalpaiguri, West Bengal with the jurisdiction area within 5 districts- Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar and Cooch Behar. Chief Justice The current Chief Justice of the court is Justice Thottathil B. Radhakrishnan. Sir Barnes Peacock was the first Chief Justice of the High Court. He assumed the charge when the court was founded on 1 July 1862. Justice Romesh Chandra Mitra was the first Indian officiating Chief Justice and Justice Phani Bhushan Chakravartti was the first Indian permanent Chief Justice of the court. The longest-serving Chief Justice was Justice Sankar Prasad Mitra. On 20 September 1871, the acting Chief Justice, Sir John Paxton Norman, was murdered on the steps of the courthouse by a Wahabi Muslim named Abdullah.

A film adaptation was subsequently made in 1999 by Star Cinema with the same title. The series was delayed in 1997 on its international channel TFC due to late broadcasting. It was aired on June 2, 1997 to November 12, 1999 with current broadcasts of Mula sa Puso. Official Promotional Poster Plot The series follows Esperanza's search for her real family. Esperanza's parents, Isabel and Juan Salgado, elope and marry without their family's approval, breaking Isabel's betrothal to Jaime Elustre, and Juan‚Äôs planned engagement to his long time girlfriend, Sandra. Isabel and Jaime have three children: two daughters and a son. One day Isabel takes them on a bus trip but somehow are separated after an accident. Both Isabel and Juan believe all three perished. The three siblings survive, but due to their very young age with nothing to identify them, are adopted by families in the same neighborhood. The eldest Socorro, renamed Esperanza by a poor family who takes her in but never tells her she is adopted. They treat her like a servant child. She grows up in this sad environment where she is mistreated or ignored by a couple she thinks are her parents, and yet sees them lavish attention towards their own children JunJun and Andrea. Esperanza‚Äôs only bright moments while growing up is spending time with her childhood friend and later her sweetheart Anton. Raphael, Esperanza's younger brother is more fortunate. He is rescued by another poor family: Ester and Luis who have a son named Noel, and they treat him as if he were their own son. He thrives in the happy and loving environment and is renamed Danilo. Regina, the youngest of the three siblings, is adopted by a rich couple, Belinda and Mayor Joaquin Montejo who are childless. They rename her Cecille. She grows up in wealth but her parents are controlling and secretly beats her. Esperanza eventually learns about her parentage, and sets out to find out the truth about her real family. She thinks her mother and brother died in the accident, and her adoptive father saves her and youngest sister, Regina but couldn‚Äôt support them both so he gives up Regina to the Majors. Danilo and Esperanza stumble upon the newspaper article featuring Juan's story about his search for his missing family. Piecing together the information stated in the article fit their story and both realize they are siblings. While Danilo now knows the truth he initially refuses to join in Esperanza's search for their father because his heart is with the family who loves him and the only family he wants. Esperanza understands and she goes on to tell Cecille the truth, and who begs Esperanza to take her away. Esperanza and Cecille make their escape to Manila, and in the last moment are joined by Danilo. They find their father but learn that their father remarried his ex fianc√©, Sandra. All these years, Sandra knows his children are alive and has been keeping this secret from him. Cecille's adoptive father Mayor Montejo takes Cecille once again and discovers that Anton is his son, a product of rape. He works out a deal to exchange Cecile with Anton. Because of his love for Esperanza, Anton agrees, and is sent to America to study, and as the Major hopes, to forget Esperanza. In Manila, Esperanza meets Brian, a new suitor and finds a job as the nurse maid or companion to Isabel Elustre, Jaime's wife. Isabel had suffered a nervous breakdown after she believed her children perished in the bus accident decades ago. In a manic depressed state she agrees to marry her original betrothed, Jaime. Isabel and Jaime do not recognize Esperanza as Isabel's daughter, but the nursemaid forms a bond with Isabel and helps her heal. Years pass and Esperanza never hears from Anton, except that he is marrying Donna, Jaime's niece who is pregnant with his baby. When they see each other again, Anton attempts to resolve their issues but Esperanza refuses because does not want to hurt Donna. She later changes her mind but it's too late. Donna learns that her Aunt Isabel does not love her Uncle Jaime who has stolen her away from her family. She tries to help her aunt escape from her uncle's clutches and Anton assists them. Jaime tries to shoot Anton but instead hits Donna, killing her. Meanwhile, Sandra abducts Cecille and Danilo away from Esperanza and takes them to her place to make them her slaves along with their grandmother Isabel's mother and discovers that Isabel and Sandra are half-sisters. Esperanza gets help from a lawyer named Cynthia Lazaro to get her brother and sister back from Sandra, which she eventually does. Cynthia has her own sinister plot against Sandra, Esperanza and her whole family. She is Rosella Salgado, the illegitimate daughter of Juan Salgado whom everyone has rejected. She has been planning for years to get vengeance on her father's family, even sending her lover Brian as her spy who accidentally fell in love with Esperanza.

The two-volume work Commutative Algebra that he wrote with Oscar Zariski is a classic. Other books of his covered projective geometry and algebraic number theory. Career Samuel ran a Paris seminar during the 1960s, and became Professeur √©m√©rite at the Universit√© Paris-Sud (Orsay). His lectures on unique factorization domains published by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research played a significant role in computing the Picard group of a Zariski surface via the work of Jeffrey Lang and collaborators. The method was inspired by earlier work of Nathan Jacobson and Pierre Cartier another outstanding member of the Bourbaki group. Nicholas Katz related this to the concept of p-curvature of a connection introduced by Alexander Grothendieck. He was a member of the Bourbaki group, and filmed some of their meetings. A French television documentary on Bourbaki broadcast some of this footage in 2000. Samuel was also active in issues of social justice, including concerns about environmental degradation (where he was influenced by Grothendieck), and arms control.Pierre Samuel Letter to the American Mathematical Society He died in Paris in August 2009.

He was also the subject of several scandals during his career. As a legal advisor working for the United States Department of War, he drafted recommendations and reports that were used by Congress and the executive branch in governing the United States' new territories following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. These reports were collected as a published book in 1902, then considered the seminal work on the subject. During his time as a governor, Magoon worked to put these recommendations into practice. Biography =Early life= Magoon was born in Owatonna, Minnesota. His family moved with him to Nebraska when he was still a small child. In 1876, he enrolled in the \\"prep\\" program at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and studied there for two years before officially enrolling in 1878. He left school in 1879 to study law independently with a prominent law firm. In 1882, he was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Lincoln, Nebraska. Eventually, he was made a partner in the firm. He also became the judge advocate of the Nebraska National Guard and continued to use the title of \\"Judge\\" throughout the remainder of his career. =War Department and the \\"Magoon Incident\\"= By 1899, Magoon was sought out to join the law office of the newly created Division of Customs and Insular Affairs, later renamed the Bureau of Insular Affairs, in the U.S. Department of War under Secretary of War Russell A. Alger. Legal and political controversy had arisen regarding whether the people of the newly acquired territories were automatically granted the same rights under the United States Constitution as American citizens. Magoon prepared a report to Alger in May 1899 that would have established the official departmental policy as \\"the Constitution follows the flag.\\" Under this view, the moment the treaty transferring the territories to U.S. sovereignty was signed, the residents of Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and other territories became subject to all the rights granted by the Constitution. For the new territories following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, this would have been from the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898. With the resignation of Secretary Alger, this incomplete report was not released to Congress. In August 1899, Elihu Root became the new secretary of war, and the unreleased report was scrapped. Magoon drafted a new report which came to precisely the opposite conclusion from the first: the Constitution did not apply in new territories until the United States Congress specifically passed legislation to authorize it. It argued that precedent was set when Congress passed legislation to apply the Constitution to the Northwest Territory and the Louisiana Purchase. This revised report was dated February 12, 1900, and released to Congress as a policy document expressing the Department's official stance on the issue. This view was largely adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States beginning in 1901 in the so-called \\"Insular Cases.\\" During this period, Congress was debating a Puerto Rico Tariff Act that would have been unconstitutional had the first definition been kept. This was a largely partisan issue at the time‚Äîthe Republicans were in favor of this Act, but it was strongly denounced by Democrats. During the ensuing debate, the existence of the original report was discovered by the Democrats, who requested that the War Department release the earlier report to them so they could be compared \\"side by side\\". The request was refused, but a copy of the report was leaked, allowing Minority Leader James D. Richardson to read it aloud on the Senate floor, prior to the vote. These efforts failed; the vote remained along party lines and the measure was passed. This small scandal, with Magoon at the center, was termed the \\"Magoon Incident\\" by the Chicago Tribune and resulted in harsh words against him from both parties. Fellow Republicans urged that Magoon was only a \\"subordinate clerk\\", with no right to express any opinion except the opinion of the Department, and therefore the first report should carry no weight. Democrats similarly were against the second version of the report. It is unclear which version, if any, actually represented Magoon's personal views rather than the views of the current secretary of war. After this incident, Magoon remained with the Department of War. In 1902, his work on the legal foundations of the new civil governments was released to the public as a book, Reports on The Law of Civil Government in Territory Subject to Military Occupation by the Military Forces of the United States, etc. It was reprinted several times and was considered the seminal text on the subject. =Panama= In late 1903, Secretary Root announced that he was retiring as secretary of war. Speculation followed in the media that Magoon would retire simultaneously and join the outgoing secretary in private practice. Instead, Magoon was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt in June 1904 to be the general counsel for the Isthmian Canal Commission, the group working toward what would eventually become the Panama Canal. In this role, he would be working under Chairman John Grimes Walker, but would not be a commissioner. According to President Roosevelt, Magoon deserved the position because he had \\"won his spurs\\" working in the War Department and was well respected. Although Magoon was working for the Canal project, his office and residence remained in Washington, DC. On March 29, 1905, President Roosevelt unexpectedly called for the simultaneous resignations of all members of the Canal Commission and the governor of the Panama Canal Zone, George Whitefield Davis. According to Secretary of War William Howard Taft, this clean sweep was due to the \\"inherent clumsiness\\" of the Commission, especially as related to sanitary problems in the Zone, as well as the difficulty of reaching consensus between the current seven commissioners. Several days later, replacement appointments were announced: Magoon was appointed both governor and a member of the Commission, with railroad entrepreneur Theodore P. Shonts made chairman of the Commission. The new Commission had seven commissioners, as required by the act of Congress that created the body, but responsibilities were to be split such that only Magoon, Shonts, and the chief engineer had any real authority. The remaining four members of the commission were appointed only to fulfil the letter of the law. Congress had already rejected a request by the President to formally make the Commission a three-member body; restructuring the organization was an end-run by the President around that restriction. In order to assume his new duties, Magoon relocated to the Canal Zone the following month. Governor of Panama Canal Zone right Magoon's primary responsibilities within the Canal Zone were to improve sanitation and to deal with the all-too-common outbreaks of yellow fever and malaria. At first, he refused to believe that the diseases were carried by mosquitos because, he reasoned, the native population would have been more affected. At this time, the nature of human acquired immunity to diseases was not well understood. The Chicago Tribune, in an article about conditions in the canal, referred to the notion that yellow fever was carried by mosquitos as \\"bugaboo\\". However, by January 1906, Magoon had long come to understand the role of mosquitos in the transmission of diseases, as evidenced in a New York Times article wherein Magoon addressed criticisms of his administration in detail; by then he had undertaken a vigorous and ambitious plan to eliminate the swamps that bred mosquitos. While governor, he worked with translators in the War Department to publish an English edition of the complete Civil Code of Panama, which he codified as the law of the Canal Zone on May 9, 1904. This was the first time that the complete civil code of a Spanish-speaking country not a U.S. territory had been translated into English. It was significant that he did not make changes to these laws when \\"importing\\" them into the legal system of the territory that he governed. On July 2, 1905, President Roosevelt further consolidated power in Panama by appointing Magoon Minister to Panama, to replace John Barrett. This put Magoon in the unique position of being both a governor of a U.S. territory and a diplomat to the country of which that territory was an enclave. During the tenure of Governor Davis, there had been friction between him and Minister Barrett. This double appointment would ensure that the two roles could not work at cross-purposes. Magoon would draw two salaries in the arrangement, an issue which would come up later to haunt him. With influential posts in both Panama proper and the Canal Zone, Magoon was an exceptionally powerful man on the Isthmus. Friction with Congress The President was coming into increasing conflict with Congress on the handling of the Zone, including the unusual consolidation of power. In addition to not officially restructuring the Commission, Congress increasingly fought or raised questions about the appointments of replacement commissioners. In November 1905, Panama was visited by Poultney Bigelow, a lecturer and writer for the American Geographical Society, who wrote a scathing report on progress in the Canal Zone‚Äîa report that was well- publicized in the States. This report criticized the efficiency of the work being performed as well as the quality of its management. Magoon countered this negative press by stressing that Bigelow had visited the Zone for less than two days, one of which was Thanksgiving Day, and that work was naturally lax on the holiday. In February, Magoon was called to testify before the Senate Committee responsible for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized now for the earlier adoption of Panama's penal system in the Zone. One major point of contention was that it did not allow for trial by jury for American citizens arrested there. They raised questions as to the quality of the judges in the territory and other issues. There was no official outcome from these hearings, but Congress subsequently passed a Consular Reform Bill which included a provision that specifically would not allow a diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position. Rather than remove Magoon from one of his positions, he was named to become vice governor-general of the Philippines. Ultimately, this offer was rescinded before it could take effect, and he was instead appointed governor of Cuba. The best coverage of Magoon's work in Panama can be found in: Mellander, Gustavo A.; Nelly Maldonado Mellander (1999). Charles Edward Magoon: The Panama Years. R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico: Editorial Plaza Mayor. . =Cuba= In 1906, Cuba was in the midst of a constitutional crisis as a result of a disputed election and an attempt by elected President Tom√°s Estrada Palma to stay in power after the conclusion of his term. This led to a revolt, and the U.S. military sent in 5,600 men to reassert control over the country in what would be called the Second Occupation of Cuba. This was permitted under the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1903, a treaty that stipulated the degree of United States intervention in Cuba. After a brief period of stabilization by Secretary Taft, Magoon was appointed governor under the Constitution of Cuba, effectively with absolute authority and backed by the U.S. military. On October 13, 1906, Magoon officially became Cuban governor. Magoon declined to have an official inauguration ceremony, and, instead, news of the appointment was announced to the Cuban public via the newspapers. In his written appointment address to the country, Magoon indicated that he would \\"perform the duties provided for by the ... constitution of Cuba for the preservation of Cuban independence\\". He was there, in short, to restore order and not to colonize. left During Magoon's time as governor, the remaining revolutionaries were defeated, and his attention was turned inward to infrastructure. He coordinated the construction of two hundred kilometers of highway. He called for the reorganization of the Cuban military into a formal army, rather than a Mexican-style \\"rural guard\\". More controversially, he called for the removal of the sunken USS Maine, the ship whose destruction led to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, because it was interfering with traffic in Havana's harbor. In his yearly report to the secretary of war, Magoon reported that many Cubans held the popular belief that neither the United States nor the US-backed Cuban government had explored the wreckage because evidence might be found to suggest that the ship was not sunk by a torpedo, as was the official report--something that would cast doubt on the justification for the United States' war against Spain. The removal of the ship did not take place while Magoon was in office; it was authorized by Congress in 1910. While he was well regarded in the United States, Magoon was not popular among Cubans. He reaped a vast number of lurid accusations at the hands of Cuban writers who described him as a \\"man of wax\\", who was \\"gross in character, rude in manners, of a profound ambition and greedy for despoilment\\". The Cuban nationalist bibliographer Carlos Manuel Trelles later wrote that Magoon \\"profoundly corrupted the Cuban nation, and on account of his venality was looked upon with contempt.\\" Other Cuban historians point to the fiscal wastefulness of Magoon's tenure, which \\"left a bad memory and a bad example to the country\\" and returned Cuba to the corrupt practices of colonial times. On January 29, 1909, the sovereign government of Cuba was restored, and Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez became president. No explicit evidence of Magoon's corruption ever surfaced, but his parting gesture of issuing lucrative Cuban contracts to U.S. firms was a continued point of contention. Several months later, Magoon received an official commendation from President Taft for his excellent service in Cuba. Following his service in Cuba, Magoon retired from public service and vacationed for a year in Europe before returning to the United States. Speculation at the time pointed to him taking a position as ambassador to China, a special commission on stability in Central America, or a Cabinet position. Ultimately Magoon did not take up any of those new responsibilities and formally entered retirement. He died in Washington, D.C., in 1920 after complications from surgery for acute appendicitis.

He was executed by firing squad, six days after staging a failed republican coup d'√©tat as Napoleon I returned from the disastrous Russian campaign in 1812. Before and during the French Revolution Malet enlisted as a Musketeer at age seventeen as was common for a young nobleman of the Ancien R√©gime, but King Louis XVI disbanded the musketeer regiments in 1776 for budgetary reasons. In 1790 Malet's family disinherited him for supporting the French revolution, when he became commander of his home town's National Guard and celebrated the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. Malet volunteered for the Revolutionary army when war broke out and was assigned to the 50th infantry regiment of the Army of the Rhine as a captain.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\"Claude Francois de Malet\\" Retrieved on 2009-06-04 He was discharged in 1795, but reenlisted again in March 1797, first as Chief of Staff of the 6th division, then in 1799 as Chief of Staff of the Army of the Alps under the command of general Jean √âtienne Championnet. After receiving honourable citations from both Championnet and general Andr√© Mass√©na for defending the Little St. Bernard Pass in August 1799, Malet was promoted to Brigadier General on October 19, 1799. He fought in the Helvetian Republic throughout 1801, until the fighting ended with the Second Coalition in 1802 by the treaties of Lun√©ville and Amiens. After the Directory After the coups of the 30 Prairial and 18 Brumaire of year VIII that replaced the French Directory with the French Consulate, Malet voted against the referendum confirming Napol√©on Bonaparte as First Consul. Malet was relegated to Bordeaux, then to Les Sables d'Olonne, as his opposition to Bonaparte became even more vehement, although he became Commander of the L√©gion d'honneur during these years. In 1805 he was discharged from active duty; Malet then resigned after Napoleon's coronation as Emperor. He was appointed Governor of Pavia in the Kingdom of Italy. Eug√®ne de Beauharnais expelled him on allegations of black market activities and propaganda, and he was interned in the La Force prison from July 1, 1807 to May 30, 1808. Released without trial, he was jailed again the next year on suspicion of belonging to the Philadelphes, a republican and anti-Bonapartist Masonic society. He remained under house arrest in Paris from July 1810, until his escape on October 23, 1812. Coup d'√©tat of 1812 Execution of Malet and his accomplices During his detention Malet conceived of and planned Napoleon's overthrow in a daring coup d'√©tat. The plan was simple: on October 23, 1812 during the Emperor's absence on the Russian front, Malet planned to announce the death of Napoleon and to establish a provisional government. Malet decided to proclaim his death via the use of forged documentation, hoping the plausible declaration would be believable. Malet's proposed provisional government would be composed of Mathieu de Montmorency, Alexis de Noailles, General Moreau as vice president, Lazare Carnot as president, Marshal Augereau, ex-legislator Bigonnet, Count Frochot, Prefect of the Seine, ex- legislator Florent Guiot, Destutt de Tracy, Malet himself, Vice-Admiral Truguet, Senator Volney, and Senator Garrat. The forces involved in the coup were the Gendarmerie forces of Paris (which were dissolved thereafter and formed the 134th Line Infantry Regiment) and the 10th Cohort of the French National Guard. Malet prepared complex instructions and forged documents for his accomplices. This preliminary work was immense, since it was necessary to give each accomplice an important role, specific instructions, and forged copies of the senatus consultum and the proclamations. As soon as a set of instructions was completely prepared, the dispatch was closed, sealed, numbered and entrusted to the custody of a Spanish priest who lived in Saint- Gilles street, close to the barracks of the 10th National Guard Cohort. On the night of the October 23, Malet escaped his captivity. Dressed in a general's uniform, he presented himself at the La Force prison and, using forged orders, obtained the release of Generals Victor Lahorie and Emmanuel Maximilien-Joseph Guidal, to whom he announced Napoleon's demise on October 7 at the Russian front near Moscow. He then convinced Lahorie and Guidal that immediate action was necessary and showed the forged documents leading them to believe the Senate had already reacted to the death of the Emperor. In the pre-dawn hours of October 23 Malet and his accomplices went to the barracks of the Gendarmerie. Malet awoke commanders and soldiers announced the Emperor's death and presented his forged documents as evidence. According to the \\"orders\\" in the forged documents, Malet had the troops take up their weapons and dispatched detachments of the 10th Cohort in columns to various locations to make arrests. A detachment of the 10th Cohort, led by Lahorie, went to the residence of the Duke of Rovigo, Minister of the Police. The Duke was taken by surprise and conveyed to La Force prison, while another detachment arrested the prefect of the police force. A third column went to the town hall of Paris and, while the troops took positions in place de Gr√®ve, the commanders took the key of the Midsummer's Day alarm bell, called the prefect Frochot and prepared the room for a provisional government. The death of the Emperor was believed throughout Paris, and Malet settled into the offices of the district general of the Place Vend√¥me, which offered the facilities necessary to play his part of commander. When General Pierre-Augustin Hulin, commander of the Paris Garrison, requested verification of the senatorial documents, Malet shot and injured him. Finally, Malet's actions were ended when a senior military police officer, Colonel Jean Doucet, recognized that the new general of the Senate in fact was the prisoner Malet. Doucet disarmed Malet, returned him to prison, and ordered the 10th Cohort back to its barracks. Consequences of the Malet Conspiracy Malet's plan was skillfully conceived. It focused on the weakness of the Imperial government, and calculated the consequences of passive obedience. Although unsuccessful, Malet's attempted coup d'√©tat can be seen as revealing a fatal weakness of the new dynasty. This coup d'√©tat caused the anger of Napoleon I because it exposed the weakness of allegiance to the Bonaparte family as a dynasty: nobody had had the idea to shout, \\"Napoleon died! Long Live Napoleon II!\\" On the other hand, the coup attempt was in fact thwarted. With the exception of two men, 23 civilians and officers, including Malet, Guidal and Lahorie, were tried on October 29, 1812 before a council of war and executed on the plain of Grenelle on October 31. The final result of the unsuccessful Malet conspiracy was the strained relations between the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Police. References External links *All√©gret, Marc.

His nephew Charles Darwin often visited Maer, and married Josiah's daughter Emma. A manor house at Maer dates back to 1282, the owner then being William de Mere. The present stone house was built around 1680 on a slope above a small lake, or \\"mere\\", which gave the house its name. In the 18th century the landscape designer Capability Brown altered the lake in a scheme of pleasure grounds. The house could be approached from either the north entrance with its grade II listed lodge or from the village of Maer to the south with its grade II* listed gatehouse. Maer Hall Gatehouse It lay only 7 miles (11 km) from the Etruria Works of the pottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood II, and in 1802 he bought the house using funds borrowed from his relative Robert. He had the house prepared, with the park being laid out by the landscape designer John Webb, and in 1807 the family moved in. There was a pleasant freedom of speech in the family, with everyone speaking their mind without restraint. They frequently exchanged visits to and from their Darwin relatives only 20 miles (30 km) away, and the young Charles Darwin found it a welcome contrast to the stricter approach of his father. Charles gained much useful information from his relatives during the inception of Darwin's theory, and it was at Maer Hall that he first became interested in the effects of earthworms which were the subject of an early paper presented to the Geological Society as well as of his last book. He proposed to Emma Wedgwood at Maer Hall, and they were married at St. Peter‚Äôs Church which stands close by on the hillside overlooking the Hall. After the death of Josiah Wedgwood II in 1843 the house and estate were owned by the pottery manufacturer William Davenport, of the Davenport Pottery, who added a huge clock tower and more stables, but these were knocked down in the 1960s restoring the appearance of the original 17th-century Hall. For most of the 20th century it was the home of the Harrison family, owners of the Harrison Shipping Line.

Of Scoto-Norman-Irish heritage, through his father he was a third-great grandson of David I of Scotland. His ancestors included Richard (Strongbow) de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, King of Leinster and Governor of Ireland, and William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, regent of England, Henry I of England and Aoife MacMurrough daughter of Dermot MacMurrough and wife of Richard de Clarehttps://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/ancestral-glimpses/I15483.php Life The son and heir of Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale and Lady Isabella de Clare, daughter of the Earl of Gloucester and Hertford, his birth date is generally accepted, but his place of birth is less certain. It is generally accepted that he, rather than his first son, was born on the family estate at Writtle, Essex. Legend tells that the 27-year-old Robert de Brus was a handsome young man participating in the Ninth Crusade. When Adam de Kilconquhar, one of his companions-in-arms, fell in 1270, at Acre, Robert was obliged to travel to tell the sad news to Adam's widow Marjorie of Carrick. The story continues that Marjorie was so taken with the messenger that she had him held captive until he agreed to marry her, which he did in 1271.Dunbar, Sir Alexander (1899): 67 However, since the crusade landed in Acre on 9 May 1271, and only started to engage the Muslims in late June, the story and / or his participation in the Ninth Crusade are generally discounted. What is recorded, is that: In 1264 his father, the 5th Lord of Annandale, was captured, along with Henry III of England, Richard of Cornwall, and the future Edward I of England at the Battle of Lewes, Sussex. Bruce negotiated with his uncle Bernard Brus, and cousin Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, both supporters of Simon de Montfort, over the terms of the ransom. Following the Battle of Evesham, in August 1265, both Bruce and his father profited from the seizure of the rebellious Barons' possessions, including those of Bernard. The younger Robert acquired lands in Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Bedfordshire. Robert and his younger brother Richard are known to have received letters of protection, in July 1270, to sail with Edward for crusade that August, and are presumed to have taken the cross, with Edward, at Northampton in 1268. They were joined by their Father, who'd sought pardon from Alexander III, but their date of return from Acre is less certain; it may have been as early as October 1271, when the younger Robert is recorded as receiving a quitclaim in Writtle, Essex, and his mother a gift of deer, from the King, also in Essex. In 1272 he married, without Scottish Royal consent, Marjorie, Countess of Carrick. As a result, she temporarily lost her castle and estates, that Oram described as poor, but regained them on payment of a fine. Around this time his mother died, the date is unknown but on 3 May 1273 his father married Christina de Ireby, the Widow of Adam Jesmond, the Sheriff of Northumberland, at Hoddam. The marriage added estates in Cumberland and dower land from her previous husband, to the Brus holdings. The younger Robert and his step-mother do not appear to have got on, with Robert recorded as trying to withhold dower lands, after his father's death in 1295. This may be one of the reasons why the Father appears to have independently managed the possessions in the North, as well as intermittently holding the position of Constable of Carlisle, while Robert appears to have confined himself largely to the management of the southern and midland possessions, with his brother Richard who independently held Tottenham and Kempston, as well as commanding a Knight banneret for Edward. Richard is recorded as receiving a number of wards and gifts of deer and to have sought permission to empark the forest at Writtle at this time. Robert, while not part of Edward's household, became an envoy and mouthpiece for Alexander III at court, swearing fealty on Alexander's behalf, to Edward at Westminster, in 1277, as well as following Edward to Gascony Robert is also recorded as following Alexander to Tewkesbury, in the autumn of 1278. * 1281 He is part of the delegation to Guy of Dampierre, Count of Flanders, to arrange the marriage of Alexander, Prince of Scotland, to Guy's daughter Margaret (d. 1331).

Earl of Carrick burial slab - Holme Cultram Abbey Shortly after the Battle of Stirling Bridge (1297), Annandale was laid waste as retaliation to younger Bruce's actions. Yet, when Edward returned to England after his victory at the Battle of Falkirk, which John of Fordun accords to Robert turning the Scottish flank: This is contested as no Bruce appears on the Falkirk roll, of nobles present in the English army, and ignoring Blind Harry's 15th claim that Wallace burned Ayre Castle in 1297, two 19th Century antiquarians: Alexander Murison and George Chalmers have stated Bruce did not participate in the battle and in the following month decided to burn Ayr Castle, to prevent it being garrisoned by the English. Annandale and Carrick were excepted from the lordships and lands which Edward assigned to his followers, the father having not opposed Edward and the son being treated as a waverer whose allegiance might still be retained. Robert at that time was old and ill, and there are reports that he wished his son to seek peace with Edward. If not his son's actions could jeopardise his own income, which was primarily derived from his holdings south of the border (est. ¬£340 vs ¬£150). The elder Bruce would have seen that, if the rebellion failed and his son was against Edward, the son would lose everything, titles, lands, and probably his life. It was not until 1302 that Robert's son submitted to Edward I. The younger Robert had sided with the Scots since the capture and exile of Balliol. There are many reasons which may have prompted his return to Edward, not the least of which was that the Bruce family may have found it loathsome to continue sacrificing his followers, family and inheritance for King John. There were rumours that John would return with a French army and regain the Scottish throne. Soulis supported his return as did many other nobles, but this would lead to the Bruces losing any chance of gaining the throne themselves. Family His first wife was Margery of Carrick, 3rd Countess of Carrick (11 Apr 1254 ‚Äì November 1292), the daughter and heiress of Niall, 2nd Earl of Carrick. Carrick was a Gaelic Earldom in Southern Scotland. Its territories contained much of today's Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire. The couple married at Turnberry Castle in 1271 and held the principal seats of Turnberry Castle and Lochmaben. Their children were: * Isabel Bruce (born c. 1272); married King Eric II of Norway in 1293; d. 1358 in Bergen, Norway. * Christina Bruce (born c. 1273, Seton, East Lothian); married, firstly, Sir Christopher Seton. Married, secondly, Sir Andrew Murray, 20 September 1305, d. 1356/7, in Scotland. * King Robert the Bruce (11 July 1274 ‚Äì 7 June 1329); married, firstly, Isabella of Mar; married, secondly, Elizabeth de Burgh. * Nigel de Brus (Niall or Nigel; born c. 1276); taken prisoner at Kildrummie, hanged, drawn and quartered at Berwick-upon-Tweed in September 1306. * Edward Bruce (born c. 1279); crowned 2 May 1316, \\"King of Ireland\\". Killed in battle, 5 October 1318. Possible marriage to Isabel, daughter of John de Strathbogie, 9th Earl of Atholl ‚Äì parents of Alexander Bruce, Earl of Carrick; Edward obtained a dispensation for a marriage to Isabella of Ross, daughter of Uilleam II, Earl of Ross, on 1 June 1317. * Mary Bruce (born c. 1282); married, firstly, Sir Neil Campbell; married, secondly, Sir Alexander Fraser of Touchfraser and Cowie. * Margaret Bruce (born c. 1283); married Sir William Carlyle. * Thomas de Brus (born c. 1284); taken prisoner in Galloway, hanged, drawn and quartered 9 February 1307, Carlisle, Cumberland. * Alexander de Brus (born c. 1285); hanged, drawn and quartered 9 February 1307, Carlisle, Cumberland. * Elizabeth Bruce (born c. 1286); married Sir William Dishington. * Matilda/Maud Bruce (born c. 1287); married Hugh, Earl of Ross, in 1308 Orkney Isles, died after September 1323. He had no children from his second wife Eleanor (died between 13 April and 8 September 1331). =Ancestry= In fiction He was portrayed (as a leper) by Ian Bannen in the 1995 film Braveheart. Braveheart inaccurately portrays Robert de Brus as being involved in the capture of William Wallace in Edinburgh; as noted above Robert de Brus died in 1304 and William Wallace was captured on 3 August 1305 by Sir John de Menteith in Glasgow. Menteith was a son-in-law to Gartnait, Earl of Mar and Christina Bruce. In Outlaw King, he is played by James Cosmo, who had a role in Braveheart as Old Campbell, the father of Wallace's childhood friend. In the 2018 film, de Brus is depicted as lamenting the disintegration of his relationship with Longshanks.

Then, he worked as an economist and the Communist Party's functionary in Kharkiv, since 1935 ‚Äì in foreign affairs service in Moscow. Malik was the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations from 1948 to 1952, and from 1968 to 1976. At the time of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 on 25 June 1950, Malik was boycotting the presence of a Nationalist Chinese representative. His absence enabled the resolution to pass unanimously with a 9‚Äì0 vote. On the floor of the United Nations on 23 June 1951, he proposed an armistice in the Korean War between China and North Korea on one hand, and South Korea, the United States, and other United Nations forces on the other. Malik is also well known for giving the USSR reasons for the occupation of Czechoslovakia at the Security Council in August 1968. He vetoed the 2 resolutions regarding the invasion (resolution requesting the liberation of the arrested Czechoslovak politicians and the removal of the communist armies from Czechoslovakia and the resolution requiring the selection of Special Envoy to Czechoslovakia). In 1955, as Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, he switched on the Blackpool Illuminations. From 1967 to 1971 he was the head of the Africa department of the Soviet ministry of Foreign affairs. During this time he initiated the covert operation Bukran, which established a spy network in several African countries.

It was established by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. The parlour or prolocutor (Speaker) was Peter de Montfort under the direction of Simon de Montfort. Simon de Montfort led the Parliament and the entire country of England for 18 months, from 1264 until his death at the Battle of Evesham. Background King Henry III of England had agreed with Pope Innocent IV that his (Henry's) son Edward should become King of Sicily following the death of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor.Carpenter (1996): p. 184 The Pope offered to partly fund the efforts to overthrow the Holy Roman Empire forces still in Sicily,Weiler (2006): p. 149Weiler (2006): p. 152 but following Innocent's death and the succession of Pope Alexander IV, issues began to arise. Alexander did not want to fund the ongoing efforts, and should Henry not complete his task then he would be excommunicated. As a result, the King sought further taxation to repay his efforts from Parliament, existing Royal funds failing to cover debts owed, even after selling Edward's lands to William de Valence.Trevelyan (1953): p. 98 Arguments and settlement In the parliament in London on 2 April 1258, the great magnates' disaffection with the King reached a breaking point. An agreement was made to look at the issues of supply on behalf of the King, to which Henry and Edward agreed on 2 May. At the Oxford Parliament on 11 June,Trevelyan (1953): p. 99 led by Simon de Montfort, Henry accepted a new form of government, laid out in the Provisions of Oxford, in which power was placed in the hands of a privy council, a council of fifteen members who were to supervise ministerial appointments, local administration and the custody of royal castles. Parliament, meanwhile, which was to meet three times a year, would monitor the performance of this council.Trevelyan (1953): p. 100 Henry agreed to these terms, and as a result a parliament consisting of fifteen was formed. These members included both Montfort, and Peter de Montfort, who acted as parlour or prolocutor for the proceedings. The remaining twelve consisted of Boniface of Savoy in his role as the Archbishop of Canterbury, Walter de Cantilupe as the Bishop of Worcester, the Earl of Norfolk, the Earl of Gloucester, the Earl of Hereford, the Earl of Warwick, the Earl of Albemarle, Hugh de Bigod, Peter de Saveye, Roger de Mortimer, James de Audeleye and John Maunsel. Aftermath The resolution of the Parliament did not last for long. The Pope excused the King of his obligations related to the throne of Sicily, meaning that he no longer required the funds provided by the additional taxation given to him by Parliament. The issue was one which was brought before King Louis IX of France, acting as arbitrator between Henry and the Barons at the Mise of Amiens. Louis made a decision entirely in favour of his fellow King,Powicke (1962): p. 183 overturning the agreement made at the Oxford Parliament and absolved Henry's need to allow Parliament to appoint ministers, instead restoring that power to him.Treharne (1973): p. 289 This soon resulted in the Second Barons' War, with forces led by Simon de Montfort rebelling against the King. Following an initial attack by the Barons, Henry's feudal army was summoned and won a battle at Northampton.Powicke (1947): pp. 459-460 The forces of Montfort and Henry failed to come to terms, resulting in the Battle of Lewes where the Barons were victorious and the Mise of Lewes resulted.Sadler (2008): pp. 55-69 Prince Edward escaped his captors within a few months,Prestwich (1997): pp. 48-49 and began to re-conquer England. The forces of Montfort found themselves trapped at Evesham, and in the ensuing battle, he was killed and his forces were routed by Edward's.Sadler (2008): pp. 105-109 The Barons continued to resist, but the Dictum of Kenilworth in October 1266 granted pardons, resulting in their surrender.Prestwich (1997): p. 117 The parliament came to be known as \\"Mad\\" as a result of an entry in Liber de Antiquis Legibus which read \\"Hoc anno fuit illud insane parliamentum apud Oxoniam\\". However, historians Dr A.G. Little and Dr R.L. Poole have shown that the word \\"insane\\" was overwritten in the original text, and may have originally read \\"insigne\\" instead.Treharne (1973): p. 72 Legacy Peter de Montfort's role as parlour or prolocutor was the forerunner for Speaker of the House of Commons which officially began in 1377.

He formed, together with Vsevolod Meyerhold, Yevgeny Vakhtangov and several other directors, the Soviet theater avant-garde in the 1920s and 1930s. He is one the most prominent representatives of Ukrainian avant-garde art. He is considered to be one of the lead figures of the Executed Renaissance.  Early work  Kurbas was born in Sambir (then part of Austria-Hungary) on February 25, 1887 and was given a double name Oleksandr-Zenon, for short Les or Oles. His father, Stepan Pylypovych Kurbas (Yanovych) (1862‚Äì1908), was a Ruthenian actor who descended from Lithuanian lineage. His mother, Vanda Adolfivna (nata Kulczycka), born in Stary Skalat, was also an actress, the daughter of an Austrian, Adolf Teichman. His parents' last name Yanovych was their pseudonym, for which they were better known, particularly in theater of \\"Ruska besida\\". Beside Les who was the first child there were three other children Kornylo (d. 2 July 1895), Nestor, and Nadia, however none of them survived past their teenage years. At first Kurbas studied at Ternopil gymnasium. In 1907 he enrolled into the Philosophy Department of University of Vienna from where he transferred out in 1908, due to his father death enrolling later in Lviv University (1908‚Äì1910).Les Kurbas brief bio at Odessa film studio This was determined by the need to lead Ukrainian culture out of the provincialism it had fallen into as a result of the century-long occupation by Poland and Russia. In the midst of the first world war Kurbas formed the \\"Ternopil theatrical evenings\\" (1915‚Äì1916) and the Molody Teatr (Young Theater) in Kiev in 1916, which was the first ensemble to experiment with both new and ancient acting techniques. Kurbas directed and acted in plays such as Gogol's Revizor and, most importantly and to much acclaim, Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. Due to the shortage in resources and the general political chaos towards the end of the First World War the ensemble was disbanded. Along with it he was a professor at the Kiev Music-Drama Institute in 1916-1919 and later Kharkiv Music-Drama Institute in 1926-1933. In 1920-21 Les Kurbas has found a Kiev Drama Theater \\"Kiydramte\\". Kurbas' next major project was Haydamaks (several stagings from 1920 on), a poem on the eighteenth-century Ukrainian upsurge against Polish occupation by Ukrainian poet laureate Taras Shevchenko. The production was the most important Ukrainian theater production of the twentieth century and went on to be staged even after Kurbas' death (without mention of his name, though). Kurbas integrated all the techniques of the Molody era, most notably in his treatment of the choir.  Berezil Theater  It was only in 1922 that conditions in the now Soviet-ruled Ukraine were stable enough to allow Kurbas to found the \\"Berezil'\\" (\\"spring\\" or \\"new beginning\\") in Kiev. In a same year Les Kurbas invited Vadym Meller to cooperation as a chief artist of the \\"Berezil'\\" Theater. Vadym Meller joined \\"Berezil'\\" with the experience of both easel artist and scenographer. The expressively unchained drawing, characteristic of V.Meller's early work, will become foundation, the origin in later stage productions done together with Les Kurbas. Since 1922 Les Kurbas also worked for the Odessa Film Studio where he directed such movies as \\"Shvedskaya spichka\\" (1922), \\"Arsenaltsy\\" (1925), and others. In 1925 Vadim Meller was awarded a gold medal for the scenic design of the \\"Berezil'\\" theatre (Exposition Internationale des Modernes, Paris ). \\"Berezil'\\" was not merely a theater, but a study and research institution which until today is nearly unequalled in its organisation. Every theater department has its own committees and workshops, and several branches were established in other Ukrainian cities. \\"Berezil'\\" attracted not only the best actors of its time: dozens of future Ukrainian actors and directors received their education here, going through a curriculum involving a whole series of acting techniques, rhythmic exercises, voice training and ensemble play. Kurbas aimed at a scientific grounding of every development in \\"Berezil'\\", which could sometimes lead to endless discussions in one of the committees. He wrote: ‚ÄúToday the comedy is over. The actor entered the stage, the only one by which the theater will live. Theater‚Äîtribune and spectacle, court and school, thought and folly of new man‚Äù. In its early years the theater suffered from a shortage of suitable plays that the productions could be based on. Kurbas was only one of several directors, if the most important one, and an outstanding organizer. His stagings of the time included \\"Gas\\" by the German author Georg Kaiser and \\"Jimmy Higgins\\" by Upton Sinclair. Kurbas made mostly use of the expressionistic techniques he had developed during the Molody era, but increased further the rhythmic organisation of the entire production. In 1927 Kurbas met up-and-coming playwright Mykola Kulish in the Ukrainian capital of the time, Kharkiv, where the \\"Berezil'\\" had moved in 1926. Kulish's early plays had been staged by other theaters in the rigid Soviet realist manner that would become the standard all over the Soviet Union in the 1930s. The collaboration between Kulish and Kurbas proved to be both fortunate and unfortunate for the ensemble. While productions as The People's Malakhii (1928), Myna Mazailo (1929) and Maklena Grassa (1933) set new standards in ensemble play and dramatic rigor, they also fell foul with the official Soviet propaganda policy. Yet Kurbas was determined to pursue his course in spite of the increasing threats. In 1930, just before the artificial famine in Ukraine, Kurbas was forced to stage Dyktatura (\\"Dictatorship\\"), by Ukrainian playwright Ivan Mykytenko. The propaganda play was an attempt to justify the Soviet policy that ultimately led to the starvation of the Ukrainian peasantry and caused several million deaths (the Holodomor). Kurbas turned the sense of the play around, a technique he named \\"recoding\\", and made a satirical and tragic opera out of a what had been a dull realist plot. While the authorities regarded the production as a final opportunity for Kurbas to give up his refractoriness and step back in line, Kurbas followed his own political instincts. By exposing the regime for what it was, he also dealt the death- blow to the theater and himself. Kurbas wrote: ‚ÄúWe all know what dictatorship is, but few of us pay attention to it as to a fact of intellectual nature. The obligation of every actor of the play was to make every spectator understand that the rudder of history‚Äîis in his own hands.‚Äù The Taras Schevchenko Academic Ukrainian Drama Theatre in Kharkiv is an heir to Berezil's magnificent artistic traditions.Encyclopediaofukraine.comUkrainianDramaTheater  Imprisonment and execution  In 1933 Kurbas was ousted from \\"Berezil\\". He was allowed to go to Moscow, where he probably was the major force behind Solomon Mikhoels' famous staging of King Lear (1934). Later in 1933 he was arrested and put into a labour camp (as were many other cultural figures). Even under these conditions Les Kurbas showed his unshakable love for the theater. As his friend and competitor Vsevolod Meyerhold would do later during his own imprisonment, Kurbas organized a camp theater and was even in touch with the author of one of the plays he staged to discuss dramaturgical decisions. Kurbas was then moved to the remote Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea, and was one of the \\"lost transport\\" of prisoners shipped back to the mainland in 1937 from Solovki. It is now known that he was shot on 3 November 1937 with 289 other members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia at the killing field and burial ground of Sandarmokh near Medvezhyegorsk, in Karelia (northwest Russia),–†–æ–∑—Å—Ç—Ä—ñ–ª—è–Ω—ñ –≤ –°–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä–º–æ—Å—ñ a site discovered in 1997 by members of the Memorial Society. Joseph Stalin had directly ordered the killing of over one thousand artists and intellectuals held in the Solovki prison camp. Kurbas' friend Mykola Kulish, who had been confined to a cage like an animal and consequently fallen into a state of utter mental derangement, met the same fate. After Stalin‚Äôs death, Kurbas was rehabilitated in 1957.Les Kurbas: the Revolutionary of the Theatre // The Ukrainian Week, 2012  Posterity  The \\"Berezil'\\" Theater lived on under the name of \\"Shevchenko Theater\\". One of Kurbas' lead actors, Marjan Kurshelnytsky, led it until the 1960s, but had to make many artistic compromises. Kurbas' work could only be mentioned again from the 1960s onwards, yet the overdue research was only begun in late 1980s, mostly in Ukraine. There is a tendency in the Ukrainian research to glorify Kurbas. Some hagiographers claim that Kurbas was a genius (he was indeed multi-talented) who anticipated every development of the later 20th century theater (some of which he did, as for example in the work of Italian director Eugenio Barba's Odin Teatret). Another important falsification is that Kurbas was not a communist. It would be more correct to say that he had an entirely different vision of communism and the potential of a new society for the development of human creativity. His most important goal as an artist was to \\"make the audience feel more alive\\".  References  * Irena R.

Overview  Established in 1892 by the Sisters of the Church, the school currently enrols approximately 700 students from Early Learning to Year 12, including up to 40 boarders in Years 5 to 12. Collegiate's brother school is The Hutchins School, with whom they share their Year 11 and 12 classes and many other brother/sister school activities. The school is a member of the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australia, the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Boarding Schools' Association, and the Association of Independent Schools' of Tasmania. The school was accredited by the Council of International Schools.  History  =1892‚Äì1939= In 1892, at the invitation of Bishop Montgomery, seven Sisters came from the mother house in Kilburn, England, to Tasmania. Of these, three Sisters remained in Tasmania and at the request of Dean Dundas, opened a school for girls and boys in October 1892. Sister Hannah was the principal of the school which had an initial enrolment of 12 children, six boys and six girls. Classes were held in the Synod Hall. The son of Bishop Montgomery was Bernard Montgomery, who attended the school while living in Tasmania and went on to be the victorious British Army field marshal in the Second World War organising the D-Day Invasion at Normandy and taking the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945. Sister Phyllis became the principal in 1895, by which time the number of enrolled students had risen to 71, including 6 boarders. To cater for this growth in numbers the school moved to 'Stephenville', a large house in Macquarie Street. 'Stephenville' was built in 1825 for the Solicitor General of Tasmania Sir Alfred Stephen. During the following decades the school continued to expand, and in 1912 the school purchased the house 'Tremayne', located next door to 'Stephenville'. This provided extra class rooms and accommodation for the senior boarders. In these early days the school was known as the Collegiate School. The students did not have a uniform as such, but were required to wear a long dark coloured skirt and a white blouse. From around 1915 girls who became prefects were presented with a silver brooch in the form of the school emblem. These were worn for the term of office and then handed back to the school to be passed to the next year's prefects. Sister Phyllis then presented each outgoing prefect with a gold signet ring. At some time during the 1920s some girls began to wear a brooch with the initials C.C.E.S., which stood for Collegiate Church of England School. In 1929 Tremayne was demolished to make way for a larger, two-storey, purpose-built building, which housed classrooms downstairs and boarding accommodation upstairs. This new building, also named 'Tremayne' was opened in 1932. Throughout this time the school continued to be run by Sister Phyllis who remained principal until 1933. In 1937 a summer uniform was introduced. It was very different from the traditional navy blue tunic and black stockings, and much more comfortable to wear in the warmer months. It was a beige-coloured tunic. This uniform remained virtually unaltered for over 50 years. =1940‚Äì1999= Due in part to the onset of the Second World War, the school did not embark on any further expansion until 1953, by which time the school required separate buildings for a junior school. For this purpose two adjacent houses in Macquarie Street were purchased in 1953. In 1959 a new large Assembly Hall was completed, and not long after a number of new classrooms were added. In 1973, 80 years after the foundation of the Collegiate Church of England School, the Sisters of the Church handed the responsibility of the running of the school over to a board, and in 1974 the school saw its first lay principal. =21st century= In 2011, Nicolaas Ockert Bester, who was a science teacher and head of maths and science at St Michael's Collegiate, was convicted and jailed by the Tasmanian Supreme Court for two years and ten months for a sex crime against a 15-year- old girl student the year prior.\\"Teacher jailed over sex with student,\\" The Australian\\"Ex-Collegiate teacher on sex charges; A former staff member of St Michael‚Äôs Collegiate School is accused of committing sex ...,\\" The Mercury\\"University of Tasmania silent on future of PhD student Nicolaas Bester jailed on child sex offences\\" ‚Äì ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)\\"Nicolaas Bester: University of Tasmania students petition to get sex offender off campus\\"\\"University students petition against sex offender Nicolaas Bester's presence on campus\\" ‚Äì ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)\\"Tas Uni responds to sex offender controversy\\" He was 55 years old at the time. He was convicted and jailed for an additional four months in 2016, for later bragging about it on social media. Principal Judith Tudball informed parents of the charges, and said Bester had been employed at the school over 20 years. In 2017, Raynor Ian Bartsch, 56, who was a physical education teacher and head of sport at St Michael's Collegiate between 1989 and 1993, pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison for maintaining a sexual relationship for eight weeks in the 1990s with a young person (a 16-year-old girl student).St Michael's Collegiate School ex- teacher, Raynor Ian Bartsch, jailed for sex with student ‚Äì ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)Teacher jailed for ‚Äòunlawful‚Äô relations  The Advocate During the trial, the court heard that the school was aware of allegations, but allowed the teacher to finish the year teaching, working at the pool, and coaching. At the time, the acting principal and the school chaplain both spoke to Bartsch about his behaviour.St Michael's Collegiate Girls' School kept sex offender on staff, despite allegations ‚Äì ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) In 2020, the boarding house within the Collegiate campus complied with the quarantine requirements as outlined by the Australian government during the COVID-19 pandemic. The boarding house accommodates local and international students from China and other countries. House system As with most Australian schools, St Michael's Collegiate School uses a house system. The current house system consists of eight houses (Dundas, Kilburn, McPhee, Mitchell, Montgomery (nicknamed Monty), Reibey, Rivers and Stevens). Each year, these houses compete against each other in physical and mental contests for the 'House Cup', donated by the graduating class of 1958. These events include inter-house swimming, debating, house performance, house choir and athletics. Curriculum Collegiate offers a wide range of subjects. Students up to Year 4 study a core of subjects, including Japanese, specifically designed to prepare them for middle school (Years 5‚Äì8). Years 5 to 8 have common teachers whenever possible. In years 5 and 6, in each semester students start learning 1 language to help them choose in year 7 and 8. In Years 7 and 8 students can study two languages other than English, from French, German, Chinese and Latin. The Senior school (9‚Äì12) is designed to prepare students for life after school. Year 9s choose three elective subjects and study a core of Science, English, SoSE, Maths, Faith and Life and Health/Physical Education (HPE). Year 10 students choose three electives each semester, and study the same core subjects as year 9s. Pre- tertiary students (Years 11 and 12) may choose up to five pre-tertiary subjects. Co-curriculum =Sport= Collegiate offers a wide range of sports. Captains are usually chosen in Years 11 and 12, but in some cases a Year 10 girl is chosen as captain.

He had an older brother, Edwin Murray Mann (1840-1885) who was born in Delaware County, New York and who would also become a Virginia judge, but in Petersburg after the American Civil War discussed below. Their father died and mother remarried, to a man named Trotter, whom she survived, dying in 1893. William Mann attended Williamsburg Academy locally, then Brownsburg Academy, a private Presbyterian high school in Brownsburg, Rockbridge County, Virginia in the Shenandoah Valley.http://www.markerhistory.com/brownsburg-marker-a-70 He would marry twice, first to Sallie Fitzgerald Mann (1845‚Äì1882) and later to Etta Edloe Donnan Mann (1861‚Äì1960), who would bear sons Stuart Donnan Mann (1886‚Äì1889) and William Hodges Mann (1890‚Äì1953).https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7140828 American Civil War When he was sixteen, Mann became Deputy Clerk of Nottoway County, Virginia in Southside Virginia. He left to return to Williamsburg and on April 20, 1861 enlisted as a private in Company E of the 12th Virginia Infantry the day after his brothers Edward Murry Mann enlisted in the same unit and two days before their brother John Mann (a deputy clerk in the Petersburg Court) enlisted, all as the Civil War. All would survive the war, and John Mann would be discharged at the end of July 1861 to resume his clerical duties.William D. Henderson, 12th Virginia Infantry (Lynchburg, H.E. Howard Inc. Virginia Regimental History Series 1984) p. 139 Initially, the 12th Virginia guarded the vital Norfolk naval yard and port, as well as the city of Petersburg (an important rail hub and transshipment point). In 1862, responding to the federal Peninsular Campaign, the 12th Virginia became part of \\"Mahone's Brigade\\" (named for William Mahone in Longstreet's Corps in the Army of Northern Virginia. It then participated in several major campaigns. Mann was badly injured during its first significant combat, the Battle of Seven Pines, on June 1, 1862, and during his recovery briefly served as a clerk in the Confederate Treasury department in Richmond. Mann later became a scout behind enemy lines and was captured by Union forces in 1863, but escaped, and served again during the federal Siege of Petersburg.Roslyn Reams Luther and Edwin C. Luter III, Governors of Virginia 1776-1974 (Accomac, Virginia: Eastern Shore News 1974) p. 91 Upon partially recovering from his wounds, Mann resumed his office as Deputy Clerk in Nottoway County as the war ended. Postwar career After General Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, Mann read law. He began practicing law in Nottoway County in 1867, and became involved in Democratic Party politics, eventually with what became known as the Martin Organization organized by future U.S. Senator Thomas Staples Martin. In 1890, the Virginia General Assembly elected Mann judge of Nottoway County. However, his judicial career proved brief. Governor Mann with his staff Voters from Nottaway County, together with those from adjacent Lunenburg and Brunswick Counties elected Mann to represent them in the Virginia Senate in 1899, and re-elected him several times, although after the 1900 census and 1902 State Constitutional Convention redistricting, the state senatorial district (now numbered the 28th) was redrawn to include not only Nottoway and Lunenburg Counties, but Amelia, Prince Edward and Cumberland Counties instead of Brunswick County (which was put into the 25th District along with Mecklenburg County and represented by F.B. Roberts).Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 572, 580, 584, 588 (Mann's Senate predecessor, Robert Turnbull, was also a lawyer and would be elected clerk of Brunswick County in 1901 and later to the U.S. Congress). Senator Mann became chairman of the committee to revise Virginia Laws. In 1906 he introduced legislation to construct 450 high schools in Virginia, the most progressive educational funding to that date. Mann also favored Prohibition, but only at the state level; the \\"Mann Law\\" he authored closed about 800 saloons in counties lacking police protection.Luther & Luther Mann was elected Virginia's governor in 1909 with 63.35% of the vote, defeating Republican William P. Kent and Socialist Labor candidate A.H. Dennitt. Upon taking office in January 1910, Mann became the last Confederate soldier to serve as Governor of Virginia. Governor Mann continued to advocate temperance and public education. During his governorship, Mann refused to prevent the execution of the teen-aged Virginia Christian, a black house maid who was convicted of murdering her white employer, and the subject of a nationwide campaign for clemency.https://www.virginiamemory.com/online- exhibitions/items/show/1069 In 1911, Mann shook hands with President William Howard Taft as part of the Manassas Peace Jubilee marking the 50th anniversary of the First Battle of Bull Run. Later years and death Upon leaving office in 1910, Mann returned to his legal practice in Nottoway County and continued to remain active in the Democratic Party. He died on December 12, 1927, aged 84, survived by his second wife (who died in 1960) and son William Hodges Mann (1890-1953), who had become a lawyer and would serve as Petersburg's mayor.

In The Pillow Book, Lady My≈çbu was also the name of a pet cat belonging to Empress Consort Sadako, whom the author Sei Sh≈çnagon served. 3 This title is commonly associated with the kitsune messengers of the rice deity Inari, for reasons that are obscure. Japanese folklore contains several stories that suggest explanations for the connection, mainly involving the Fushimi Inari Shrine on Mount Inari near Kyoto. On this mountain are a vast number of shrines, mainly to Inari, but also to other deities, including a fox deity named My≈çbu. The Fushimi shrine itself contains smaller shrines, including the Byakko-sha (\\"white fox shrine\\") and the My≈çbu-sha (\\"court lady shrine\\"). Legends connecting kitsune to the title my≈çbu * Kitsune were given the title by a court lady of the same rank.  In the reign of the Emperor Ichij≈ç (980‚Äì1011), there lived a charming court lady with a rank of my≈çbu whose name was Shinno-My≈çbu. She was a devotee of Inari God. She went to the shrine at Fushimi, Kyoto, to confine herself there for prayer for a period of seven days. After she had completed her term of worship, it is said, she won the heart of the Mikado and later became his consort. She attributed her good luck to the white foxes guarding the shrine and the name of my≈çbu was given to them. 2  A lady of the imperial court who followed the Inari faith would frequently make pilgrimage to Fushimi. As she grew older she became unable to climb to the highest peak of Mount Inari, and so asked a tamed fox to make the pilgrimage to the third peak for her, promising to bestow her title upon the fox if it did so. The fox made the pilgrimage every day, and so received her title. 1  A particular lady of the court who followed the Inari religion faithfully believed in a spirit fox known as Akomachi. Due to her faith, she was able to receive the favour of a high-ranking lord, and became one of his wives. One of her daughters became the wife of the emperor, and her sons all received high positions within the court. Because of this, she awarded the fox the title of my≈çbu. 1 * Kitsune were given the title in honor of a deity.  During a visit to the Fushimi Inari shrine during the spring of 1071, the Emperor Go-Sanj≈ç awarded the title my≈çbu to an old fox at a shrine to a female deity. 1 *Myobu was often used to describe the kitsune who were faithful to Inari. These kitsune are often white or other lighter colors. *Kitsune who did not follow Inari are often referred to as Nogitsune. They are often black or red. They are generally more mischievous than their Myobu brethren, and seem to have more interactions with humans.4 References # Chris Azure, A History of Fox Beliefs.

Biography Mantzaros was of noble Greco-Italian descent, coming from one of the most important and wealthy Venetian families of the \\"Libro d'Oro\\" di Corfu and therefore he never considered himself a \\"professional composer\\", teaching the youth of Corfu without profit. His father was Iakovos Chalikiopoulos Mantzaros and his mother Regina Turini, from Dalmatia. Recent research and performances have led to a re-evaluation of Mantzaros as a significant composer and music theorist. Debut in Corfu He was taught music in his native city by the brothers Stefano (pianoforte) and Gerolamo Pojago (violin), Stefano Moretti from Ancona (music theory) and cavalliere Barbati, possibly a Neapolitan (music theory and composition). Mantzaros presented his first compositions (three concert or substitute arias and the one-act azione comica Don Crepuscolo) in 1815 in the theatre of San Giacomo of Corfu. Relationship to Italy From 1819 onwards he was regularly visiting Italy (Venice, Bologna, Milan, Naples), where, among others, he met the veteran Neapolitan composer Niccolo Antonio Zingarelli. Work His compositions include incidental music, vocal works in Italian and demotic Greek, sacred music for the Catholic Rite (three masses [possibly 1819, 1825, and possibly 1835], a Te Deum [1830]) and the Orthodox Church (notably, a complete mass based on the septinsular polyphonic traditional chanting [1834]), band music, instrumental music (24 piano sinfonie, some of them also for orchestra) etc. Mantzaros also composed the music for the first concert aria in Greek in 1827, the Aria Greca. Mantzaros was an important music theorist, contrapuntist and teacher. From 1841 and until his death he was the Artistic Director of the Philharmonic Society of Corfu. The initial pages of an 1820 piano 'Sinfonia' by Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros (composer's autograph). It is exhibited in the Music Museum of the Philharmonic Society of Corfu. =Greek national anthem= His most popular composition remains the musical setting for the poem of Dionysios Solomos' √ùmnos eis tƒ´n Eleuther√≠an (Hymn to Liberty), which Mantzaros added to Solomos' poem in 1828. The first and second stanzas were adopted initially in 1864 as the Royal Anthem of Greece and on 28 June 1865 as the Greek national anthem. However, recent research and performances have proved that Mantzaros had broader activities as a significant composer and music theorist, which go beyond the established perception of him as the mere composer of the National Anthem.

Sahitya Akademi, 1998. . p. 1-16 (introduction) He believed that literature which criticises and enriches human life and ultimately reforms the human thought of its time is the only relevant form of literature.  Life  Kodavatiganti Kutumbarao was born in to a middle-class family in Tenali, Guntur district. His schooling until 1925 was in Tenali. He lost his father in 1914 and his mother in 1920, and grew up with his uncle. He was very familiar with village life. His elder brother Venkatasubbiah (out of touch since 1921) was a poet-writer and he was introduced to the literary community early through him. He was introduced to western literature too during this time. His early experiments, at the age of thirteen, included an unfinished thriller and poetry, which he would soon abandon. He married eleven-year-old Padmavati in 1924, before he graduated from high school. After Intermediate education (1925 to 1927) at A C college, Guntur, he studied for Bachelors Physics at Vijayanagaram Maharajah college. He started his serious attempts in writing during this time. Towards the end of his undergraduate education, he also became an atheist. He went to the Benaras Hindu University for his Masters in Physics. During this time, he published his first works: an essay called Cinema (1930) in the oriental weekly and Pranadhikam (1931), which won him the first prize in Gruhalakshmi. His masters was cut short in the second year due to the economic depression. Later, he worked in several places from Shimla to Bombay to Madras, in such positions as a clerk, teacher, factory foreman and a film writer (including music direction for a film), before settling down in the field of journalism.

He unexpectedly succeeded S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike as Prime Minister when the latter was assassinated on 26 September 1959. His tenure as the caretaker Prime Minister was short as he was unable to keep together the alliance formed by Bandaranaike. He dismissed the Cabinet of Ministers and called for fresh elections, for which he formed his own party. Although he least his parliamentary seat in the 1960 March elections, he regained it in the general election that followed two months later.

Early life and education The young Wijeyananda Dahanayaka attended the well known Richmond College, in Galle, Sri Lanka. He was born as a twin in Dangedera, Richmond Hill, Galle and was named Don Wijeyananda Dahanayake after the Wijayananda Pirivena.

He also organized student protests against the British colonial administration.Dahanayake twins and their service to education  Political career - Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the United National Party  =Early years= Dahanayake became active in pre-independence politics while serving as a teacher and switched to full-time politics. As a member of the Trotskyite Lanka Sama Samaja Party, he was elected to the Galle Municipal Council from the Kumbalwella Ward, which he held until 1944. He was elected the first Mayor of Galle in 1939 and served till 1941. When world war 2 started in the far-east, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party refused to support the British war effort. Dahanayake was prosecuted by the police for organizing a strike during the height of war, which angered the British colonial administration. He represented himself in court without a lawyer and won against the crown prosecution. =State Council= He contested in a by-election to the State Council of Ceylon in 1944 from Bibile. Even though he lost to the bus magnate S.A. Peiris, he filed an election petition against his opponent and unseated him. He once again represented himself in court without a lawyer. In the following by-election, Dahanayake was elected to the State Council from Bibile. That year, when the Lanka Sama Samaja Party split, he joined the Bolshevik‚ÄìLeninist Party lead by Dr Colvin R. de Silva. He supported the education reforms initiated by C. W. W. Kannangara by collecting a large amount of signatures for a public petition in support of the reforms that ushered equal opportunities for education for all children in the island. In 1947, he was only one of three members who voted against the Soulbury Constitution which enabled self rule for Ceylon as a dominion. =Parliament= He contested the 1947 general elections from the Bolshevik‚ÄìLeninist Party in the Galle electorate. With a campaign in which he did not spend any money, he won against the wealthy H. W. Amarasuriya contesting from the United National Party and was elected to the House of Representatives. In parliament, he gave a thirteen and half hour speech during the first budget speech, which is the record for the longest speech. He later re-joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party under Dr N. M. Perera and successfully contested the 1952 general elections from the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and retaining his seat. He was expelled from the party for hosting a reception for the Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake's visit to Galle. In 1955, he gave leadership to the nationalist movement that sort for \\"Sinhala only\\" under a new party called the \\"Basha Peramuna\\" (Language Front) which aligned with the alliance Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (Peoples United Front) lead by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike which contested the 1956 general elections and won a landslide victory against the ruling United National Party which was reduced to eight seats in parliament. Dahanayake was himself re-elected from Galle having joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. =Minister of Education= With S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike becoming prime minister, Dahanayake was appointed Minister of Education by Bandaranaike. As Education Minister he re-introduced the mid-day school meal for students by providing a free bun, which gained him the nickname \\"Bannis Mama\\" (Bun Uncle). He gave university status to the Vidyodaya Pirivena and Vidyalankara Pirivena. In 1959, he became the acting leader of the house after the incumbent C. P. de Silva was taken to London for medical treatment after becoming ill after consuming a glass of milk at a cabinet meeting. =Prime Minister of Ceylon= Bandaranaike had been scheduled to go to New York to attend the UN General Assembly in late September 1959. With the absence of C. P. de Silva, Bandaranaike had sent a letter to the Governor General recommending that he appoint Dahanayake as acting Prime Minister during his absence. Bandaranaike was assassinated on September 26, 1959 and with the letter as a reference, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, the Governor General of Ceylon appointed Dahanayake as Prime Minister. He was later confirmed by parliament in this position. He also took on the portfolios of defence and external affairs (customary held by the Prime Minister) as well as education. His tenure as prime minister was controversial and difficult. Even before Bandaranaike's assassination, there was infighting among the alliance parties of the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. The situation deteriorated under Dahanayake, which was compounded by the investigation into the assassination which drew suspicion on several ministers and resulted their resignation or removal. Dahanayake dismissed his Cabinet of Ministers and requested the dissolution of parliament on December 4, 1959 calling for fresh elections. For the interim he ran the country with a five member cabinet. He also resigned from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and formed Lanka Prajathanthravadi Pakshaya (Ceylon Democratic Party) from which he contested the March 1960 general elections from Galle which he lost to W. D. S. Abeygoonawardena by 400 votes. His party put forward 101 candidates, but is only four candidates won a seat in parliament. His most notable achievement during his tenor was the repeal of the Capital Punishment Act which Bandaranaike had used to suspended capital punishment in Ceylon. The repeal made way for the execution of those convicted of the assassination of Bandaranaike. =Return to parliament= He successfully contested the July 1960 general elections from the Lanka Prajathanthravadi Pakshaya in Galle and elected to parliament defeating W. D. S. Abeygoonawardena. He seat in the opposition and was called before the commission of inquiry into the Bandaranaike assassination to give evidence in 1963. That year he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Vidyodaya University. In 1964, Dahanayake gained fame when he attempted and was prevented from entering parliament chambers in a span cloth (known locally as an Amude) in protest of government of Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike's rationing of clothing to two yards of textiles per month per person due to foreign exchange shortage. The following day dailies carried photos of Dahanayake in an Amude. =Cabinet minister and opposition= He was re- elected 1965 general elections from the Sri Lanka Freedom Socialist Party lead by C. P. de Silva. The party supported the United National Party in forming a national government and Dahanayake was appointed Minister of Home Affairs. He was re-elected in the 1970 general elections from the United National Party and sat in the opposition. He resigned from United National Party and sat as an independent after his request for a free vote for the republican constitution was refused. In the 1977 general elections, he contested from Galle as an independent candidate, but lost to the United National Party candidate Albert de Silva. Dahanayake challenged Silva in an election petition in the Galle High Court and in the Supreme Court, once again representing himself and a judgment in his favor unseating Silva in 1979. Dahanayake gained the seat in the following by-election as the candidate from the United National Party with a majority of 13,012 votes and sat as a backbencher. He was appointed Minister of Co-operatives by J. R. Jayewardene in March 1986 and serving till 1988.

This marked the end of his political career. Death Dahanayaka died on 4 May 1997 at the age of 95 after a short illness at his home in Richmond Hill, Galle.Midnight sacking of ministers Personal life Dahanayake was a simple man. When appointed Prime Minister, he moved into Temple Trees carrying his own things in two old suitcases from his room in the Srawasthi Mandiraya. He found the prime minister's bed room too large and had it partitioned. When he resigned from the post of prime minister following his electoral defeat, he packed his personal belongings to the same suitcase left Temple Trees to Galle. He remained a bachelor throughout his life until he married the widow of his twin brother after his death in order to grant her a widow's pension which he was entitled to as a retired member of parliament.

Album concept The album featured mostly cover songs by bands such as Dio, Twisted Sister, Iron Maiden, Ozzy Osbourne and M√∂tley Cr√ºe, as Fozzy had a satirical back-story that they had spent the last 20 years in Japan being megastars and once they returned to America, they realized that many famous artists had ripped off their songs. However, the album featured two original songs by Fozzy, \\"End of Days\\" and \\"Feel the Burn\\", in which it was implied that the band had just recently written these songs and other bands hadn't had the chance to \\"rip\\" these songs off them. Release and reception Prior to the album's release, Megaforce had high hopes for the record, as they expected wrestling fans of the Attitude Era boom period to flock to Fozzy and buy the record. However, the album failed commercially and only managed to sell 4,225 copies. The album also failed to chart on the Billboard 200. Due to the poor commercial reception of the album, Megaforce cancelled plans for the release of the album in Europe and a Fozzy documentary DVD as well as several other endorsements and appearances.

It is served by a railway station on the Kyle of Lochalsh Line from Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh. History Achanalt in 1970 The Achanalt railway station was opened by the Dingwall and Skye Railway, but operated from the outset by the Highland Railway. Taken into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923, the line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced, the station became part of ScotRail until the Privatisation of British Rail. The Achanalt Power Station, commissioned in 1957 by James Shearer, lies less than a mile southwest of the Grudie Bridge Power Station. Culture Sir Arthur Bignold, MP for Wick Burghs in the early 20th century, was the proprietor of the Achanalt Inn (now Achanalt House), built in 1878. Bignold acquired the estates of Lochrosque and Strathbran, including the villages of Achanalt and Achnasheen, a castle at Lochrosque and lodges at Cabuie and Strathbran in 1885. Cabuie Lodge was lost below the waters of Loch Fannich in the 1950s and Lochrosque Castle has also been demolished. The estate at Strathbran including Achanalt passed to Bignold's grandson the Marquis de Torrehermosa and his family continue to live at Strathbran Lodge in Achanalt. The steeply sloping Cnoc na Bhain burial ground, one of Scotland's most beautiful graveyards, contains a memorial and grave of the pioneer aviator, Captain Bertram Dickson. Geography Grudie Bridge Power Station The village lies on the A832 road and the River Bran, and is near to the western shore of Loch Achanalt. To the north is Loch Fannich. The terrain in the area is rugged and marshy, typical of this part of the Highlands. The dominant local geographical feature is Loch Achanalt, roughly quadrangular, with a maximum diameter of approximately . Its water is shallow and reedy, and drains over , including the River Bran. The area between Achanalt and Achnasheen is characterised by a gentle slope down to the River Bran, and features two peaks, Scuir Vuillin and Scuir a Ghlas Leathaid . Fauna and flora Looking towards the head of the loch The Achanalt reservoir and marshes were designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest on 18 May 1989 as the area is an important nesting ground. It is in size. The marshes are characterised by mesotrophic grassland on a river valley flood plain. There are two waterlogged Carex Juncus communities that include bottle sedge, marsh pennywort, and bogbean. In a relatively drier area, short grass and sedge occur, mainly in winter. The marshes are sedge dominated, and these include common sedge, carnation sedge, flea sedge, and star sedge. Tawny sedge and dioecious sedge occur in flush line areas. The featured herbs include heath spotted orchid and common valerian. Purple moor grass and tufted hair grass are locally extensive. Four nationally rare species of breeding birds are located here. The open water and grassland areas of Achanalt marshes support an array of nesting birds. Waders include common sandpiper, curlew, dunlin, lapwing, oystercatcher, redshank, ringed plover, and snipe. Wildfowl include mallard, red-breasted merganser, teal, tufted duck, and wigeon. There is also a black-headed gull colony.

Biography Dean was born on the Isle of Man, where he was baptised on 6 September 1857. He moved to Manchester, and then to Preston, Lancashire around 1882. He decided to make a career in songwriting, and used the pseudonyms Harry Dacre and Henry Decker (which some sources state was his birth name). He later claimed to have sold some 600 songs in the first two years of his career, but his first popular success was with the song \\"The Ghost of Benjamin Binns\\", which was first sung by Harry Randall in Brighton in 1885. Claiming that the stress of constant songwriting was affecting his health, he emigrated to Australia, where he stayed for four years before returning to England and then leaving for America in 1891. He took with him an early version of the song \\"Daisy Bell\\", and a bicycle on which he had to pay import duty. Supposedly, his friend William Jerome told him that if he had brought a tandem he would have had to pay double, inspiring Dacre to rewrite the words of his song to refer to a \\"bicycle built for two\\". While in New York, he persuaded singer Katie Lawrence to perform the song when she appeared in London in 1892. The song soon became popular in London music halls, and then a worldwide hit. Dacre returned to London, and in 1895 set up his own publishing house, Frank Dean and Co.. He continued to write successful songs, including \\"Katie O'Connor\\" (1891); \\"I Can't Think of Nuthin' Else But You, Lulu\\" (1896); and \\"I'll Be Your Sweetheart\\" (1899), which became a popular success performed by Lil Hawthorne. When it became clear that the law could do little to prevent the pirating of sheet music, Dacre withdrew from the music business for several years, returning only when T. P. O'Connor's proposals were enacted in the 1906 Musical Copyright Act. Thereafter, Dacre lived in comfort in Langham Place in London. He died there in 1922.

A watermill was constructed to harness the power of the nearby Acharn Burn, and this was converted into a craft centre in the 1970s, and later into a private residence. There is a bridge in the middle that goes over the Acharn burn. The Falls of Acharn, a series of waterfalls with a total height of set in a steep wooded gorge, are a popular tourist attraction on the nearby Acharn Burn south of the hamlet. The steep Acharn Falls Walk is about straight up and down from the village, and is a dangerous place to walk dogs without leads, but provides scenic views of the falls above the village. The upper falls have a timber walkway constructed by the 202 Field Squadron RE (V) in June 1989. There is also Hermits Cave, possibly constructed by the Victorians as a kind of folly. William Wordsworth is known to have visited the falls in 1803 with his sister Dorothy, who noted in her diary the \\"very beautiful prospect\\" available of Loch Tay from the falls.

Meaning \\"field of the stones\\", 36 of the original 54 remain today, mostly on the western side of the structure. The arrangement of these stones is extremely rare as the slabs are pointing towards the centre of the circle, rather than the typical side-by- side arrangement. The angle of the stones themselves is also strange. In most British stone circles, stones face the center with flat sides, but Achavanich's stones face the row at 90 degree angles. The stone circle remains open like a letter U, and evidence suggests it never was closed.Britain Express, David Ross, http://www.britainexpress.com/scotland/Highlands/Caithness/achavanich.htm The largest of the 36 remaining stones stands at only 2 meters, with an overall average of 1.5 meters tall. Although the site stood for several decades neglected and overgrown within a fenced off area which visitors were requested not to enter, access has recently been vastly improved with the clearance of the site, the repositioning of fence boundaries and the installation of information boards. Background Achavanich is located near Loch Stemster in Caithness, Scotland. The tallest of its relatively small stones is 2 m (6 ft 6 in) high. Some stones may have been taller, but weathering has caused them to crack and split. Only 36 stones remain in the setting, although there may have been about 54 originally. At most stone circles the flat faces of the stones follow the line of the setting, but at Achavanich the flat faces are 'side on'. The stone slabs appear to be set into a low mound of earth and stone, possibly the result of leveling the central area. The purpose and date of this structure are unknown, but it is usually assumed to belong to the Bronze Age. Outside the northeast corner of the setting are some small slabs (possibly the remains of cist burials) protruding through the turf. Close to the southeast there are also the remains of a chambered cairn, situated on a knoll. The only other site with a similar structure is at Broubster, 23 km away, where 9 stones of a 32 stone setting survive, with the open end of the setting in Broubster at the south-south-west. The open end at Achavanich is at the south- east. Achavanich is estimated to be around 4000 years old, still young compared to 5000 year old burial mounds that litter the area. The structure was built of rock from the Caithness flagstone group.

They were first introduced by Isaac Newton in 1676 and rediscovered by Victor Puiseux in 1850.Puiseux (1850, 1851) For example, the series : T^{-2} + 2T^{-1/2} + T^{1/3} + 2T^{11/6} + T^{8/3} + 2T^{25/6} + T^5 + 2T^{13/2} + \\\\cdots is a Puiseux series in T. Puiseux's theorem, sometimes also called the Newton‚ÄìPuiseux theorem, asserts that, given a polynomial equation P(x,y)=0, its solutions in , viewed as functions of , may be expanded as Puiseux series that are convergent in some neighbourhood of the origin (0 excluded, in the case of a solution that tends to infinity at the origin). In other words, every branch of an algebraic curve may be locally (in terms of ) described by a Puiseux series. The set of Puiseux series over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 is itself an algebraically closed field, called the field of Puiseux series. It is the algebraic closure of the field of Laurent series. This statement is also referred to as Puiseux's theorem, being an expression of the original Puiseux theorem in modern abstract language. Puiseux series are generalized by Hahn series.  Formal definition  If K is a field (such as the complex numbers) then we can define the field of Puiseux series with coefficients in K informally as the set of expressions of the form :f = \\\\sum_{k=k_0}^{+\\\\infty} c_k T^{k/n} where n is a positive integer and k_0 is an arbitrary integer. In other words, Puiseux series differ from Laurent series in that they allow for fractional exponents of the indeterminate, as long as these fractional exponents have bounded denominator (here n). Just as with Laurent series, Puiseux series allow for negative exponents of the indeterminate as long as these negative exponents are bounded below (here by k_0). Addition and multiplication are as expected: for example, : (T^{-1} + 2T^{-1/2} + T^{1/3} + \\\\cdots) + (T^{-5/4} - T^{-1/2} + 2 + \\\\cdots) = T^{-5/4} + T^{-1} + T^{-1/2} + 2 + \\\\cdots and : (T^{-1} + 2T^{-1/2} + T^{1/3} + \\\\cdots) \\\\cdot (T^{-5/4} - T^{-1/2} + 2 + \\\\cdots) = T^{-9/4} + 2T^{-7/4} - T^{-3/2} + T^{-11/12} + 4T^{-1/2} + \\\\cdots. One might define them by first \\"upgrading\\" the denominator of the exponents to some common denominator and then performing the operation in the corresponding field of formal Laurent series of T^{1/N}. In other words, the field of Puiseux series with coefficients in K is the union of the fields K(\\\\\\\\!(T^{1/n})\\\\\\\\!) (where n ranges over the positive integers), where each element of the union is a field of formal Laurent series over T^{1/n} (considered as an indeterminate), and where each such field is considered as a subfield of the ones with larger n by rewriting the fractional exponents to use a larger denominator (so, for example, T^{1/2} is identified with T^{15/30} ). This yields a formal definition of the field of Puiseux series: it is the direct limit of the direct system, indexed over the non-zero natural numbers n ordered by divisibility, whose objects are all K(\\\\\\\\!(T)\\\\\\\\!) (the field of formal Laurent series, which we rewrite as K(\\\\\\\\!(T_n)\\\\\\\\!) for clarity), with a morphism K(\\\\\\\\!(T_m)\\\\\\\\!) \\\\to K(\\\\\\\\!(T_n)\\\\\\\\!) being given, whenever m divides n, by T_m \\\\mapsto (T_n)^{n/m}. = Valuation and order = The Puiseux series over a field K form a valued field with value group \\\\Q (the rationals): the valuation v(f) of a series :f = \\\\sum_{k=k_0}^{+\\\\infty} c_k T^{k/n} as above is defined to be the smallest rational k/n such that the coefficient c_k of the term with exponent k/n is non-zero (with the usual convention that the valuation of 0 is +‚àû). The coefficient c_k in question is typically called the valuation coefficient of f. This valuation in turn defines a (translation-invariant) distance (which is ultrametric), hence a topology on the field of Puiseux series by letting the distance from f to 0 be \\\\exp(-v(f)). This justifies a posteriori the notation :f = \\\\sum_{k=k_0}^{+\\\\infty} c_k T^{k/n} as the series in question does, indeed, converge to f in the Puiseux series field (this is in contrast to Hahn series which cannot be viewed as converging series). If the base field K is ordered, then the field of Puiseux series over K is also naturally (‚Äúlexicographically‚Äù) ordered as follows: a non-zero Puiseux series f with 0 is declared positive whenever its valuation coefficient is so. Essentially, this means that any positive rational power of the indeterminate T is made positive, but smaller than any positive element in the base field K. If the base field K is endowed with a valuation w, then we can construct a different valuation on the field of Puiseux series over K by letting the valuation \\\\hat w(f) be \\\\omega\\\\cdot v + w(c_k), where v=k/n is the previously defined valuation (c_k is the first non-zero coefficient) and œâ is infinitely large (in other words, the value group of \\\\hat w is \\\\Q \\\\times \\\\Gamma ordered lexicographically, where Œì is the value group of w). Essentially, this means that the previously defined valuation v is corrected by an infinitesimal amount to take into account the valuation w given on the base field. = Algebraic closedness of Puiseux series = One essential property of Puiseux series is expressed by the following theorem, attributed to Puiseux (for K=\\\\Complex) but which was implicit in Newton's use of the Newton polygon as early as 1671Newton (1736) and therefore known either as Puiseux's theorem or as the Newton‚ÄìPuiseux theorem:cf. Kedlaya (2001), introduction Theorem: If K is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, then the field of Puiseux series over K is the algebraic closure of the field of formal Laurent series over K.cf. Eisenbud (1995), corollary 13.15 (p. 295) Very roughly, the proof proceeds essentially by inspecting the Newton polygon of the equation and extracting the coefficients one by one using a valuative form of Newton's method. Provided algebraic equations can be solved algorithmically in the base field K, then the coefficients of the Puiseux series solutions can be computed to any given order. For example, the equation X^2 - X = T^{-1} has solutions :X = T^{-1/2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{8}T^{1/2} - \\\\frac{1}{128}T^{3/2} + \\\\cdots and :X = -T^{-1/2} + \\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{8}T^{1/2} + \\\\frac{1}{128}T^{3/2} + \\\\cdots (one readily checks on the first few terms that the sum and product of these two series are 1 and -T^{-1} respectively; this is valid whenever the base field K has characteristic different from 2). As the powers of 2 in the denominators of the coefficients of the previous example might lead one to believe, the statement of the theorem is not true in positive characteristic. The example of the Artin‚ÄìSchreier equation X^p - X = T^{-1} shows this: reasoning with valuations shows that X should have valuation -\\\\frac{1}{p}, and if we rewrite it as X = T^{-1/p} + X_1 then :X^p = T^{-1} + {X_1}^p,\\\\text{ so }{X_1}^p - X_1 = T^{-1/p} and one shows similarly that X_1 should have valuation -\\\\frac{1}{p^2}, and proceeding in that way one obtains the series :T^{-1/p} + T^{-1/p^2} + T^{-1/p^3} + \\\\cdots; since this series makes no sense as a Puiseux series‚Äîbecause the exponents have unbounded denominators‚Äîthe original equation has no solution. However, such Eisenstein equations are essentially the only ones not to have a solution, because, if K is algebraically closed of characteristic p>0, then the field of Puiseux series over K is the perfect closure of the maximal tamely ramified extension of K(\\\\\\\\!(T)\\\\\\\\!). Similarly to the case of algebraic closure, there is an analogous theorem for real closure: if K is a real closed field, then the field of Puiseux series over K is the real closure of the field of formal Laurent series over K.Basu &al (2006), chapter 2 (\\"Real Closed Fields\\"), theorem 2.91 (p. 75) (This implies the former theorem since any algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is the unique quadratic extension of some real-closed field.) There is also an analogous result for p-adic closure: if K is a p-adically closed field with respect to a valuation w, then the field of Puiseux series over K is also p-adically closed.Cherlin (1976), chapter 2 (\\"The Ax‚ÄìKochen‚ÄìErshof Transfer Principle\\"), ¬ß7 (\\"Puiseux series fields\\")  Puiseux expansion of algebraic curves and functions  = Algebraic curves = Let X be an algebraic curveWe assume that X is irreducible or, at least, that it is reduced and that it does not contain the y coordinate axis. given by an affine equation F(x,y)=0 over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero, and consider a point p on X which we can assume to be (0,0). We also assume that X is not the coordinate axis x = 0\\\\. Then a Puiseux expansion of (the y coordinate of) X at p is a Puiseux series f having positive valuation such that F(x,f(x))=0. More precisely, let us define the branches of X at p to be the points q of the normalization Y of X which map to p. For each such q, there is a local coordinate t of Y at q (which is a smooth point) such that the coordinates x and y can be expressed as formal power series of t, say x = t^n + \\\\cdots (since K is algebraically closed, we can assume the valuation coefficient to be 1) and y = c t^k + \\\\cdots: then there is a unique Puiseux series of the form f = c T^{k/n} + \\\\cdots (a power series in T^{1/n}), such that y(t)=f(x(t)) (the latter expression is meaningful since x(t)^{1/n} = t+\\\\cdots is a well-defined power series in t). This is a Puiseux expansion of X at p which is said to be associated to the branch given by q (or simply, the Puiseux expansion of that branch of X), and each Puiseux expansion of X at p is given in this manner for a unique branch of X at p.Shafarevich (1994), II.5, pp. 133‚Äì135Cutkosky (2004), chapter 2, pp. 3‚Äì11 This existence of a formal parametrization of the branches of an algebraic curve or function is also referred to as Puiseux's theorem: it has arguably the same mathematical content as the fact that the field of Puiseux series is algebraically closed and is a historically more accurate description of the original author's statement.Puiseux (1850), p. 397 For example, the curve y^2 = x^3 + x^2 (whose normalization is a line with coordinate t and map t \\\\mapsto (t^2-1,t^3-t)) has two branches at the double point (0,0), corresponding to the points t = +1 and t = ‚àí1 on the normalization, whose Puiseux expansions are y = x + \\\\frac{1}{2}x^2 - \\\\frac{1}{8}x^3 + \\\\cdots and y = - x - \\\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\\\frac{1}{8}x^3 + \\\\cdots respectively (here, both are power series because the x coordinate is √©tale at the corresponding points in the normalization). At the smooth point (‚àí1,0) (which is t = 0 in the normalization), it has a single branch, given by the Puiseux expansion y = -(x+1)^{1/2} + (x+1)^{3/2} (the x coordinate ramifies at this point, so it is not a power series). The curve y^2 = x^3 (whose normalization is again a line with coordinate t and map t \\\\mapsto (t^2,t^3)), on the other hand, has a single branch at the cusp point (0,0), whose Puiseux expansion is y = x^{3/2}. = Analytic convergence = When K=\\\\Complex is the field of complex numbers, the Puiseux expansion of an algebraic curve (as defined above) is convergent in the sense that for a given choice of n-th root of x, they converge for small enough x, hence define an analytic parametrization of each branch of X in the neighborhood of p (more precisely, the parametrization is by the n-th root of x).  Generalizations  = Levi-Civita field = The field of Puiseux series is not complete as a metric space. Its completion, called the Levi-Civita field, can be described as follows: it is the field of formal expressions of the form f = \\\\sum_e c_e T^e, where the support of the coefficients (that is, the set of e such that c_e eq 0) is the range of an increasing sequence of rational numbers that either is finite or tends to +‚àû. In other words, such series admit exponents of unbounded denominators, provided there are finitely many terms of exponent less than A for any given bound A. For example, \\\\sum_{k=1}^{+\\\\infty} T^{k+\\\\frac{1}{k}} is not a Puiseux series, but it is the limit of a Cauchy sequence of Puiseux series; in particular, it is the limit of \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N} T^{k+\\\\frac{1}{k}} as N \\\\to +\\\\infty. However, even this completion is still not \\"maximally complete\\" in the sense that it admits non-trivial extensions which are valued fields having the same value group and residue field, hence the opportunity of completing it even more. = Hahn series = Hahn series are a further (larger) generalization of Puiseux series, introduced by Hans Hahn in the course of the proof of his embedding theorem in 1907 and then studied by him in his approach to Hilbert's seventeenth problem. In a Hahn series, instead of requiring the exponents to have bounded denominator they are required to form a well-ordered subset of the value group (usually \\\\Q or \\\\R). These were later further generalized by Anatoly Maltsev and Bernhard Neumann to a non-commutative setting (they are therefore sometimes known as Hahn‚ÄìMal'cev‚ÄìNeumann series). Using Hahn series, it is possible to give a description of the algebraic closure of the field of power series in positive characteristic which is somewhat analogous to the field of Puiseux series.Kedlaya (2001)  Notes  See also * Laurent series * Madhava series * Newton's divided difference interpolation * Pad√© approximant  References    (Translated from Latin)  * *  External links  * *Puiseux series at MathWorld *Puiseux's Theorem at MathWorld *Puiseux series at PlanetMath Category:Commutative algebra Category:Algebraic curves Category:Mathematical series ","title":"Puiseux series"},{"id":"2604431","text":"The shoreline near Achinhoan Achinhoan is a settlement on the Kintyre peninsula in Argyll and Bute, Scotland.

The castle was vandalised in the 1970s, when the windows were smashed and the door removed, but it is not unknown for people to use the castle as a bothy. The detail design of this structure may give a clue to its popular name, as the entrance aperture consists of a tall but very narrow slit barely a foot wide. In this regard the design may be said to approach the concept of an anchorite's (or hermit's) cell, a ceremonially bricked up enclosure whose sole access was only large enough to allow for the passage of food in and waste out. Another feature of great interest is that the structure is perched quite high above, and close to the edge of, a small inlet of the sea, and the above-mentioned aperture is on the seaward side. This results in the need to enter the Castle from below. Such a location also suggests a defensive aspect to the design. Combined with the quite strong resemblance to a pill-box or similar military structure, this leads one to speculate exactly what the Castle's architect designer had in his mind when building it.

The village was one of several that were created in around 1823 in Lochs to accommodate tenants that had been evicted from other parts of the parish and island. It was founded by former tenants of the farm of Kirkibost on the island of Bernera. They claimed that they had been forced to give up their lease at the insistence of the Seaforth Estate, and had moved to Achmore and nearby Lochganvich with the agreement of the said Estate and with the promise of a 14-year lease of these farms. In the early 1830s, however, the Estate, having found a more profitable tenant or use for the land of these 1823 villages, began formal proceedings to evict the existing tenants, on the basis that they had no written lease. The other villages bowed to Estate pressure and disappeared, but Achmore seems to have been different. Six of the tenants of that farm ‚Äì John Maclennan Senior, John Macdonald Senior, John Mackenzie, Kenneth Maciver, Murdo Maciver and Finlay Maclean ‚Äì fought their eviction notices through the courts, ending up in the Court of Session in Edinburgh in 1833. Their defence was that although they had not been given a formal written lease, their occupation of the lands had been verbally agreed by the Estate Factor; that they had their names recorded in the estate rental logs; and that they paid their rents in full to the estate over those previous nine years. They also produced an estate document from 1823 which detailed how the farms of Achmore and Lochganvich should be lotted into 20 holdings together with a defined lot size of three acres, and rules by which the hill ground should operate in shared usage. It also suggested that 14 years would be the ordinary lease period.John Maclennan & Others v Patrick Coburn & Others, Court of Session, Edinburgh, 1833 Ultimately, they were successful, and so they were allowed to stay. Early history The remains of a fallen ancient stone circle lie close to the village. It was sited to link rare risings and settings of the moon and the sun with a hill range looking like a sleeping (and, only from the Achmore stone circle, pregnant) woman, called \\"Sleeping Beauty\\". The circle was discovered in 1981 and measures 41 metres across. The circle was built around 3000 BC and probably consisted of 22 slabs up to two metres tall, two of which remain standing.

He was born in London as the youngest of 8 children to a family of steel merchants from Leeds. As a school boy he did water analysis with the Leeds City Analyst. He studied chemistry at the University of Leeds with Julius B. Cohen and after he worked with Albrecht Kossel on arginase at the University of Heidelberg he joined Columbia University in 1905, working in the lab of Christian Herter. During his work on amino acids he obtained his PhD from Leeds. In 1905, he was one of the first scientists to successfully synthesise adrenaline in the laboratory (see: History of catecholamine research). In 1914 he went back to England to offer his service with the war effort. Due to a request for a chemist by Alexis Carrel to the Rockefeller Institute, Dakin joined Carrel in 1916 at a temporary hospital in Compi√®gne. There they developed the Carrel‚ÄìDakin method of wound treatments. This consisted of intermittently irrigating the wound with Dakin's solution, a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in common liquid bleach products) and boric acid. In the process, he analyzed more than 200 candidate substances, and developed quantitative methods to evaluate their effectiveness for disinfection and wound healing. The solution is still widely used for that purpose, as of 2013. After he married the widow of Christian Herter in 1916, he worked in his private laboratory in Scarsdale, New York and had several close collaborations with other scientists. His main working fields were amino acids and enzymes. The extraction of amino acids from hydrolyzed peptides by butanol was invented by him. He also was interested in organic chemistry and synthesis, and devised the Dakin reaction and the Dakin‚ÄìWest reaction. He died shortly after the death of his wife in early 1952.

He is also life president and former chairman of Newcastle United Football Club.  Biography  The son of a miner, Hall was born and brought up in North Seaton, Ashington, Northumberland, and he attended nearby Bedlington Grammar School until 1949. Before starting his own business career, he worked in the mining industry as a surveyor. In the 1980s, Hall's company, Cameron Hall Developments, masterminded the construction of the MetroCentre shopping mall in Dunston, Gateshead. The development was not without its critics; reputedly, the script of the BBC drama Our Friends in the North was changed to remove a character resembling Sir John who took advantage of tax breaks to build a shopping centre. Hall's company bought Woolsington Hall, northwest of Newcastle, in 1994. Hall has planned several developments of the site, including a football academy and a luxury hotel with golf course. In 2002, the hall was added to English Heritage's Heritage at Risk Register and, as of 2013, is vacant and requiring full restoration. In April 2010, Hall announced that he was suffering from inoperable prostate cancer and was about to embark on a course of intensive chemotherapy.The Guardian, 7 April 2010 As of February 2011, the cancer was being kept under control by medication and Hall was concentrating on his final project, a ¬£2.5-million rose garden at his Wynyard Park estate.The Daily Telegraph, 15 February 2011 On 10 February 2011, at a ceremony at the Shipley Art Gallery, Hall and his wife were given the freedom of Gateshead for their services to leisure, retail, business and sport.  Newcastle United Football Club  Hall began his ownership of the team by taking over Newcastle United in a bitter battle for control and appointing Kevin Keegan as manager in February 1992. Keegan turned the club's fortunes around, taking the team from the brink of relegation into the Third Division, to competing with Manchester United for the Premier League in 1996. After taking over Newcastle United, Hall announced his intention to create a \\"sporting club\\" along similar lines to multi-sport institutions in Europe such as FC Barcelona. To this end he also bought the Newcastle Falcons (rugby union), the Newcastle Eagles (basketball), and the Durham Wasps (ice hockey) in 1995. The Wasps were subsequently moved to Sunderland's Crowtree Leisure Centre. They were renamed the Newcastle Cobras when they moved to Newcastle Arena the following season. Hall planned to build a new rugby, football and ice-skating stadium at Leazes Park but the scheme was rejected after a 38,000-signature petition against it was organised by local residents. Instead, he began rebuilding St James' Park, Newcastle United's stadium, where the Leazes End stand is now the Sir John Hall Stand. Although he proved very popular with the club's fans, questions as to whether his involvement with Newcastle United was anything other than profitable opportunism have been raised. In 1997, Hall passed chairmanship of the club to Freddy Shepherd and his family interests in the club to his son, Douglas. He then sold his entire 41.6% shareholding to sports retail magnate Mike Ashley for ¬£55 million on 23 May 2007, valuing the club at ¬£133.1 million. Politics Hall has donated more than ¬£500,000 to the Conservative Party and helped to fund Theresa May's snap general election in 2017. In May 2017, he gave ¬£25,000 to the Conservative Party. In February 2018, he expressed disapproval over what he described as May's indecisiveness about Brexit and her lack of domestic policies.

History  With the advent of email, many mailing lists were maintained manually, with a list owner adding and removing participants by editing a text file. In 1984, LISTSERV was developed to run on IBM VM mainframes, and automated mailing lists on a large scale. Most mailing lists moved to commercial mailing list hosting services, often with a stipend of $100 or more paid to the list owner by the hosting service in exchange for the transfer. Most of those hosting providers were subsequently bought out by Yahoo!, and merged into its Yahoo! Groups service. Majordomo has been in widespread use since 1992, predating the popularity of the web browser, in an era when many people had access to email but the World Wide Web did not enjoy wide deployment. As a result, tasks such as subscribing and unsubscribing are only handled by sending mail messages. There are front-ends, such as MajorCool, to provide a web interface. Many mailing lists still use Majordomo. = Majordomo 2 = As of 18 May 2004, there was work being done to completely rewrite Majordomo with a focus on keeping the familiar email interface while greatly improving the web interface and other features.

Early life The only son of Sir Robert Tuite Boothby, KBE, of Edinburgh and a cousin of Rosalind Grant, mother of the broadcaster Sir Ludovic Kennedy, Boothby was educated at St Aubyns School, Eton College, and Magdalen College, Oxford. Before going up to Oxford, near the end of the First World War, he trained as an officer and was commissioned into the Brigade of Guards, but was too young to see active service.Article by John Grigg. Boothby read History at Oxford University; the shortened war course was not classed, being marked either 'Pass' or 'Fail'. He attended a few lectures and did some general reading, but, as he cheerfully observed, \\"there were far too many other things to do\\".Robert Rhodes James, Robert Boothby: A Portrait of Churchill's Ally, Harmondsworth: Viking Penguin, 1991, pp. 38‚Äì39 He achieved a pass without distinction in 1921.Oxford University Calendar 1925, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1925, p. 229 After Oxford, he became a partner in a firm of stockbrokers. Politics Portrait by Allan Warren (1974) He was an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for Orkney and Shetland in 1923 and was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Aberdeen and Kincardine East in 1924. He held the seat until its abolition in 1950, when he was elected for its successor constituency of East Aberdeenshire. Re-elected a final time in 1955, he gave up the seat in 1958 when he was raised to the peerage, triggering a by- election. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill from 1926 to 1929. He helped launch the Popular Front in December 1936.The Liberal Party and the Popular Front, English Historical Review (2006) He held junior ministerial office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food in 1940‚Äì41. He was later forced to resign his post and go to the back benches for not declaring an interest when asking a parliamentary question. During the Second World War he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and served as a junior staff officer with Bomber Command, and later as a liaison officer with the Free French Forces, retiring with the rank of Flight Lieutenant. In 1950 he received the Legion of Honour for his latter services. In 1954 (echoing words he had said in 1934) he complained that for 30 years he had been advocating \\"a constructive policy on broad lines\\" but that this had not been taken up: \\"The doctrine of infallibility has always applied to the Treasury and the Bank of England\\". Boothby opposed free trade in food stuffs, and claimed that such a policy would invalidate the Agriculture Act 1947 and ruin British farmers. This economic liberalism of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rab Butler, led to Boothby complaining that \\"The Tory Party have in fact become the Liberal Party\\" and cited what the leader of the Liberal Party (Clement Davies) had said to him about Butler: \\"Sir Robert Peel has come again.\\"COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC CONFERENCE HC Deb 04 February 1954 vol 523 cc576-695 In response, Davies claimed that Boothby \\"has been sitting on the wrong side of the House for many years. Undoubtedly he said tonight that he is the planner of planners. I do not believe in that kind of planning. The hon. Member seems to know better than the ordinary person what is good for the ordinary person, what he ought to buy, where he ought to buy it, where he ought to manufacture and everything else of that kind. There is the true Socialist\\". Boothby was a British delegate to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe from 1949 until 1957 and advocated the United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community (a predecessor of the European Union). He was a prominent commentator on public affairs on radio and television, often taking part in the long-running BBC radio programme Any Questions. He also advocated the virtues of herring as a food.Referred to in passing during Face to Face, BBC Television, 27 May 1959. He was Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Economic Affairs, 1952‚Äì1956; Honorary President of the Scottish Chamber of Agriculture, 1934; Rector of the University of St Andrews, 1958‚Äì1961; Chairman of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, 1961‚Äì1963; and President, Anglo-Israel Association, 1962‚Äì1975. He was awarded an Honorary LLD by St Andrews in 1959, and was made an Honorary Burgess of the Burghs of Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Turriff and Rosehearty. He was appointed an Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1950, and a KBE in 1953. Boothby was raised to the peerage as a life peer with the title Baron Boothby, of Buchan and Rattray Head in the County of Aberdeen, on 22 August 1958. There is a blue plaque on his house in Eaton Square, London. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in October 1963, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at BBC Television Centre. = Homosexual law reform = During the 1950s, Boothby was a prominent advocate of decriminalizing homosexual acts between men. In his memoirs, he wrote that he was determined to \\"do something practical to remove the fear and misery in which many of our most gifted citizens were then compelled to live\\". In December 1953, he sent a memorandum to David Maxwell Fyfe, then the Home Secretary, calling for the establishment of a departmental inquiry into homosexuality. He argued that: > By attaching so fearful a stigma to homosexuality as such, you put a very > large number of otherwise law-abiding and useful citizens on the other side > of the fence which divides the good citizen from the bad. By making them > feel that, instead of unfortunates they are social pariahs, you drive them > into squalor ‚Äì perhaps into crime; and produce that very \\"underground\\" which > it is so clearly in the public interest to eradicate. Boothby premised his argument for law reform on the idea that it was the role of the state \\"not to _punish_ psychological disorders ‚Äì rather to try and cure them\\". He argued in the House of Commons that the law as it was did not \\"achieve the objective of all of us, which is to limit the incidence of homosexuality and to mitigate its evil effects\\".HANSARD 1803‚Äì2005; HC Deb 28 April 1954, vol. 526, c1750. After the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution recommended decriminalization in the Wolfenden Report of 1957, Boothby claimed that, through his correspondence with Fyfe, he had been \\"primarily responsible\\" for the committee's establishment. Personal life Boothby had a colourful, if reasonably discreet, private life, mainly because the press refused to print what they knew of him, or were prevented from doing so. Woodrow Wyatt, whose reliability has been questioned,David Sexton, \\"Don't believe all those diary droolings\\", Evening Standard (12 October 1998), A 11: \\"Robert Rhodes James, the editor of Chips Channon's entertaining diaries, advised caution in believing them. 'Even if the diarist is not attempting to give a deliberately false version, a talented writer can easily over-dramatise...' There is plenty of internal evidence that Wyatt should be approached with a similar caution.\\"Stephen Lomax, Valentine Low, \\"Did he drool? What a horrible thought\\", Evening Standard (19 October 1998), p. 15.Petronella Wyatt, \\"All of a tremble\\", The Spectator (31 October 1998), p. 71. claimed after the death of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother that she had confided to him in an interview in 1991 that \\"The press knew all about it\\", referring to Boothby's affairs, and that she had described Boothby as \\"a bounder but not a cad\\".Cullen, Pamela V., A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams, London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, pp. 617‚Äì18 From 1930, Boothby had a long affair with Lady Dorothy Macmillan, wife of the Conservative politician Harold Macmillan (prime minister from 1957 to 1963). He was rumoured to be the father of the youngest Macmillan daughter, Sarah, although the 2010 biography of Harold Macmillan by D. R. Thorpe discounts Boothby's paternity.D. R. Thorpe, Supermac: The Life of Harold Macmillan (London: Pimlico, paperback edition, 2011, p. 100. London: Chatto & Windus, Kindle ed., 2010, locs. 2467, 2477). This connection to Macmillan, via his wife, has been seen as one of the reasons why the police did not investigate the death of Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire, who died in the presence of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. The duke was Lady Dorothy's brother, and it is thought the police were wary of drawing press attention to her while she was being unfaithful. Boothby was married twice. His first wife (married 1935) was Diana Cavendish, daughter of Lord Richard Cavendish, and Lady Dorothy's first cousin; Boothby married her after concluding his relationship with the married Lady Dorothy to be \\"on the wane\\". He swiftly realised the marriage had been a mistake (it went on to be a source of long-lasting guilt for him) and it was dissolved in 1937. His second wife (married 1967) was Wanda Sanna, a Sardinian woman 33 years his junior. His second cousin, writer and broadcaster Sir Ludovic Kennedy, asserted that Boothby fathered at least three children by the wives of other men (\\"two by one woman, one by another\\").Matthew Parris and Kevin Maguire, Great Parliamentary Scandals: Five Centuries of Calumny, Smear and Innuendo, Robson Books, 2004, p116 =Sexuality and the Kray twins= Blue plaque in Eaton Square, London Partly because of his support for homosexual law reform, Boothby was subject to public rumours about his sexuality, although he insisted publicly in 1954 that he was \\"not a homosexual\\". He did, however, comment that \\"sub-conscious bi-sexuality is a component part of all of us [and] the majority of males pass through a homosexual period\\".Robert Rhodes James, Bob Boothby: A Portrait (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1991), p. 40. Whilst an undergraduate at Magdalen College, Oxford, Boothby earned the nickname 'the Palladium', because \\"he was twice nightly\\".\\"Lords of the Underworld\\", Secret History, Channel 4 (23 June 1997). He later spoke about the role of a speculated homosexual relationship in the drowning of his friend Michael Llewelyn Davies (one of the models for Peter Pan) and fellow Oxonian Rupert Buxton. In a Channel 4 documentary broadcast in 1997, it was claimed that he did not begin to have physical relationships with women until the age of 25. In 1963, Boothby began an affair with East End cat burglar Leslie Holt (d. 1979), a younger man he met at a gambling club. Holt introduced him to the gangster Ronald Kray, the Kray twin, who allegedly supplied Boothby with young men and arranged orgies in Cedra Court (the apartment block in Hackney where the Kray twins lived), receiving favours from Boothby in return. When Boothby's underworld associations came to the attention of the Sunday Express, the Conservative-supporting newspaper opted not to publish the damaging story.David Barrett \\"Letters shed new light on Kray twins scandal\\", The Sunday Telegraph, 26 July 2009\\"Reggie Kray: Notorious gangster\\", BBC News, 1 October 2000 The matter was eventually reported in 1964 in the Labour-supporting Sunday Mirror tabloid, and the parties subsequently named by the German magazine Stern.\\"The Kray Twins: Brothers in Arms\\" on truTV Boothby denied the story and threatened to sue the Mirror. His close friend Tom Driberg‚Äîa senior Labour MP, and also homosexual‚Äîalso associated with the Krays; hence, neither of the major political parties had an interest in publicity, and the newspaper's owner Cecil King came under pressure from the Labour leadership to drop the matter. The Mirror backed down, sacked its editor, apologised and paid Boothby ¬£40,000 in an out-of-court settlement. Other newspapers became less willing to cover the Krays' criminal activities, which continued for three more years. The police investigation received no support from Scotland Yard, while Boothby embarrassed his fellow peers by campaigning on behalf of the Krays in the Lords, until their increasing violence made association impossible. It has been claimed that journalists who investigated Boothby were subjected to legal threats and break-ins, and that much of this suppression was directed by Arnold Goodman.Toffs and Crims, \\"Episode 2: The Gangster and the Pervert Peer\\", Richard Bond (Channel 4, 16 February 2009) [television documentary].  \\"Heil Boothby!\\"  In his book on Winston Churchill, Boris Johnson characterises the effect on reputations of prominent British MPs and aristocrats for favourable comments after meeting Hitler in Germany in the earlier 1930s. He singles out Boothby for avoiding such an effect by his response there to the Heil Hitler! salute, which was \\"Heil Boothby!\\"Boris Johnson, 2014.

He is best known for the Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas effect, the de Haas‚Äìvan Alphen effect and the Einstein‚Äìde Haas effect. Personal life Wander de Haas was born in Lisse, a small town near Leiden. He was the son of Albertus de Haas, principal of the Teacher's College in Middelburg, and Maria Efting. On 22 December 1910 he married Geertruida Luberta Lorentz, the eldest daughter of Hendrik Lorentz. They had two daughters and two sons. He was an atheist. Education After attending high school in Middelburg, de Haas started paralegal studies in 1895. After completion of two of three parts of the examinations and having worked in a lawyer's office for some time, he decided to change career and become a physicist instead. After passing the qualifications exams for admission to University, he started to study physics at the University of Leiden in 1900 under Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and Johannes Petrus Kuenen. He earned his doctorate in 1912, under Kamerlingh Onnes, with a thesis entitled: Measurements on the Compressibility of Hydrogen. Career After getting his degree, de Haas worked in Berlin as a researcher at the Physikalische Reichsanstalt. Then he returned to the Netherlands, worked as a schoolteacher in Deventer, a conservator of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, and then a physics professor in Delft Technical School and University of Groningen. In 1925, he became a professor in Leiden, and one of the two heads of the Laboratory of physics, succeeding Kamerlingh Onnes. In 1948, de Haas retired. An example of the equipment (an electromagnet of c.1930) used for his low-temperature research can be seen in the Boerhaave Museum, the history of science museum in Leiden. In 1922 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Twenty years later, in 1942, he was forced to resign. After World War II ended in 1945, he was allowed to rejoin as a member.

His grandson Robert the Bruce eventually became King of Scots. Life =Early life= Robert was son of Robert Bruce, 4th Lord of Annandale and Isobel of Huntingdon. Widely known as Robert the Noble, he was also grandson of David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon and Matilda de Kevilloc of Chester, Great- grandson of Henry of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon and Northumberland and Ada de Warenne and Great-great grandson of King David I of Scotland and Maud, Countess of Huntingdon. In addition to Annandale, Robert was Lord of Hartlepool (otherwise known as Hartness) in county Durham, and Writtle and Hatfield Broadoak in Essex, England. His first wife brought to him the village of Ripe, in Sussex, and his second wife the Lordship of Ireby in Cumberland.Richardson (2005) p.731 His possessions were increased following the defeat of Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham (1265), via a series of grants that included the estates of the former rebel barons Walter de Fauconberg, John de Melsa and his brother Bernard. These grants were possibly compensation for the ransom his son Robert, negotiated and paid to his brother Bernard, and nephew Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester, for his release following his capture, at the Battle of Lewes (1264). Henry III also re- appointed Robert a Justice, and Constable of Carlisle Castle and keeper of the Castle there in 1267, a position he had been dismissed from in 1255. Robert sought pardon from Alexander and probably joined the princes Edward and Edmund on their August 1270-74 crusade, as Robert if not Richard possibly failed to attend, or returned early, as the younger Robert is recorded as receiving a quitclaim in Writtle, Essex in October 1271Dictionary of National BiographyBlakely, Ruth Margaret. The Brus Family in England and Scotland: 1100‚Äì1295 In 1271‚Äì2, Robert obtained the hand of Marjorie of Carrick, the young widowed heiress of Niall of Carrick, 2nd Earl of Carrick for his son, also called Robert de Brus. Around this time his first wife Isabella de Clare of Gloucester and Hertford died. The last recording of her of that she received the gift of deer from King Henry in Essex in 1271. On 3 May 1273 Robert married Christina de Ireby, the Widow of Adam Jesmond, the Sheriff of Northumberland. This marriage added estates in Cumberland and dower land from her previous husband to the Brus holdings. Following the marriage, Robert appears to have restricted himself to the management of the family's northern possessions, leaving the southern to his sons. Robert Bruce was Regent of Scotland some time during minority of his second cousin King Alexander III of Scotland (1241‚Äì1286) and was occasionally recognised as a Tanist of the Scottish throne. He was the closest surviving male relative to the king: Margaret of Huntingdon's issue were all females up until birth of Hugh Balliol sometime in the 1260s. When Alexander yet was childless, he was officially named as heir presumptive, but never gained the throne as Alexander managed to beget three children. The succession in the main line of the House of Dunkeld became highly precarious when towards the end of Alexander's reign, all three of his children died within a few years. The middle-aged Alexander III induced in 1284 the Estates to recognise as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter Margaret, called the \\"Maid of Norway\\", his only surviving descendant. The need for a male heir led Alexander to contract a second marriage to Yolande de Dreux on 1 November 1285. All this was eventually in vain. Alexander died suddenly, in a fall from his horse, when only 45 years old, in 1286. His death ushered in a time of political upheaval for Scotland. His three-year-old granddaughter Margaret, who lived in Norway, was recognised as his successor. However, the then 7-year old heiress Margaret died, travelling towards her kingdom, on the Orkney Islands around 26 September 1290. With her death, the main royal line came to an end and thirteen claimants asserted their rights to the Scottish Throne. =The Great Cause= Photograph of a seal of Robert Bruce V, Lord of Annandale, 1291.Stevenson, JH (1914). Heraldry in Scotland. Vol. 1. Glasgow: James Maclehose and Sons. The image appears between pages 196 and 197, on plate xxx, figure 5. After this extinction of the senior line of the Scottish royal house (the line of William I of Scotland) David of Huntingdon's descendants were the primary candidates for the throne. The two most notable claimants to the throne, John Balliol and Robert himself represented descent through David's daughters Margaret and Isobel respectively. Robert Bruce pleaded tanistry and proximity of blood in the succession dispute. He descended from the second daughter of David of Huntingdon, whereas John Balliol descended from the eldest, and thus had the lineal right. However, Robert was a second cousin of kings of Scotland and descended in 4th generation from King David I of Scotland, whereas John Balliol was a third cousin of kings and descended in 5th generation from King David I, the most recent common ancestor who had been Scottish king. The ensuing 'Great Cause' was concluded in 1292. It gave the Crown of Scotland to his family's great rival, John Balliol. The events took place as follows: Soon after the death of young queen Margaret, Robert Bruce raised a body of men with the help of the Earls of Mar and Atholl and marched to Perth with a considerable following and uncertain intentions. Bishop William Fraser of St. Andrews, worried of the possibility of civil war, wrote to Edward I of England, asking for his assistance in choosing a new monarch. Edward took this chance to demand sasine of the Scottish royal estate, but agreed to pass judgment in return for recognition of his suzerainty. The guardians of Scotland denied him this, but Robert Bruce was quick to pay homage. All the claimants swore oaths of homage, and John Balliol was the last to do so. The guardians were forced to concede and were thus reinstated by Edward. Judgment processed slowly. On 3 August 1291 Edward asked both Balliol and Bruce to choose forty auditors while he himself chose twenty-four, to decide the case. After considering all of the arguments, in early November the court decided in favour of John Balliol, having the superior claim in feudal law, not to mention greater support from the kingdom of Scotland. In accordance with this, final judgement was given by Edward on 17 November. On 30 November, John Balliol was crowned as King of Scots at Scone Abbey. On 26 December, at Newcastle upon Tyne, King John swore homage to Edward I for the kingdom of Scotland. Edward soon made it clear that he regarded the country as his vassal state. The Bruce family thus lost what they regarded as their rightful place on the Scottish throne. =Later years= Robert, 5th Lord of Annandale resigned the lordship of Annandale and his claim to the throne to his eldest son Robert de Brus. Shortly afterwards, in 1292, the younger Robert's wife Marjorie of Carrick died and the earldom of Carrick, which Robert had ruled jure uxoris, devolved upon their eldest son, also called Robert, the future King. In 1292, Robert V de Brus held a market at Ireby, Cumberland, in right of his wife. The following year he had a market at Hartlepool, county Durham within the liberties of the Bishop of Durham.Richardson (2005) p.732 Sir Robert de Brus died at Lochmaben Castle and was buried at Gisborough Priory in Cleveland. Family and children He married firstly on 12 May 1240 Lady Isabella de Clare (2 November 1226 ‚Äì after 10 July 1264), daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford and 5th Earl of Gloucester and Lady Isabel Marshal, with issue: *Isabel de Brus (1249 ‚Äì c. 1284), married (as his first wife) Sir John FitzMarmaduke, Knt., of Horden, Eighton, Lamesley, Ravensholm, and Silksworth, County Durham, Sheriff of North Durham, and Joint Warden beyond the Scottish Sea between the Firth of Forth and Orkney. He fought on the English side at the Battle of Falkirk, 22 July 1298, and was present at the Siege of Caerlaverock Castle in 1300. In 1307 he was commanded to assist the Earl of Richmond in expelling Robert de Brus and the Scottish rebels from Galloway. In 1309 his armour and provisions in a vessel bound for Perth were arrested off Great Yarmouth. He was governor of St. John's Town (Perth) in 1310 until his death. Isabel was buried at Easington, County Durham.Richardson (2005) p.539 *Robert VI the Bruce, 6th Lord of Annandale, Earl of Carrick (1243‚Äì1304) *William de Brus, married Elizabeth de Sully, without issue *Sir Bernard de Bruce, of Connington, married firstly Alicia de Clare and married secondly Constance de Morleyn, and had: Sir John Bruce, of Exton, married and had: *Jane Bruce, married Sir Nicholas Green *John de Brus (d. 1275), alleged ancestor of Barons of Clackmannan, Earls of Elgin, Kincardine and Ailesbury *Richard de Brus (died ca. 26 January 1287), unmarried and without issue.

Despite claims by amateur genealogists that he had another daughter named Constance, there is no evidence that Robert was her father.A woman named Constance Bruce, born circa 1251, who married a William Scott, has been attributed to Robert by some amateur genealogists.

However, since 2016, due to mergers between several Norwegian institutions, the structure of Grieg Academy has changed and its remaining components are expected to be a doctoral research school (Grieg Research School in Interdisciplinary Music Studies) and various research groups. Specifically, this is due to a merger between the University of Bergen‚Äôs Faculty of Humanities with the Bergen Academy of Art and Design, as well as a nearly simultaneous merger between Bergen University College and two other university colleges in western Norway: Stord/Haugesund University College and Sogn og Fjordane University College to become, in January 2017, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL) The music programs across HVL briefly became the largest music department in western Norway in terms of the number of full time teachers, but this has rapidly changed due to an unofficial policy of not replacing retiring teachers. Due to an array of mergers, the background of \\"Grieg Academy\\" is complex. One prominent institution, which until recently has referred to itself in English as the \\"Grieg Institute\\" (or \\"Griegakademiet - Institutt for musikk\\" in Norwegian) is the music conservatory in Bergen, and a department of the University of Bergen (UiB). However, Norway's oldest music degree program,Noralf Mork, The Fate of Innovation: A Social History of Creativity and Curriculum Control (PhD dissertation, University of Brighton, 2008) and the institution that has for the longest been called \\"Griegakademiet\\" in Norwegian - and \\"Grieg Academy\\" in English - is the music education department incorporated into Bergen University College (HiB), which in 2017 becomes part of Western Norway University of Applied Sciences. \\"Griegakademiet\\" has appeared for many years in official documents and on street signs for all entrances as well as hallways to the former music department of HiB (in Land√•s), which was the largest music education program in Norway (with alumni of over 1000 music teachers), offering bachelor's and master's degrees and teacher certification. HiB is also the \\"Grieg Academy\\" that in 2002 hosted one of the world's largest music education conferences. The UiB music department, in contrast to the HiB music department, used to be called the \\"Bergen Conservatory,\\" and now has a slightly larger number of full-time music faculty, emphasizes elite performance studies rather than music teacher education, and is more centrally-located in downtown Bergen. Significance of bi-institutional context Although the scenario of a shared name might appear to suggest competing interests (and indeed there was resistance to a full merger proposed in the 1990s), several instructors have taught music concurrently at both institutions, and some signs of a healthy partnership have been evident between musicians and programs at these two schools which have rather different emphases. According to the history explained in Norwegian on the Grieg Academy-UiB's official website, ‚Äútowards the end of the 1980s, the conservatory faced major restructuring, and a government report recommended closer cooperation with the University of Bergen. In the autumn of 1995, Nina Grieg's 150th birthday and 90 years after Torgrim Castberg first opened the Music Academy, the Conservatoire was founded as an ‚Äòinstitute‚Äô at the University of Bergen, and ‚ÄòGrieg Academy‚Äô was established as a ceiling (or umbrella ...) of all music education programs under both the University of Bergen and Bergen University College.‚Äù Also, according to a 1996 report from the website of University of Bergen, ‚ÄúThe Grieg Academy is a partnership between the University and Bergen University College who has since earlier been offering a major in music education. This academic partnership rests on three pillars: music pedagogy at the former teachers college and applied/creative music and musicology at the University.‚Äù Due to both marketing strategies and inter-institutional politics, the Grieg Academy-UiB has in recent years increasingly taken a public stance implying that it is \\"the\\" Grieg Academy, yet for those who know this history it remains undeniably clear that \\"the Grieg Academy\\" has actually referred to multiple institutions, University of Bergen and Bergen University College, with some forms of collaboration. In recent years, the folk music school Ole Bull Academy in nearby Voss (named after renowned violin virtuoso Ole Bull), has also been to some extent brought under the Grieg Academy umbrella. The name Grieg may be traced to Norway's most famous composer Edvard Grieg, a native son of Bergen, and the tradition of naming music schools after famous composers is evident across Europe, including the Sibelius Academy, Liszt Academy, and Mozarteum. Grieg Academy-UiB The Music department of the University of Bergen (UiB), since 2017 incorporated into the Faculty of Fine Art, Music and Design, was founded in 1905 as the Bergen Musikkonservatorium (Bergen Music Conservatory) by T. Castberg. (eBook). It offers 4-year undergraduate programs in Performance, Composition and Pedagogy/Music Education, and also 2-year Masters programs in Performance, Composition and Ethnomusicology. The Academy maintains a population of approximately 160 students, A permanent staff of 25 and numerous part-time faculty. The Griegakademiet-Institutt for musikk has also partnered itself with two of the elite bands in the Hordaland area: the brass band Eikanger-Bj√∏rsvik Musikklag and the wind band Dragefjellets Musikkorps (Bergen Symphonic Band). Many faculty members are also members and principal players of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra. Notable faculty include professor Per Hannevold (bassoon and orchestral studies), professor (II) Gro Schibsted Sandvik (flute), guitarist Stein-Erik Olsen, professor Brynjulf Stige (music therapist), Tom Solomon (ethnomusicologist), and professor Harald Bj√∏rk√∏y (voice). Alumni from the Academy include Leif Ove Andsnes, Harald S√¶verud, and Torstein Aagaard-Nilsen. The department's music therapy program, Grieg Academy Center for Music Therapy (GAMUT) is especially well-known, and attracts many postgraduate students and funding for PhD research projects. Grieg Academy-HiB The original Grieg Academy- the music department in the Faculty of Education at Bergen University College (HiB/HVL) - was the very first institution in Norway to offer a music degree (established in Land√•s in 1958 by Ivar Benum:no:Ivar Benum), and the first to offer a postgraduate degree in music education, and was the nation's largest music education degree program until recent years, with studies primarily for those who plan to become music teachers, music teacher educators, or arts researchers and cultural policy-makers. Although its emphasis is on music education rather than performance studies, the faculty includes performers, composers, conductors, and musicologists, and it has been affiliated with arts research centers for which PhD students are frequently in residence. Notable music Professors and Lecturers at HiB include Thorolf Kr√ºger (educational theorist), David G. Hebert (sociomusicologist), Tiri Bergesen Schei (choral conductor and music phenomenologist), Catharina Christophersen (educational researcher), Jostein Stalheim (composer), and Egil Haugland (guitarist and guitar maker). Notable alumni of the HiB Griegakademiet at Land√•s include renowned brass band conductor and arranger Tom Brevik, Opera Bergen producer and director Anne Randine √òverby, choral conductor Per Oddvar Hildre, award- winning jazz pianist Dag Arnesen, and several of Norway's most renowned songwriters and rock musicians, such as the leaders of Kaizers Orchestra and Odd Nordstoga, and the school is often given some credit for the recent ‚ÄúBergen Wave\\" of popular music. Professional opera singers to have come from the HiB/HVL music department, before seeking additional training in Norway and abroad, include Lise Davidsen and Ingvild Schultze-Florey. In the fields of music academia and music industry/management, notable graduates from HiB-Grieg Academy's music education programs include: Associate Professor Tom Eide Osa, Associate Professor Steinar Saetre, Associate Professor Ketil Thorgersen, CEO Gisle Johnsen, and international festival manager/jazz pianist Dr. Oystein Kvinge. Choir conductor Maria Gamborg Helbekkmo became Emeritus Professor in 2012. Torunn Bakken Hauge (rhythmic music pedagogue) retired in 2018. In 2019, a Full Professor, Nj√•l Vindenes (guitarist), resigned in protest (with much media attention) as the music programs continued to be radically downsized, worsened by a merger and restructure, to become less than half their original size. The department is located on Floor 4 of a new 51,000 square metre building constructed in 2014 for Bergen University College, in Kronstad, just south of downtown Bergen. The HiB Faculty of Education currently has 2300 students and 150 staff members (around 17 of whom are full-time in music at Griegakademiet), and music is the oldest (and formerly, largest) graduate program offered by the Faculty, which is also known for its strong programs in drama, children's literature and other arts. The Faculty offers a PhD degree in education, and additional PhD programs have been under development, as indicated in HiB's strategic plan. According to its website, ‚ÄúGrieg Academy, Bergen University College has exchange agreements with educational institutions in Denmark, Portugal, Spain, Iceland, Sweden, Finland, England, Germany, USA, Australia, Greece and Austria.‚Äù See also *Education in Norway *Music of Norway References External links *Official website (University of Bergen) *Network of higher education music programs in western Norway Grieg Academy Category:Education in Bergen Category:1905 establishments in Norway ","title":"Grieg Academy"},{"id":"2604565","text":"Nathan Lamar Watts (born March 25, 1954 in Detroit, Michigan, United States) is an American session bassist, best known for his work with Stevie Wonder from the 1970s to the present. He has served as Stevie Wonder's musical director since 1994.  Biography  Born in Detroit, Nathan Watts started playing the trumpet while he was still in elementary school, inspired by jazz giant Lee Morgan. Watts was part of a trio that featured other future prominent session musicians Ray Parker Jr. on clarinet and drummer Ollie Brown and frequented Motown's Hitsville Studios to attend rehearsals and recordings of The Funk Brothers, the base-band of the label. When Parker abandoned the clarinet in favor of the guitar, he convinced Watts to switch to bass, which was the first thing that he did after graduating from high school in 1972. With his first instrument, a National Bass, Watts learned \\"Cold Sweat\\" by James Brown, and soon began to study the lines of other great bassists such as James Jamerson, Chuck Rainey, and Bob Babbitt. When Ray Parker Jr. joined Marvin Gaye's band, Watts joined a local group called the Final Decision, with the intention of studying accounting, if his career as a musician failed. In August 1974, Watts received a call to work with Stevie Wonder, in replacement of Reggie McBride, who had joined Rare Earth. At the time, Watts had only been playing bass for two years. After being selected as the official bassist of the band, Watts took part in the Japanese tour of 1975, and then began recording the album Songs in the Key of Life. Watts says throughout his career with Wonder that he recorded bass tracks on many demos that Wonder replaced with his own keyboard bass for the final versions. This method was employed for ‚ÄúKnocks Me Off My Feet‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥Isn't She Lovely‚Ä≥. From that moment on, Nathan Watts's career has continued to develop, both alongside Stevie Wonder and with many other artists.  Style and valuation  Nathan Watts grew up listening to the Funk Brothers as well as other musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple, Rare Earth, Mahogany Rush, and Steppenwolf. In terms of his three main influences as a bassist, Watts lists James Jamerson, Chuck Rainey and Joseph \\"Lucky\\" Scott, bassist of Curtis Mayfield. Technically, his style is characterized by the use of three fingers of the right hand, the strong attack that prints the notes, as well as the frequent use of techniques of palm mute, hammer on, trills and slides. The musician has developed an important career along with Stevie Wonder, with whom he has recorded some songs that would become classics for lovers: \\"I Wish\\", \\"As\\", \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand for It\\" and \\"Do I Do\\" are among Watts top favorite bass lines. More than 36 years in the service of Stevie Wonder ‚Äì along with being the musical director of the band for 12 years ‚Äì he earned in 2010 the International Bassist Award from the Winter NAMM Show, an award that recognizes the achievements of the musician throughout his career.  Gear  Nathan Watts has used his 1974 Fender Precision Bass and his 1979 Music Man StingRay as main instruments throughout his career. He has also used a Fender Jazz Bass and Yamaha, Aria, and B.C. Rich (four and five string) bass. On the road he currently switches between Bossa 4 and 5 string basses for a modern tone. In the studio he uses Alleva-Coppolo basses (a LG-5 Classic Crewes of five strings with and without frets). He also uses Elixir Nanowebs, and Hartke Hydrive amplifiers and LH1000 heads. Before he became an endorser for Hartke, he had previously used a National amplifier and SWR amplifiers.

History In Ackergill is a famous tower/castle named Ackergill Tower. In the 1920s, archaeologists excavated an ancient cemetery in an elongated sand mound at Ackergill, finding ten graves with sixteen burials. Most inhumations were in long cists. Grave goods were found in only one of the burials. A Pictish symbol stone depicting the lower part of a fish together with a rectangular symbol bore the Ogham inscription ‚ÄúNEHTERI,‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúNeht, son of Etrios.‚Äù It is believed the burial ground may have been important through the first and second centuries. Economy Despite being a small village, Ackergill used to have a lifeboat station, which served the increasing volume of shipping that began to pass through the area with the rise of the herring industry at nearby Wick from the mid-19th century; in poor weather, vessels often sought shelter in Sinclair's Bay.

Philosophy Anniceris denied that pleasure was merely the absence of pain, for if so death would be a pleasure; and furthermore he denied that pleasure is the general goal of human life. To each separate action, there is a particular end, namely the pleasure which actually results from it. He differed from Aristippus because he allowed that friendship, patriotism, and similar virtues, were good in themselves; saying that the wise person will derive pleasure from such qualities, even though they cause occasional trouble, and that a friend should be chosen not only for our own need, but for kindness and natural affection. He also denied that reason () alone can secure us from error; the wise person is the person who has acquired a habit of wise action; human wisdom is liable to lapses at any moment.; Clement of Alexandria, Stromata. ii.

Demicheli was a de facto President of Uruguay in 1976 as a non-democratically elected authority of the civic-military dictatorship.  Background  He was a noted jurist and economist and previously served as Interior Minister under President Gabriel Terra. A member of the Colorado Party, Demicheli was one of a number of civilians who participated in the civilian-military administration which took office following President Juan Maria Bordaberry's coup in 1973.  President of Uruguay  He succeeded Bordaberry as President in July 1976. Aged 80 by the end of his brief period as President, he was the oldest ever president of Uruguay. While in office he adopted measures designed to liberalize the economy. Demicheli was a relative moderate within the civilian-military administrations which ruled Uruguay between 1973 and 1985, in that, although he was known for measures deemed repressive by democracy advocates opposed to the government, he dissented with his military colleagues regarding the extent to which former political figures should be proscribed from pursuing political activities: this is believed to have hastened the end of his short term of office as President of Uruguay. Demicheli handed over his Presidential office to Aparicio M√©ndez in September 1976, who was still serving as President when Demicheli died in 1980.  Historical background  As with his predecessor Juan Maria Bordaberry, some observers would argue that the close links between leading Colorado party figures such as Demicheli and the military mirror the similar elements present in the Colorado party's founder, the 19th century President and military patriot, Fructuoso Rivera. The preference for rule by decree of nineteenth century Colorado President of Uruguay Venancio Flores would also be a historical case in point, according to this argument. Others would reason that Demicheli was morally repudiating Colorado party ideals in cooperating with the civilian-military administration which took office in 1973. The fact that the Colorado Demicheli twice in his career exercised ministerial / executive powers at periods when rule by decree was in force arguably illustrates the fact that within the Colorado party there was substantial support for such measures. The tendency of some observers to describe Latin American heads of state who ruled by decree as 'de facto' Presidents may be seen in this light. Others would seek to discount Demicheli's association with the Colorado Party.  Spouse  His wife, Sof√≠a √Ålvarez Vignoli de Demicheli, was noted for her diplomatic activity during the Presidency of Gabriel Terra, in whose administration Alberto Demicheli also served.

Today due to its large size it is generally referred to as a \\"town\\" although the parish council has not elected to give itself the status of a town as it could do under s.245(6) of the Local Government Act 1972,http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/70/section/245 so it does not have a town council and cannot have a town mayor. It is also known informally as a \\"market town\\", as from at least 1199 the lord of the manor has held the right to hold a regular market. The village is situated on the A379 road, which links it to Plymouth and Kingsbridge. The current parish population is approximately 1,500. Etymology The name Modbury is a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon name, Moot burgh from 'Moot' meaning either 'Mud' or 'meeting' and 'bury' meaning 'fortified enclosure'. History Modbury is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.Open Domesday Online: Modbury, accessed December 2017. It has had permission to hold a weekly fair since before 1199. The population of the town was greatly reduced as a consequence of the Black Death in the 14th century. =Civil war= Modbury was the site of two battles in the English Civil War. The first battle was a minor royalist victory on 9 December 1642, when a small Royalist force put to flight a smaller Parliamentarian force. The second Battle of Modbury occurred on 21 February 1643 when the Royalists forces, expecting an attack by Parliamentarian forces assembled at nearby Kingsbridge, had fortified the town. Outnumbered approximately four to one, and running short of ammunition, the royalists retreated. This victory was largely instrumental in the lifting of the Siege of Plymouth, and the driving of the encircling Royalist forces into Cornwall. =19th century= By 1801, the population of Modbury had risen to 1,813, with almost half engaged in the wool trade. The impact of the mechanisation of the wool industry was to have a dramatic effect on the economic prosperity and population of the town in the mid-1820s and later. Many workers left the town and headed to large cities in search of employment; others left the country altogether, emigrating to America. The railway line bypassed Modbury, contributing still further to this decline. Modbury remained an important market town until as late as 1944 when the cattle market ceased. Manor The manor of Modbury was held from the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, by the Vautort family, and passed successively to the families of Okeston and Champernowne.  Church  The parish Church of St George is Grade 1 listed.The main body of the church is fourteenth century and is constructed of coursed rubble with granite dressings beneath slate roofs. The tower has angle buttresses and a broach spire believed to have been struck by lightning in AD 1621 and rebuilt as a copy of the original. The nave has a wagon roof, as do the aisles and transepts, the Lady Chapel, the Vestry, and the chancel. Dendrochronological analysis suggest the church was reroofed in the sixteenth century. The church was placed on Historic England's Heritage at Risk Register in 2013 with concerns about roof damage and damp. A 2015 Heritage Lottery Fund grant led to a extensive programme of roof repairs and restoration. Historic estates =Wympston= Whympston in the parish of Modbury is a historic manor. In the 12th century it became the earliest English seat of the prominent Norman family of Fortescue, influential in British and West Country history, which survives today as Earl Fortescue, seated in Gloucestershire, but until recently seated at Castle Hill in Devon. =Orcheton= Orcheton within the parish was long a seat of the Prideaux family. The much mutilated effigy survives in the Orcheton (or Prideaux) aisle of Modbury Church of Sir John Prideaux (c.1347-1403) of Orcheton, twice a Member of Parliament for Devon in 1383 and 1388.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/prideaux- sir-john-1347-1403 Plastic bag ban In April 2007 local traders declared that for environmental reasons, they would no longer give customers plastic bags. This initiative led to other communities, such as Ilam in Staffordshire and Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, to pursue similar enterprises.Sunday Telegraph 22 July 2007 2, 406 pC12 Modbury Rovers F.C.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this once tiny village passed from Stokesley Rural District, to Middlesbrough Rural District and was eventually incorporated into the county borough of Middlesbrough during the early 20th century. = Stainsby = In the west of Acklam is the abandoned medieval settlement of Stainsby, deserted by 1757. Today this amounts to little more than a series of grassy mounds near the A19 road.  Geography  Acklam is situated in West Middlesbrough, and encloses smaller estates such as Kader, And Trimdon Avenue Estate. Acklam Road runs directly through Acklam, and just off Acklam Road is Hall Drive. The previous focus of the parish was the residence of the Hustler family, the Restoration mansion of Acklam Hall, this is shown in maps of the pre- industrial area--such as the 1714 Lordship of Acklam Plan--in the nearby Dorman Museum in Linthorpe. The house, formerly a grammar school and Middlesbrough's sole Grade I listed building, had ceased to be the Acklam Campus of Middlesbrough College by the middle of 2008.  Education  Acklam schools, include Kader Primary School, Acklam Grange School, Outwood Academy Acklam, Acklam Whin Primary School and St Clare's Primary School, on Trimdon Avenue. Acklam Grange Secondary School was previously Stainsby Secondary Modern School, named as such in 1952 after the mediaeval settlement of Stainsby.

His partner was Detective Mitchell (Tim Elston). Recurring characters in the series were the disapproving Daley (James Condon) who appeared in 21 episodes, the forensics technician Clem (Brian Young) who was in 15 of the episodes. Adam Garnett as Ginger, a street-wise child who befriended Bellamy, appeared in six early episodes but was phased-out of the series. Later in the run Tom Richards appeared as Detective Burns over five episodes. In the story Burns was ultimately revealed to be corrupt. The series was noticeably more violent than previous Australian police series such as those made by Crawford Productions during the 1970s. Bellamy attracted only mediocre ratings and was shifted around the schedules several times. The series was not renewed beyond the initial series of 26 one-hour episodes.

Previously, Lincoln City had played at the nearby John O'Gaunts ground since the club's 1884 inception. The stadium has an overall capacity of 10,120 and is colloquially known to fans as \\"Sinny Bank\\". It is overlooked by Lincoln Cathedral. Former Lincoln City chairman John Reames re-purchased the ground from the local council in 2000 at a cost of ¬£175,000. The club had sold it in 1982 for ¬£225,000 in order to fend off the threat of eviction, arranging a 125-year lease. On 28 November 2008, the stadium hosted England U16s' 2‚Äì0 win over Scotland U16s to win the Victory Shield, an annual football competition between the four Home Nations at the Under 16 level. Martin Peters paraded the FIFA World Cup Trophy at the ground in March 2010 as part of its global tour. On 10 December 2019, London North Eastern Railway (LNER) was confirmed as Lincoln City‚Äôs new stadium sponsor. Sincil Bank ‚Äì the Imps‚Äô home since 1895 ‚Äì was renamed to the LNER Stadium in a 3 year partnership agreement. The stadium has previously been renamed in 2012 and 2013.Who remembers this? When the Sincil Bank name was altered just seven years ago Lincolnshire Live, 30 May 2019.

Retrieved 11 December 2019 Stands =Lincolnshire Co-operative Stand= Lincoln Ladies with the County Cup in front of the Co-op stand The largest stand at the stadium holds approximately 5,700 people. It is located on the Sincil Bank street side of the ground and is home to the majority of the Imps' supporters. The block nearest the Bridge McFarland/South Park stand was given to visiting supporters until 2013, but is now used for only home supporters. The lower block closest the South Park Stand has now been made a family seating area as the old family stand now takes visiting fans. This side of the ground was occupied by uncovered terracing ever since the club moved from their first home, the John O'Gaunt's Ground, in 1895. The terracing was cordoned-off in August 1994 and demolition work soon began. The stand was officially opened before Lincoln City's match with Hartlepool United on 4 March 1995. The stand cost around ¬£1 million to build and meant that the stadium had been completely redeveloped from its previous state in the 1980s (at a total cost of ¬£3 million). Over the years the stand has been known under three different guises, depending on sponsorship contracts. It was first known as the Linpave Stand and, in 1998, was sponsored by Simons Construction. It was named the Lincolnshire Co-operative stand in 2001, but is more commonly known as the Co- op stand. It was home to the LCFC band, which was originally put together by former manager John Beck in 1995 in order to increase matchday atmosphere. =St Andrews/The Selenity Stand= The Selenity Stand at Lincoln City's LNER stadium Constructed in 1987, the structure replaced the old St Andrews Stand, which was named after the street that runs all the way from Lincoln city centre to the stadium. The old stand was constructed in 1932 (replacing a small predecessor) and was made out of timber. It had a total capacity of 2,250, in a seated enclosure and a small bank of terracing at the front. By the mid-1980s, however, the entire stadium was in a state of decline and a renovation project began when the stand was demolished in the close season of 1986. The new stand opened in November 1987 but was smaller in size than originally envisaged, partly due to City's season-long drop into Conference football. Running only half the length of the pitch, it has a capacity of 1,700 and holds the press box and Directors' enclosure. This is in addition to the majority of the club's offices and corporate areas. =Stacey-West Stand= This was the traditional home-end up until 2013 but now takes visiting fans who bring large numbers of supporters. Built in 1990, the Stacey-West Stand is named after two lifelong supporters - Bill Stacey and Jim West - who died in the Bradford City stadium fire. It replaced the old Railway End terrace in 1990, which had a goods rail line running behind the enclosure until the line was demolished in the early 1990s. The Stacey-West Stand first had areas of terracing at either end with a large area of seating in between so that supporters had the choice of sitting or standing at games. However, when City were promoted to the old Division Two at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season, the stand was made entirely terraced. This was because a number of large clubs then in Division Two, such as Manchester City, Stoke City and Burnley were expected to bring large travelling support to the ground. This convinced the club that the Stacey-West stand should hold visiting fans, rather than a portion of the Co-op Stand. However, when the club was relegated back to the old Division Three in May 1999, a grant by the Football Trust partially enabled just under 2,000 seats to replace the Stacey-West Stand terracing which meant that, for the first time in the history of Lincoln City, it was an all-seater stadium. The stand continued to house visiting supporters until it was given back to home fans in the 2002 close-season. But at the start of 2013/14 season it was announced that the stand would no longer be housing home supporters but only used as an away-end for large quantities of supporters. As of 2016 the stand is used for home fans on certain games. =Bridge McFarland Stand= Named as part of a two-year sponsorship with GoCar motor dealership in 2009. Previously named the I.M.P.S. Stand since 2003 when local company Industrial Marine Power Services signed a sponsorship agreement with the club. The stand was built in 1992 and houses 17 executive boxes, Strikers bar for supporters and companies using the executive boxes and the Centre Spot, a fans' bar that welcomes both home and away supporters on matchdays. It replaced the old South Park stand, which consisted of a small seated area and a terrace. As of 2013 visiting supporters now sit in half of the Bridge McFarland Stand and the Family Stand. If a large away crowd is expected then the Stacey West Stand is used to accommodate away fans instead. =Poacher's Corner= The Family Stand was built in 1994. It is situated to the west of the St Andrew's/Selenity Stand, nearest the Bridge McFarland/South Park Stand and is directly adjacent to the players' tunnel. The land on which it was built was previously occupied by a small, open terrace. When the Family Stand was built, a new building ‚Äì which incorporates the club's dressing rooms and treatment areas ‚Äì was also erected. On top of the stand there is a police control box, which is used to keep a close watch on all areas of the crowd. City supporters can pay to sit in this stand, although much of it is often given over to children from local schools who are invited to watch the Imps as part of the club's Football in the Community programme. Since mid-2008 the stand has been known as 'Poacher's Corner', a reference to Imps mascot Poacher the Imp. The 'Poacher's Club' initiative by Lincoln saw cheap ticket deals and other incentives offered to any parent/child combination, and Poacher's Corner became the focal point of the efforts. In the start of the 2011-12 season, Lincoln City signed a sponsorship deal with Network Telecom Rentals Ltd, changing the stand's name to the 'NTR Family Stand'. As of 2013 this stand and half of the Bridge McFarland Stand is used for visiting supporters. For the 2016-17 season the stand has been part of the University of Lincoln partnership, and through the \\"Uni Imps\\" scheme offers students and staff the chance to attend matches. Other sports and concerts In 1958 the ground played host to a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. A major rock concert was staged at the ground in May 1966 which featured the Who, the Kinks, the Yardbirds and the Small Faces & many others. The facility has played host to many sports including local cricket finals, boxing, wrestling, athletics, cycling, lawn tennis and American football. On the weekend of 19/20 May 2006, the Irish pop band Westlife and other supporting acts including Liberty X, Blue's Lee Ryan and Journey South performed in front of over 13,000 fans, the biggest concert ever to take place in the city of Lincoln. The event was organised by both Lincoln City and the City Council, with funding and profits being shared between the two. The club actually recorded a ¬£44,000 loss but the venue had been put back on the map for future live events. Since a Bonfire Night 2006 live event has been held, and though on a much smaller scale (over 5,000 spectators), it featured several artists such as Lee Ryan again, former Steps star Lisa Scott-Lee's brother Andy Scott-Lee, Icelandic outfit Nylon and 2ToGo of X-Factor fame. Future of the Stadium As of November 2019, the club is evaluating either redevelopment or moving to increase capacity and facilities at the ground.Interview with Vice Chairman Roger Bates, Vital Lincoln City, 16 November 2019.

Admissions It provides predominantly further education, but also selected higher education provision, and until 2008, existed on four different sites across the town (Marton, Acklam, Kirby and Longlands). Relocation to Middlehaven was one of Tees Valley Regeneration's major redevelopment projects. It is situated just north of the A66 and Middlesbrough town centre, next to Middlesbrough Dock and the dock tower, and close to the Transporter Bridge and Middlesbrough FC's Riverside Stadium. The college is approximately from Middlesbrough railway station. Student numbers during the 2013/14 college year were 14,232 (2013/14 annual report).  History and estates  =Former schools= Three of the pre-2008 sites were those of the former grammar schools when run by the Middlesbrough Education Committee: * Middlesbrough High School (Boys) ‚Äì opened in October 1870 as a fee-paying school. * Middlesbrough High School (Girls) ‚Äì opened in August 1874. A joint new building was opened on Albert Road in 1877, but the boys and girls were taught separately. The central Middlesbrough site was in use until 1960, and then moved to Marton Road. * the girls-only Kirby Grammar School - opened in October 1911 on the corner of Roman Road and Orchard Road in Linthorpe. * the boys-only Acklam Hall Grammar School for Boys ‚Äì opened in September 1935 when the numbers at Middlesbrough High School for Boys outgrew the capacity of the buildings. Middlesbrough High School for Girls had 450 girls in the 1950s, and 600 in 1962. Middlesbrough High School for Boys had around 450 boys in the 1950s, and 600 in the mid-1960s. The boys' and girls' schools, both three-form entry schools, merged in September 1967 to form Middlesbrough High School, an ages 13‚Äì18 comprehensive with around 1,200 boys and girls and 500 in the sixth form. Middlesbrough High School became Middlesbrough and Marton Sixth Form College in 1974. In April 1974, the school had been taken over by the County of Cleveland (Cleveland County Council). Acklam Hall Grammar School had 600 boys in the mid-1960s. It merged with Kirby to form Acklam High School, a comprehensive school, in 1968. This school then further changed in 1974 to Acklam Sixth Form College and King's Manor 11‚Äì16 School. The King's Manor School suffered a fire and moved across the road, Hall Drive, to share a site with Hall Garth School (now Hall Garth Community Arts College). =Former colleges= Longlands College of Further Education was on Douglas Street which opened in 1957, and at first partly used by the Constantine Technical College. It was near the junction of Marton Road (A172) and Longlands Road (A1085) just west of North Ormesby. Kirby College of Further Education was separate and established in 1968 on Roman Road. It had departments such as Food and Fashion, Catering, Hairdressing, and Business Studies, and taught single O-level subjects (re-takes or part-time). It also offered A level programmes in the late 1970s =Foundation through two mergers= Teesside Tertiary College was created on 1 August 1995 by the merger of Longlands College of Further Education and Marton Sixth Form College, and was based on Marton Road next to the James Cook University Hospital. Middlesbrough College was formed when Kirby College of Further Education merged with Acklam Sixth Form College, also on 1 August 1995. From 1992, these two colleges had been funded by the Further Education Funding Council for England. In 1995, Teesside Tertiary College offered ¬£1,200 for every person signing up for A-level course who had eight A grades at GCSE. =Merger and move to new site= Main Building Middlesbrough College merged with Teesside Tertiary College on 1 August 2002, with it now being spread over four sites. Since 2001, these colleges had been funded by the Learning and Skills Council for England. Once the merger was complete, planning began for the relocation to a single site at Middlehaven in central Middlesbrough. Building work for the new college building at Middlehaven began in early 2007. In September 2008, the four separate sites were eventually consolidated onto a single site with the opening of the new ¬£68 million Middlesbrough college building. The Middlehaven site has since grown with the opening of new college buildings adjacent to the main building. MC6 & MC SPORT (a sixth form centre & sports academy) opened in October 2012, and MC STEM (science, technology, engineering & maths) was officially opened by Professor Brian Cox in November 2015. =Former sites= Middlesbrough college's four previous sites were: * Marton Road (Marton Campus) * Douglas Street (Longlands Campus) * Roman Road (Kirby Campus) * Hall Drive (Acklam Campus) Most of the Marton Campus is in the process of becoming a housing estate with 275 houses being built by Taylor Woodrow. The remainder of the site was encompassed into part of the new Middlesbrough Sports Village with an outdoor velodrome replacing the football pitches. The Kirby Campus now has 84 houses and 53 apartments built on it by Taylor Woodrow. The former Kirby Grammar School has become 21 apartments. The Longlands Campus has become 104 houses built by Taylor Woodrow. This includes the former playing field and sports hall. Curriculum Courses range from university-oriented academics to vocational education. Selected higher education courses exist by virtue of an indirectly funded partnership arrangement with the Teesside University.

It is a Grade I listed building. It was built by William Hustler between 1680‚Äì83. A long-held, albeit unverified family tradition claimed that the Hall was visited by a royal progress by the then-sovereign, King Charles II, in 1684. It continued to house the Hustlers until the conceding of ownership to Middlesbrough Corporation in 1928. After 1935 it was in public ownership and has been used as a grammar school and a comprehensive school, known as Kings Manor School, with the addition of several modern buildings to the grounds. It was then owned by Middlesbrough Council. Middlesbrough College inherited the site and continued to use it as a college building. Internally the building features a magnificent main staircase with balustrade carved in spirals and helixes. The ceilings in the front part of the house feature many stucco decorations. There is a fine rose window in the roof at the top of the staircase. The front room in the second storey spans the width of the house. It was probably a reception/ballroom originally, and has served various functions in education. It was the Assembly Hall for Acklam Hall Grammar School until the opening of the new hall around 1958. It then became the school's main library. Subsequently, the library moved to a new building, later demolished, and the space became the staff common room. In front of the hall stretches the Avenue of Trees (as it is known locally), with two rows of large oak trees forming a corridor which was likely to have been the route by which visitors originally approached the Hall. These trees stretch from Acklam Road to Hall Drive (immediately in front of the Hall) ‚Äì a distance of around 0.5 miles. Architectural details The coat of arms of the Hustler family can be seen above the main door, with the figure of a Talbot on top. This extinct breed of hunting dog became the emblem of Acklam Hall Grammar School. The front door has a short portico. Acklam Hall today Middlesbrough Council revealed plans in 2011 to sell the hall to developers. Controversially the Council sold the hall and land for ¬£900,000, when other valuations put its worth at ¬£4,000,000. As of 2016, the council had only received ¬£120,000 of the money it was owed.BBC Look North, 3 October 2016 In 2014, Acklam Hall Ltd, which now owns the hall, confirmed that the building would be developed as a wedding venue with small spa, gym, conference rooms and a restaurant. The possibility of a medical centre and nursing home were also considered for the site. The financing of this would be offset against the building of 56 new houses, to the east and west of the hall, by Taylor Wimpey.

This relationship can be formal or informal, depending on the society. Early anthropological research focused on the association between the avunculate and matrilineal descent, while later research has expanded to consider the avunculate in general society. Definition The term avunculate comes from the Latin avunculus, the maternal uncle. The 1989 Oxford English Dictionary defines \\"avunculate\\" as follows: :\\"Avunculate. The special relationship existing in some societies between a maternal uncle and his sister's son; maternal uncles regarded as a collective body. ::1920 R. H. LOWIE Prim. Soc. v. 81 Ethnologists describe under the heading of avunculate the customs regulating in an altogether special way the relations of a nephew to his maternal uncle. Ibid. vii. 171 The Omaha are patrilineal now, but their having the avunculate proves that they once traced descent through the mother, for on no other hypothesis can such a usage be explained. ... \\"Oxford English Dictionary. Second Edition 1989. On-line version. Avunculocal societies An avunculocal society is one in which a married couple traditionally lives with the man's mother's eldest brother, which most often occurs in matrilineal societies. The anthropological term \\"avunculocal residence\\" refers to this convention, which has been identified in about 4% of the world's societies.Rosman, Abraham and Rubel, Paula G. The Tapestry of Culture: An Introduction to Cultural Anthropology. Mcgraw-Hill College, 1995. () This pattern generally occurs when a man obtains his status, his job role, or his privileges from their nearest elder matrilineal male relative. When a woman's son lives near her brother, he is able to more easily learn how he needs to behave in the matrilineal role he has inherited.  Cultures with a formal avunculate  According to the Kazakh common law, the avunculate nephews could take anything from the relatives of the mother up to three times. In the Kyrgyz past a nephew, at a feast at his maternal uncle or grandfather, could take any horse from their herd or any delicacy.Yu.Zuev, \\"Early T√ºrks: Sketches of history and ideology\\", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 30, In the Southwest United States, the Apache tribe practices a form of this, where the uncle is responsible for teaching the children social values and proper behavior while inheritance and ancestry is reckoned through the mother's family alone. Modern day influences have somewhat but not completely erased this tradition. The Chamorros of the Mariana IslandsCunningham, Lawarence J. Ancient Chamorro Society. Bess Press, 1992. () and the Ta√≠no of Turks and Caicos IslandsKeegan, William F. Before Columbus: Caonabo‚Äôs Homeland, Middle Caicos Earthwatch Report, 1999. are examples of societies that have practiced avunculocal residence.  Anthropology research  Research on the avunculate in the early 20th century focused on the association between the avunculate and patrilineal/matrilineal societies. Franz Boas categorized various avunculate arrangements based on the location of residence in 1922. Henri Alexandre Juno made the claim that the avunculate in the Tsonga indicated that society had previously been matrilineal. Alfred Radcliffe-Brown identified the Tsonga (BaThonga) of Mozambique, the Tongans of the Pacific, and the Nama of Namibia as avunculate societies as early as 1924. He also expanded the concept to incorporate other family relationships. Later research moved beyond the issue of matrilinealism. Claude L√©vi-Strauss incorporating the avunculate into his \\"atom of kinship\\". Jan N. Bremmer argued based on a survey of the Indo- European peoples that the avunculate is explained by the principle of education outside the (extended) family, and does not indicate matrilinealism. Avunculate marriage In historical (not anthropological) terminology, an avunculate marriage is the marriage of a man with the daughter of his sister (not explicitly forbidden by the listings in Leviticus 18). In most cultures with avunculate customs in the sense used by anthropologists, such a marriage would violate incest taboos governing relations between members of the same matrilineal lineage.

Description Quercus coccinea is a medium-large deciduous tree growing to 20‚Äì30 m (67‚Äì100 feet) tall with an open, rounded crown. The leaves are glossy green, 7‚Äì17 cm (2.8‚Äì6.8 inches) long and 8‚Äì13 cm (3.2‚Äì5.2 inches) broad, lobed, with seven lobes, and deep sinuses between the lobes. Each lobe has 3‚Äì7 bristle-tipped teeth. The leaf is hairless (unlike the related pin oak, which has tufts of pale orange-brown down where the lobe veins join the central vein). The common English name is derived from the autumn coloration of the foliage, which generally becomes bright scarlet; in contrast, pin oak foliage generally turns bronze in autumn. The acorns are ovate, 7‚Äì13 mm broad and 17‚Äì31 mm long, a third to a half covered in a deep cup, green maturing pale brown about 18 months after pollination; the kernel is very bitter.

The city of Al-Thawrah is located immediately south of the dam. The dam is high and long and is the largest dam in Syria. Its construction led to the creation of Lake Assad, Syria's largest water reservoir. The dam was constructed between 1968 and 1973 with help from the Soviet Union. At the same time, an international effort was made to excavate and document as many archaeological remains as possible in the area of the future lake before they would be flooded by the rising water. When the flow of the Euphrates was reduced in 1974 to fill the lake behind the dam, a dispute broke out between Syria and Iraq (which is downstream) that was settled by intervention from Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union. The dam was originally built to generate hydroelectric power, as well as irrigate lands on both sides of the Euphrates. The dam has not reached its full potential in either of these objectives. Project history In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was proposed to build a dam in the Euphrates near the Syria‚ÄìTurkey border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, the Syrian government reached an agreement with the Soviet Union for technical and financial aid for the construction of a dam in the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction of the dam. After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a new agreement about the financing of the dam was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of the dam. In the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist √Öke Sundborg worked as an advisor on the dam project with the task of estimating the amount and fate of sediments that would enter into the dam. Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the projected growth of a river delta in the dam.L√§ngs floder v√§rlden runt - m√§nniskor och milj√∂er (2003). Originally, the Tabqa Dam was conceived as a dual-purpose dam. The dam would include a hydroelectric power station with eight turbines capable of producing 880 MW in total, and would irrigate an area of on both sides of the Euphrates. Construction of the dam lasted between 1968 and 1973, while the accompanying power station was finished on 8 March 1978. The dam was constructed during the agricultural reform policies of Hafez al-Assad, who had re-routed the Euphrates river for the dam in 1974. The total cost of the dam was US$340 million of which US$100 million was in the form of a loan by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union also provided technical expertise. During construction, up to 12,000 Syrians and 900 Russian technicians worked on the dam. They were housed in the greatly expanded town near the construction site, which was subsequently renamed Al-Thawrah. To facilitate the project, as well as the construction of irrigation works on the Khabur River, the national railway system (Chemins de Fer Syriens) was extended from Aleppo to the dam, Raqqa, Deir ez-Zor, and eventually Qamishli. Around 4,000 Arab families who had been living in the flooded part of the Euphrates Valley were resettled in other parts of northern Syria, part of a partially implemented plan to establish an \\"Arab belt\\" along the borders with Turkey and Iraq in order to separate Kurds in Syria from Turkish and Iraqi Kurdistan. =Dispute with Iraq= In 1974, Syria started to fill the lake behind the dam by reducing the flow of the Euphrates. Slightly earlier, Turkey had started filling the reservoir of the newly constructed Keban Dam, and at the same time the area was also hit by significant drought. As a result, Iraq received significantly less water from the Euphrates than normal, and complained that annual Euphrates flow had dropped from in 1973 to in 1975. Iraq asked the Arab League to intervene but Syria argued that it received less water from Turkey as well and refused to cooperate. As a result, tensions rose and Iraq and Syria sent troops to their shared border. Iraq also threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam. Before the dispute could escalate any further, an agreement was reached in 1975 by mediation of Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union whereby Syria immediately increased the flow from the dam and reportedly henceforth agreed to let 60 percent of the Euphrates water flow into Iraq. In 1987, Turkey, Syria and Iraq signed an agreement by which Turkey was committed to maintain an average Euphrates flow of per second into Syria, which translates into of water per year. =Rescue excavations in the Lake Assad region= The upper part of the Syrian Euphrates valley has been intensively occupied at least since the Late Natufian period (10,800‚Äì9500 BC). Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European travellers had already noted the presence of numerous archaeological sites in the area that would be flooded by the new reservoir. In order to preserve or at least document as many of these remains as possible, an extensive archaeological rescue programme was initiated during which more than 25 sites were excavated. Between 1963 and 1965, archaeological sites and remains were located with the help of aerial photographs, and a ground survey was carried out as well to determine the periods that were present at each site. Between 1965 and 1970, foreign archaeological missions carried out systematic excavations at the sites of Mureybet (United States), Tell Qannas (Belgium), Habuba Kabira, Mumbaqa (Germany), Selenkahiye (Netherlands), and Emar (France). With help from UNESCO, two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were photogrammetrically measured, and a protective glacis was built around the castle Qal'at Ja'bar. The castle was located on a hilltop that would not be flooded, but the lake would turn it in an island. The castle is now connected to the shore by a causeway. Qal'at Ja'bar surrounded by the waters of Lake Assad In 1971, with support from UNESCO, Syria appealed to the international community to participate in the efforts to salvage as many archaeological remains as possible before the area would disappear under the rising water of Lake Assad. To stimulate foreign participation, the Syrian antiquities law was modified so that foreign missions had the right to claim a part of the artefacts that were found during excavation. As a result, between 1971 and 1974, numerous excavations were carried out in the Lake Assad area by Syrian as well as foreign missions. Syrian archaeologists worked at the sites of Tell al-'Abd, 'Anab al-Safinah, Tell Sheikh Hassan, Qal'at Ja'bar, Dibsi Faraj and Tell Fray. There were missions from the United States on Dibsi Faraj, Tell Fray and Shams ed-Din- Tannira; from France on Mureybet and Emar; from Italy on Tell Fray; from the Netherlands on Tell Ta'as, Hadidi, Jebel 'Aruda and Selenkahiye; from Switzerland on Tell al-Hajj; from Great Britain on Abu Hureyra and Tell es- Sweyhat; and from Japan on Tell Roumeila. In addition, the minarets of Mureybet and Meskene were moved to higher locations, and Qal'at Ja'bar was further reinforced and restored. Many finds from the excavations are now on display in the National Museum of Aleppo, where a special permanent exhibition is devoted to the finds from the Lake Assad region. =Other dams in the Syrian Euphrates valley= After the completion of the Tabqa Dam, Syria built two more dams in the Euphrates, both of which were functionally related to the Tabqa Dam. The Baath Dam, located downstream from the Tabqa Dam, was completed in 1986 and functions as a floodwater control to manage the irregular output of the Tabqa Dam and as a hydroelectric power station. The Tishrin Dam, which functions primarily as a hydroelectric power station, has been constructed south from the Syro‚ÄìTurkish border and filling of the reservoir started in 1999. Its construction was partly motivated by the disappointing performance of the Tabqa Dam. The implementation of a fourth dam between Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor ‚Äì the Halabiye Dam ‚Äì was planned in 2009 and an appeal to archaeologists was released to excavate sites that will be flooded by the new reservoir. =Recent history= On 11 February 2013 the dam was captured by the Syrian opposition in their fight against the government, according to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In 2013, four of the dam's eight turbines were operational and the original staff continued to manage it. Dam workers still received pay from the Syrian Government, and fighting in the area temporarily ceased if repairs were needed. As of December 2016 the village near the dam, Al-Thawrah, was occupied by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. January 2017 saw a raid against ISIL by combined SDF and US special forces, between the dam and nearby Al-Thawrah. In March 2017, after heavy fighting damaged the main control panel at the dam and disabled the hydroelectric power station, ISIL warned of the dam's imminent collapse during a joint US/SDF operation to capture it. SDF forces announced they captured the dam on 10 May 2017. Characteristics of the dam and the reservoir alt=See caption The Tabqa dam is located on a spot where rocky outcrops on each side of the Euphrates Valley are less than apart. The dam is an earth-fill dam that is long, high from the riverbed ( above sea-level), wide at its base and at the top. The hydroelectric power station is located on the southern end of the dam and contains eight Kaplan turbines. The turbines' rotation speed is 125 RPM, and they can potentially generate 103 MW each. Lake Assad is long and on average wide. The reservoir can potentially hold of water, at which size its surface area would be . Annual evaporation is due to the high average summer temperature in northern Syria. This is high compared to reservoirs upstream from Lake Assad. For example, the evaporation at Keban Dam Lake is per year at roughly the same surface area. Neither the Tabqa Dam nor Lake Assad is currently used to its full economic potential. Although the lake can potentially hold , actual capacity is , with a surface area of . The proposed irrigation scheme suffered from a number of problems, including the high gypsum content in the reclaimed soils around Lake Assad, soil salinization, the collapse of canals that distributed the water from Lake Assad, and the unwillingness of farmers to resettle in the reclaimed areas. As a result, only were irrigated from Lake Assad in 1984. In 2000, the irrigated surface had risen to , which is 19 percent of the projected . Due to lower than expected water flow from Turkey, as well as lack of maintenance, the dam generates only 150 MW instead of 800 MW. Lake Assad is the most important source of drinking water to Aleppo, providing the city through a pipeline with of drinking water per year. The lake also supports a fishing industry. =Environmental effects= Research indicates that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria. This increase can, among other things, be related to the lower discharge of the Euphrates as a result of the construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes. The shore of the lake has developed into an important marshland area. On the southeastern shore, some areas have been reforested with evergreen trees including the Aleppo pine and the Euphrates poplar. Lake Assad is an important wintering location for migratory birds and the government has undertaken measures to protect small areas along the shores of Lake Assad from hunters by downgrading access roads. The island of Jazirat al-Thawra has been designated a nature reserve.

Serios was observed, when he thought no one was looking, sticking pictures into his \\"gizmo,\\" a tube he held between his head and the camera lens. That some claim he produced images without the tube, and at some distance from the camera, is easily attributed to double exposure or use of previously made exposures, followed by the fake snapping of a picture.\\"  History and method  Serios was an unemployed bellhop when his claims that he had the ability to put images on film with his mind came to the attention of Jule Eisenbud. He was tested by Eisenbud at Denver during a period of three years.Leonard Zusne, Warren Jones. (1982). Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Extraordinary Phenomena of Behavior and Experience. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. p. 411. Serios usually held a small cylinder or tube he called a \\"gizmo\\" up to the lens of an instant camera, which was then pointed at his forehead and the shutter released. He would often be drunk, or at least have been drinking, when he produced his photographs.John Thomas Sladek. (1974). The New Apocrypha: A Guide to Strange Science and Occult Beliefs. Stein and Day. p. 218. Serios' images were most often blank or black. Occasionally, a fuzzy image would be seen that could be interpreted in many different ways (cf. pareidolia), but on rare occasions a relatively clear and identifiable image showed up although often appearing surrounded by dark areas on the film.James Randi. (2011). Those Spooky Photos Are Back.... James Randi Educational Foundation. On some occasions, his photos appeared to be distorted, or altered versions of real places or images, e.g., one such photo seemed to be of Eisenbud's ranch showing the barn as a different structure to the reality. Another photograph depicted part of a building identified later as a hangar belonging to the Air Division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; however, in the photograph there was a misspelling \\"CAINADAIN\\" for \\"CANADIAN\\" on the imaged sign.Alfred Douglas.

Robert Todd Carroll later wrote \\"after the exposure he remained virtually unheard from for the past 30 years.\\" In 1968, W. A. H. Rushton a Professor of physiology and President of the Society for Psychical Research rejected any paranormal interpretation of the photographs. He suggested that it was light that formed the photographs from a luminous picture placed in front of the camera lens hidden in the 'gizmo'.

In an article in New Scientist titled \\"The Chance of a Lifetime\\" (24 March 2007), an interview appears with the noted mathematician and magician Persi Diaconis. During the interview Diaconis mentioned that Martin Gardner had paid him to watch Ted Serios perform, during which Diaconis claimed that he caught Serios sneaking a small marble with a photograph on it into the little tube attached to the front of the camera he used. \\"It was,\\" Diaconis said, \\"a trick.\\" Gardner wrote that \\"the parapsychologists who once took Ted Serios and others like him seriously would have been spared their embarrassments had they known anything about magic.\\"  Popular culture  Thoughtography was the premise of The X-files episode \\"Unruhe\\".

This project was separate from their Neubauten.org Supporter Project, which it ran concurrent to. The focus of this Musterhaus release was, as the title would suggest, intense noise. A quote from the back of the CD reads: \\"It was not a concert. It was not really music. When you were upstairs, you couldn't hear anything at all, but you could see EN clicking away on laptops (and Blixa screaming in a microphone). The REAL thing was downstairs. You can see the small room on the photos - maybe 20 people could be there at the same time. Because of ear- protection headsets (or your fingers pressed into your ears) it was not about sound. It was about feeling. The massive wave of sound from those speakers (in this small room!) flattened the hairs on the back of my arms and on my head. Sometimes the music came to a DEEP grinding halt. Sometimes Blixa's voice cut through. It was not a wall of sound. A wall is something in front of you. You were INSIDE the sound. The very air you were breathing vibrated. The eyes shook in their sockets. I've never been attacked like this by music. I don't know if this sounds funny in a way, it wasn't.

The then Bengal Presidency was a vast province including present day Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal. It was difficult to administratively manage such a vast area, inhabited by people speaking in different languages and having different traditions. Administrative exigencies required separation of such areas which originally did not from part of Bengal. So, new province of Bihar and Orissa was formed on 22 March 1912. However, the said new province of Bihar and Odisha was under the jurisdiction of Calcutta High Court. On 9 February 1916, in exercise of the powers under Section 113 of the Government of India Act, 1915, the King of England issued letters of patent constituting High Court of Patna. Odisha was placed under the jurisdiction of Patna High Court. Although, on 18 May 1916, Circuit Court of Patna High Court for Odisha held its first sitting at Cuttack. On 1 April 1936, Odisha was made a separate province but no separate High Court was provided for it. The Government of India agreed to create a new High Court, and for that purpose the Government of India issued the Odisha High Court Order, 1948, under the Section 229(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, on 30 April 1948. Finally, on 26 July 1948, Odisha High Court was formally inaugurated. The seat of the court is Cuttack. The court has a sanctioned judge strength of 27.

Life Statue of Christopher Codrington in the Codrington Library at All Souls College, Oxford Christopher Codrington (3rd) was born in Barbados in 1668. His father, Colonel Christopher Codrington, was captain-general of the Leeward Islands. As a young man, Codrington was sent to England to be educated, and went to school in Enfield under the tutelage of Dr. Wedale. From 1685 he attended Christ Church, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner. He was elected to All Souls as a probationer fellow in 1690. He was an enthusiastic book-collector. In 1694, while retaining his fellowship, he followed William III of England to Flanders during the Nine Years' War. Having fought with distinction at Huy and Namur, he was made a captain of the 1st regiment of foot guards in 1695. In the same year, he accompanied the king to Oxford and, in the absence of the public orator, was selected by the University to deliver the university oration. \\"Mr. Codrington of All Souls,\\" says Edmund Gibson (afterwards Bishop of London), \\"in a very elegant oration expressed the publick joy of the university to see his majesty.\\" Codrington had by this time acquired the reputation of a wit and scholar, though his fame is rather to be inferred from the dedications addressed to him by Thomas Creech, Dennis, and others, than from documented performances on his part. In 1698, after the Peace of Ryswick, which ended the War of the League of Augsburg, his father died, and King William gave him the succession to his father's office of captain-general and commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands.See transcript of his father Christopher Codrington's will, written & proved in 1698 As a governor his rule was not wholly popular, since in 1702 an appeal was made against his behavior by the inhabitants of Antigua. This document, which is still to be seen in the Codrington Library at All Souls with his comments attached, was ultimately laid before the House of Commons, by whom it was summarily dismissed. When, in the beginning of Anne's reign, war broke out again with France and Spain, Codrington's first military operations as captain-general were initially successful. However, in 1703 the Siege of Guadeloupe he led was a failure. After this, he resigned his governorship and retired to his estates in Barbados, passing the remainder of his life in seclusion and study, chiefly of church history and metaphysics. Will He died on 7 April 1710, and his body was brought to England and buried on 19 June that year in All Souls Chapel. By his will, dated 1702, he left ¬£10,000, and ¬£6,000 worth of books, to the college, a legacy that sufficed to erect, furnish, and endow a magnificent library,Bill Heine, \\"The shameful truth of how slavery paid for fine library\\", Oxford Mail, 28 February 2014. in the middle of which stands his statue by Sir Henry Cheere. He also left ¬£20 for his own gravestone and ¬£1,500 for a monument to his father in Westminster Abbey. His two plantations in Barbados, now known as the Society and the College, together with part of the island of Barbuda, he left \\"to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts for the foundation of a college in Barbadoes,\\"See transcript of Christopher Codrington's will. in which his \\"desire is to have the plantations continued Intire and three hundred negroes at least Kept thereon, and a convenient number of professors and scholars were to be maintained, all of them to be under the vowes of poverty, chastity, and obedience,\\" and \\"obliged to study and practice physick and chirurgery, as well as divinity, that by the apparent usefulness of the former to all mankind they may both endear themselves to the people, and have the better opportunity of doing good to men's souls, while they are taking care of their bodies.\\" The monastic intention of the testator is no longer followed, but Codrington College, built 1714-42, still flourishes.\\"Historical\\" , Codrington College.

Network The Portuguese railway network consists (2010) of 2,843 km of track: * 1,668 mm gauge: 2,650 km, of which 1,460 km are electrified at 25 kV 50 Hz AC and 25 km at 1.5 kV DC. Of this, 563 km are double track and 43 km multiple track * Metre gauge (1,000 mm, 3 ft 3‚Öú in): 188 km not electrified. * The maximum extent of 3592 km was reached in 1949, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s some lines were shortened and some totally closed. Historical summary The first railway in Portugal was between Lisbon and Carregado, now referred to as the Linha do Norte; it opened on 28 October 1856. It was extended to Porto, joining Portugal's two largest cities, in 1877. Meanwhile, on 1 February 1861 the lines between Barreiro Pinhal Novo and Vendas Novas (the Linha do Alentejo) and between Pinhal Novo and Set√∫bal (the Linha do Sul) followed. The Linha do Sul, at 274 km was the principal main line in the south of the country, but it terminated short of Lisbon on the south side of the river Tagus (Tejo in Portuguese) but it received a considerable improvement when it was extended from Pinhal Novo to Lisbon over the Ponte 25 de Abril, which was provided with an additional railway deck. The earliest railways in Portugal were built to standard gauge (1,435 mm) but were regauged in the nineteenth century for compatibility with the trains of the railways of Spain, which at that time used a track gauge of 1,668 mm. First electrification in Portugal was the suburban line from Lisbon to Cascais, at 1,500 V d.c., but it was another 30 years before the next electrification, the Norte line between Lisbon and Carregado, on 28 October 1956, exactly 100 years from the line's opening. This electrification was at 25 kV 50 Hz. Through routes to Spain are single-track and are not completely electrified.Karl Arne Richter (editor), Europ√§ische Bahnen '11, Eurailpress, Hamburg, 2010, New and upgraded railway lines A number of new high speed lines are planned. These were to be built in standard gauge to allow easy connection with the Spanish high speed network but most have since been downgraded. * Lisbon - √âvora - Elv√°s - Badajoz (Spain), forming a through route to Madrid; anticipated completion was 2013. Postponed during financial crisis, plans were announced in 2014 to restart work on the project and to include an upgrade of the freight only connection from the major port at Sines.

The Ulster Final was held in Clones from 1905 until 2004: before this, a mixture of grounds were used as venues. Between 2004 and 2006, due to increased capacity, the Ulster Final was played at Croke Park in Dublin. However, with the 2007 Leinster Senior Football Championship final being scheduled for the same date, that year's Ulster Final was restored to Clones, with Tyrone narrowly defeating Monaghan by a scoreline of 1‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì13.

Named after Gaelic scholar and first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde, the ground previously had a capacity of about 30,000, which was reduced to 18,500 after a nationwide inspection of facilities by the GAA in 2011. Remedial works have since been carried out at the ground, and the capacity been set to 25,000. The ground has hosted numerous Connacht Senior Football Championship finals, both with and without Roscommon's participation. It hosted the 1994 Connacht Final in which Leitrim triumphed over Mayo to win their first title since 1927. Other memorable Connacht finals hosted on this ground include the match between Roscommon and Galway in 1998, Roscommon's last-minute victory over Mayo in 2001 and Sligo's triumph over Galway in 2007. Hyde Park also hosted the 1978,1987 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship Finals and 1978 and 1981 All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championship Finals. The ground was, until recently, also home to Roscommon Gaels GAA club who have moved to newly-developed grounds at Lisnamult. The grounds consist of four stands; one covered with seating and the other three open terraces. It is located beside the county hospital on the Athlone Road in Roscommon Town.

Many of those with exercise hypertension have spikes in systolic pressure to 250 mmHg or greater. A rise in systolic blood pressure to over 200 mmHg when exercising at 100 W is pathological and a rise in pressure over 220 mmHg needs to be controlled by the appropriate drugs. Similarly, in healthy individuals the response of the diastolic pressure to 'dynamic' exercise (e.g. walking, running or jogging) of moderate intensity is to remain constant or to fall slightly (due to the improved blood flow), but in some individuals a rise of 10 mmHg or greater is found. Recent work at Johns Hopkins involving a group of athletes aged 55 to 75 with mild hypertension has found a correlation of those with exercise hypertension to a reduced ability of the major blood vessels to change in size in response to increased blood flow (probably due to impaired function of the endothelial cells in the vessel walls). This is to be differentiated from stiffness of the blood-vessel walls, which was not found to be correlated with the effect.

During their engagement in Dublin, Ireland Coghlan approached John Baldwin Buckstone, then manager of the Haymarket Theatre, with a play he had written. Buckstone passed on the play, but instead gave him the chance to play Monsieur Mafoi, a small role in ‚ÄúThe Pilgrim of Love‚Äù a play adapted by Lord Byron from Irving's ‚ÄúLegends of the Alhambra‚Äù that opened at the Haymarket on April 9, 1860. Over the following few seasons Coghlan would play a number of supporting roles that steadily increased his stature as an actor. In 1868 he played Charles Surface in Sheridan's \\"School for Scandal\\" at the St James's Theatre and later that year played Sir Oscar opposite Adelaide Neilson in Marston's ‚ÄúLife for Life‚Äù at the Prince of Wales Theatre. Coghlan would remain with Prince of Wales over the next seven or eight seasons playing leading roles such as Geoffrey Delamayn in Collins‚Äô \\"Man and Wife‚Äù and Harry Speadbrow in Gilbert's Sweethearts.Appletons' Annual Cyclopaedia and Register of Important Events of 1899, Volume 4, 1900, pg. 588-589, Appletons and Company In 1876 Augustin Daly brought Coghlan to America where he would spend the greater balance of his career. He made his Broadway debut on September 12, 1876, at the Fifth Avenue Theater, as Alfred Evelyn in Lord Lytton's ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù and was an instant success. Two months later, at the same venue, Coghlan played Orlando opposite Fanny Davenport's Rosalind in Shakespeare's As You Like It.Shakespeare On the Stage by William Winter 1915, pg. 262 The next season Coghlan was engaged as the leading man at the Union Square Theater, where he played Jean Remind during the successful run of Augustus R.

This great success was tempered the following year by the failure of his play \\"Citizen Pierre\\", in which he made his last New York performance.

Dr. Cullen Park was officially opened on 9 August 1936 by Patrick McNamee of the G.A.A. A total expenditure of ¬£3,590 and 15 shillings was accounted for at the first audit. This sum included the purchase of the land. Dr. Cullen Park was officially opened on Sunday 9 August 1936. It was named in honour of Dr. Matthew Cullen (Catholic Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin 1927‚Äì36) who had died on 2 January 1936. The late Bishop was honoured as \\"a great churchman, a true-hearted gael and a patriotic Irishman\\". Thomas Ryan President of County Carlow GAA presided at the ceremony. Padraig McNamee, President of the Ulster Council of the GAA represented the President of the Association. A number of local dignitaries also attended including James Reddy, who was the County Secretary during the early 1898‚Äì1890 period. By the 1960s Dr. Cullen Park still lacked a stand.

In 1983, it was the first machine to achieve master- level play, with a USCF rating of 2250. It won the ACM North American Computer Chess Championship five times and the 1980 World Computer Chess Championship. It was the first system to win using specialized chess hardware. In its final incarnation, Belle used an LSI-11 general purpose computer to coordinate its chess hardware. There were three custom boards for move generation, four custom boards for position evaluation, and a microcode implementation of alpha-beta pruning. The computer also had one megabyte of commercial memory for storing transposition tables. At the end of its career, Belle was donated to the Smithsonian Institution. The overall architecture of Belle was used for the initial designs of ChipTest, the progenitor of IBM Deep Blue.Newborn 1997 p. 147. Origins Following his work on the Unix operating system, Ken Thompson turned his attention to computer chess.Newborn 1997 p. 91. In summer 1972, he began work on a program for the PDP-11, which would eventually become Belle. In competition, this early version encouraged Thompson to pursue a brute-force approach when designing Belle's hardware.Frey 1983 p. 202. Design Belle's design underwent many changes throughout its lifetime. The initial chess program was rewritten to utilize move-vs-evaluation quiescence search and evaluate positions by prioritizing material advantage. Belle also used a transposition table to avoid redundant examinations of positions. =Hardware Move Generator= In 1976, Joe Condon implemented a hardware move generator to be used with software version of Belle on the PDP-11. His design had several steps: # A 6-bit \\"from\\" register searches the board for friendly pieces. # Once a friendly piece is found, a ‚àÜxy move-offset counter provides a bit-code for the move offset, e.g. (2,2) for a bishop or (2,0) for a rook. # This offset is combined with the contents of the \\"from\\" register and moved to a 6-bit \\"to\\" register. These two registers fully describe a potential move. # A test circuit compares the move to the existing board to determine whether the move is pseudo-legal. If it is, the \\"from\\" and \\"to\\" registers are output to software. A similar series of steps uses the move generator to test whether the pseudo-legal move is in fact legal. This ensures that the move does not place the moving side in check.Frey 1983 p. 203. =Second Generation= Belle's second generation was completed in 1978. It implemented several improvements over its predecessor. * The move generator had its own stack, which it used to store moves, rather than outputting them to software. * A hardware implementation of the position evaluator was added. * A hardware implementation of the transposition memory. These changes reduced the role of the PDP-11 software. Now, the software controlled these three devices and ran the alpha-beta pruning algorithm. The second generation of Belle could search 5,000 positions per second.Frey 1983 p. 204. =Third generation= Belle's final incarnation was completed in 1980. It consisted of further improvements to the speed of move generation and evaluation. * The move generator now included 64 transmitter and receiver circuits. Each transmitter remembered the piece on its square and potential moves that piece could make. Each receiver detected incoming moves, or threats, from other pieces. Extra circuitry detected castling and en passant.Frey 1983 p. 205. * The evaluator could now examine square control, using 64 specialized circuits, as well as pawn structure. * The transposition memory was increased to 1 Mb. * Belle's Alpha- beta algorithm was now implemented in microcode, controlling the move generator, evaluator, and transposition table.Frey 1983 p. 206. The third generation of Belle was controlled by an LSI-11 computer. Depending on the stage of the game, it examined 100,000 to 200,000 moves per second.Frey 1983 p. 207. Career =Early Competitions= Ken Thompson's software version of Belle competed in the 1972 U.S. Open Chess Championship and the 1973 ACM Computer Chess Championship. Over the next year, Belle played several UCSF games and finished 3-1 in the 1974 ACM Computer Chess Championship. In 1978, the second generation of Belle competed at the ACM Computer Chess Championships, winning with a perfect 4/0. In a pivotal game against Chess 4.7, the runner-up, Belle examined 5,000 positions per second, while Chess 4.7 examined 3,500.Newborn 1997 p. 93. =World Championship= In 1980, the third generation of Belle won the third World Computer Chess Championship in Linz, Austria. After four rounds, it had a score of 3.5/4, tied with the Chaos chess machine.Newborn 1997 p. 98. In a tie-breaker for the world-champion title, Belle broke through Chaos's Alekhine's Defense and went on to declare checkmate in 8, winning the game on turn 41.Levy 1980 p. 663. During the game, Belle searched 160,000 positions per second.Levy 1980 p. 664. =Master Rating= In 1983, Belle competed in the U.S. Open, where it finished 8.5/3.5 with a performance rating of 2363. Later that year, the USCF awarded Belle the rank of master.Newborn 1997 p. 92. Because it reached this level before any other chess computer, Belle was awarded the $5,000 Fredkin prize. Belle's reign ended when it placed sixth in the Fourth World Computer Chess Championship, despite being the favorite to win. It managed one more win at the ACM Championships in 1986 before retiring. Performance Analysis Because of its ability to generate and analyze many chess positions, Belle represented the brute-force approach to chess computing. In the late 1970s, Thompson became interested in the limits of this method, playing different versions of Belle against one another. Using identical machines allowed him to minimize effects of the individual machine's play style while isolating the effects of search depth. For instance, if one Belle computer searches three levels deep, the other might search to 4. Thompson concluded that for each additional level of search, Belle improved by approximately 250 points.Newborn 1997 p. 122.Frey 1983 p. 209. This effect has been replicated in self-play experiments with different machines.Heinz 2001 p. 76. Beyond 2,000 points, however, Thompson found that improvements leveled off.Newborn 1997 p. 123.

Diquat is no longer approved for use in the European Union, although its registration in many other countries including the USA is still valid. Synthesis Pyridine is oxidatively coupled to 2,2‚Ä≤-bipyridine over a heated Raney nickel catalyst. The ethylene bridge is formed by the reaction with 1,2-dibromoethane :530px History Diquat's herbicidal properties were recognized in 1955 in the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) laboratories at Jealott's Hill, following its first synthesis at ICI's Dyestuffs Division in Blackley, England. It was active on test plants at application rates as low as 0.1 lb/acre. It was found that only those quaternary salts which were capable of being converted by reducing agents to radical cations had herbicidal activity and another of these was paraquat, which was more effective as a non-selective herbicide than diquat. Initial attempts to commercialize diquat focused on its ability to control broadleaved annual weeds while damage to cereal crops was, by comparison, minor. However, the auxin herbicides including ICI's MCPA were more selective and hence this use of diquat was unattractive. Instead, diquat was combined with the use of specialised mechanised equipment which by the late 1950s was becoming common in the harvesting of crops such as potatoes. A concern in that use was the possibility that the compound could cause stem-end rot, but protocols were developed that overcame this problem and it was introduced commercially for potato haulm desiccation in 1961. In the mid 1960s, diquat's use was extended to the pre-harvest desiccation of oilseed crops such as sunflower, linseed, cotton and soya. The patent to the active ingredient has now expired in all countries. Mode of action When acting as a herbicide, diquat inhibits photosynthesis. In light-exposed plants, it accepts an electron from photosystem I (more specifically ferredoxin), to form its green radical cation: : [diquat]2+ \\\\+ e‚àí [diquat]+. The electron is then transferred to molecular oxygen, producing destructive reactive oxygen species. In forming these, the diquat dication is regenerated and is again available to shunt electrons from photosystem I to restart the cycle. Formulation Diquat is made available to end users only in formulated products. Since it has extremely high solubility in water modern formulations contain up to 40% of the active dibromide salt. Usage All pesticides are required to seek registration from appropriate authorities in the country in which they will be used. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). A pesticide can only be used legally according to the directions on the label that is included at the time of the sale of the pesticide. The purpose of the label is \\"to provide clear directions for effective product performance while minimizing risks to human health and the environment\\". A label is a legally binding document that mandates how the pesticide can and must be used and failure to follow the label as written when using the pesticide is a federal offense. Within the European Union, a 2-tiered approach is used for the approval and authorisation of pesticides. Firstly, before a formulated product can be developed for market, the active substance must be approved for the European Union. After this has been achieved, authorisation for the specific product must be sought from every Member State that the applicant wants to sell it to. Afterwards, there is a monitoring programme to make sure the pesticide residues in food are below the limits set by the European Food Safety Authority. Although diquat was used in many European countries from the 1960s, an EU directive has removed its approval for any use, effective from 12 October 2018. Diquat use in USA to 2017 (estimated by USGS) Diquat is an unusual herbicide because it is often not used for weed control but is instead applied directly on mature crops. This causes desiccation, making the crop easier to harvest, particularly with mechanised equipment. The advantage to the farmer can be to advance the harvesting date, reduce the time taken to harvest and, in the case of seed crops, reduce the moisture content of the seed and increase its useful yield. Farmers can act in their best economic interest: the value of these benefits can be estimated and the total cost of using the herbicide, including the cost, for example of aerial spraying, informs the decision to purchase. This cost-benefit analysis by the end user sets a maximum price which the supplier can demand. When used as a conventional herbicide for weed control, diquat must be applied after the weeds have emerged since it is only effective on contact with green tissue. In this use it is fast-acting in sunlight and more effective on broadleaved weeds than grasses. Mixing of diquat with other herbicides is also feasible. The estimated annual use of diquat in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Survey. This shows that use is fairly stable and in 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, was about annually, almost exclusively in fruit and vegetable crops. Beyond agriculture, diquat is also used to control invasive species such as submerged aquatic vegetation in the California Delta. Because California public drinking water is drawn through the delta as part of the California State Water Project, trace amounts of this pesticide are in much of the state's water supply.  Human safety  Diquat dibromide is moderately toxic. It may be fatal to humans if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin in large quantities. Its chronic neurotoxic effects have been investigated. First aid measures are included with the label information. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) joint meeting on pesticide residues has determined that the acceptable daily intake for diquat (as its ion) is 0-0.006 mg/kg bodyweight per day, with an acute reference dose of 0.8 mg/kg bodyweight. The Codex Alimentarius database maintained by the FAO lists the maximum residue limits for diquat in various food products. Effects on the environment  Diquat bonds strongly to mineral and organic particles in soil and water, where it remains without significant degradation for years. However, bound to clays, diquat is biologically inactive at the concentrations typically observed in agricultural soils. Regulatory authorities of the various nations of the world assess the known hazards, risks, and environmental effects of the compound and compare that with known benefits to the consumer. Brands By international convention and in many countries the law, pesticide labels are required to include the common name of the active ingredients. These names are not the exclusive property of the holder of any patent or trademark and as such they are the easiest way for non-experts to refer to individual chemicals. Companies selling pesticides normally do so using a brand name or wordmark which allows them to distinguish their product from competitor products having the same active ingredient. In many cases, this branding is country and formulation-specific so after several years of sales there can be multiple brand names for a given active ingredient. The situation is made even more complicated when companies license their ingredients to others, as is often done. The licensee will normally wish to create their own set of trademarks for use in advertising and to promote to their customers. In addition, they may intend to mix the licensed product with their own proprietary materials and would certainly create a new brand for these mixtures. It is therefore difficult to provide a comprehensive list of brand names for products containing diquat in its many salt and ester forms. The original ICI brand was Reglone and this name is still used by Syngenta. Other names include Aquacide, Dextrone, Preeglone, Deiquat, Spectracide, Detrone, Tribune and Weedtrine-D.

It is alternately called Lake Razazah (). Lake Milh is a depression into which excess water from Lake Habbaniyah, which comes from the Euphrates River, is diverted through a controlled escape channel or canal. The lake is listed as a wetland of international importance. The lake is rather shallow and water levels change with the seasons. Due to the salts and the changing water levels, this largest freshwater lake in Iraq has lost its important stock of fish species and only a few recreational areas exist around the lake. Geography A more recent satellite image of Lake Milh in 2010, taken from the program World Wind The lake, also termed as \\"Kerbala Gap‚Äù has a large expanse of enclosed by deserts with a few low hills on the shore line. The lake and its surrounding areas lie in an elevation range of . It is a deep closed lake in a sand/silt basin. The lake's western part of the valley has thick forest cover, apart from orchards. In the eastern and southern parts, the terrain is of flat arid/semi-desert type. Mud flats are a common feature in the lake. The geological formation in and around the lake consists of marls, siltstones, gypsum/anhydrite, and limestone bands, but mostly silts. The lake is at a distance of to the south-west of Baghdad, and to the west of Karbala in the Karbala Governorate. History The lake was constructed during the latter half of the 1970s, below the Haur Al Habbaniya as a flood control measure to regulate the flood flows in the Euphrates River. Features The lake is fed from the excess flood flows diverted from the Majora escape of the Habbaniya Lake. The flow from the escape is diverted through the Sin-Al-Thibban Canal, which is a narrow channel that is aligned through a semi-desert area. This diversion prevents flooding in the northern areas. The salinity of the lake is increasing as result of inadequate supply of water from the link canal. According to a USGS study of Landsat imagery of the area it is noted that the water level of the shallow lake fluctuates with the seasons, and in recent years of 1995, 2003, and 2013 the area of the lake has reduced considerably. The local people said that the water depth in the lake was reduced to about since 1993, during the regime of Saddam Hussein. The reason for this reduction in area is mainly due to inadequate diversion of water from Habbaniya Lake, where the priority of use is irrigation. Diversion has been limited to once in 15 days only. This has also affected fishing operations in the lake which in the past used to be throughout the year. As a result, the only fish species surviving in the lake is reported to be \\"al- Shanik\\" or Shanak, (Acanthopagrus cf. arabicus) of marine origin, stocked in the lake by the government. During the Gulf War the area was a military establishment. Vegetation The vegetation around the periphery of the lake consists of Aeluropus lagapoides, Juncus acutus, Phragmites australis, Salicornia herbacea, and Schoenoplectus littoralis. Also reported are shrub- lands made up of desert species of Haloxylon salicornicum, Nitraria retusa, Prosopis farcta, Tamarix aucherana, Tamarix macrocarpa, and Zygophyllum fabago. Fauna The lake area has a large number of wintering waterfowl. Some of the species reported are Marmaronetta angustirostris, Podiceps cristatus, Podiceps nigricollis, Phalacrocorax carbo, Pelecanus onocrotalus, Mergellus albellus and Fulica atra. According to a survey 42 bird species have been recorded. The mammal species reported are the: R√ºppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii), golden jackal (Canis aureus), Indian grey mongoose (Herpestes edwardsii), jungle cat (Felis chaus), and wild cat (Felis silvestris).

He consistently achieved outstanding results in the Vuelta a Espa√±a and in the Tour de France. Sastre established himself as a strong and stable climbing specialist, and after working to improve his individual time trial skills, he became a contender for the top GC spots in the Grand Tours. In total, Sastre finished in the top ten overall of fifteen Grand Tours during his career. Sastre never tested positive for drugs, nor was he implicated in any doping investigation, even though he performed at the top level of cycling. Sastre continues to be widely regarded, following the Lance Armstrong affair, as one of the very few 'clean' riders to have won the Tour de France in modern times as he has never been involved in a doping affair. In fact, with respect to doping allegations and admissions that have surrounded Tour winners in recent decades, Sastre has been called \\"Don Limpio\\" (\\"Mr. Clean\\" in Spanish) by the press and others. Biography When Sastre was young, professional cyclist Francisco Ignacio San Rom√°n lived in his parents' house during military service. Sastre was at first coached by his father, until he became an amateur. Sastre signed his first professional contract in 1997 with . In his five years at ONCE he mostly served as a domestique and only managed a few wins, though he showed his strength in the mountains with several good results, most notably winning the mountain competition in the 2000 Vuelta a Espa√±a. In 2002 he switched to , where he filled the role of captain in the Vuelta a Espa√±a and, until 2005, had a free role in the Tour de France. This resulted in his winning the 13th stage of the 2003 Tour de France, which Sastre won with a pacifier in his mouth, as a greeting to his infant daughter. Sastre finished 2 minutes 32 seconds ahead of team captain Tyler Hamilton on the stage. Before the 2004 season, Carlos Sastre and teammate Ivan Basso trained extensively to improve their individual time trial skills, making them better all-round riders. They went to Boston to train on MIT's wind tunnel. This helped Sastre improve his Vuelta a Espa√±a performance, ranking 6th in the overall classification, as well as 8th in the 2004 Tour de France. Tour 2005: Sastre during the stage 20 individual time trial. In the 2005 Tour de France he was a domestique for Ivan Basso, and 21st in the overall classification. However, as the captain of Team CSC's 2005 Vuelta a Espa√±a campaign, Sastre finally reached the podium of a Grand Tour, finishing in third place behind Denis Menchov and initial winner Roberto Heras. Heras was later disqualified due to a positive EPO test, making Sastre the de facto second placed rider of the competition. After the Vuelta a Espa√±a, he extended his contract with Team CSC for another year. In May 2006 he signed a new contract which expired after the 2008 season. = 2006 = Before the 2006 Giro d'Italia in May, Sastre decided to ride the Giro d'Italia to help Ivan Basso to win,Sastre in Giro line-up , Team CSC, 2006 indicating that he would ride all three Grand Tours; the Giro and Tour in support of Basso and the Vuelta as team captain. In the Giro, Sastre's pace on select mountain stages helped Basso win the overall classification. Sastre finished 43rd in the GC of the 2006 Giro. Days before the 2006 Tour de France started in July, Team CSC suspended Ivan Basso as his name was brought up in the Operaci√≥n Puerto doping case. This meant Sastre became the CSC team captain at the 2006 Tour. Even though his main focus for the season had been the 2006 Vuelta a Espa√±a in September, this Tour was a great opportunity for Sastre to prove himself as a Tour GC contender. Through the mountain stages, Sastre proved himself the strongest mountain rider in the peloton, beating Floyd Landis by one minute and 59 seconds and Andreas Kl√∂den by two and a half minutes on mountain climbs. Sastre var bedst i bjergene, TV 2, July 22, 2006 Sastre was placed well on stage 15, and came in 2nd on both stage 16 and 17, where he closed the gap to the then yellow jersey √ìscar Pereiro. Before the penultimate stage of the Tour, the stage 19 individual time trial, Sastre was the second placed rider overall, trailing race leader √ìscar Pereiro by 14 seconds. However, on the final time trial, which stretched 57 kilometres between Le Creusot and Montceau-les-Mines, Sastre finished 20th, losing several minutes to Pereiro, eventual overall winner Floyd Landis and Andreas Kl√∂den, who took third place overall. Sastre thus finished the 2006 Tour in 4th place. Floyd Landis has since been stripped of this title, making Sastre 3rd in the 2006 Tour de France. When he finished the 2006 Vuelta 4th overall, Sastre, who also rode the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France in 2006, became one of a rare breed of riders to finish all three Grand Tours in one year. = 2007 = In the 2007 Tour de France, Sastre finished 4th overall, 7'08\\" behind race winner Alberto Contador. He finished 2nd overall in the 2007 Vuelta a Espa√±a, 3'31\\" behind race winner Denis Menchov. = 2008 Tour de France = Carlos Sastre entering Paris wearing the yellow jersey. Coming into the 2008 Tour de France, Sastre was considered one of the favorites to win the race along with Australian Cadel Evans of Team , Spaniard Alejandro Valverde of and Russian Denis Menchov of . He also faced competition within his own team from brothers Andy and Fr√§nk Schleck, despite officially being the leader of . Sastre had a quiet, understated opening to the tour. After a lacklustre opening time-trial, he remained relatively restrained in the opening mountain stages in the Pyrenees and opted to stay defensive and follow the wheel of his main rivals. This allowed his CSC teammate Fr√§nk Schleck to claim the yellow jersey at the finish to stage 15 at Prato Nevoso. However, on the crucial 17th stage, Sastre showed his class and mountain climbing prowess, attacking at the bottom of the final climb of the day, Alpe d'Huez, finishing 2 minutes and 15 seconds ahead of Evans, claiming both the stage win and the yellow jersey. Sastre, knowing that a slender lead over a strong time-trialist like Evans may not have been enough to secure overall victory going into the penultimate stage, sought to gain an advantage of at least a couple of minutes over his closest rivals. Following his victorious Stage 17 attack, Sastre took a lead of 1 minute and 24 seconds over teammate Fr√§nk Schleck into the final time trial, although, more crucially, he had a further 10 seconds advantage over Evans, a man considered to be a more accomplished time trialist, who was widely expected to overcome the deficit and leapfrog Sastre into first place. However, Sastre managed to hold onto his lead in the time trial, finishing the Tour with a 58-second lead. Following his overall victory in the general classification, Sastre found it hard to express his joy at finally achieving a boyhood dream; Sastre's victory capped an exceptional 2008 tour for , as they also won the young rider classification with Andy Schleck, the overall team classification, as well as 2 stages, the latter being won by Sastre, on l'Alpe d'Huez. His victory was however criticized by Lance Armstrong, who said the 2008 Tour was a joke. Armstrong later apologized for this to Sastre. Sastre and CSC could not agree on a new contract, so Sastre left the team at the end of the year. After the Tour, Sastre ended up focusing on the Vuelta a Espa√±a looking to double his victories. He later finished 3rd overall. = 2009 = Sastre joined the new for the 2009 season. He won the high mountain Stage 16 of the 2009 Giro d'Italia, which had been called the Giro's queen stage, after seven hours and twelve minutes. His decisive attack saw him break free from a group of general classification contenders to get to the summit of Monte Petrano just under half a minute faster than the group he left. After seeming off his form in Stage 17 of that race, Sastre rebounded with another solo ride to victory in Stage 19 to Mount Vesuvius. He then completed the Giro with a solid ride in the final time-trial around Rome to hold off Ivan Basso and finished 2nd overall. In the 2009 Tour de France, Sastre attempted to defend his title but had a quiet year finishing 16th overall. =2010= In 2010, Sastre raced all three Grand Tours, finishing 8th in the Giro, 20th in the Tour and 7th in the Vuelta. He announced that he would join Geox-TMC for the 2011 season. =2011= In the 2011 Vuelta a Espa√±a Sastre himself finished 20th overall, but helped his teammate Juan Jos√© Cobo, who was later, in 2019, considered ineligible for results due to the use of performance-enhancing drugs in the period between 2009 and 2011, claim the overall title ahead of Chris Froome. Chris Froome was later recognised as the 2011 champion. Bradley Wiggins was promoted to second place, and Bauke Mollema promoted to third. Shortly afterwards, he announced his retirement, bringing an end to a professional career spanning 15 years. Personal life Sastre is married to the sister of deceased cyclist Jos√© Mar√≠a Jim√©nez, who died in 2003.

It is also a National Nature Reserve, and a Nature Conservation Review site. It is protected by international designations as a Ramsar wetland site of international importance, and part of the Fenland Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive. A large part of it is owned and managed by the National Trust. It is one of Britain's oldest nature reserves, and was the first reserve cared for by the National Trust, starting in 1899.. The first parcel of land for the reserve was donated to the Trust by Charles Rothschild in 1901.Tim Sands. Wildlife in Trust: a hundred years of nature conservation. The Wildlife Trusts, 2012. Page 672. The reserve includes fenland, farmland, marsh, and reedbeds. Wicken Fen is one of only four wild fens which still survive in the enormous Great Fen Basin area of East Anglia, where 99.9% of the former fens have now been replaced by arable cultivation. Reserve =Management= The windpump at Wicken Fen Although Wicken Fen is often described as if it were a natural wilderness, it is neither natural nor wild; humans have been closely involved in the fen for centuries, and the reserve is still managed intensively to protect and maintain the delicate balance of species which has built up over the years. Much of the management tries to recreate the old systems of fen working which persisted for hundreds of years, allowing species to become dependent on the practices. For example, the sedge plant, Cladium mariscus, is harvested every year and sold for thatching roofs. The earliest recorded sedge harvest at Wicken was in 1414,Rowell, T.A. (1983). History and Management of Wicken Fen. PhD thesis, University of Cambridge. and ever since then, sedge has been regularly cut. The sedge-cutting has allowed an array of plants and animals to colonize the area that depend on regular clearance of the sedge in order to survive. (Many plants and animals are dependent upon regular management of vegetation in this way to keep their habitats intact.) As part of the management plan for Wicken Fen, Konik ponies and Highland cattle have been introduced to some areas in order to prevent scrub from regrowing. The present appearance of Wicken Fen is the result of centuries of management by human beings. Many of the practices now undertaken have changed little since medieval times. In surrounding areas, the landscape has changed so completely that it is almost impossible to imagine how it must once have all looked. Only a very few places survive where it is possible to experience this primitive landscape first hand; Wicken Fen is one of these. Tracks in and around Wicken Fen became visible on Google Street View before many towns and urban areas in Britain were covered. =Windpump= Wicken Fen features the last surviving wooden windpump in the Fens. It is a small smock wind pump, which was probably built about 1912 at Adventurers' Fen for land drainage.http://www.nationalmillsweekend.co.uk/pages_wind/wicken%20Fen.htm The pump was moved to its present site and restored in 1956 by the National Trust. The Windpump now pumps water from the drainage channel up into the Fen to maintain a high water table. The nearby museums, Stretham Old Engine and Prickwillow Museum tell the story of how windpumps were succeeded by steam engines in the nineteenth century and diesel engines in the twentieth century. =Science= Specimen of Swallowtail butterfly, collected from Wicken Fen The Fen has been long associated with natural history. Charles Darwin collected beetles on the site in the 1820s. Many eminent Victorian naturalists collected beetles, moths and butterflies at Wicken Fen; some of their collections can still be found in museums. Many nationally rare species have been recorded, including the swallowtail butterfly until its decline and eventual loss from the fen in the 1950s, and despite an attempt to reintroduce it. From the 1920s onwards the fathers of modern ecology and conservation, the Cambridge botanists Sir Arthur Tansley and Sir Harry Godwin carried out their pioneering work on the reserve. One of the world's longest running science experiments, the Godwin Plots, continues at the Fen to this day. The Fen's long association with science, especially nearby Cambridge University, continues to the present day with scientists actively involved in the management of the reserve, and many hundreds of research papers published about the fen over more than a century. A Bibliography can be downloaded from the Wicken website and the latest Newsletter. =Facilities= The Fen is open to the public. The site is open all year round from dawn to dusk except for Christmas Day. Some paths are closed in very wet weather, and some areas are inaccessible. However, there is a boardwalk, leading to two bird hides that is open all of the time. There are several bird hides and many miles of trails for visitors to follow. There is a visitor centre, shop and caf√©. The visitor centre has a permanent exhibition of information about Wicken Fen, its history and ecological importance. The Fen Cottage is open on Sundays, showing the life of fen people at the turn of the 20th century. Development of the reserve National Trust land at Wicken Fen in 2011.Maps of National Trust owned land at Wicken Fen , accessed 18th Dec 2011 On 1 May 1899, the National Trust purchased two acres (8094 m2) for ¬£10, and by 2016 it was over 800 acres. =The Wicken Fen Vision= The Wicken Fen Vision is a project of the National Trust to, over a 100-year period, expand the fen to a size of . It was launched in 1999 to mark the 100th anniversary of the first acquisition. In 2001 a major acquisition was made with the purchase of Burwell Fen Farm (1.65 km2). In 2005, a 100 ha turf farm, to be called Tubney Fen, was purchased. Other purchases include Hurdle Hall Farm and Oily Hall Farm in 2009, and St Edmunds Fen in 2011. The National Trust aims to acquire further land as it becomes available, paying the market prices. As a result of the increased area of wetlands, the populations of skylarks, snipe, grey partridge, widgeon and teal have all increased with a major increase in barn owls and short-eared owls. Buzzards, hen and marsh- harriers have returned, and bitterns began breeding by 2009 for the first time since the 1930s.http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-access-annual- report-09.pdf National Trust Annual Report 2009) The Wicken Fen Vision has great support from many people and organisations. Large sums of money have been raised from grant-awarding bodies, and from individual donors. Enlargement of the reserve has faced criticism from some residents of nearby settlements. An on-line petition entitled 'SaveOurFens' stated \\"We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Stop the National Trust flooding or junglefying our Cambridgeshire Fens!\\". Concerns centred on the issues of loss of agricultural land and increases in levels of local traffic and mosquito populations. A petition named 'wickenfenvision', in favour of the scheme, was also held. The two petitions ended in 2010, with a two to one vote in favour of the Wicken Fen Vision.Petition supporting the Vision, 846 votes; Petition against the Vision, 418 votes = Lodes Way = Lodes Way sustainable transport route As part of the Vision project, the National Trust, in conjunction with Sustrans, opened a sustainable transport route connecting Wicken Fen with Anglesey Abbey and Bottisham. Work on the paths and bridges began in 2008 and was scheduled for completion in 2011. The new walking, cycle and horse riding route is long, and includes a number of minor roads as well as new paths and bridges to link the gap in the existing Sustrans National Cycle Route 11 between Cambridge and Ely. The project, originally called the Wicken Fen Spine Route, includes the construction of a series of new bridges over the man-made waterways known as Lodes. In July 2008, the new Swaffham Bulbeck Lode bridge and a half-mile cycle and bridleway path across White Fen were opened. Upgrades to the crossing of the River Cam at Bottisham Lock and the bridge over Burwell Lode are planned. A new bridge over Reach Lode was opened in September 2010 and an upgraded cycle way across Burwell Fen is nearly complete. The total cost of the scheme is ¬£2 million, ¬£600,000 of which are from Sustrans's Connect2 scheme. =Habitats= Wicken Lode Wicken Fen is divided by a man-made watercourse called \\"Wicken Lode\\". The area north of Wicken Lode, together with a smaller area known as Wicken Poors' Fen and St. Edmunds Fen, forms the classic old, undrained fen. The designated national nature reserve of 269 hectares also includes the area around the Mere, to the south of Wicken Lode. These areas contain original peat fen with communities of carr and sedge. They support rare and uncommon fenland plants such as marsh pea, Cambridge milk parsley, fen violet and marsh fern. This part of the Fen can be enjoyed from a series of boardwalks (made from recycled plastic). The area south of the Lode is called \\"Adventurers' Fen\\" and consists of rough pasture (grading from dry to wet grassland), reedbed and pools. The dykes, abandoned clay pits and other watercourses carry a great wealth of aquatic plants and insects, many of which are uncommon elsewhere. Wildlife Naturalists were originally drawn to Wicken because of its species richness and the presence of rarities. The Fen has therefore received a great deal of recording effort and as a result, huge species lists have accumulated. Surveys continue to the present day. In 1998 over 20 species new to the Fen were recorded for the first time and in 2005 another 10 were added. Many of the species lists can be downloaded from the Fen website (see below). Wicken Fen was established as a nature reserve because of its invertebrate and plant interest. Over 8,500 species have so far been recorded on the fen, including more than 125 that are included in the Red Data Book of rare invertebrates. =Invertebrates= The reserve supports large numbers of fly, snail, spider and beetle species. Damselflies found here include the emerald, azure, large red, red-eyed, variable and common blue; together with dragonflies such as the southern and brown hawkers, emperor, hairy dragonfly and black-tailed skimmer. The Lepidoptera fauna is very rich also, especially moths with over 1000 species including the nationally rare reed leopard and marsh carpet. Other local moths include cream-bordered green pea, yellow-legged clearwing and emperor. China-mark moths such as the small, brown and ringed are also seen here. Local butterflies include the green hairstreak, brown argus, speckled wood and brimstone. There are a range of freshwater and land snails including the Red Data Book species Desmoulin's whorl snail. =Birds= A reed warbler at Wicken Fen The site is mainly noted for its plants and invertebrates, but many birds also can be seen, and these are particularly popular with visitors as they are often easier to observe than the more elusive insects and plants. Bird species recorded living at the site include great crested grebe, cormorant, gadwall, teal, sparrowhawk, water rail, kingfisher, snipe, woodcock, great spotted and green woodpeckers; and barn, little, tawny, long- eared and short-eared owls. Visiting birds include bittern, whooper swan, golden plover, garganey, pochard, goosander, marsh harrier, hen harrier, merlin and hobby. In season, it is most unlikely that visitors will fail to hear the 'drumming' of snipe. =Plants= Notable plants include the fen violet, great fen sedge Cladium mariscus, marsh pea, greater spearwort, marsh orchids and milk parsley. There are also a number of stonewort species present in the ditches and ponds, along with flowering rush, water millefoil, and yellow and white water lilies.

He entered the Dominican order and lectured on philosophy at Paris, being also ordinary preacher to Henry IV, and afterwards ambassador at Rome. In 1606 he was vicar-general of the congregation of France, and received from Marie de' Medici the revenues of the sees of Lombez and Saintes. He also administered the diocese of Metz, and was nominated to the diocese of Marseille in 1621, but ill health obliged him here to take a coadjutor. Coeffeteau won considerable distinction in the controversy against the Protestant reformers and also wrote a History of Rome from Augustus to Constantine. Many of his theological writings were collected in one volume (Paris, 1622), and at the time of his death he was engaged on a translation of the New Testament which is still in manuscript. He was buried in the now demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris. He was acclaimed for his command of the French language.

Most are herbaceous perennials growing to tall. A few are shrubs. The genus is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Most are commonly called bonesets, thoroughworts or snakeroots in North America. The genus is named for Mithridates Eupator, king of Pontus. Systematics and taxonomy Eupatorium has at times been held to contain as many as 800 species,Whittemore (1987) but many of these have been moved (at least by some authors) to other genera, including Ageratina, Chromolaena, Condylidium, Conoclinium, Critonia, Cronquistianthus, Eutrochium, Fleischmannia, Flyriella, Hebeclinium, Koanophyllon, Mikania, and Tamaulipa. The classification of the tribe Eupatorieae, including species placed in Eupatorium in the present or past, is an area of ongoing research, so further changes are likely. What seems fairly certain by now is that there is a monophyletic group containing Eupatorium (about 42 species of white flowered plants in North America, Europe and Asia, but not South America) and the Joe-pye weeds (Eutrochium), and possibly others.Ito et al. (2000), Schmidt & Schilling (2006) Uses Eupatorium are grown as ornamental plants, in particular in Asia. A number of popular ornamental plants formerly included in Eupatorium have been moved to other genera, such as Bartlettina and Conoclinium. Tobacco leaf curl virus is a pathogen occasionally affecting plants of this genus. The foliage is eaten by some Lepidoptera larvae, including those of Orthonama obstipata (The Gem). =Medical use= The common names for the plants are all based on the previous usage of one species, Eupatorium perfoliatum, as an herbal medicine. Despite its name, boneset is not used to treat broken bones, instead the common name apparently derives from the herb's use to treat dengue fever, which was also called breakbone fever because of the pain that it caused. The name thoroughwort also comes from Eupatorium perfoliatum, and refers to the perfoliate leaves, in which the stem appears to pierce the leaf (i.e. go through, note that in older usage \\"thorough\\" was not distinguished from \\"through\\", compare for example the word thoroughfare). Boneset, although poisonous to humans and grazing livestock, has been used in folk medicine,Sharma et al. (1999) for instance to excrete excess uric acid which causes gout. Caution is advised when using boneset, since it contains toxic compounds that can cause liver damage. Side effects include muscular tremors, weakness, and constipation; overdoses may be deadly.

Phytologia 86(3):116-120 Within Helianthodae, they belong to an informal group without taxonomic rank called the phytomelanin cypsela clade, which contains 11 tribes. The sister tribe of Eupatorieae is probably Perityleae.

King and Harold E. Robinson wrote a book on Eupatorieae.King,R.M., and Robinson,H.E. 1987. The Genera of Eupatorieae Missouri Botanical Garden Monographs in Systematic Botany 22:1-581. Missouri Botanical Garden/Allen Press. Lawrence, Kansas, USA. In this book, they divided the tribe into 18 subtribes. These are Hofmeisteriinae, Oxylobinae, Oaxacaniinae, Mikaniinae, Trichocoroninae, Adenostemmatinae, Fleischmanniinae, Ageratinae, Eupatoriinae, Liatrinae, Praxelinae, Gyptidinae, Disynaphiinae, Ayapaninae, Alomiinae, Critoniinae, Hebecliniinae, and Neomirandeinae. In 1994, Kare Bremer did a cladistic analysis of Eupatorieae in his book on the family Asteraceae.Bremer,K. 1994. Asteraceae: Cladistics & Classification. Timber Press. Portland, Oregon, USA. He recognized only 16 subtribes, subsuming Neomirandeinae into Hebecliniinae. In 2007, D. J. Nicholas Hind and Harold E. Robinson covered Eupatorieae for The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants. They recognized 17 subtribes equivalent to those of King and Robinson (1987) except that Oaxacaniinae was placed in the synonymy of Hofmeisteriinae. The division of this tribe into subtribes is provisional and likely to change when more data, especially DNA sequence data, becomes available. No DNA study has yet included a large number of species and sampled widely in Eupatorieae, but 3 studies have investigated Eupatorium and its relatives within the tribe.Schilling,E.E., Panero,J.L., and Cox,P.B. 1999. \\"Chloroplast DNA restriction site data support a narrow interpretation of Eupatorium\\". Plant Systematics and Evolution 219:209-223.Ito,M., Watanabe,K., Kita,Y., Kawahara,T., Crawford,D.J., and Yahara,T. 2000. \\"Phylogeny and Phytogeography of Eupatorium: Insights from sequence data of the nrDNA ITS regions and cpDNA RFLP\\". Journal of Plant Research 113(1109):79-89. These 3 studies are the basis for the phylogeny shown below. In some of the older works, the genus Eupatorium has been circumscribed to include as many as 1200 species, over a third of the species in the tribe. In more recent works, Eupatorium has been defined to contain about 40‚Äì45 species, with the main differences between authors being whether to include Eutrochium and whether certain populations should be considered species, varieties, or hybrids. As more becomes known about the Eupatorieae, other genera will surely have to be revised as well. A partial phylogeny of the tribe (focusing on Eupatorium and some of the other North American genera) is: From the positions of Stevia and Stomatanthes in the phylogeny, some of the subtribes are probably polyphyletic. Many of the branches in the tree above have only weak statistical support, so this tree can not serve as a basis for re-classification. For convenience, the genera will remain in their current subtribes until a much larger data set enables the production of a more robustly supported phylogeny. = Subtribes = In terms of the number of genera, the largest subtribes are Critoniinae (40), Gyptidinae (29), Ageratinae (26), Alomiinae (23), Ayapaninae (13), and Oxylobinae (9). *Gyptidinae, found mostly in eastern Brazil, is known to be polyphyletic.

The school opened as a Secondary Modern in 1953 under headteacher Mr Garth. It was officially opened by Lord Cobham on 26 March 1955. The Chase became a comprehensive with the abolition of selective education in Worcestershire in 1974 and became an academy on 1 November 2011. Teaching students from Year 7 to Year 13, The Chase has around 1,500 students, making it one of the larger schools in Worcestershire, with just over 300 students in the sixth form. Recent results, notably the headline measure of 5+ A*-C GCSEs (or equivalent) including English and maths, are significantly above the national average at 72% in 2015 and 74% in 2014. The school is located in Barnards Green, a suburb of Malvern, adjacent to the sites of QinetiQ and the Malvern Hills Science Park. Links between the school and these organisations has led to the establishment of the Cyber-security Apprentice Development Scheme, an apprenticeship initiative aimed to encourage more students into the cyber security sector.  Background  The Chase School has been a specialist schools programme Technology College since 1999, and was awarded Beacon school status in 2002. The school achieved Artsmark Gold status in 2001 for excellence in art and design, drama, music, creative writing and public speaking. The Chase School is also a Language College (French, German, Spanish and Japanese). The school has Sportsmark Gold status, this is awarded to schools by Sport England for the excellent in provision of Physical Education and school sport. It is administered by the Worcestershire County Directorate of Educational Services, and Matt May is the head of governors. Former headmaster Richard Jacobs started in 2013, taking over from Kevin Peck who had started in 2002. Peck was brought in when the previous headteacher retired; David Fawbert had been awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to education during his tenure. There are 16 primary schools in Malvern that feed The Chase School and nearby Dyson Perrins CofE Academy. Current headmaster, Mike Fieldhouse, began his position as acting headteacher in 2017, while Richard Jacobs was placed on special leave. He became headmaster in July 2017. The most recent Ofsted inspection took place in July 2016, awarding the school Grade 2 (Good) overall with the Sixth Form ranked as Grade 1 (Outstanding). This echoed the findings of the 2009 inspection. The inspectors noted that the \\"curriculum is well planned and inclusive\\" and how pupils are \\"keen to learn\\" and that \\"positive relationships with teachers and other pupils in the classroom support learning\\". The school was named in July 2019 as a computing hub for the National Centre for Computing Education. Buildings Photograph of The Chase School. A view of the stream in front of the Science Block with the Malvern Hills in the background. The Chase School library opened in September 2006 and was officially opened on 23 February 2007, by the now poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy. The library is situated adjacent to the main ground floor block. The science block was built and was open in 2008 and was officially opened in 2009. In 2014 local MP Harriett Baldwin officially opened the new ¬£1 million humanities block, a new build featuring seven classrooms. Uniform The Chase School's uniform for boys consists of a blue sweater, with the school's emblem on the left side of the polo or jumper, a white shirt, a blue and gold, diagonally striped tie and grey or black trousers. The girls' uniform consists of a blue sweater, with the emblem on the left side of the polo or jumper, a white shirt, a blue and gold, diagonally striped tie or a revere shirt without the tie, black, blue or natural tights (unpatterned), and a blue or black skirt. Traditions The students of The Chase School take part in the annual \\"Hills Walk\\", a 7.5-mile walk across the Malvern Hills and the surrounding area. The walk begins at the clock tower in North Malvern, at the foot of the Malvern Hills, and finishes at the school campus on Geraldine Road, Malvern. The walk has taken place every year since it started in 1977, to celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee, apart from in 2006, when it was too hot, and in 2013 due to thunder and lightning, and in 2019 due to stormy weather, and the walk was cancelled. A Senior Student Team is selected each year from students in the Upper-Sixth form. One Head Boy and one Head Girl, supported by several deputies, take on additional roles including making introductions at Speech Day and representing the school at various events. The school supports a variety of charities and runs various fundraising events, regularly raising over ¬£5,000 each year. This includes the donation of food parcels to residents of local housing for the elderly and to food banks in Malvern. Notable achievements The Chase has a strong history of varied extra-curricular achievements. In July 2016 the school won a record eighth best team trophy at the Worcestershire Schools' Sailing and Canoeing Association (WSSCA) OnBoard Regatta. The school's links with local technology companies has enabled them to develop apprenticeships in cyber security. In 2015 a team representing The Chase secured the runners-up prize in the national finals of the UK Cyber Centurion Competition and second in the international competition. The Chase has also found success in national and regional business competitions, achieving top marks in the 2012 Business, Accountancy and Skills Education competition run by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). They have also enjoyed great success in Young Enterprise each year. =Notable alumni= *Cher Lloyd, singer and former X Factor contestant.https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local- news/x-factor-star-cher-lloyd-249415 *Ed Elliott (sculptor) achieved recognition for his critically acclaimed wooded angel Greer, commissioned by the National Trust. *Alex Hegenbarth (politician) https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000990 *Adam Hatton, Director of exterior design at Jaguar, co-designed the 2009 XJ X351,Jaguar XJ#X351 .282009.E2.80.93.29 and is sole designer of the 2014 Jaguar XE.http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/regional/11488713.print/ *Evie Richards *Tom Scutt, theatre designer.

From an anthropological standpoint, this type of marriage strengthens the ties between both groups (the wife's family or clan and the husband's) and preserves the contract between the two to provide children and continue the alliance. The Inuit people (formerly known as Eskimos) of northern Alaska, Canada and Greenland follow or followed this custom. It is followed by the Chiricahua group of the Western Apache, who are Athabaskan speaking, as is levirate marriage. Sororate marriage is practiced by the Sioux (Lakota) tribes, and some Western Mono tribes in California, such as the Wuksachi or Waksachi. Sororate marriage is practiced by the Swazi people and for the same reasons as stated. This type of marriage is made in Bhutan. The former King Jigme Singye Wangchuck (the current king's father) is married to four wives, all of whom are sisters. There is evidence that sororate marriage existed in ancient China. Levirate marriage and junior sororate marriage are permitted for the Hindu Bania caste. Sororate marriage (a widower marrying his wife's younger sister) was practiced by Jews in the shtetl (eastern European culture of the late 1900s) Judaism Levirate marriage was encouraged among ancient Jewish cultures; the chief example of sororate marriage found in the Hebrew Bible is that of sisters Rachel and Leah to one husband Jacob, forebear of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. However, such a marriage as Jacob's during the lifetime of the first wife was subsequently prohibited by the Law of Moses (Leviticus 18:18).https://www.biblehub.com/leviticus/18-18.htm Christianity Besides being prohibited in Roman Catholic canon law, marriage is also prohibited within close degrees of affinity by conservative Lutherans. This is on the basis of the same Bible passages noted in Judaism. Together with consanguineous relatives, close relatives by marriage are within the prohibited degrees of kinship even if not specifically outlawed by the state.Christian Cyclopedia article on Impediments to Marriage.

For the most part, the police forces of the United Kingdom are unarmed; however, all have firearms units to provide the police force with the capability to deal with terrorists and armed criminals. A police officer cannot apply to join the firearms unit without first finishing their two-year probationary period, with a further two years in a core policing role for some forces. Firearms unit is the most common name outside of the capital, while that of London's Metropolitan Police Service is called the Specialist Firearms Command, Trojan or SC&O19.; Within the media it is sometimes compared to the SWAT units of the United States. Typically, criminals do not carry firearms in the UK and the number of firearms available to criminals is generally low compared to other Western nations partly due to it being harder to smuggle them into the UK as an island nation and partly due to the United Kingdom's gun laws requiring licensing and background checks to legally acquire and possess most types of firearms. In the majority of cases the presence of an armed officer can often be enough to negotiate the surrender of an armed criminal and the number of times a police firearm is deliberately discharged at suspects in the UK rarely exceeds around ten occasions per year. And for an example of this, Thames Valley Police has only used a firearm against a suspect once in its entire history. Only three forces in the United Kingdom routinely arm officers due to the nature of their work; the Ministry of Defence Police who are responsible law enforcement on MOD property, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary who guard civil nuclear facilities, and the Police Service of Northern Ireland.Ministry of Defence Police - Home On 13 January 2016, following the November 2015 Paris attacks it was decided to significantly increase the numbers of armed officers in London. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has decided that he will double the number of armed officers and promised a 'significant' further announcement.  Organization, history, training and tactics  =History= Police use of firearms has been a slow and controversial process, usually due to resistance from senior officers regarding firearms and adverse reactions from the public. During the Second World War, firearms were only carried on protection duties, such as guarding Downing Street, Buckingham Palace and locations at risk from enemy sabotage. However, the police were supplied with many firearms such as the Canadian Ross Rifle and P14 Enfield as part of the anti-invasion preparations of World War II. Due to equipment shortages, firearms issued to the police were often in poor condition and sometimes lacked a holster to accommodate the weapon, leading to them being concealed in the uniform tunic or tucked in the waistline of the trouser. In the years following the Second World War, training for the standard issue Webley & Scott revolver consisted of firing six shots, to pass, it was required that three shots be on target. Loading, unloading and safe handling of the weapon was not usually taught. During the same period, the police had an increased number of ex-servicemen joining the ranks, and their previous knowledge was treated to suffice leading to them being issued with firearms without police training, in an emergency. An example of this, was when the police mounted a large-scale search following the Shepherd's Bush murders, firearms were issued to any officer who had previous experience of their use, such as officers that attended shooting clubs or ex-members of the armed forces. The Metropolitan Police was formed on 29 September 1829, with the passing of the Metropolitan Police Act. The officers of the 'new police' were unarmed to counter fears of a paramilitary organisation. Despite this, Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel gave the Commissioner authorisation to purchase fifty flintlock pocket pistols for use in exceptional circumstances. As time progressed, the flintlocks were decommissioned, being superseded by early revolvers. During the 1880s, burglary (or \\"house breaking\\" as it was then called) was a common problem for police. \\"House breakers\\" often carried firearms, due to the law of the day permitting members of the public to own firearms. After a series of fatal shootings of officers on the outer divisions of the Metropolis, and after much press coverage debating whether the service should be routinely armed, the Commissioner applied to the Home Secretary for authorisation to allow officers on the outer districts to carry a revolver if they wished to at night. A revolver could only be issued if, in the opinion of the senior officer, the officer could be trusted to use it safely and with discretion. From then on, all officers who felt the need to be armed, could be so. The practice lasted until 1936, although the vast majority of the system was phased out by the end of the 19th century. During the late 19th century, revolvers were issued to divisional police stations. The number of revolvers stored at the station depended on its size, and geographical location. In the Metropolitan Police the issue of firearms to stations was standardised with; ten pistols with 320 rounds of ammunition issued to divisional stations, six pistols with 192 rounds per sub-divisional station, and three pistols with 96 rounds to each section station. The firearms were kept in a locked box, with rules of their use attached to the front of it. The key to the box was held by a senior officer, and their permission had to be sought before the box could be opened. Rules of their use dictated that if the revolvers were to be issued, the names of the officers who they were allocated to be recorded, and they be checked of their condition and loaded by the Section Sergeant when the officers paraded for duty. In 1948, concerns were aired by the Home Office over the civil police's role if there were to be another war, invasion or the newly posed threat of nuclear attack. The government dictated that the role of the police would still be to maintain law and order, even in times of emergency. However, despite the police not being a combatant force, in the event of war they were to have an offensive capability assisting the Armed Forces. It was decided that to be successful in this role, the police needed to be issued firearms. The Ministry of Defence loaned Sten submachine guns, along with a number of Lee‚ÄìEnfield No4 bolt-action rifles. These, along with Webley & Scott revolvers and ammunition were kept in secret depots around the United Kingdom, with the locations known by senior officers, so each force had access to them if required. Before the 1970s, rules regarding operational use of firearms dictated that they were to be worn in a holster on the duty belt, concealing the weapon until drawn. The rule was revised when armed police officers began to carry firearms other than pistols, the size of which meant they could not be concealed. The first instance of this was when armed airport officers of the Metropolitan Police Aviation Security OCU were issued with the newly sanctioned Heckler & Koch MP5 semi-automatic carbine. Before a major reconstruction of the rules regarding operational use of firearms, high- ranking officers such as Chief Inspectors or Superintendents could authorise firearms officers to draw weapons from an ARV, in the event of an \\"immediate threat to life\\". In a less threatening situation, authorisation had to be gained from an on-call senior officer of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The difficulty of this authorisation was realised, as desired officers were not always available. The decision to draw firearms from the secure cabinet in the rear of the ARV now rests upon the individual judgement of the firearms officer, with personal side arms being carried on each member as a matter of routine. For planned operations, a designated senior officer can authorise the deployment of carbines. Intervention from Specialist Firearms Officers requires authorisation from the Home Office before the Chief Constable of the force can deploy them. Before the creation of Authorised Firearms Officer and Specialist Firearms Officer roles, each large police station had a small number of \\"authorised shots\\" (as they were then called). trained in the use of firearms. Until needed, the \\"authorised shots\\" carried out routine policing duties. After the formation of firearms units, all trained officers in each force were brought together under one unit, with a structured training programme headed by senior officers. The concept of Armed Response Vehicles were not introduced until 1991, being first transitioned in London. Within London's Metropolitan Police, \\"authorised shots\\" were not completely phased out after the creation of AFO and SFO. Within London, sieges involving a terrorist objective or required specialist entry was dealt with by D11. Whereas, all other siege situations involving an armed, barricaded criminal were dealt with by borough \\"divisional riflemen\\", supervised by a senior officer doubling as instructor from D11. The Metropolitan Police firearms unit has had a series of name changes, due to continuous changes in departmental units. When first formed in 1966, it was named D6, before being changed to D11. After that it was changed to PT17 under Personnel and Training, when the Specialist Operations designation was introduced it was changed to SO19. Upon \\"SO\\" being phased out in 2005, its designation was replaced by Central Operations. The firearms units present name is Specialist Firearms Command, with its designation being SCO19. Since 2005, the police have been equipped and authorised to employ the use of the Heckler & Koch L104A1 \\"baton gun\\", which fires an attenuating energy projectile. The \\"baton gun\\" is authorised for use in situations where an offender needs to be incapacitated, without resorting to the use of conventional firearms. Armed officers also have access to the discriminating irritant projectile, which is designed to deliver a cloud of irritant in the direction of an aggressive offender. During July 2007, the Home Office announced plans to supply police forces in England & Wales with tasers as a Less-lethal option. Tasers are authorised for use in situations where an offender needs to be incapacitated, but without resorting to the use of conventional firearms. Tasers are authorised for use by Authorised and Specialist Firearms Officers, along with other units who are not routinely armed such as public order Police Support Units. Following a 12-month trial period in 2004, tasers became authorised on a full-time basis. = Organization = Firearms units in large forces are headed by a Chief Superintendent, Superintendent, four Chief Inspectors, three Inspectors and six Sergeants, with up to fifty to sixty Constables. In certain smaller forces, the firearms unit is headed by a Superintendent, four Chief Inspectors, two Inspectors, four Sergeants, with forty to fifty Constables. Firearms units maintain a number of tactical advisors to aid senior officers in decision making during major incidents, and to provide a planning capability for planned firearms operations and VIP protection.Manual of Guidance on the Police Use of Firearms The main responsibilities of firearms units in the UK are the response to emergency calls believed to involve firearms, and the arrest of armed, dangerous or barricaded criminals in official raids and operations. Specialist Firearms Officers receive enhanced training in dynamic entry tactics, for hostage rescue. Each police force operates an Armed Response Vehicle system, crewed by Authorised Firearms Officers. ARVs were introduced into the British police in the early 1990s, to provide them with the capability to respond to firearms incidents. ARVs constantly patrol a geographical area, reducing deployment time. Most forces have purchased Volvo V70s for ARV duties, although the Metropolitan Police Service employs standard BMW area cars, adapted for specialist duty usage. The new 'standard' vehicle for ARV use, as of 2012, favored by most forces and soon to be adopted by the MET police is the BMW X5. Many forces operate Road Policing Units, solely responsible for maintaining the traffic flow on UK motorways and A roads. Instead of creating both an ARV and an RPU, certain forces have merged them together creating \\"Traffic ARVs\\" which carry out normal road policing duties, until required for firearms incidents. Within London's Metropolitan Police, Armed Response Vehicles are crewed by three Authorised Firearms Officers. Each AFO has a specified task - an advanced driver, a navigator and an observer who is responsible for scene assessment and liaison with other services. ARVs outside of the capital are crewed by two officers, with the observer assuming the role of navigator. Some forces have reserved a radio call sign for ARVs, such as \\"trojan\\" to make them easier to identify when using radios. ARVs in most forces are identified by a circular yellow sticker on the body of the vehicle, and some have \\"ARV\\" printed on the vehicle. Metropolitan Police firearms officers usually patrol on-foot more often than those outside London, due to the large geographic area the Metropolitan Police are responsible for and the number of sensitive government buildings in need of armed security. They can also be found at major demonstrations, and large social events such as the Chinese New Year. Diplomatic Protection Group officers are routinely armed as they are responsible for guarding government buildings classed as \\"high risk\\", such as foreign embassies, Downing Street, along with Westminster and Buckingham Palace.Metropolitan Police Service - Central Operations If a police forces geographical area includes an airport, armed officers would be assigned to the airport to assist in security. The Metropolitan Police's Aviation Security Operational Command Unit polices London Heathrow Airport, Sussex Police are responsible for Gatwick Airport, and Essex Police are responsible for Stansted Airport. In some forces major crime or specialist operational units have firearms capacities. The Metropolitan Police Service has the flying squad which is a group of Specialist Firearm Officers used operationally to tackle organized crime groups and armed gangs. Within the flying squad is The Projects Team which was a highly secretive unit inside the Flying Squad. The Projects Team are deployed against Contract killers, armed gang enforcers and even more of the most dangerous members of the organized underworld. = Training = Before a police officer can apply to join the firearms unit, they are required to have completed their two-year probationary period. After being screened for security clearance and undergoing various interviews, they are invited to attend the National Police Firearms Training Centre at Gravesend, Kent. At the centre, the potential AFOs undergo one week of intensive training on the Glock 17 pistol, Heckler & Koch MP5 semi automatic carbine, Heckler & Koch L104A1 baton gun and the X26 Taser. This is followed by training on the legal regulations regarding the police use of firearms and rules of engagement, a further six weeks of training is focused solely on ARVs, with an emphasis on driving techniques, high speed pursuit methods and safely executing controlled crashes. Authorized Firearms Officers applying to become Specialist Firearms Officers, are required to attend an eight-week training course at the National Police Firearms Training Centre. The main role of an SFO is to intervene in situations that are beyond the control of AFOs, such as building sieges involving a hostage situation. Potential SFOs are extensively trained in the use of specialist firearms, method of entry techniques and abseiling 'fast rope' skills. Potential SFOs are also trained in safe entry into air and watercraft. Training also includes the use of tear gas and stun grenades, safe handling of hostages and rescue techniques, computer simulated 'war games' of potential threats such as a major evacuation or terrorist attack, and training in the use of protective clothing against CBRN attack. The guidelines regarding operational use of firearms and rules of engagement are dictated by the Association of Chief Police Officers, making sure that the rules outlined are compliant with the European Convention of Human Rights and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Firearms officers are authorized to fire upon a suspect if they pose an \\"immediate threat to life\\", such as if an armed offender brandished a firearm at a member of the public or police officer. They may also fire if an offender is clearly in possession of a firearm, or is suspected to be carrying one. In all situations, a clear oral warning must be given of the officer's intention to use firearms, unless in a particular situation where it would be pointless or place life at risk. Firearms officers are also authorized to use their firearms for the humane destruction of animals, if the latter pose a significant threat. Firearms officers are not required to give an oral warning if they are approaching someone who is believed to be intent on committing a suicide bombing. All officers are trained to fire once at the central mass in order to incapacitate a threat, then to re-assess the situation and the threat posed to justify any further shots. However, if Operation Kratos contingency plans are activated, an armed officer may shoot at the target's head, to kill, as a standard incapacitating shot risks detonating a bomb attached to the person. In all situations, the officer is to make the decision when to shoot. However, they are accountable in court and are asked to justify their actions in a court of law. = Tactics = Metropolitan police officer attached to the DPG guards an entrance to Downing Street, London, home of the Prime Minister. Upon an emergency call being received about an incident involving firearms, an Armed Response Vehicle crewed by AFOs would be dispatched. The AFOs first on scene would attempt to contain an armed subject if they are inside a building, whereas if they were in the open where an immediate threat is posed a quicker solution would be sought. If a subject is inside a building which is barricaded, AFOs would most likely assault the building as long as it does not require specialist entry or the motive of the subject is terrorist affiliated. If the building required specialist entry or a terrorist gain, Specialist Firearms Officers would attempt to assault the building. Pending authorisation from the Home Office to deploy SFOs, ARV officers would organise an inner and outer cordon. The inner being made up of armed officers, and the outer of unarmed to prevent members of the public gaining entry and prevent traffic entering the affected area. Efforts would be made to evacuate people in the immediate vicinity so that they are not at risk of stray gunfire, or confine them to their homes for their own safety. A control room would be established where emergency services can liaise and plan the operation, along with a mobile canteen nearby. The police would employ the Gold Silver Bronze command structure, with a Gold Commander being a senior officer overseeing events from a nearby police station, the Silver Commander who would oversee events from the on-scene control room, and the Bronze Commander who would be as close to the incident as possible. In the preliminary stages of a siege or hostage situation, an observation point is allocated and assigned a marksman. A deliberate action plan would be devised, briefing each member of the assault team on the entry points, and details of the assault. Negotiations are made allowing the hostage takers to issue demands, which are usually done to acquire time and avoid harm to the hostages. The negotiations would be attended by a psychological profiler to assess the hostage takers state of mind, such as whether they have been forced into the situation through avoiding arrest or have a wider objective. If negotiations deteriorate to a point where hostages are placed at risk of immediate death or injury, an assault by SFOs may be authorised. In a minority of cases, the police may hand over responsibility to the British Army Special Forces. The structure of police assault teams vary, but the most commonly deployed are: * \\"Shield officer\\" - carrying a ballistic shield to cover the team from being fired upon. * \\"Baton officer\\" - carrying a baton (as well as a firearm) to engage any unarmed offenders. * Method of entry Specialist - responsible for opening barricaded doors, usually armed with a Remington shotgun. * \\"Cover officer\\" - responsible for protecting the other members of the team as they carry out their functions. * \\"Prisoner reception officer\\" - responsible for handling prisoners. * A team leader and a police dog may enter. Such an assault may be preceded by \\"ferret\\" CS gas canisters fired into the property, to concuss and soften resistance. Following an assault firearms officers have made the premises safe, by clearing it out of offenders and making both police and offenders weapons safe. Scenes of Crime Officers will forensically seal both police and other weapons for examination to discover if either have been discharged, and to be used as evidence in court.  Legal status of the use of firearms  The usage of firearms by the police is covered by statute (such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and Human Rights Act 1998), policy (such as the Home Office Code of Practice on Police use of Firearms and Less Lethal Weapons and the ACPO Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms) and common law. AFOs may only carry firearms when authorized by an \\"appropriate authorising officer\\".ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms, 3.2.1 The appropriate authorizing officer must be of the rank of Inspector or higher.ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms, 3.6.6 When working at airports, nuclear sites, on Protection Duties and deployed in Armed Response Vehicles in certain areas, 'Standing Authority' is granted to carry personal sidearms.ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms, 3.8 All members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland have authority to carry a personal issue handgun as a matter of routine, and may carry it whilst off duty.ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms, 3.8.5 In all forces, usage of other weapons such as semi-automatic carbines requires further training and authorisation. Semi-automatic carbines are stored in a locked armoury which is situated in the boot of an Armed Response Vehicle. Equipping of semi-automatic carbines rests on a judgment of the AFO. United Kingdom law allows the use of \\"reasonable force\\" in order to make an arrest or prevent a crimePolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, Section 117 or Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, Article 88Criminal Law Act 1967, Section 3 or Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967, Section 3 or to defend one's self.Common Law, as cited in ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms, 2.3.4 However, if the force used is fatal, then the European Convention of Human Rights only allows \\"the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary\\".ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms, 2.3.7 Firearms officers may therefore only discharge their weapons \\"to stop an imminent threat to life\\".ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms, 5.6.1 ACPO policy states that \\"use\\" of a firearm includes both pointing it at a person and discharging it (whether accidentally, negligently or on purpose).ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms 3.2.4 As with all use of force in England and Wales, the onus is on the individual officer to justify their actions in court.ACPO (2003), Manual of Guidance on Police Use of Firearms Chapter 3.3.1  Firearms Intelligence Unit  Certain police forces that have high gun crime rates have set up an FIU to gather intelligence on gun crime, or certain parts of the community it may affect. Possibly one of the most notable FIUs is the Metropolitan Police's Operation Trident & Trafalgar, which initially only investigated gun crime involving the black community but has since expanded to investigate all shootings. FIU also works to identify criminals who are known to have access to firearms.  Types of firearms officer  * Authorised Firearms Officer are trained in the use of the standard issue firearms of his or her police force as well as battlefield medicine, which includes the treatment of gunshot wounds. They also crew Armed Response Vehicles. AFOs form the majority of police firearms officers. * Specialist Firearms Officer are qualified as an AFO, with extra training within a specific area, such as specialist weapons, Close Protection, Tactical Medicine, Tactics Advice, Advanced Police Driving or Police Firearms Instruction, and are commonly the firearms officers to assault a building in a hostage situation. SFO's no longer exist in London being instead replaced by CTSFO's. * Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officer are elite officers based in several areas of the UK, where terrorist attacks are most likely. Trained in Explosive method of entry (EMOE) and tactical insertions from helicopters to name a few new tactics they use. * Tactical Rifle Officer are specialist police marksman used during operational deployments such as at the 2012 Olympic games or during situational deployments such as during a siege. *Principal Protection Officer (PPO) are the officers in charge of protection teams. These protection officers were made better known by the BBC show \\"Bodyguard\\".  Firearms and equipment  Firearms and equipment in service vary between forces, due to individual police authorities' and chief officers' independency in deciding equipment for their force. Despite being armed, AFOs carry the standard issue telescopic or rigid baton, CS/PAVA incapacitant spray, and Speedcuffs on the duty belt. Instead of wearing the standard issue stab vest, AFOs and SFOs wear a ballistic vest which affords greater protection from gun shots. Instead of carrying one TETRA radio like that of an unarmed officer, AFOs carry two, with one being for the force frequency and the other to communicate solely with other firearms officers on the same duties. The radios are specially adapted so that the officer is not forced to release the grip on the firearm. SFOs would be more likely to wear fire retardant coveralls with webbing including \\"belt order\\" kit. During the early 1990s, most forces adopted white dress shirts for officers, rather than the previous light blue. In most forces, AFOs wear a black polo style shirt with standard black trousers. AFOs and SFOs often wear a PASGT style ballistic helmet, rather than the peaked cap or custodian helmet. Firearms issued to the police are adapted so that they can only fire semi-automatic, meaning that they can only discharge one round with each pull of the trigger, opposed to fully automatics as used by the armed forces.  Alternative names for firearms units  * Devon and Cornwall Constabulary: Tactical Aid Group * Metropolitan Police Service: Specialist Firearms Command (known as SCO19, after the CO designation, previously within SO). Furthermore, the Road Transport Policing Command, Specialist Protection, Counter Terrorism Command and Surveillance unit all have firearms officers in their ranks. * Kent Police: Training and Tactical Firearms Unit * City of London Police: Tactical Firearms Group * Wiltshire Police: Armed Response Group * Northumbria Police Firearms Support Unit, based at Follingsby Park. * Greater Manchester Police Tactical Firearms Unit, based at the Firearms HQ Birmingham. *Police Scotland Strategic Firearms Unit with ARVs deployed in all divisions.  Firearms units outside the UK  Specialist police firearm units are present in foreign Law enforcement agencies in which firearms are routinely carried by officers. These units are provided with increased firepower, more equipment and training than regular officers. Foreign firearms units are not intended to deal with routine firearms incidents, as they are attended to by officers who routinely carry firearms. Such units are normally only called upon when firearms incidents are of such a nature, that they require specialist intervention whereas the firearms units within the United Kingdom respond to all firearms related incidents, as UK police (with the exception of Northern Ireland) are not routinely armed. The New Zealand Police had a similar policy to the UK of no routine carriage of firearms by officers and established Armed Offenders Squads around their country to respond to firearms incidents. However, New Zealand police officers whilst still not carrying firearms are now being provided with ready access and training that is diminishing the role of the Squads. Examples of tactical units include Ireland's Garda Emergency Response Unit and Garda Regional Support Unit and Australian Police Tactical Groups. The United States has tactical units referred to commonly as Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) units.

It occupies an unusual position, surrounded on all sides by higher fells but not connected by any obvious ridge. This separation from its fellows ensures that it is a Marilyn (a hill with topographic prominence of at least 150m). Topography High Rigg is strictly the continuation of the ridge running up the western shore of Thirlmere, whose high point is Raven Crag. This forms the watershed between the Shoulthwaite and Thirlmere/ Vale of St John systems. The depression between High Rigg and Raven Crag to the south ‚Äî at only around ‚Äî is at Smaithwaite, just south of the A591 Keswick to Ambleside road. High Rigg resembles a model of the Lakeland Fells in miniature, complete with crags, intermediate tops, tarns and even a 'pass' crossing the ridge halfway along, complete with church. The northern and southern aspects of the fell are largely grassed and gently rolling, in contrast to the western and eastern flanks which are steep with numerous rocky outcroppings and cliffs. Travelling south to north the main features are Wren Crag (1,020 ft), overlooking the Vale of St John, Yew Crag (1,000 ft) facing west and then two tops at and respectively. The ridge then falls to the 'pass' and St John's church, before rising again to Low Rigg (836 ft). Finally comes Tewet Tarn as the ridge falls away to the river Greta. Also known as Tewfit Tarn, this shallow pool stands on a shelf, overlooked by higher rocks.Don Blair: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Geology The geology of the ridge is complex with much small scale faulting. Gravel and scree overlay much of the fell which lies between two branches of the Coniston Fault, with the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation beneath. Low Rigg exhibits intrusions of microgranite to the surface.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Summit The summit has a cairn set on an outcrop and commands a fine view of the surrounding fells. The giants of Skiddaw and Blencathra dominate the view to the north, and Clough Head and the Helvellyn range the view east. Thirlmere is visible to the south and Bleaberry Fell to the west, over which the Scafell group can be seen on a clear day.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): The Helvellyn range, seen from the summit of High Rigg. Ascents The hill may be climbed in a short twenty-minute walk from the Church of St John's in the Vale. It only involves about 120 m (400 ft) of climb and is one of the shortest ascents in the Lakes. Alternatively, a traverse of the fell's three mile (5 km) long ridge may be made, starting at Tewit Tarn and finishing near Shoulthwaite. Name The word Rigg is from the Old English language and means a bumpy fell or ridge.

It is the home of the Castlebar Mitchels GAA and Mayo GAA Gaelic football teams. Built in 1931, the ground has a capacity of 25,369 and is named after John MacHale, Catholic Archbishop of Tuam from 1831 to 1881. History Discussions with the owners of the land where MacHale Park now stands commenced in 1929 and the deal was concluded on 7 March 1930. In early 1931 development of the pitch took place at a cost of ¬£1,700. The first competitive matches took place in MacHale Park on 22 March 1931 when Castlebar minors played Balla and Ballina and Cloonacastle played a junior championship match. The first inter-county match was a National Football League match between Mayo and Sligo on 19 April 1931, Mayo winning by 0‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì2. The official opening took place on 24 May 1931 when about 4,000 spectators attended a match between Mayo and Kildare GAA which ended in a draw. A major redevelopment was undertaken between 1950 and 1952 which raised the capacity of the ground to 40,000 with seating for 18,000 costing ¬£15,000. The ground was reopened on 15 June 1952 with a game between the reigning All-Ireland champions Mayo and Meath which also ended in a draw. In the late 1980s, covered seating was provided in the Gerry McDonald Stand. In 1990 the Connacht Council decided to grant aid Dr. Hyde Park, County Roscommon with a view to making it the main venue in the province. In reaction to this a further redevelopment was embarked upon by the Castlebar Mitchels club. Over the course of the next 12 years, the ground was converted into a 32,000 all-seater stadium and new dressing rooms, improved press facilities, dug-outs and a wheelchair area were constructed. In March 2005, the Mayo County Board took control of MacHale Park on a 50-year lease with a view to upgrading the stadium.Western People ‚Äì \\"McHale Park future lies in County Board's hands\\", 16 March 2005 In 2008, construction work commenced on a detailed renovation of the ground, to include the construction of a new 10,000 seater stand as well as an extension to the seated area to the south (Albany) end of the ground. The ‚Ç¨16 million redevelopment works included improved facilities for spectators, a museum, underground training areas, and County Board offices. As part of these works, the famous fa√ßade on the MacHale Road side of the ground was demolished. Funding for the project was generated by the sale of the naming rights for the stadium as well as the sale of season tickets for matches taking place at the ground.http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/mayo-in-crisis- over-116m-debt-on-mchale-park-redevelopment-26792635.html Images of proposed redevelopment of MacHale Park In 2019, on health and safety reasons, capacity of MacHale Park was reduced by a further 6,000 to 25,369. During the COVID-19 pandemic, MacHale Park was used as a drive-through test centre. Photographs of ongoing development work at venue, April 2009  Notable MacHale Park matches 1934 National Football League final: Mayo 2‚Äì3 Dublin GAA 1‚Äì6. This was the first League final played in MacHale Park. 8,000 attended the match which ended in a draw. Mayo won the replay in Croke Park by 2‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì5. It was the first of six League titles in-a-row for Mayo. 1952 Connacht Senior Football final: Roscommon GAA 3‚Äì5 Mayo 0‚Äì6. This was the first Connacht final to take place in MacHale Park and the first big game there since the redevelopment. Mayo were coming off the back of two consecutive All-Ireland titles and four Connacht titles in a row. There was a journalists' strike on at the time and there were no reporters at the game. The result was sent by telegram to RT√â to be read out on their evening GAA results programme. However, it was felt that a mistake must have been made and that Mayo couldn't have been beaten by an unfancied Roscommon. There was no way of checking this due to the journalists' strike, so the result was erroneously read out as Mayo 3‚Äì5 Roscommon 0‚Äì6. 1962 Connacht Senior Football final: Roscommon 3‚Äì7 Galway GAA 2‚Äì9. Galway were well ahead when Aidan Brady broke the crossbar. A lengthy delay ensued while repairs were made. On the resumption the game changed completely and Roscommon turned things around to snatch a famous win. 1975 Connacht Senior Football final replay: Sligo 2‚Äì10 Mayo 0‚Äì15. Many thought Sligo had missed their chance in the drawn match in Markievicz Park but inspired by Mickey Kearins, they won their first Connacht title in 47 years to spark joyous scenes among the Sligo supporters at the final whistle. 1981 Connacht Senior Football semi-final: Mayo 2‚Äì7 Galway 1‚Äì8. Few gave Mayo, without a Connacht title for 12 years, any chance against arch-rivals Galway who had just been crowned League champions. However, on a blazing hot summer's day, a tremendous performance of high fielding by Willie Nally propelled Mayo to a famous victory and they would go on to clinch the Connacht title over Sligo, also at MacHale Park. 1991 Connacht Senior Football final: Roscommon 0‚Äì14 Mayo 0‚Äì14. With time almost up, it appeared that Mayo had regained the title but Derek Duggan stepped up to kick a now-legendary long-range free to take the game to a replay. 1992 Connacht Senior Football final: Mayo 1‚Äì14 Roscommon 0‚Äì10. Remarkably, the same MacHale Park crossbar was to be broken again in a Connacht final. Mayo were on top when Roscommon's Enon Gavin brought down the bar. However, there was to be no turnaround for Roscommon on this occasion and Mayo went on to comfortably regain the title. 2001 All- Ireland Senior Football quarter-final: Galway 0‚Äì14 Roscommon 1‚Äì5. The first All-Ireland series match to take place in MacHale Park was an all-Connacht affair. The two sides had met earlier in the championship when Roscommon had shocked the defending Connacht champions. In the re-match Galway ran out convincing winners on their way to claiming the All-Ireland title. 2012 Connacht Senior Club Football final: Ballaghaderreen 0-6 vs St Brigid's 1-12. Dubbed the \\"All-Rossie\\" Connacht final, St Brigids won an historic three-in-a- row provincial titles which was a platform to claiming the All-Ireland title four months later. 2013 Connacht Senior Football Final: Mayo 5-11 London 0-10. History was made as London played in their first ever Connacht final. However Mayo won comfortably to claim a third Connacht title in a row.

It was adapted by John Hawkesworth from the 1959 book of the same title by Elspeth Huxley, and is set in and around the town of Thika in Kenya's Central Province. The story deals with the lives of British settlers in this part of East Africa in 1913, when the country was a British colony, up to the start of World War One. The series stars Hayley Mills (in her first starring role after a six-year performing hiatus), Holly Aird, David Robb and Ben Cross. Plot Robin Grant (David Robb), his wife Tilly (Hayley Mills) and daughter Elspeth (Holly Aird) move to British East Africa (now called Kenya) to set up a coffee plantation. They meet Piet Roos (Morgan Sheppard), a Boer big game hunter and Njombo, a native who goes to work for them. The Grants face many travails in getting established, but these improve after they hire Sammy as the headman of the plantation. Hereward (Nicholas Jones) and Lettice Palmer (Sharon Maughan) move to the area. There is a fight between Roos and Sammy. Then Njombo kills Kimon, who was the Palmers' headman. As a result, his chief strips him of his property and Sammy marries the girl Njombo wanted. Elspeth has a very interesting New Year‚Äôs Eve party with Mrs. Nimmo and a newcomer to the area, Alec Wilson while her parents and the Palmers go to Nairobi. A big game hunter, Ian Crawford (Ben Cross) arrives in the area and becomes infatuated with Lettice Palmer, who gives a pony to Elspeth. We learn Lettice left her first husband to elope with Hereward, and Elspeth develops an intense dislike for Hereward Palmer after he shoots a baby antelope on a hunt. Sammy arranges for a curse to be put on Njombo, and it literally takes an ‚ÄúAct of God‚Äù to get it lifted. After the railroad reaches Thika, Lettice gets a piano, but during a party held to celebrate its arrival, a leopard kills one of her dogs. During the hunt to get it, Hereward kills the leopard, but is almost killed by its mate, but saved by Roos. The Palmers, Tilly, and Crawford go on a safari, during which Lettice and Crawford have an affair. Hereward and Crawford are about to have a brawl when Crawford‚Äôs servant stabs Hereward. As a result, Crawford leaves and Lettice stays with Hereward. Then, on 4 August 1914, the Grants learn war has been declared on Germany. Robin joins the army, while Tilly becomes a nurse and Elspeth goes to school, where she is bullied for being a know-it-all. She runs away back to Thika. Ian Crawford is killed. Then Robin is transferred to France so all the Grants leave Africa and return to Europe for the duration. Production The Flame Trees of Thika was filmed on location in Kenya, directed by Roy Ward Baker and produced by Hawkesworth and Christopher Neame with Verity Lambert as executive producer. The filming included aerial views of the actual Kenya- Uganda railway train as it traveled between Mombasa and Nairobi heading toward Uganda. The television series was nominated for three BAFTA Television Awards, including Ian Wilson for Best Cinematography.

He is currently the manager of KV Kortrijk. Known for his tackling, hard-working approach and stamina, he played for five clubs during his 22-year professional career, amassing Belgian Pro League totals of 340 games and 32 goals. A late bloomer, Vanderhaeghe did not reach the Belgian national team until the age of 29, but still went on to collect nearly 50 caps, representing the nation in one World Cup and one European Championship. Club career At the age of 16, Vanderhaeghe moved from hometown's K.S.V. Roeselare to Cercle Brugge KSV, on loan, but he only played one game in two seasons. Subsequently, he returned to his first club, playing four years in the Belgian Third Division and two in the second, now with the shirt of R.E. Mouscron. Vanderhaeghe first established himself in the Pro League with K.S.C. Eendracht Aalst, amassing more than 100 official appearances and adding 11 goals in the league alone. In January 1998 he returned to Mouscron, scoring a career-best eight times in the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign as the Wallonia team finished in fourth position, nearly qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Aged already 30, Vanderhaeghe signed with country giants R.S.C. Anderlecht. In his first two years combined he appeared in 65 matches, helping the Brussels side to the league and the domestic supercup in his debut campaign; in the following years he began to be irregularly used, due to persistent injury problems. During the winter-break of 2006‚Äì07, 37-year-old Vanderhaeghe was told to look for a new club, and he joined another old acquaintance, Roeselaere, by then competing in the first division. He retired in June 2008, later working as assistant manager at K.V. Kortrijk. On 11 May 2015, Vanderhaeghe was appointed head coach of K.V. Oostende. Shortly after he was dismissed at Oostende he was appointed as the new manager of Gent, where he stayed for 1 year. On 15 November 2018, Vanderhaeghe became the new manager of Kortrijk, where he started his second term as head coach. International career Vanderhaeghe made 48 appearances for Belgium, his debut coming on 30 May 1999 against Peru (in a friendly tournament in Japan) at the age of 29. Vanderhaeghe represented the nation in UEFA Euro 2000 ‚Äì played on home soil ‚Äì and the 2002 FIFA World Cup, totalling seven appearances and helping the country to the round-of-16 in the latter competition (0‚Äì2 against eventual winners Brazil). He scored his two only goals for Belgium in the historic 10‚Äì1 win against San Marino in Brussels for the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, on 28 February 2001.

Sotol liquor is a Mexican drink that is known as the state drink of Chihuahua, Durango and Coahuila, and is also currently produced in Central Texas. However, sotol has their own denomination and can only be produced in Chihuahua, Coahuila and Durango. There are few commercial examples available. It is produced in a manner similar to the more common artisanal mezcals of central Mexico. Early history At the Fate Bell Shelter, a 150-yard-long opening in a large rock face on the U.S. side of the Rio Grande, sotol is depicted in paintings on the rock walls. Sandals, baskets, ropes, mats and many other items of sotol fiber show that the resource was highly important to Ancestral Puebloans of the Basketmaker culture. These artifacts date to around 7000 BCE. The base of a cooked sotol stem may be eaten rather like an artichoke leaf (by scraping across the front teeth). This remnant, called a \\"quid\\", resembles a spoon and can be used as one. Archaeological sites where \\"Desert Spoon\\" was eaten in this way are full of discarded quids thousands of years old. Sotol and lechuguilla flower-stalks used as atlatl dart hind-shafts were found in a Ceremonial Cave (Hueco Mountains, near El Paso, Texas). Sotol may also have been affiliated with fire; the sotol stem was used as a fireplow. A humanoid figure with a spray of spiky leaves for a head and a black stripe down the middle of its body may represent the magical spirit of sotol. Sometimes it appears in connection with hunting scenes, at others it appears surrounded by orange ochre flames and black smoke. The presence in these rock shelters of troughs a half-meter long and four centimeters deep, along with mounds of quids, suggests the production of beverages with sotol as far back as 9000 years ago. The murals depicting sotol-related images may, in part, be a tribute to the remarkable usefulness of the plant, especially at sites like the Fate Bell Shelter. History The Chihuahuan indigenous, Rar√°muri, fermented sotol juice into a beer-like alcoholic beverage as early as 800 years ago. In the 16th century, Spanish colonists introduced European distillation techniques to produce a spirit. Sotol is now beginning to achieve international recognition like its cousins, mezcal and tequila. Production The Desert Spoon takes approximately 15 years to mature and yields only one bottle of sotol per plant. It typically grows on rocky slopes in the Chihuahuan desert grassland between 3,000 and 6,500 feet above sea level. Unlike agave, which flowers only once in its lifetime, sotols produce a flower stalk every few years. Once the plant matures, it is harvested like agave plants when mezcal or tequila are to be made. The outer leaves are removed to reveal the center core, which is taken back to the distillery. The core can then be cooked and/or steamed, shredded, fermented, and distilled. Flower stem of the Desert Spoon plant Types Age classifications: * Plata - Un-aged, straight from distillation to the bottle. * Reposado (rested) - Aged several months to a year. * A√±ejo - Aged for at least one year References External links *Reviews of several commercially produced brands of Sotol. *Presence in American Market.

The tall mountain is located at the southern end of the Tromsdalen valley, just southeast of the city of Troms√∏. Snowfall varies from one year to another, but the peak is usually snow free only for a few months in the summer. The mountain is easily spotted from the city centre of Troms√∏. The summit is a popular hike, requiring nothing more than good shoes, normal physical condition, and plenty to drink.  Etymology  The Norwegian name Tromsdalstinden means \\"the peak above Tromsdalen\\", while the S√°mi name is made up from the components S√°la≈° and Oaivi. The first word signifies a good hunting area, the second literally translates as \\"head\\" but when speaking of landscapes indicate a mountain that is rounded, i.e. does not have any jagged peaks.  Skiing and hiking  Hikers may summit Tromsdalstinden either from the suburb Tromsdalen, or from Ramfjorden. The slopes up are not technically difficult, though fog and rain can make the ascent complicated for those not familiar with the terrain. When approaching the mountain from the southeast (Ramfjorden), though, hikers and skiers must at one point move over the southwestern or northwestern (city-facing) sides of the mountain as the mountain becomes too steep. The best season for hiking is May through September. Skiers usually take the Fjellheisen aerial tramway to Storsteinen, and begin their ascent from there. There are two main treks, the Winter trek and the Summer trek. =The Winter trek= A ski trip that starts on the southwest side of the mountain (on the right in the pictures) which is called Salen (the Saddle). When descending, skiers zig-zag down from the top until they reach the minor lake Tromsdalsvannet (nor.) or Moskoj√°vri (s√°m.) in the innermost part of the Tromsdalen valley. =The Summer trek= A hike that starts on the zig-zag trek used to descend when skiing. On the way back, hikers follow the narrow northeastern ridge of the mountain (left on the pictures). The descent route at one point takes you quite close to the steep drop behind the mountain, and as such may not be suitable for hikers prone to vertigo. For such hikers, it is perhaps a better recommendation to go back the way they came. =Straight up= Also, it is possible to ascend from the northwest, i.e. straight up from the valley. Hikers then start at the Nerloftet (a low plateau above the Tromsdalen valley), proceed to the half-way stop Loftet (a protruding part of the mountain facing the city), and then go straight up. When the mountain becomes too steep to keep going straight, you go upwards to the right until you're on the 'winter route' (the right slope). The names of these points mean, respectively, the Lower Attic and the Attic. This route is quite steep and thus demanding, but safe - although some rocks may be slippery, or loose, so one should be careful.  Controversy over S√°mi cultural significance  In 2003 Troms√∏ applied to host the 2014 Winter Olympics. The proposal to the International Olympic Committee featured plans to build an alpine skiing facility on the slopes of the mountain. This sparked immediate protests from some Sami activists who claimed that Tromsdaltinden has been a Sami sacred mountain since ancient times. A heated debate ensued over whether Tromsdalstinden could be considered \\"holy\\" or not. The Sami Parliament enacted a resolution declaring it a holy mountain in 2004, and the plans were discontinued. The S√°mi Parliament does not in fact have any formal authority to declare objects 'sacred', but their resolution was listened to anyway. Lawyers in the aftermath discussed the possibility of defining a mountain as a cultural relic according to the definition of \\"cultural relic\\" in the law. Professor Siv Ellen Kraft from the department of Religious Studies, University of Troms√∏ wrote an article suggesting that Tromsdalstind was made a holy mountain in recent times as a part of sami identity politics.Siv Ellen Kraft: Et hellig fjell blir til - Om samer, OL og arktisk magi. Norwegian only (a holy mountain is created- Samis, olympics and arctic magic) Nytt Norsk Tidsskrift, 2004, Nr 03-04 However, the mountain is also reckoned by S√°mi people in the region to have been sacred at one point, before Christianization. The mountain bears the significant feature of a traditional sacred mountain - i.e. that it dominates the landscape due to shape and/or height. As the classic S√°mi religion is dead and only elements survive through local vestiges and neo-shamanism; a good case can be made that the mountain is no longer sacred to most S√°mi in the traditional sense. Still, the level of commitment to the preserving the mountain shown by the S√°mi - up to the point of having the S√°mi parliament pronounce it sacred - quite effectively display the intense cultural significance of the mountain to modern S√°mi also, a significance which is indeed rooted in the religious traditions of ones ancestors.

The son of two dancers from Civitanova Marche, he was born in the costuming room of the Teatro Tordinona in Rome. After an illustrious career as a dancer in Europe, he went to dance for the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia, where he further honed his skills. Cecchetti was praised for his agility and strength in his performances, as well as his technical abilities in dance. By 1888, he was widely accepted as the greatest ballet virtuoso in the world. After an esteemed career in Russia, originating such roles as both the Bluebird and Carabosse in Petipa's masterpiece, The Sleeping Beauty, he turned to teaching. Some of his students included other notable dancers of the Imperial Ballet, such as: Anna Pavlova, L√©onide Massine, and Vaslav Nijinsky. While in London in 1920, he provided instruction to the American ballerina Ruth PageNew York Public Library Archives - Ruth Page Collection 1918-70 at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts - Jerome Robbins Dance Division, New York City, USA on archives.nypl.org and to Ninette de Valois. Ninette de Valois -Idealist without Illusions, Katherine Sorley Walker (1987) Hamish Hamilton He also restaged many ballets, including Petipa's definitive version of Copp√©lia in 1894, from which nearly all modern versions of the work are based. (This version was notated in the early 20th century, and is today part of the Sergeyev Collection). While teaching a class, Cecchetti collapsed and he died the following day, 13 November 1928. Changes to the choreography of the male variations featured in the works of the Imperial Ballet's repertory. In 1890, Cecchetti performed in the ground-breaking production of The Sleeping Beauty, where his performance as the Bluebird caused a sensation in the audience at the Mariinsky Theatre. The choreography of the Bluebird has challenged male dancers even to the present day. Cecchetti left the Imperial ballet in 1902 to accept the directorship of the Imperial Ballet School in Warsaw, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire. His farewell gala at the Mariinsky Theatre featured all of the leading ballerinas of the day, many of whom were his students. In order to have everyone pay him homage, the Paquita Grand pas classique was performed, with the inclusion of the favorite solos of all of the participating ballerinas. This led to the tradition of including a long suite of variations for several ballerinas. In 1919 Cecchetti performed at the inaugural performance of the ballet, La Boutique fantasque, in London, appearing in the role of the shopkeeper. Mariinsky Theatre In 1887 Cecchetti performed in St. Petersburg where Ivan Vsevolozhsky, the director of the Mariinsky Theatre saw him perform. He was so impressed with Cecchetti that he immediately hired Cecchetti as a principal dancer for the theatre. This was extremely rare at the time because normally dancers would be asked to join a company on a lower level. Varvara Nikitina and Enrico Cecchetti costumed for the Bluebird Pas de deux from Petipa's original production of The Sleeping Beauty. St. Petersburg, 1890 Enrico Cecchetti teaching Anna Pavlova in Paris, circa 1920 With the introduction of the pointe shoe in the early 19th century, ballet was dominated by female performers using pointe technique. In many ways male technique had been reduced to the role of an actor whose responsibilities as a dancer were relegated to a servant who partnered the ballerina. Cecchetti immediately began transforming the traditionally conservative roles for the male dancer, making drastic changes to the choreography of the male variations featured in the works of the Imperial Ballet's repertory. In 1890, Cecchetti performed in the ground-breaking production of The Sleeping Beauty, where his performance as the Bluebird caused a sensation in the auditorium of the Mariinsky Theatre. The choreography of the Bluebird has challenged male dancers even to the present day. Cecchetti left the Imperial ballet in 1902 to accept the directorship of the Imperial Ballet School in Warsaw, Poland. His farewell gala at the Mariinsky Theatre featured all of the leading ballerinas of the day, many of whom were his students. In order to have everyone pay him homage, the Paquita Grand pas classique was performed with the inclusion of the favorite solos of all of the participating ballerinas. This led to the tradition of including a long suite of variations for several ballerinas. In 1919 Cecchetti performed at the inaugural performance of the ballet La Boutique fantasque in London, appearing in the role of the shopkeeper. Teaching In the tradition of classical ballet, techniques and parts are taught directly, person to person. The technique was passed on directly to Enrico Cecchetti, as he was taught by Giovanni Lepri, who in turn was taught by Carlo Blasis and the line can be traced back to Beauchamp the first ballet master at the court of Louis XIV. So, too, the Cecchetti method has been passed on directly by his former pupils such as Laura Wilson. Cecchetti died in Milan on 13 November 1928. Cecchetti Method Cecchetti created a ballet technique that is now known as the Cecchetti method. This technique is popular with past and present ballet teachers, remaining fresh and contemporary.Poesio pg 80 After Cecchetti's death, Cyril Beaumont, Stanislas Idzikowsky, Margaret Craske and Derra de Moroda decided to codify Cecchetti's method so it could continue to be used by ballet teachers to perfect the technique of ballet dancers.Brillarelli pg 59 Under the Cecchetti Method, dancers follow strict routines and daily exercises to develop all-around skills to support learning and performance of every kind of dance. This training method is used by many ballet companies around the world, including The National Ballet of Canada and Mont Albert Ballet School in Melbourne, Australia.

Its local government area is the Town of Victoria Park. History Lathlain's development commenced in the 1890s when Peet and Co subdivided and sold lots in the \\"Victoria Park Station Estate\\" east of the railway station, with quarter-acre blocks on sale for ¬£25‚Äì30. A brochure advertising the state claimed the lots were \\"So near Perth, near the Station and so near the Trams\\" (although the tram service did not eventuate). Peet and Co's advertising for the Victoria Park Station Estate was elaborate and multifaceted. Much of the promotion centred on the \\"Oldest Settler\\", a tree in the shape of a standing figure, located on one of the lots. Would-be purchasers were invited to \\"Look for the Oldest Settler from the train and at the pictures.\\" They were also assured that the new section of the Victoria Park estate was the \\"finest subdivision\\" in Western Australia, destined to be \\"up-to-date in 40 years time\\", and distinguished by \\"Childrens Playgrounds for every group of homes\\". Residential development was slow, and Geoff Gallop records in his historical notes that \\"bush land with some heavy timber and the occasional stray cow from Belmont greeted the post-war generation who built the suburb.\\"Dr Geoff Gallop. \\"From The Swan To The Canning - Historical Notes on Victoria Park and Surrounding Districts\\", December 1989. Originally published in Southern Gazette, 24 October 1989, p.7. Accessed at Battye Library, Perth. Lathlain was a \\"garden suburb\\" estate designed in 1920 by Carl Klem and brother-in-law and senior partner Percy Hope. There was much controversy surrounding the development, which was initially planned to have 16 internal reserves that provided open space to all allotments. Maintenance of these public open spaces was seen as problematic by the City of Perth (then the local government of the area), and the plan was scaled back to only two such reserves (bordered by Roberts Road, Rutland Avenue, Bishopsgate Street and Goddard Street) one of which has been sold to adjoining residents (Roberts, Rutland, Bishopsgate, Forster). The suburb's name honours Sir William Lathlain, the Lord Mayor of Perth from 1918 until 1923. The name was in general use since the 1950s, after a park of this name was built there, but was not gazetted until 1981. In November 1953, it was proposed that the Perth Football Club, an Australian rules football team in the West Australian Football League, be based at a new oval to be built on vacant land at Lathlain. The Perth City Council supported the scheme, and construction commenced. As residents started to move into the area, a primary school was constructed in 1956. On 11 July 1959, the club moved into the premises at the ground, known as Lathlain Park, and went on to win premierships in 1966-1968 and 1976-1977. The ground was renamed to Eftel Oval in 2003. Demographics changed and during the early 1990s Lathlain's only civil structure, its local primary school, was earmarked for closure by the education minister at the time, Norman Moore, due to low student enrolments. Students, parents and locals fought successfully to keep the school open, and it now has a healthy enrolment aided by the on-site pre-primary and better facilities. Geography Lathlain is bounded by Great Eastern Highway to the northwest, the Armadale railway to the southwest, Roberts Road to the southeast and Orrong Road and Graham Farmer Freeway to the northeast. The suburb is almost entirely residential, although a number of parks can be found - most notably Lathlain Park, which houses the home ground of the Phoenix Demons, and J.A. Lee Reserve. Rayment Park is a small community park located centrally within the suburb, adjacent to Lathlain Primary School, local shops situated in Lathlain Place, Carlisle/Lathlain Playgroup, Carlisle/Victoria Park Toy Libraryhttp://www.cvptoylibrary.org.au and scout hall.2006 StreetSmart directory, Department of Lands and Surveys, Perth. Lathlain is zoned predominately R20. City and hill views can be found in the western end of the suburb, which is situated on a hill that extends as far north as Rivervale and as far south as Kensington.  Facilities  Lathlain is a residential suburb containing two reserves, two hotels and Lathlain Primary School. Commercial and other services are provided by Victoria Park and Belmont.  Transport  Lathlain is served by the Victoria Park train station on its southwestern edge, and by various bus services. All services are operated by Swan Transit. The Lathlain railway station, built in 1959 and once located at the beginning of Goddard Street, was closed on 3 February 2003. Almost no trace of it exists today, although when the Lathlain railway station was decommissioned the \\"Lathlain\\" lighted signs were donated to the Perth Football Club to display in their clubroom due to their historical links with the station.  Politics  Lathlain's booth supports the Australian Labor Party at both federal and state elections, although less strongly than booths to the south and east - in the 1996 election it voted for the Liberal Party.

It is the home of the Down Gaelic football and hurling teams and the Newry Shamrocks GAA club. The ground has a capacity of about 20,000. History The ground was named after Fr. (later Archdeacon) Hugh Esler (d. 1983), a Catholic priest and Ballynahinch native credited with reinvigorating interest in Gaelic football in Newry in the 1930s‚Äì50s, and with securing the grounds that was to later become P√°irc Esler. =Renovation= The ground has undergone major redevelopment work, with new stands, floodlights, new pitch all added in 2006‚Äì2007. From 1999 to 2004 no senior intercounty championship matches were played at the venue. After the development of a new terrace at the canal end of the ground and a new stand on the south side of the ground, Down hosted the All Ireland Champions, Tyrone, in round 2 of the football championship qualifiers. The following year both Fermanagh and Derry visited the ground in the qualifiers, Down losing to the latter. The ground was closed after the Down v Armagh game in Division 1B of the National Football League in March 2006 for further development. =Reopening= GAA President Nicky Brennan (second from left) cuts the ribbon at the official re-opening of P√°irc Esler. With work now completed on the ground, with a new covered stand and floodlighting facilities, the ground hosted its first Ulster Senior Football Championship Match since 1999 when Cavan visited the stadium for a preliminary round replay on Sunday 20 May 2007, which the home side won 0‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì11. In June it held a first-round Ulster Championship clash with Monaghan and a first-round qualifier game with Meath ‚Äì Down lost both games. On 8 October 2007, the new stand was officially opened by GAA president Nickey Brennan, just before the start of the Senior Football Championship Final between Mayobridge and Longstone, which ended in a draw. Mayobridge won the replay, and their fourth title in a row. The 26 October saw the official switch-on of the floodlights, which was marked by the division one league final between Kilcoo and An Riocht. An Riocht won the game by 3 points, with AFL star Martin Clarke scoring 2‚Äì1 in the final. It has now hosted Dr. McKenna cup matches in 2008 in which Down played and beat Cavan, UUJ and beat Donegal 5‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì13. In the same year they won the final which was played in Casement Park, Belfast.

The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966. and History Designed in 1838 by Alexander Jackson Davis, the house was owned in succession by New York City mayor William Paulding, Jr., merchant George Merritt, and railroad tycoon Jay Gould. Paulding named his house \\"Knoll\\", although critics quickly dubbed it \\"Paulding's Folly\\" because of its unusual design that includes fanciful turrets and asymmetrical outline. Its limestone exterior was quarried at Sing Sing in present-day Ossining, New York. Merritt, the house's second owner, engaged Davis as his architect, and in 1864‚Äì1865 doubled the size of the house, renaming it \\"Lyndenhurst\\" after the estate's linden trees. Davis' new north wing included an imposing four-story tower, a new porte-cochere (the old one was reworked as a glass-walled vestibule), a new dining room, two bedrooms and servants' quarters. Gould purchased the property in 1880 to use as a country house, shortened its name to \\"Lyndhurst\\" and occupied it until his death in 1892. In 1961, Gould's daughter Anna Gould donated it to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The house is now open to the public. Architecture Architectural detail of Lyndhurst Unlike later mansions along the Hudson River, Lyndhurst's rooms are few and of a more modest scale, and strongly Gothic in character. Hallways are narrow, windows small and sharply arched, and ceilings are fantastically peaked, vaulted, and ornamented. The effect is at once gloomy, somber, and highly romantic; the large, double- height art gallery provides a contrast of light and space. The house sits within a landscape park, designed in the English naturalistic style by Ferdinand Mangold, whom Merritt hired. Mangold drained the surrounding swamps, created lawns, planted specimen trees, and built a conservatory. The park is an outstanding example of 19th-century landscape design with a curving entrance drive that reveals \\"surprise\\" views of rolling lawns accented with shrubs and specimen trees.

He was a member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and was great patron of charity schools. Early life Acklam Hall Hustler was the eldest son of William Hustler of Acklam and his wife Grace Savile, daughter of Sir John Savile of Lupset, near Wakefield, Yorkshire. He was knighted on 14 May 1673 and succeeded his father in 1678. On 8 July 1680, he married Lady Anne Wentworth, widow of Sir Matthew Wentworth of Bretton, Yorkshire, and daughter of William Osbaldeston of Hunmanby, Yorkshire. He built Acklam Hall in Cleveland in the early 1680s Career Hustler was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Northallerton at the 1695 English general election on the interest of the Whig Sir William Robinson, 1st Baronet. He signed the Association, but was absent from the division on the attainder of Sir John Fenwick. He managed a bill in April 1698 to make it easier to return juries to serve at the assizes and throughout his career managed many bills through the House, often private bills. At the 1698 English general election he was again returned unopposed and was listed as a member of the Country party and later as a supporter of the Whig Junto. He was returned unopposed in the first general election 1701, and during the year became vice president of the newly founded SPG. At the second general election of 1701, he was again returned unopposed as a Whig for Northallerton and acted frequently as a teller. At the 1702 English general election, Hustler was returned as MP for both Northallerton and Ripon. He chose to sit for Ripon, probably as part of an electoral agreement on behalf of John Aislabie with whom he exchanged places. He was returned unopposed again for Northallerton at the 1705 English general election and voted for the Court candidate as Speaker on 25 October 1705. At the 1708 British general election, he was returned unopposed as Whig MP for Northallerton once more. He supported the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709 and voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He was defeated at the 1710 British general election, when he came bottom of the poll. He did not stand for Parliament again. As a member of SPCK he was busy establishing charity schools in Wakefield.

The station, which is managed by Northern, is the eastern terminus of the East Lancashire Line. Trains from Blackpool South run through Preston and Blackburn to Burnley and Colne. Currently the station only has a single platform and a shelter. The old station was demolished in 1971, after the closure of the line from Colne to Skipton, which had occurred in the previous year. Facilities Though unstaffed, the station now has a ticket machine in place to allow travellers to buy or collect tickets prior to travelling.Colne station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 25 November 2016 Passenger information screens and a PA system have also been installed to provide train running information for users. A ramp provides step-free access from the station car park and main road to the platform. Services The station has an hourly service seven days a week to Preston via serving all local stations en route. On Sundays only, trains continue through to - these now run hourly (rather than two- hourly as before) since the December 2017 timetable change. History The station opened on 2 October 1848, as the terminus of the Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway from Bradford and .Binns, p.8 The station became an end-on junction with the East Lancashire Railway's Blackburn, Burnley, Accrington and Colne Extension Railway, which opened on 1 February 1849. By 2 April in the same year the line was part of a through route between Leeds and Liverpool, but the majority of passenger trains east of Colne were local between Skipton and Colne.Suggitt, p.73 The station was rebuilt in 1883 with two engine sheds - one for the Midland Railway to the east, one for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to the west (these two companies now owning the respective lines).Suggitt, p.75 In its heyday, the station had regular through links to both Blackpool termini, , , , Manchester Victoria via and even through coaches to London EustonFrater, p.31 via , Manchester Victoria and . There were also summer dated services to/from (worked in conjunction with the London & North Eastern Railway prior to nationalisation of the railways in 1948) and . However, these had all disappeared by the mid-1960s as a result of economies imposed by the British Railways Board, leaving only basic local services to/from and Skipton. The Beeching cuts of 1964/5 reduced the services along the Skipton-Colne line, and on 2 February 1970 this section closed to all traffic. A year later the station was downgraded to an unstaffed halt following the dismantling of the route towards Earby, the singling of the surviving line from Nelson and the abandonment of the eastbound island platform - all trains henceforth used the former westbound platform, which had its buildings demolished & replaced by a simple waiting shelter. The remainder of the branch from Gannow Junction (near ) to Nelson was also reduced to single track in December 1986 and so the entire line from there is now operated as a \\"long siding\\" with no intermediate passing loops (this restricts the service frequency that can operate along the branch, as only one train can be on the branch at a time). Colne is therefore in the unusual position of having been a western terminus (1848-1849), a through station (1849-1970) and an eastern terminus (1970 to present).

It is geographically located approximately midway between the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. The northern quarter of the lake belongs to the country of Uzbekistan, while the rest belongs to Turkmenistan. Up until the 17th century, Lake Sarygamysh was fed by the Uzboy River, a distributary of the Amu Darya River, which continued on to the Caspian Sea. Today, its main source of water is a canal from the Amu Darya but also the runoff water from surrounding irrigated lands, containing high levels of pesticides, herbicides and heavy metals.  Contribution to the drying up of the Aral Sea  This and many other \\"unintended\\" lakes, such as Aydar Lake on the Syr Darya, created by the Soviet planners, deny the Aral Sea about 150 cubic kilometers of annual inflow of water, directly contributing to, if not actually causing, the latter's drying up.  Etymology  The name of the lake comes from Turkic Sari (yellow) and Qamish (depression), a reference to the yellow color of silt and salt in the old dried up basin before its flooding by the Soviets. The modern Turkmen authorities wish to \\"Turkmenize\\" the name by contending that the name is Turkmen sarykamysh 'yellow reed'.E.M. Pospelov, Geograficheskiye nazvaniya mira (Moscow, 1998), p. 369. The Turkmen section of the lake and the land around it is protected by the Sarygamy≈ü Sanctuary. History Throughout its history, the lake has disappeared several times and re-emerged, depending on the arrival of the Amudarya waters.

Since the beginning of the 1960s, the Sarykamysh lake has been filled with collector-drainage waters, feeding was carried out through the Daryalyk collector, while water from the farmland of the left bank of the Amu Darya was used.

Born in Norwood, London, Sands trained as a teacher in Cheltenham and also turned out for Cheltenham Town while in the town. He joined Woolwich Arsenal (as they were then known) as an amateur in 1902. While still an amateur, he became the club's first-choice centre half in 1903-04, having made his debut against Blackpool on 5 September 1903. He would not turn fully professional for another three years, and would still work as a teacher when not playing. Woolwich Arsenal were promoted to the First Division in 1904, and Sands was a near ever-present in the side. Although Arsenal were an undistinguished mid-table side at this time, they reached the FA Cup semi- finals two years running, in 1905-06 and 1906-07. Nicknamed \\"Mr Reliable\\", Sands stuck with the club through leaner times, including financial difficulties and then relegation in 1912-13, by which time he had been made captain of the side, and the club's move to Highbury (and its subsequent renaming) that same year. With the advent of World War I, first-class football was suspended, but despite his age (33), Sands continued to play for Arsenal in unofficial wartime matches. He later left to serve in the Royal Army Medical Corps on the Western Front. After peace broke out, he joined Southern League side Southend United, before retiring. In all he played 350 matches for the Gunners, a record that stood until it was broken by Bob John fifteen years later. He was never capped for England, although he was called up for trials with the squad, and also played for the Football League representative team. He died in December 1965 aged 84.

Since the name can easily be dialectically adjusted and translated as ‚Äúdear guest‚Äù or ‚Äúwelcomed guest‚Äù, Radegast was proclaimed as the Slavic god of hospitality and as such entered the hypothetical, reconstructed Slavic pantheon. Even myths concerning him were constructed based on various folk customs of sacred hospitality. Similar customs, however, are known in many Indo-European mythologies without a distinct deity associated explicitly with them. Another possible etymology may be from Slavic \\"rada\\" ‚Äì council, and \\"go≈õciƒá\\", \\"hostit\\", \\"goszczƒÖcy\\" ‚Äì to host, Radogost being the name of the council or assembly host, leader, or speaker, and one of the attributes of the god. This view could be supported by the political role Radegast temple played in the life of West Slavic tribes. According to some literary sources he is also the god of war, night, fire, and the evening sky.Book B√°je a m√Ωty star√Ωch slovan≈Ø by Ivan Hudec, Slovart, 1994 He is completely black, is armed with a spear and helmet, and it pleases him to be invited to banquets.  History  Radegast is mentioned by Adam of Bremen in his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum as the deity worshipped in the Lutician (West Slavic tribes) city of Radgosc. Likewise, Helmold in his Chronica Slavorum wrote of Radegast as a Lutician god. However, Thietmar of Merseburg earlier wrote in his Chronicon that the pagan Luticians in their holy city of \\"Radegast\\" worshiped many gods, the most important of which was called Zuarasici, identified as either Svarog or Svaro≈æiƒç. According to Adam of Bremen, Johannes Scotus, Bishop of Mecklenburg, was sacrificed to this god on November 10, 1066 during a Wendish pagan rebellion against Christianity. Ill. 6. Radegast in an illustration from Acta Eruditorum, 1715  Mythology  According to one of the romantic authors, Radegast was beloved by Hors, described as the beautiful young goddess of the moon. However he ignored her, unlike the god of the wind Stribog, who loved her. Stribog secretly stole Radegast's cloak and towards morning he sneaked into Hors chamber, where she let him seduce her and got her pregnant. Radegast was outraged, but not because of Hors rather for the stolen coat. Hors felt cheated and lonely. She begged for mercy for her newborn girl and suggested that she could be a goddess of Autumn, but the main god Svarog disagreed and the dispute was not settled. As a result, this season does not have a goddess and the goddess ≈Ωiva fights over it with the goddess Marzanna. Mt. Radho≈°≈•, in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain range, is traditionally associated with the worship of this god; according to (modern) legend, missionaries Cyril and Methodius when they visited the mountain on their trip to Great Moravia, had his idol demolished. The original statue once placed on Mt. Radho≈°≈•, sculpted in 1929 by Albin Polasek, is now located in Frenstat's (Czech Republic) Town Hall. When the statue was moved to the mountain in 1931, the truck became stuck in a steep turn, and heavy rain accompanied by storm and lightning killed one of the soldiers. A second casting by Albin Polasek stands in the center of Prague's Zoo. The granite version, now found on Mt. Radho≈°≈•, is a more recent copy funded by the Radegast Beer Company in 1998. More information and sculptures of Radegast can be viewed at Polasek Museum in Winter Park, Florida. The name Radho≈°≈• itself is supposed to be a Czech transcription of Radegast.  In popular culture  Radagast the Brown is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. He is one of the wizards and lives among animals. Radigost is the name of a Russian black metal band formed in 1994; Radogost is the name of a folk metal band from Poland formed in 2006. Radagast is the password for Will Byers's fort in the Netflix series Stranger Things.

Maddington has a railway station and like numerous other centres, has been engaging in transit-oriented development planning.  History  During the 19th century, Maddington was owned by John Randall Phillips, one of the wealthier colonists to arrive in Perth during the 1830s. Maddington Park, which Phillips named after a town in Wiltshire, England, was subdivided 70 years later as Perth dealt with the population explosion following the Gold Rush. Maddington Park became 'Maddington' ‚Äì an area of varied agricultural uses including market gardens, poultry and orchards. In the 1950s and 1960s, Maddington and surrounding suburbs were further subdivided and developed into residential suburbs. During the 1960s the Canning Park race course, located in Maddington, was abandoned. William Davison, an English property developer bought up the land and developed the area into an industrial estate, which is the light industrial area which can be seen along Albany Highway and the train line today. The suburb also was the site of one of 24 new Australian Technical Colleges proposed by the Howard Government in 2005.

In this game knights \\"relay\\" their power to friendly pieces. Game rules Any piece defended by a friendly knight gains the power of a knight (except the king). The piece loses the additional power as soon as a friendly knight no longer defends it. Knights are immune from capture, cannot capture enemy pieces and (so) cannot give check. Pawns may not move to the first or last rank by a relayed knight move. If a pawn is relayed to its initial rank, it regains the option to make a double-step move. There is no en passant in Knight Relay chess. Pawns can promote to knights and promoted knights also have relay power. =Example moves= The diagram shows possible moves of the white pawn on e6. As a normal pawn it can move to e7 or capture on d7 or f7. In addition, since it is defended by a friendly knight on d4, it can move like a knight to c7, c5, f4, g5 or g7. It cannot relay as a knight to the last rank, and the black king on d8 is not in check. The white knight on b7 does not check the king either, and is not able to capture the pawn on a5. The white queen cannot take the black knight on c3. White can deliver checkmate in this position by playing Qd6#. The black king cannot escape to c8 or e8, since those squares are attacked by the queen on d6 (the queen getting knight power from the knight on b7).

Early life His family came to Canada from County Antrim in Ulster, Ireland in 1822. The four Barber brothers built a woollen mill, foundry and sawmill in Georgetown, Ontario. In 1854, they built a paper mill on the Credit River near Streetsville, Ontario. In 1888, his nephew, John Roaf Barber, upgraded the mill to use hydroelectricity power, one of the early industrial applications of electricity in Canada. In 1862, Barber built a brick home near Streetsville, Ontario now known as The Old Barber House. Political career He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for Halton from 1867 to 1875. In 1871 the Liberal Party dropped Barber as their candidate in the upcoming election, due to his support for Premier J. Sandfield Macdonald's self-described \\"Patent Combination\\" government. In his stead, the party selected William Durie Lyon and the radical 'Clear Grits' platform he championed. Despite the withdrawal of Liberal support, Barber ran as an independent and successfully fended off Lyon's challenge, largely thanks to the significant Conservative support he had acquired. Four years after initially deselecting Barber, the Liberal Party readopted him at the 1875 election, thus preventing Lyon from contesting the riding of Halton on behalf of the party. Following the 1875 election, he was disqualified for having induced a voter to stay home, and a byelection was held on November 15, 1875 which was won by William Durie Lyon.

Life Colburn began his career in the London shop of William Earle, a bookseller in Albemarle Street. He then worked as an assistant at Morgan's Library, a circulating library in Conduit Street. He took it over in 1816, and carried on the business until he resigned it to Messrs. Saunders & Otley, to concentrate on light literature. He started off with a coup in publishing Lady Caroline Lamb's roman √† clef (and succ√®s de scandale) novel Glenarvon (1816), which went through four editions and sold very well.Douglass, Paul. Lady Caroline Lamb Palgrave-Macmillan, 2004, pp. 183‚Äì18. Lady Morgan's France (1817) was another of his earliest successful ventures. A furious attack in the Quarterly Review (April 1817) did more good than harm to the book. Glenarvon was a harbinger of Colburn's later great innovation, the so-called \\"Silver Fork Novel,\\" a kind of Fashionable Novel which gave readers the thrill of peering into the lifestyles of rich and aristocratic families. In 1830 Colburn took his printer, Richard Bentley into a partnership, which was the dissolved in August 1832. Having first set up business again at Windsor for a short time, Colburn paid a forfeiture for breaking the covenant not to commence publishing within twenty miles of London, and opened a house in Great Marlborough Street. He finally retired from business in favour of Messrs. Hurst & Blackett, but kept his name attached to a few books. These were Elliot Warburton's Crescent and the Cross, the Diaries of Evelyn and Pepys, Agnes Strickland's Lives, Burke's Peerage and some more. Their copyrights went to auction at Southgate & Barrett on 26 May 1857, and produced about ¬£14,000. Colburn amassed a considerable fortune, his property being sworn as under ¬£35,000. Periodicals With the support of Frederic Shoberl, Colburn started in 1814 New Monthly Magazine, and Universal Register, a rival to the old Monthly Magazine of Sir Richard Phillips. John Watkins and Alaric Alexander Watts were among the early editors. A new series began in 1820 under the care of Thomas Campbell. Bulwer Lytton (1832), Theodore Hook, and Harrison Ainsworth (3rd ser., 1836) successively were editors. The magazine lasted to 1875. On 25 January 1817, Colburn brought out the first number of the Literary Gazette, priced at one shilling. It was the earliest weekly newspaper devoted to literature, science, and the arts which obtained reputation and authority. Initially Hannibal Evans Lloyd, and Thomasina Ross who had worked with Lloyd before, appear to have been joint editors. The department of fine arts was under the care of William Paulet Carey. After the twenty-sixth number (19 July 1817) William Jerdan purchased a third share of the property and became sole editor. Messrs. Longman also purchased a third, and the periodical was rapidly successful. In 1842, William Jerdan became sole proprietor. The Gazette was incorporated with the Parthenon in 1862. On 31 December 1827, Colburn wrote to Jerdan that he had joined the new literary journal, the Athenaeum, \\"in consequence of the injustice done to my authors generally\\" by the Gazette. In 1828, he founded the Court Journal; in the following year he brought out the United Service Magazine and Naval and Military Gazette; and he had some interest in the Sunday Times. A biography of David Lester Richardson recounts the background to Colburn's Court Journal. Richardson established the London Weekly Review in 1827, but was compelled to give it up in 1828; he entered into an agreement under which Colburn would assume control of the journal in return for Richardson receiving a share in the profits of sales of the London Weekly Review. Colburn ingeniously renamed the publication as the Court Journal, and Richardson's anticipated rewards evaporated. Books After the successes of Lady Caroline Lamb's Glenarvon (1816) and Lady Morgan's France (1817), Colburn, at the suggestion of William Upcott, brought out the first edition of John Evelyn's Diary in 1818. It was followed by his publication of Pepys's Diary in 1825. At the height of Theodore Hook's headlong London career, Colburn offered him ¬£600. for a novel, and Sayings and Doings (1824) was the result. Six thousand copies of the three volumes are said to have been sold. In 1827 he published Thomas Skinner Sturr's anonymous Richmond, or stories in the life of a Bow Street officer, the earliest collection of detective stories. In 1826, Colburn published The Posthumous Works of Anne Radcliffe, featuring Gaston de Blondeville, and A Memoir of The Authoress, the first known biographical work on Mrs. Radcliffe. Colburn was a major purveyor of the fashionable novel mode of social fiction called \\"Silver Fork\\" after a phrase coined by William Hazlitt. The series of Colburn's Modern Standard Novelists (1835‚Äì41, 19 vols.), containing works by Thomas Campbell, Bulwer Lytton, Theodore Hook and Harrison Ainsworth, Lady Morgan, Robert Plumer Ward, Horace Smith, Marryat, Thomas Henry Lister, G. P. R. James, and George Robert Gleig. Colburn also numbered among \\"my authors\\" Disraeli, John Banim, and fashionable novelists of the day. Family He was twice married, the second time to Eliza Anne, only daughter of Captain Crosbie, who survived him. He died at his house in Bryanston Square on 16 August 1855.

It was first broadcast on BBC One on 15 April 2006. The episode is set five billion years in the future on New Earth, a planet humanity settled on following the destruction of the Earth in the 2005 episode \\"The End of the World\\". In the episode, the alien time traveller the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant), his travelling companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), and their old enemy Lady Cassandra (Zo√´ Wanamaker) uncover many artificially-grown humans having been infected with every disease in a hospital by a group of humanoid cat nuns as a way of finding cures for the diseases. Plot After saying their goodbyes to Jackie and Mickey, The Tenth Doctor takes Rose to the year 5,000,000,023 to a world humanity settled on after the destruction of the Earth called \\"New Earth\\". The Face of Boe summons the Doctor to Ward 26 in a hospital in New New York through the Doctor's psychic paper. In the ward, the Doctor notices humanoid feline nuns of the Sisters of Plenitude have been curing incurable diseases. Meanwhile, Rose is separated from the Doctor and is tricked by Lady Cassandra into having Cassandra's mind implanted in Rose's body, using a psychic graft. The Sisters of Plenitude as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. The Doctor is suspicious of Cassandra's actions after she kisses him and displays knowledge of advanced computer systems. They discover that the hospital houses thousands of pods containing artificially grown humans in what is supposedly the intensive care unit. The artificial humans are forcibly infected with every disease in the galaxy so that the Sisters can discover the cures as a way of dealing with the influx of settlers and the diseases they brought with them. Cassandra reveals she is in Rose's body and knocks the Doctor out with a perfume gas, locking him in a pod. Cassandra then approaches Sister Jatt and demands payment in exchange for keeping the human test subjects secret. The Sisters refuse, and Cassandra releases the Doctor and some of the humans as a distraction. The infected humans release others from their pods and soon a zombie-like attack begins, with those infected trying to attack others in the hospital. The Doctor and Cassandra reach Ward 26 and grab all the intravenous medical solutions, emptying them into a disinfectant shower installed in a lift. They apply the mixture to a group of infected humans, who within moments become cured of their diseases. The Doctor encourages them to go and spread the cure to the other infected people, and soon the attack is over. The police arrest the surviving Sisters, while the Face of Boe tells the Doctor that the message for him can wait until they meet for the third and final time. The Doctor orders Cassandra out of Rose's body. Cassandra's servant Chip volunteers to accept her consciousness. Chip's cloned body begins to fail, and Cassandra finally accepts her death. The Doctor takes Cassandra back to see herself on the last night someone had called her beautiful. Cassandra, in Chip's body, approaches her younger self at a party and tells her that she is beautiful, before collapsing and dying in her arms. Production The Face of Boe last appeared in The End of the World. His role was elevated from his previously incidental role. Russell T Davies said of the episode \\"I promised Billie [Piper] an episode in which she'd be funny. So episode one of the new series is very much based around comedy for Billie.\\"Radio Times, 8‚Äì14 April The exterior scenes on New Earth were shot at Rhossili Bay overlooking Worm's Head on the Gower Peninsula on 26 September 2005. The hospital basement scenes were recorded at Tredegar House in Newport. The location for the pods containing the human specimens was a disused paper mill previously used as the base of the Nestene Consciousness in \\"Rose\\". The hospital scenes were filmed inside the Wales Millennium Centre. The nightclub the Doctor and Rose take Cassandra (as Chip) to at the end was filmed at the restaurant Ba Orient in Cardiff Bay. As it was filmed during the day, the building was covered with black drapes. The exterior shots of the lift car as Rose descends to the basement are reused footage from \\"Rose\\". Cassandra's face and body was put in during post- production by The Mill. The producer's and director's credits have been amended slightly since \\"The Christmas Invasion\\", so that now the credit is in lower case and the name of the crewmember is in capitals. This was the result of a suggestion from a Doctor Who Magazine editor, who felt the previous arrangement had made the job seem more important than the crewmember. This episode is set twenty-three years after the events of the 2005 episode \\"The End of the World\\", and thirty years prior to the events of the 2007 episode \\"Gridlock\\". According to Russell T Davies on the episode commentary, Cassandra's earlier self bases Chip on the man who had praised her beauty at the party ‚Äî Chip himself. Where the \\"pattern\\" for Chip comes from in the first instance is thus unclear, creating an ontological paradox. Also in the commentary, Tennant noted that the TARDIS has moved since \\"The Christmas Invasion\\". He speculates that there might have been many off-screen adventures, or (observing that it no longer seems like Christmas in the introduction) perhaps that the Doctor \\"lived there for a bit\\". =Cast notes= Adjoa Andoh returned to Doctor Who in five episodes of Series 3 and the final two episodes of Series 4, as Francine Jones, mother of Martha Jones. She also played Nurse Albertine in the audio play Year of the Pig. Outside references Cassandra uses the UK slang term chav, although she is unable to mimic Rose's accent properly, instead making attempts at Cockney rhyming slang. Rose refers to Cassandra as \\"Michael Jackson\\" as she did in \\"The End of the World\\". She refers to Chip as \\"Gollum\\". Broadcast and reception Overnight ratings for the episode peaked at 8.3 million viewers in the UK, with a final rating of 8.62 million, making it the ninth most watched programme of the week. The episode achieved an audience Appreciation Index of 85. This is the first Doctor Who episode to have an accompanying TARDISODE. The Canadian English-language premiere of Series 2 on CBC, consisting of this episode, took place on 9 October 2006. It concluded with an extended version of the \\"Tooth and Claw\\" trailer from the BBC broadcast; the revised closing theme was not heard in the broadcast and it was also the first episode to be broadcast without a specially taped introduction featuring one of the lead actors. The episode had previously aired on 29 August 2006 in translation on the French-language broadcaster Zt√©l√©, under the title Une nouvelle Terre. This episode was released together with \\"The Christmas Invasion\\" as a basic DVD with no special features on 1 May 2006, and as part of a second series boxset on 20 November 2006. *Copies of the DVD from the complete Series 2 set distributed to Netflix customers contained an error: at the 32-minute mark, the playback switched abruptly to a scene from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. Netflix has pulled the disc from their inventory while they work out the issue with the BBC; this only seems to have affected Netflix copies. IGN's rated the episode 7.2 out of 10, concluding, \\"Although this was an entertaining episode, it did not have the dramatic impact of the previous episode. Overall, \\"New Earth\\" featured more than a few interesting moments, such as the scenes with the Doctor and the Face of Boe, and Billie Piper's performance as the Casandra-possessed Rose was hilarious; but the zombie attack felt quite out of place for a Doctor Who episode\\". Nick Setchfield of SFX questioned whether the \\"brash, colourful and occasionally howl-out-loud funny\\" tone was appropriate enough to start the series, but he praised the concept of the cat nuns as well as their prosthetics, Tennant's performance, and the ending that \\"alchemises the broad strokes comedy into something genuinely moving\\". Writing for The A.V. Club in 2014, Alasdair Wilkins gave \\"New Earth\\" the grade of \\"C+\\". He noted that, likely due to production difficulties, it \\"too often feels like it is missing vital context\\" and suffered from unconvincing special effects. Furthermore, he criticised the story for being \\"caught between two irreconcilable tones\\" and featuring a \\"baffling\\" ending that wished to redeem Cassandra. Nevertheless, he found Tennants performance to be impressive though not as coherent as he eventually will be, and he praised Piper despite the fact that the story lacked Rose's character.

Her father, Zhang Huaqing (), was a long-distance truck driver whose work frequently took him away from home; her mother, Zhang Guiying (), was a department-store assistant during that time. Zhang noted in an interview that \\"her parents divorced early [though she] did not realize the secret until years later\\". At the age of 15, Zhang's father died and \\"her mother was laid off from her job\\", so Zhang sang at a public bar to help support the family, adding to the 100 yuan per month she received from her late father's family.

It is a 5-mile- long Old Red Sandstone ridge in south Wales, in the heart of the Gower Peninsula, in the City and County of Swansea. Local people colloquially refer to it as the \\"backbone of Gower\\", as it protrudes from surrounding limestone. The highest point on the ridge (188m/617 ft ) is the second highest point in the peninsula, offering panoramic views of the surrounding country and seas. The swathes of grassland around the ridge are known as Cefn Bryn Common. Along the ridge of the hill, banked by grassy common on both sides is the road from Cilibion to Reynoldston. The road was previously known as the Old Coal Road and Red Road. Wandering sheep, wild ponies and cows can be seen along the road. Large swells and dips can be encountered along the route, formed by swallets and sinkholes in the surrounding limestone. The highest point of the road intersects with the ridge summit. Arthur's Stone Arthur's stone, near Swansea as depicted c. 1840 Arthur's Stone Just north of the ridge summit of Cefn Bryn, there is a neolithic burial ground, known as \\"Arthur's Stone\\" (). Its name comes from a legend that the ancient British King Arthur threw a large stone from Llanelli which landed on this spot. It is believed that during the Bronze Age Cefn Bryn was used extensively for ceremonies and rituals. Beneath the bracken on the hill over sixty cairns have been discovered. Most of these are likely to be no more than collections of stones cleared by local farmers; but just north-west of Arthur's Stone three prominent cairns have been excavated that prove their ancient role - the largest being Great Cairn, a circular heap of stones above a central grave. Broad Pool Broad Pool There is a small fresh water pool called Broad Pool at the foot of the eastern approach to the ridge. This pool is known to have existed since 1645, and has dried out and been re-excavated twice. Today it is a protected nature reserve. It lies in a shallow basin on the limestone plateau beneath Cefn Bryn, and consists of an acidic pond, heath and bog, which is important for aquatic plants, amphibians, dragonflies (including Southern Damselfly) and wetland birds.Cefn Bryn factsheet from CCW In Art A landscape painting of Cefn Bryn from Pennard castle by the Neo-impressionist painter Lucien Pissarro may be seen in the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea.

Ladue was born in Schuyler Falls, New York. His mother died when he was seven years old, and his father in 1874. Upon his father's death, 19-year-old Joe headed west. In 1876, he found employment in a gold mine in Deadwood, South Dakota, beginning as a general labourer and working his way up to engineer, foreman and superintendent. He eventually quit to go prospecting in Arizona and New Mexico, but did not strike it rich. In 1882, he crossed the Chilkoot Pass into the interior of the Yukon, where he prospected and traded for a couple of years. In August 1896, a few days after the discovery of gold in the Klondike, he staked a claim to either 160 or 178 acres (65-72 hectares) of boggy flats at the mouth of the Klondike River as a townsite. In January 1897, he named the new town Dawson after Canadian geologist George Mercer Dawson. By July, about 5000 people lived there. Ladue could sell town lots for as much as $5000 or $8000. He relocated his saw mill to Dawson; it ran continuously night and day in response to the extreme demand. He also set up a store and the first saloon in town. In addition, he acquired a number of rich gold claims. All this enabled Ladue to leave the north a rich man that year. SS Morgan City leaving Seattle for Alaska, April 26, 1898. With some of his wealth, Ladue bought the steamer SS Morgan City and had it brought around Cape Horn from New York City. After a single trip from Seattle to Skagway and Valdez he leased it at $600 per day as a troop transport to the Philippines. The ship was lost in the Sea of Japan in September 1899. Ladue returned to his home town and on December 15, 1897, he married Anna \\"Kitty\\" Mason. He was in poor health and died of \\"consumption\\" (tuberculosis) at Schuyler Falls on June 27, 1901. He was survived by his wife and a son.

He translated from the French the romances of Kynge Appolyne of Thyre (W. de Worde, 1510), The History of Helyas Knyght of the Swanne (W. de Worde, 1512, 1522), and The Life of Ipomydon (Hue de Rotelande), not dated. Among his other works is The Complaynte of them that ben too late maryed, an undated tract printed by Wynkyn de Worde. William Copland, the printer, supposed to have been his brother, published three editions of Howleglas, perhaps by Robert, which in any case represent the earliest English version of Till Eulenspiegel. The Knyght of the Swanne was reprinted by W. Copland possibly in 1560, in William John Thoms's Early Prose Romances, vol. iii, and by the Grolier Club (1901); the Hye Way in William Carew Hazlitt's Remains of the Early Popular Poetry of England, vol. iv (1866).

After each episode, she would appear in a live-action segment to perform an illusion or do her \\"Teach-A-Trick,\\" a segment that teaches the audience a simple magic trick they could perform at home. The show failed to attract an audience and production was cancelled after a single season. Plot A young female magician, already an experienced performer, is chosen by an old man named Tenko to come to his school for magicians and learn real magic. At the school, the young magician befriends a number of other magicians already attending the school and learning magic from Tenko. The new magician begins her training and quickly becomes the best magician at the school. Impressed by her abilities, the master names the young magician \\"Princess Tenko\\" in recognition as his successor as the next Tenko and the Master Guardian of the Tenko Box, a magical wardrobe that contains many magic gems known as the Starfire Gems. Two of the most senior students, the twins Jana and Jason watch on. Jana become jealous of the newcomer when she is chosen to become Tenko's successor and conspires for rebellion. Jason tries to talk some sense stating that unlike Jana who had slacked off during training, Mariko is more responsible and therefore Tenko could trust her. She convinces him to help her and succeed at stealing two of the Starfire Gems for their own use. When Jana and Jason are discovered, Master Tenko is overcome by their magic. In the scuffle, the Tenko Box is damaged, and the remaining Starfire gems are scattered all over the world and some through time. The twins escape as the new Tenko arrives in an attempt to stop them. Pleased with the young magician's abilities, Master Tenko entrusts Princess Tenko and his remaining students with Starfire Gems he had hidden away and the duty of recovering and protecting the other Starfire Gems from the forces of evil. Characters The main protagonists of the series from left to right: Bolt, Steel, Tenko, and Hawk. *Princess Tenko (voiced by Cree Summer): As the Master Guardian, the Japanese Tenko is the leader of the show's heroes. She performs a traveling magic show while searching for the displaced Starfire Gems. The ones she personally uses each allow her to summon a ghostly animal companion to help her battle. *Bolt (voiced by Neal McDonough): Bolt is a white Guardian from Chicago who is the team's joker. His Starfire Gem uses the power to wield a magic sword. *Hawk: Hawk is a Native American Guardian with a somewhat stereotypical connection to nature. His Starfire Gem uses the power to wield a magical shield which can block most other gems' powers. *Steel (voiced by Michael Sorich): Steel is an African-American Guardian who is a scholar of history. His Starfire Gem uses the power to fire magical rings which he can throw to capture enemies or create ladders. *Ali (voiced by Amy Danles): Ali is a hot-headed teenage white girl who feels distant from everyone in her life. After helping Tenko in one adventure, she becomes her apprentice and trains constantly to be a Guardian. In the twelfth episode she does become a Guardian and earns her own Starfire Gem, but her power is never put to use. *Shonti: Shonti is an animal trainer hired by Hikita prior to the show. She is technically not a Guardian and does not acquire a gem within the series, but she can perform magic and is part of the team. She is from Africa, though which country is not specified. Like Hawk, she has a connection to nature. *Jana (voiced by Cree Summer): Granddaughter of the Master Guardian who came before Hikita, the short-tempered Jana tried to steal the Starfire Gems when Tenko became the new Master Guardian instead of her. It is also presumed that Jana is manipulating Jason into being loyal to her. And yet, after Vell tried to take her life away, Jana helped Tenko to seal the demon away, which means there's still a chance that she might become a guardian with her brother just like she always wanted. *Jason (voiced by Michael Sorich): Jana's twin brother. He and Tenko have shown signs of being attracted to each other, but his loyalty to his sister is greater and so he follows her orders. Unbeknownst to Jason, Jana is actually manipulating his loyalty by using their close bond to get what she wants. *Hikita Tenko: The former leader of the Guardians. After he was injured by Jana and Jason he was placed in the Tenko Box and disappeared, but occasionally his spirit appears to Princess Tenko to give her advice. *Travis Cage: An endangered-species poacher who is interested in money with each endangered animal he captures and trades. He finds the diamond Starfire Gem after failing to bag a gorilla. With the help of Jana and Jason, he kidnaps Ninjara, seeing her as a rare prey, and sets traps for Tenko and the Guardians. *Vell: An evil industrialist who was logging a rainforest to try to find the emerald Starfire Gem, which would allow him to free a demonic entity imprisoned long ago in another dimension. He is pulled into the demon's other realm for his failure and his ultimate fate is unknown.

Over time, this creates a thick layer of acidic peat. Large areas of these forests are being logged at high rates. Peat swamp forests are typically surrounded by lowland rain forests on better-drained soils, and by brackish or salt-water mangrove forests near the coast. Tropical peatlands, which coexist with swamp forests within the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, store and accumulate vast amounts of carbon as soil organic matter - much more than natural forests contain. Their stability has important implications for climate change; they are among the largest near-surface reserves of terrestrial organic carbon. Peat swamp forests, which have ecological importance, are one of the most threatened, yet least studied and most poorly understood biotypes. Since the 1970s, peat swamp forest deforestation and drainage have increased exponentially.Ng, Peter. (June 1994). Diversity and conservation of blackwater fishes in Peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the North Selangor peat swamp forest In addition, El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought and large-scale fires are accelerating peatland devastation. This destruction enhances the decomposition of soil and organic matter, increasing the carbon release to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This phenomenon suggests that tropical peatlands have already become a large carbon-dioxide source, but related data and information is limited.Hirano, Takashi. (29 November 2006). Carbon dioxide balance of a tropical peat swamp forest in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Tropical peat swamp forests are home to thousands of animals and plants, including many rare and critically endangered species such as the orangutan and Sumatran tiger, whose habitats are threatened by peatland deforestation.  Distribution  Tropical peat ecosystem are found in three regions, i.e. Central America, Africa and South East Asia with about 62% of the world's tropical peat lands occur in the Indomalayan realm (80% in Indonesia, 11% in Malaysia, 6% in Papua New Guinea, and pockets in Brunei, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand).Rieley JO, Ahmad-Shah AA Brady MA (1996) The extent and nature of tropical peat swamps.

Elsevier BV pp 145-172 Peat in Indonesia is distributed over three islands, Sumatra (8.3 million ha), Kalimantan (6.3 million ha) and Papua (4.6 million ha).  Formation  Tropical peat forms on low-lying areas, such as river deltas, floodplains or shallow oxbow lakes. The formation process usually follows hydrosere successional steps, where the ponds or flooded area eutrophicated by water plants, then transform into waterlogged swamp with grasses or shrubs, and eventually formed a forest that continues to grow and accumulate. Peat located on the fringing areas of domes in between domes might form through lateral expansion. This peat accumulation often forms a convex shape called a dome, which could rise up to 4 m on coastal peat and up to 18 m on inland peat. At the beginning of its formation, peat is largely topogenous or minerotrophic, receiving high nutrient input from rivers or groundwaters. As the peat thickens and the dome becomes elevated, the top of the peat is no longer affected by the river or groundwater input, instead they are becoming ombrotrophic, exclusively obtaining water from the precipitation Input only from the rain causes a low nutrient and mineral content, especially calcium. The peat thus becomes highly acidic and only able to support low biodiversity and stunted forest. Inland and coastal peat differ greatly in their age, where coastal peat formed during the mid Holocene, about 8000 years ago. Inland peat formed much earlier during the Late Pleistocene, more than 26000 BP. Coastal peat formation is highly affected by the sea level rise with strong accumulation around 8-4000 BP when El Nino is less intense. Because the Sunda Shelf is tectonically stable, the sea level change in this area is only affected by the eustatic sea level, and during the glacial period the Karimata Strait dried, causing Asian Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo and Java to become connected. After the Last Glacial Maximum, this coastline moved inland as the ice sheet melted, and finally reached the level of modern coastline around 8500 BP. Thus, the oldest age of coastal peat in this region is less than 8500 years old. Inland peat formation is highly affected by climate with little or no effect of sea level rise because it located around 15‚Äì20 m above sea level, where the most recent record of higher sea level was during about 125000 BP when sea level was 6 m above the modern level. Peat cores from Sebangau, South Kalimantan show a slow growth of 0.04 mm/y around 13000 BP when the climate was colder, then accelerated to 2.55mm/y around 9900 BP in warmer Early Holocene, then slower again to 0.23-0.15 mm/y during intense El Nino. A similar pattern is observed in cores from Sentarum, West Kalimantan, where the peat shows slower growth around 28-16000 BP, 13-3000 BP and on 5-3000 BP. While the slower growth from 28-16000 BP and 5-3000 BP is explained by a drier climate during this period due to Heinrich Event I and the emergence of El Ni√±o.  Ecology  Peat swamp forest in Kalimantan Peat swamp forest are unusual ecosystems, with trees up to 70 m high - vastly different from the peat lands of the north temperate and boreal zones (which are dominated by Sphagnum mosses, grasses, sedges and shrubs). The spongy, unstable, waterlogged, anaerobic beds of peat can be up to 20 m deep with low pH (pH 2.9 ‚Äì 4) and low nutrients, and the forest floor is seasonally flooded. The water is stained dark brown by the tannins that leach from the fallen leaves and peat ‚Äì hence the name blackwater swamps. During the dry season, the peat remains waterlogged and pools remain among the trees. Water level on the peat is usually below the surface. however, during a severe El Nino, this water level might drop to below the surface and increase the risk of burning. Peat forest contains high amount of carbon due to its soil nature, categorized as histosols with characteristics of high organic material content (70-99%). This carbon pool is stabilized by the low temperature on temperate peat, and by the water logging on tropical peat. Disturbances that change the temperature or the water content of the peat will release this stored carbon into the atmosphere, exacerbating human-made climate change. Estimation of carbon content of tropical peat ranges from 50 Gt carbon to 88 Gt carbon.  In Indonesia  Peat formation is a natural carbon sink; carbon is withdrawn out of the system and converted into peat through biological activity. Peat swamp forests originally represented major ecosystems in Indonesia and ranged between 16.5‚Äì27 million hectares. In their original state, Indonesian peat swamp forests released between 0.01‚Äì0.03 Gt of carbon annually. In recent years, however, these important ecosystems have been reduced through deforestation, drainage, and conversion to agricultural lands and other activities. Their current status as carbon sequestering systems have thus also been reduced significantly. An understanding of the global importance of peat (and thus the urgency of maintaining peat swamp forests) and identifying alternative ways of making these areas productive in an environmentally sound and sustainable manner should have high priority among scientists and policy- makers alike.Sorensen, Kim W. (September 1993). Indonesian peat swamp forests and their role as a carbon sink. =The problem= File:TOMS indonesia smog lrg.jpgAir pollution over Southeast Asia in October 1997. File:Borneo fires October 2006.jpgSatellite photograph of the haze above Borneo Image:Fires and Smoke in Borneo 2009.jpgThe lowlands to the north-west and south-east are shrouded with thick, grey smoke from dozens of fires in this satellite image from 2009. Over the past decade, under the Mega Rice Project (MRP), the government of Indonesia has drained over 1 million hectares of the Borneo peat swamp forests for conversion to agricultural land. Between 1996 and 1998, more than 4,000 kilometers of drainage and irrigation channels were dug, and deforestation accelerated in part through legal and illegal logging and in part through burning. The water channels, and the roads and railways built for legal forestry, opened up the region to illegal forestry. In the MRP area, forest cover dropped from 64.8% in 1991 to 45.7% in 2000, and clearance has continued since then. It appears that almost all the marketable trees have now been removed from the areas covered by the MRP. What happened was not what had been expected: the channels drained the peat forests rather than irrigating them. Where the forests had often flooded up to 2 meters deep in the rainy season, now their surface is dry at all times of the year. The Indonesian government has now abandoned the MRP. A study for the European Space Agency found that up to 2.57 billion tons of carbon were released to the atmosphere in 1997 as a result of burning peat and vegetation in Indonesia. This is equivalent to 40% of the average annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and contributed greatly to the largest annual increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration detected since records began in 1957. Additionally, the 2002-3 fires released between 200 million to 1 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Indonesia is currently the world's third largest carbon emitter, to a large extent due to the destruction of its ancient peat swamp forests. Indonesia contains 50% of tropical peat swamps and 10% of dry land in the world. They have the potential of playing an important role in mitigating global warming and climate change under the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) scheme. Rather than reducing deforestation - in terms of claiming carbon credits from REDD initiatives - peatland conservation and rehabilitation are more efficient undertakings, due to the much larger reduced emissions achievable per unit area and the much lower opportunity costs involved.Mathai, J. (5 October 2009). Seeing REDD over deforestation. =Conservation and preservation= Attempts to preserve tropical peat swamp forests have been minimal in comparison to the widespread impact and devastation of commercial logging; in Sarawak, logging is ongoing and planned to intensify in Brunei. One plan by the environmental NGO Borneo Orangutan Survival is to preserve the peat swamp forest of Mawas using a combination of carbon finance and debt-for-nature-swap. About 6% of the original peat-forest area is contained within protected areas, the largest of which are Tanjung Puting and Sabangau National Parks. The main causes of deforestation in Indonesia continue to be palm oil business (see palm oil production in Indonesia) and illegal logging, ongoing in areas such as South Sumatra. A survey by the University of Muhammadiyah Palembang in 2008 estimated that in 25 years most of the natural forests will be depleted due to illegal logging. Projects by REDD are designed to tackle deforestation and protect forests from the encroachment of agriculture, benefitting biodiversity and improving the quality of the environment to surrounding villages. To counter the destruction of mangroves and unsustainable palm oil expansion in Indonesia's peatlands, organizations, such as Wetlands International, work with the Indonesian government to improve policies and spatial planning. They engage with the palm-oil industry, promoting best management practices in tropical peat swamp forests and ensuring the participation of local communities, who lack awareness about natural resource management. In the field, they work with communities to restore mangroves and peatlands. Habitat disturbance caused by logging was shown to affect orangutan density within a mixed swamp forest. The presence of a very large, self-sustaining orangutan population in this region emphasizes the urgency for greater protection of Kalimantan's peat swamp forests in light of recent and rapid habitat degradation.  In Malaysia  It has long been assumed that the peat underlying tropical peat swamp forests accumulates because the extreme conditions (waterlogged, nutrient poor, anaerobic and acidic) impede microbial activity. Studies in a tropical Malaysian peat swamp (North Selangor peat swamp forest) showed that although the sclerophyllous, toxic leaves of endemic peat-forest plants (Macaranga pruinosa, Campnosperma coriaceum, Pandanus atrocarpus, Stenochlaena palustris) were barely decomposed by bacteria and fungi, the leaves of M. tanarius, another plant species, were almost completely decomposed after one year. Thus it is intrinsic properties of the leaves (that are adaptations to deter herbivory in the nutrient poor environment) that impede microbial breakdown.Yule, Catherine M. (22 June 2008).

She was the second woman to win as a solo performer, after Jenny Eclair in 1995. Background She was raised in Great Kimble near Aylesbury. She attended Downe House School followed by Worcester College, Oxford where she received a scholarship to read English and started writing and performing in the Oxford Revue. Career Solon tried being a stand up comedian but found character comedy suited her better. In 2005 she won the Perrier Award for her one-woman Edinburgh Fringe show Kopfraper's Syndrome: One Man and His Incredible Mind. Following this the BBC and Channel 4 were keen to acquire her to produce material for them, and in April 2006 it was announced by the BBC that Solon had been signed to develop projects for them on Radio and TV. The first series of Laura Solon: Talking and Not Talking, a sketch and character comedy series, ran on BBC Radio 4 in January and February 2007. The second series ran in May and June 2008, and the third in November 2009. She recorded a BBC sitcom pilot from the creators of People Like Us, featuring Man Stroke Woman's Daisy Haggard, called Great News.Great News She appeared in Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse's sketch show Ruddy Hell! It's Harry and Paul, broadcast from 2007 on BBC One. She was seen in a sketch show for ITV2 Laura, Ben and Him (2008) with Marek Larwood and Ben Willbond. She was part of Al Murray's Multiple Personality Disorder, shown on ITV1. Alongside Tony Hawks and Angus Deayton she appeared in the feature film Playing the Moldovans at Tennis, which was recorded in 2010 and released in 2012. In the first half of 2010 she toured with Rabbit Faced Story Soup, a play set in a publisher's office in which she played every character. It contained characters from her radio show, Talking and Not Talking, including Carol Price, a divorcee children's author, and Gwynneth the inept call centre worker. New characters included Marcia, an American super publishing agent. Her award-winning 2010 short film Tooty's Wedding, which Solon co-wrote with Ben Willbond, was screened as part of the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. In 2011 Solon was one of the players in the BBC Two improvisational show Fast and Loose, hosted by Hugh Dennis. Kopfraper's Syndrome: One Man and His Incredible Mind The title is a holdover from an entirely different show that Solon had planned to perform with a male partner. When the partner dropped out she rewrote the show in the three weeks leading up to the festival but retained the title in order not to negate the value of the advance publicity or confuse those who had already purchased tickets. Solon plays eight different characters in the show, which consists of sketches of varying lengths, including: *An Andrew Lloyd Webber fan *Caroline, an Australian disabled housewife who is possessed by the ghost of Diana, Princess of Wales *Karen, a prize-winning beautician *Borgesia, a Polish story-teller *A wedding planner from Rotherham *A hunter who does not believe in zebras *Katrina, a corporate high-flier with an irrational terror of the Chinese *A marketing assistant forced to dress as a bookworm As a Perrier award-winning show it secured a run in London's West End, at the Soho Theatre, in November 2005.

The Family Computer version would later be re- released on the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo 3DS via Virtual Console. Gameplay Arcade screenshot Chack'n Pop is an platform arcade game. The player controls Chack'n, a small yellow creature with extendable legs, through a series of single-screen mazes. He is capable of walking on floors or ceilings but not walls. He can climb steps and traverse high walls by extending his legs until he is tall enough to pass onto the next step. He is also capable of throwing hand grenades to his left or right which, after a short period, explode into a cloud of smoke. Separate fire buttons control rolling to the left or right. Chack'n is killed if caught by the explosion cloud. He is delayed in this process by a series of solid walls. In order to get past the walls, he must free hearts from cages using his hand grenades. A further obstruction comes in the form of Monstas hatching from eggs. All or none of the Monstas in a level can be destroyed for a bonus at the end of the level. Each screen is played against a time limit, marked by a Mighta pushing a boulder along the top of the screen. The Monstas and Mightas would later appear as common enemies in Bubble Bobble.  Release  The arcade version was released around April 1984 in Japan, despite the copyright notice of the game saying 1983. = Conversions = Taito would later develop ports of the game for the MSX, Family Computer, Sharp X1, NEC PC-6001 and NEC PC-8801. Sega later developed and published a version of the game for the SG-1000. An emulated version of the arcade version would later be included in Taito Legends Power-Up, Taito Memories Pocket, Taito Memories Gekan, and Taito Legends 2.

The Family Computer version is included on the MyArcade Don Doko Don Pocket Player unit, along with the Family Computer version of Don Doko Don, as well as Don Doko Don 2. Reception and legacy Retrospective views on Chack'n Pop have been mostly negative. A mini review of the game on a retrospective of The NewZealand Story found in an issue of Retro Gamer claimed the game \\"wasn't a great platformer\\" due to how complex it is. PC Zone said the game \\"isn't much fun\\", despite the ideas it presented for the time, and the fact that it was Bubble Bobble's predecessor. Rhody Tobin of HonestGamers slammed the Family Computer version of the game for it's controls, gameplay, and presentation, and while admitting that the game is \\"vaguely interesting\\", ended that it is \\"best forgotten\\". A more positive review of the game came from Alex Kidman of Kotaku Australia, where he briefly reviewed the Family Computer version of the game, and while he recommended it for fans of Bubble Bobble, he noted that it is a very different game compared to Bubble Bobble. Chack'n Pop is often considered to be one of the spiritual predecessors to Bubble Bobble, mostly due to the similar gameplay structure and shared characters. Chack'n and other characters from Chack'n Pop has appeared in various other Taito games as cameos, such as Bubble Bobble, Bubble Memories, and NY Captor.

P. 404., Cossack Hetmanate, Russian Empire (now Ukraine) on July 24, 1757 in a family with Ukrainian Cossack background. His father, Luka Borovik, was an icon-painter. According to the family tradition, all four of Borovik's sons served as Cossacks in Mirgorod regiment, but Vladimir retired early at the rank of poruchik and devoted his life to art ‚Äî mostly icon painting for local churches. Borovikovsky lived in Mirgorod until 1788, where he painted icons and portraits in the Cossack Baroque tradition. His friend Vasily Kapnist was preparing an accommodation for Empress Catherine II in Kremenchuk during her travel to newly conquered Crimea. Kapnist asked Borovikovsky to paint two allegoric paintings (Peter I of Russia and Catherine II as peasants sowing seeds and Catherine II as a Minerva) for her rooms. The paintings so pleased the Empress that she requested that the painter move to Saint Petersburg. After September 1788 Borovikovsky lived in Saint Petersburg where he changed his surname from the Cossack Borovyk to the more aristocratic-sounding Borovikovsky. For his first ten years in Saint Petersburg, he lived in the house of the poet, architect, musician and art theorist, Prince Nikolay Lvov, whose ideas strongly influenced Borovikovsky's art. At the age of 30 years, he was too old to attend Imperial Academy of Arts, so he took private lessons from Dmitry Levitzky and later from Austrian painter Johann Baptist Lampi. In 1795 he was appointed an academician. He became a popular portrait painter and created about 500 portraits during his lifetime, 400 of which survived to the 21st century. He had his own studio, and often relied on assistants to paint the less important parts of a portrait. His sitters included members of the imperial family, courtiers, generals, many aristocrats, and figures from the Russian artistic and literary worlds. Most of his portraits are intimate in style. The most notable are: *Portrait of Catherine II, Empress of Russia (1794) *Portrait of E. N. Arsenyeva (1796) *Portrait of M. I. Lopukhina (1797) *Portrait of F. A. Borovsky (1799) *Portrait of Paul I, Emperor of Russia (1800) *Portrait of Prince A. B. Kurakin (1801‚Äì1802) *Portrait of Princess A. G. Gagarina and Princess V. G. Gagarina (1802). *Portrait of Serbian Prince Karadjordje' 1816 Borovikovsky never taught in the Imperial Academy of Art but pupils lived in his home. Among them were Alexey Venetsianov and Bugaevsky- Blagodarny (who painted the only survived portrait of Vladimir Borovikovsky). After 1819 Borovikovsky became a Freemason, member of a lodge Dying Sphinx. At that time he mostly painted icons, including Iconostasis of the Smolensky Cemetery church and some icons for Kazan Cathedral in Saint-Petersburg. On April 6, 1825 he died suddenly of a heart attack and was interned in the Lazarevskoe Cemetery of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Saint Petersburg.

A well-known historical region, Las Hurdes is currently a Site of Community Importance of the European Union. Description Las Hurdes covers an area of , bordered with Sierra de Gata to the west, Sierra de Francia (Salamanca Province) of Castile-Leon to the north and Trasierra/Tierras de Granadilla to the south. It is a relatively high mountain region with low population density. Its territory is linked to the neighboring valley of Las Batuecas, in whose lower fringes lies the Las Mestas alquer√≠a which is historically part of Las Hurdes. The average weather patterns of the region mark the climate in Las Hurdes as Mediterranean/Continental with Atlantic influence. Despite being usually included as part of the \\"humid\\" section of Spain (\\"Espa√±a h√∫meda\\"), the physical conditions and natural vegetation are semiarid. There are seven rivers cutting stony valleys in Las Hurdes: The R√≠o Malo or Ladrillar, Batuecas, Hurdano, Malvellido, Esperab√°n, Ovejuela and the R√≠o de Los √Ångeles. History Prehistoric Cerezal stele (Chalcolithic, Las Hurdes). =Early history= Archaeological evidence has been found that Las Hurdes region was inhabited in the Chalcolithic Age. The oldest stone inscriptions (petroglyphs) date from about 4000 years before the Iberian Roman era began. The remains are largely testimonial, proving merely that the area was inhabited, for there is no evidence of large settlements. Remains of settlements from Roman times, when the whole area around Las Hurdes was part of the ancient Roman province of Lusitania, have been found in sites near Caminomorisco. The Las Hurdes region was depopulated after the Arab invasion of Spain in the 8th century, and the first vestiges of repopulation in isolated compounds of a few dwellings or hamlets, locally known as alquer√≠as, are dated around the end of the 12th century. =The dark legend= The Las Hurdes region was remote, poor and isolated. The poor diet and general lack of hygiene meant that goiter, pellagra, parasitic worms and other, sometimes repulsive, diseases were common. Many of the local inhabitants (hurdanos) were also suffering from birth defects owing to inbreeding. Livestock illnesses were also widespread. The conditions in the households were unsanitary and, according to visitors, the stench and the misery were overwhelming. The name of the region is believed to derive from the Latin gurdus, a word of Iberian substrate origin meaning \\"doltish, stupid.\\" There was also no literacy in Las Hurdes owing to the harsh living conditions, as well as the distances and travel difficulties involved in reaching the closest centres of learning. The weak church presence favored widespread ignorance and the survival of ancient superstitions. The first census in Las Hurdes was made in the 16th century. And it is at that time when the legend of the darkness and backwardness surrounding the region began to be established. Before 1635 playwright Lope de Vega set a comedy, Las Batuecas del Duque de Alba, in Las Hurdes in which he cast the area as a haunted place and its inhabitants as benighted and barbarous. Porque no saben que hay Dios / ni m√°s mundo que este valle. (Because they do not know that there is a God/neither a world beyond this valley) Lope de Vega relied on writings by Alonso Sanchez Racionero of Salamanca (‚ÄúDe Rebus hispaniae‚Äù, Alcal√° de Henares, 1632), who travelled to the region and was shocked by the poverty he saw, to write his play. As the centuries went by other Spanish writers would follow, casting Las Hurdes as a \\"bad and hidden place\\", thereby adding to the myth, the prejudice and the horrified fascination. Even some serious chroniclers, like Pascual Madoz in his \\"Diccionario Geografico Estadistico-Historico\\", published in 1849, magnified the perceived savagery and moral degradation of the local Hurdanos, with statements like \\"religion is unknown (there)\\".‚Äúla religi√≥n es desconocida‚Äù This spurious contribution to the dark legend about the region was denounced by a Spanish intellectual, Marcelino Men√©ndez y Pelayo, who deemed that such information was \\"probably supplied by a disgruntled priest of the region\\" and that Madoz did not bother to verify it. =Efforts to change the image of the region= Group of Hurdanos at the beginning of the 20th century At the end of the 19th century, however, las Hurdes was ushered into an unprecedented era of patronage and scholarly attention. Some people began to express publicly genuine concern for the extreme poverty, as well as the resulting abject living conditions, of the people in Las Hurdes. In 1892 French doctor J. B. Bid√© travelled to Las Hurdes researching the region, drawing a map and publishing a report in the Bolet√≠n de la Sociedad Geogr√°fica de Madrid. In 1904 Jos√© Mar√≠a Gabriel y Gal√°n composed the poem \\"A Su Majestad el Rey\\" in Salamanca, asking the crown for help in favor of his forgotten subjects in las Hurdes. This poem was published in \\"Las Hurdes\\", a magazine issued for the first time that same year in order to create awareness about the needs of the region. Finally Francisco Jarr√≠n y Moro, then bishop of Coria, established a philanthropic society, \\"Sociedad Esperanza de Las Hurdes\\", in 1908. This first organized move attracted many participants in certain key cities keen to take initiatives in order to alleviate the backwardness and superstition of the region's inhabitants. Maurice Legendre, French Catholic intellectual and head of the French Institute in Madrid, visited Las Hurdes in 1912 and denounced the historical neglect of the region. In 1914 he invited his friend and fellow intellectual Miguel de Unamuno to travel through las Hurdes. Legendre visited the region again in 1922 with an official Comisi√≥n Sanitaria; led by his friend Doctor Gregorio Mara√±√≥n the latter prepared the ground for the royal visit the same year. King Alfonso XIII visited Las Hurdes in 1922 in order to display the concern of the crown. Gregorio Mara√±√≥n accompanied the young king as guide. The king and his retinue lived in military tents planted near the town of Casares de las Hurdes. During the king's visit a famous awkward incident took place: A local village chief, concerned that the king was drinking only black coffee (a consequence of the king's aides distrusting the quality of the local milk owing to unsanitary conditions in the area) served the king a small jug of milk saying \\"Your Majesty rest assured that this milk is totally trustworthy\\",\\"Le aseguro a Su Majestad que esta leche es de toda confianza\\" which turned out to be milk from his wife who had recently given birth. The king became aware of this fact only after having had his caf√© con leche. In 1927 Legendre published an ethnographic study about Las Hurdes.Las Jurdes: √©tude de g√©ographie humaine (1927) This study was read by Luis Bu√±uel, who continued the gloomy legend that cast a pall over the area by means of the modern media. In a short but famous 1933 film about the hurdanos, Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan, that Bu√±uel shot around the town of La Alberca, Las Hurdes was portrayed as an isolated spot full of darkness. Bu√±uel exaggerated some scenes of the film by staging them beforehand in order to create strong impressions in the public. Screening of Bu√±uel's movie was banned by the authorities at that time, the Government of the Second Spanish Republic, for allegedly exploiting the misery in which the local people lived.Translation from Spanish Wikipedia =Present day= View of R√≠o Malo de Arriba, one of the traditional hamlets of Las Hurdes During Francisco Franco's era las Hurdes entered a time of economic stagnation and population loss, as urban centers and some areas close to the coast were favored for development much to the detriment of rural Spain. Following the dictatorship's Plan de Estabilizaci√≥n in 1959, the population declined steeply as people emigrated towards the industrial areas of the large cities and the coastal towns where tourism grew exponentially. Between 1955 and 1975 many Hurdanos left behind small villages where living conditions were often harsh, with cold snowy winters and very basic facilities. Some places like Arrocerezo, La Batuequilla, La Horcajada and El Moral, among others, were abandoned and became ghost towns. In 1976, at the beginning of the transition to democracy, minister Manuel Fraga Iribarne visited Las Hurdes and drew a plan to do away with the bad name of the region and boost its economy called Plan Hurdes. Fraga's plan was welcomed by Las Hurdes' inhabitants for the positive publicity and the fanfare it provided, but it met with scant success. Spearheaded by ICONA, much reafforestation was done by planting pines, a non- indigenous species, on formerly bare mountain slopes. This measure was counterproductive for the traditional goatherders and beekeepers, for the new forests killed the smaller flowering bushes and aromatic plants favoured by goats and bees. The pine woods also made the region highly vulnerable to fires. Other complaints by locals living in alquer√≠as in Valle del Malvellido are that the new forests obliterated ancient paths and clogged wells. New houses were built and the traditional houses of stone and shale, often small and overcrowded, were replaced with modern dwellings. In places like Las Mestas no ancestral houses have been left. The Asociaci√≥n Sociocultural de Las Hurdes (ASHURDES), was established in 1985. It organized the \\"II Congreso Nacional de Hurdanos y Hurdan√≥filos\\" in 1988, where it sought to ask for greater participation of the local people in policies concerning Las Hurdes. The chief concerns of the ca. 6,000 present day inhabitants of the region are to fight against the stigma issues affecting Las Hurdes and to reverse its depopulation. Despite the presence of experts in the congress, its effect and responses have been less marked than during the 1908 church-led philanthropic effort. King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia visited Pinofranqueado in Las Hurdes in April 1998, the first royal visit since 1922. In his speech the king praised the Hurdanos for having overcome the miseries and illnesses of the past.¬´Sois un honor para Espa√±a¬ª, asegura el Rey en Las Hurdes, El Mundo Despite all the media attention trying to cast an appearance of normality, the region still faces difficulties. While Caminomorisco and Pinofranqueado have seen a certain measure of development, Nu√±omoral, Casares de las Hurdes and Ladrillar are in recession, losing population owing to emigration to the cities and the ageing of those who remain in the villages. In 2001, thanks to the Plan Hidrol√≥gico Nacional scheme, water supply to the regions of Las Hurdes and La Vera was improved. Nowadays Las Hurdes is a good holiday destination for city-dwellers because of its scant population, its pristine wilderness and its landscapes. Thanks largely to tourism, present-day standards of living have risen to the average Spanish levels. Economy Las Hurdes was once one of the poorest regions in Spain. Its traditional economy was based on agriculture, including olives, potatoes, cherries, forest products, cork, and goat herding. In recent years, the economy of the area has flourished due mainly to tourism and beekeeping. There is a company commercializing the region's honey. Gastronomy Local cuisine is based on different ways of preparing goat (cabrito en caldereta, cabrito en cuchifrito, cabrito a la sal and cabrito a la hortelana). One dish (cabrito al polen) includes pollen in the recipe. The pork products (embutidos) of Las Hurdes have a taste particular to the region, like the local chorizos and the morcilla de calabaza, made with pork blood and pumpkin. Among the staples, the best known are the habichuelas and a stew with offal known as olla con \\"asaura\\". Las Hurdes sweets (bu√±uelos, hijuelas, bollos fritos (fried buns), roscas, floretas, socochones hurdanos and jeringas) are mostly based on the local honey, as well as lard and flour. The pollen and honey candy caramelos de miel y polen is perhaps the most well-known local sweet outside of the area. Main towns Map of Las Hurdes Despite the heavy depopulation, there are still some people living in about 40 traditional alquer√≠as, such as Las Mestas, scattered through the region.

The son of Governor of Western Australia Dr John Hampton, George Hampton arrived in the colony with his father in February 1862 on board the Stathallen. In 1866 he was holding the offices of private secretary to his father, clerk of council and member of the Finance Board, when he was in addition appointed acting Comptroller General of Convicts. As Hampton had no particular qualifications for the position, this \\"unusually blatant act of nepotism\\"1 was extremely unpopular within the colony. It was further rumoured that George Hampton received a lodging allowance for the position, an allowance to which he was entitled by regulations but did not need since he lived with his father at Government House. The Perth Gazette sarcastically commented that Hampton could not apply the money to the purpose for which it was granted \\"unless His Excellency intends to charge him rent for the rooms he occupies in his residence, in which case, of course, the amount will be placed to the credit of the colonial revenue.\\"2 Both Hamptons became figures of public hostility and ridicule thereafter, especially George. Under George Hampton, convict discipline became extremely harsh; floggings became commonplace and solitary confinement was reintroduced. He was hated by most convicts, and in October 1866 a convict named Connor attacked him with a pickaxe at the Fremantle Quarries, and only the swift action of a guard saved him. As a result of Hampton's harsh convict discipline, escape attempts increased markedly. When Moondyne Joe effected his famous escape of 7 March 1867, the public in general felt that a good joke had been played on the Governor and his son, and much pleasure was taken in ridiculing them. A song caught on: :The Governor's son has got the pip, :The Governor's got the measles. :For Moondyne Joe has give 'em the slip, :Pop goes the weasel. Governor Hampton lobbied for his son to be confirmed in his acting position, but was unsuccessful. At the conclusion of Governor Hampton's term, George Hampton indicated his willingness to remain in the colony provided he was official appointed Comptroller General. A week later the appointment of Henry Wakefield was announced, and in November 1868 he accompanied his father in departing the colony on the Emily Smith. Little is known of Hampton's personal life. In 1865, Bishop Hale had been openly critical of his \\"romantic affair with a Mrs Young\\" 3. On 13 June 1868, he married Fanny Stone, and she accompanied him back to England. He died in 1876.

His name is said to be al-Samaw'al Bin Adiya or al-Samaw'al Bin 'Arid Bin Adiya or al-Samaw'al Bin Awfa or al- Samaw'al Bin Hayyan or al-Samaw'al Bin Hayya. Ibn Durid said that he was son of a priest called Haroun Ibn 'Amran and that he was from the tribe of Banu Ghassan. While al-Jawaliqi said his mother was from Banu Ghassan and his father was from al-Azd. He was one of the most famous poets of his time thanks to the famous poem that he wrote after a princess tried to degrade his people since they were few in number. In this poem, he brags about the history of his clan, Banu Alrayan, and how they ascended to the lordship of their tribe. Before moving out of Yemen, his clan were the kings in Najran, and at one point they had supremacy over Yemen before some of them, including the poet's father, converted to Judaism and moved to northern Arabia. In this poem, Al- Samaw'al also trace his genealogy to Banu Aldayan. Al-Samuel owned a castle near Taima (eight hours north of Medina), built by his grandfather 'Adiya and called, from its mixed color, al-Ablaq. It was situated on a high hill and was a stopping-place for travelers to and from Syria. Fidelity More than for his poetic talents al-Samaw'al is famous for his connection with the warrior- poet and prince Imru' al-Qais, which won for him the epithet \\"faithful,\\" and gave rise to the Arabic saying \\"more faithful than al-Samaw'al.\\" This came about in the following manner: Amru al-Qais, being abandoned by his followers in his fight with the Banu Asad to avenge the death of his father, and being pursued by Al-Nu'man Ibn al-Mundhir Ibn Ma' al-Sama', wandered about from tribe to tribe seeking protection as well as support in his endeavor to regain his inheritance. When he came to the Banu Fazara their chief advised him to seek out Samaw'al ibn 'Adiya' in his castle al-Ablaq, saying that although he had seen the Emperor of the Greeks and visited the Lakhmid kingdom of al- Hirah, he had never found a place better fitted for assuring safety to those in need, nor known a more faithful protector than its owner. Amru al-Qais, who was accompanied by his daughter Hind, and his cousin, and had with him five suits of chainmail besides other weapons, immediately set out for the castle, and on the way he and his guide composed a poem in praise of their prospective host. Samaw'al received the poet hospitably, erected a tent of skins for Hind, and received the men into his own hall. After they had been there \\"as long as God willed,\\" Amru al-Qais, wishing to secure the assistance of the emperor Justinian I, asked Samaw'al to give him a letter to the Ghassanid prince Harith ibn Abi Shamir, who might further him on his way. The poet then departed, leaving Hind, his cousin, and his armor in Samaw'al's keeping, and he never came to reclaim them. According to Arabian tradition, while on his homeward journey from Constantinople, he was poisoned by order of Justinian, who had listened to treacherous accusations against him. After Amru al-Qais had left Al-Ablaq, Prince al-Munthir ‚Äîit is not known whether before or after Amru's death‚Äî sent Harith to Samuel ordering him to deliver up the articles deposited with him. Samuel refusing to do so, Harith laid siege to the castle. The besiegers met with no success until one day Harith captured Samuel's son, who, according to the story in the Kitab al-Aghani, was returning from the chase. Harith then called upon the father to choose between giving up the property and witnessing his son's death. Samuel answered that his son had brothers, but that his honor once lost could not be recovered. Harith at once struck off the boy's head before the unhappy father's eyes and then withdrew, perceiving that he could accomplish nothing in the face of such steadfastness. There are a few verses handed down by different Arabian writers in which Samaw'al ibn 'Adiya refers to this deed. A description of the castle al-Ablaq is given by the poet A'sha (Yaqut, i.96), who confuses it with Solomon's Temple. It is related of this poet that, being captured together with other Arabs, he was taken as a prisoner to the castle at Taima, at that time belonging to Samuel's son Shuraih ibn Samaw'al, without his captor's knowing that he was in the company. Waiting until Shuraih was within hearing, A'sha began to recite a poem extolling the deed of his father, and calling on the son to emulate his example by rescuing him (A'sha). Shuraih procured the poet's release, and allowed him to depart, first presenting him with a swift camel. Shuraih himself, his brother Jarid, and Samuel's grandson Sa'ba were all poets.

He is an all-round rider, known for his aggressive style of riding, whose speciality is to pick the right breakaways. He competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 2000 Summer Olympics. He is the cousin of Danish former professional bicycle racer J√∏rgen V. Pedersen. Biography Piil was born in Virum, Copenhagen. He started his career as a track racer, riding six-day races with shifting partners, including the Danish riders Michael Sandst√∏d, Tayeb Braikia, and Jimmi Madsen. In 1997 he signed up for the RDM professional cycling team, getting only a handful of top-ten results in his first year as a pro. He moved to Danish Team Acceptcard in 1998, where he got the first, minor, victory of his career at the GP Skive in 1998. 1999 was his professional breakthrough with many good results, and a meriting win of the USPRO Championship. In 2000, he switched to Team CSC, back then known as Team Memory Card ‚Äì Jack & Jones. His first year at Team CSC wasn't entirely successful, as a crash into a car just before the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo ruined the first four months of his season, though he still managed a few minor results. 2001 was a better season for Piil, as he won the Peace Race and, perhaps most importantly for his later career, finished a 2nd at stage 17 in the 2001 Tour de France. After a 16-man break-away was established after only five kilometres, Piil was one of three riders in the 16-man group who were able to keep the peloton behind them, but Piil found himself beaten by Serge Baguet at the finish line. In 2002 Piil won Paris‚ÄìTours and Danmark Rundt, and once again tried his luck at winning a stage in the 2002 Tour de France. At the 18th stage, Piil was lined up in a favourable position to sprint for the stage win, when his foot jumped out of the toe clip with 250 meters to go, and Piil came in third.CyclingNews.com recap of stage 18. In the 2003 Tour de France, Piil finally got the success he sought. At the 219 kilometres long stage 10, Piil was a part of a nine-man breakaway which ended up in a duel for the stage win between Piil and Fabio Sacchi. As the two riders neared the finishing line, they shook hands on a good final sprint, and Sacchi opened with Piil on the wheel, a position Piil used to his full advantage, sprinting past Sacchi just before the finishing line. In 2004, Piil tried again, and he won the title of the most aggressive rider in the 2004 Tour de France, but didn't get a stage win for his effort. Most of the 2005 season was ruined due to injuries, and Piil was left out of Team CSC's setup for the 2005 Tour de France. Instead, he rode the Vuelta a Espa√±a, where he once again showed his tenacity to attack, and looked in great form until illness forced him to retire from the race. He recuperated in time for the World Cycling Championship where he got the biggest result of the season with a fifth place, behind winner Tom Boonen. In 2006 Jakob Piil did not participate in any of the grand tours, and shortly after being left out of the 2006 Vuelta a Espa√±a team, he wrote a contract with T-Mobile Team.

In the myth, the planet Venus is called Kileken and visits the Earth in the form of a small boy. The boy befriends an old farmer and tends his cattle, the man agreeing to let the boy keep the only thing he has: the secret of his origin. When the man betrays his trust and spies on Kileken, the boy vanishes in a bright light and returns to the heavens. The myth explains why the planet Venus is seen during the morning and evening.

In common with other societies, the Maasai believed Venus to be two separate bodies when seen at morning and in the evening. Kileken was the appearance of the \\"morning star\\".

Hagen was the youngest of the three sons of Gwen Hagen, a visual artist, writer and advertising executive who studied creative writing with Mari Sandoz and enjoyed a successful advertising career as creative director of Exclusively Yours MagazineExclusively Yours and Earl Hagen (an attorney). Hagen began composing prolifically in 1974, when his older brother Kevin gave him a recording and score of Benjamin Britten's Billy Budd. Two years later, at the age of fifteen, he conducted the premiere of his first orchestral work, a recording and score of which came to the attention of Leonard Bernstein, who enthusiastically urged Hagen to attend Juilliard to study with David Diamond.Yale University Oral History of American Music Interview.

Retrieved July 8, 2012. It is \\"notable for its warm lyricism, but his style defies easy categorization. While his works demonstrate fluency with a range of twentieth-century compositional techniques, those procedures are secondary to his exploitation and expansion of the possibilities of tonal harmony, giving his music an immediacy that makes it appealing to a wide spectrum of audiences. His music is broadly eclectic, drawing on a variety of styles as diverse as jazz, Broadway, Latin music, Italian verismo, and soft rock.\\" According to Hagen, \\"Polytonality figures prominently in the major operas as a mechanism for manifesting the interaction between characters.\\" Hagen, asked at one point by Bernstein to complete Marc Blitzstein's opera Sacco and Vanzetti, acknowledges a debt to Blitzstein's music: \\"I find the musical DNA of which it is composed indispensable. Strands of that DNA ‚Äî strict adherence to economy of means, a passion for combining words and music, the belief that music can promote social justice, an abhorrence of pretension ‚Äî are woven contrapuntally, inextricably, into the music that I compose, and have been, nearly from the start.\\" Hagen's vocal music is described in The New Grove as \\"the cornerstone of his compositional output.\\" He has remarked, \\"I love voices and I like singers, and along with the intersection of loving music and words and singers, I adore the process of composing and going through the production of musical theater. There is the communion of people coming together to commit to undertaking a work of art that is larger than any of us.\\" \\"Using his gift for composing vocal lines, [Hagen] produces songs that flow lyrically and illuminate texts with unerring musical and dramatic aim. His scores are full of extensive markings, requiring singers to use variety of tone color to achieve the emotions inherent in the texts.\\" His operas embrace a particularly broad stylistic spectrum. In Shining Brow \\"Hagen's baseline idiom,\\" writes Tom Strini, \\"seems to be modernist-expressionist, tonal but freely dissonant. He sets all sorts of influences, from barbershop to ticky-tick dance music against that idiom, to underscore character and crystallize the period (1903‚Äì'14).\\" In Vera of Las Vegas, Hagen, writes Robert Thicknesse, \\"blends idioms ‚Äì neo-Gershwin, jazz, soft rock, Broadway ‚Äì with soaring melodies that send the characters looping off in arias of self-revelation.\\"Thicknesse, Robert. \\"Vera of Las Vegas\\", The Times.

Daron is music.\\" The NATS Journal of Singing has described Hagen as \\"the finest American composer of vocal music in his generation.\\" Hagen's debut opera Shining Brow premiered in 1993 to universally glowing reviews in the international press. When the Buffalo Philharmonic released the first recording on Naxos in 2009, David Patrick Sterns noted in The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"the ceaselessly inventive score hooks you early on, easily embracing a wide range of predominantly tonal modes of expression, from barbershop quartet to Der Rosenkavalier quotations. The music's theatrical timing and naturalistic sense of language ‚Äì so problematic in other contemporary operas ‚Äì feels effortlessly right. Dramatically speaking, the portrayal of the great architect is so unflinching that Wright (played with many layers of irony by the excellent Robert Orth) borders on being too unsympathetic to carry this sizable, two-act opera. Particularly effective is the musical creepiness that sets in as Wright's high-ego world grows refracted from reality.\\". Hagen's 2010 opera Amelia premiered to positive reviews in The New York Times, Financial Times, Times of London, Seattle Times, The Washington Post, and Opera Magazine, among others. Heidi Waleson in The Wall Street Journal described the work as \\"both highly original and gripping. ... Amelia is a modern opera with traditional values ... Mr. Hagen's restless, questioning music never loses its heart.\\" Ivan Katz, in The Huffington Post, wrote \\"Hagen's score is well-composed and, in many respects, a work of genius. He tends to write in a more facile manner for the women, but his writing for the men (especially tenor William Burden) is complex and highly effective.\\" Anthony Tommasini in The New York Times noted that \\"the opera is earnest and original, if heavy-handed and melodramatic. [It is] a serious, heartfelt and unusual work. However, there is too much lyricism and no break in the orchestral richness.\\" His 2013 opera, A Woman in Morocco, deals with the issue of human trafficking. A \\"film noir, verismo, cin√©ma v√©rit√©\\". While in its college workshop production at the University of Texas, the characters were felt by one graduate student to \\"come across as flat and largely unsympathetic and so frustratingly spineless that it's hard to care about them,\\" when the work was given its professional premiere in spring 2015 under Hagen's direction by Kentucky Opera, professional critics noted that \\"[its] complex score works to underline issues with leitmotifs, musical cues assigned to different characters, and music that never settles or rests. When singers get soaring arias, they emerge naturally from this intricate texture. Hagen has a gift for writing sensually rich tunes and uses this skill to release the music at important moments.\\" Most of the universally positive reviews touched approvingly on the opera's subject matter: > Will [a new opera] find a connection with tradition while creating something > fresh and timely?

The Scaredies performed their last ever live show in Brisbane in May 2011, until a one-off benefit gig in Melbourne in October 2016. They reunited for a 3-day stint at the Brisbane Powerhouse on 8 to 10 March 2019. History In 1987 Fleming joined \\"Four Chairs No Waiting\\", an a cappella group comprising David Holmes, Ramsey Collins and Rusty Berther. The group performed aboard a Fairstar cruise, as well as touring RSL clubs around Sydney. They performed during most of Expo 88 in Brisbane. In 1989 Berther and Fleming joined \\"The Phones\\", one of Australia's top a cappella groups, which boasted members such as Paul Keelan, Michael Dalton and Reg Ellery. Performing at comedy and cabaret venues around Australia, the group also held a regular TV spot on Channel 7's Bert Newton Show. Following the group's break-up in 1990, Fleming and Berther teamed up and moved away from a cappella to concentrate on musical comedy routines. The duo had much success touring Australia, as well as more than 20 tours of festivals and college campuses in North America, and three tours of the UK in 1997, 1998 and 2001. The name \\"Scared Weird Little Guys\\" comes from a line in the Al Pacino movie Cruising. The Scaredies announced on 1 August 2010 that the act would be coming to an end after 21 years. They embarked on a national farewell tour named 'Enough Already', which ran until mid-2011. The duo released a final CD entitled Enough Already which included recordings from their Mount Gambier, Horsham and Warrnambool shows. The Scaredies did in excess of 4,600 live gigs, performing their final show in Brisbane on 22 May 2011. Rusty Berther continues to perform with another group, \\"Rusty and Another Guy\\", whose style is similar to the Scaredies. They mostly perform for private events and corporate functions.

The city Strabo does not mention a town of Corycus, but reports a promontory so called at the location, but a town Corycus is mentioned by Livy (xxxiii. 20), and by Pliny (v. 27), and Pomponius Mela (i. 13), and Stephanus of Byzantium (s. v. ŒöœéœÅœÖŒ∫ŒøœÇ). In antiquity, Corycus was an important harbor and commercial town. It was the port of Seleucia, where, in 191 BCE, the fleet of Antiochus the Great was defeated by the Romans. In the Roman times it preserved its ancient laws; the emperors usually kept a fleet there to watch over the pirates. Corycus was also a mint in antiquity and some of its coins survive. Corycus was controlled by the Byzantine Empire. Justinian I restored the public baths and a hospital. The admiral Eustathios Kymineianos re-fortified the island on the orders of Alexios I Komnenos at the beginning of the 12th century, adding a supplementary castle on a small island. This castle was later called \\"maidens castle\\", because it was told that a king held his daughter here in captivity until she was killed by a venomous snake. It was prophesied she would die by a snake bite. So she was taken to the sea castle to protect her, but a serpent was taken by basket to the castle, she was bitten and died. Corycus was conquered by the Armenians soon after it was rebuilt by the Byzantines. Until the mid-14th century the Armenians held both the mainland and island castles, which guarded this strategic port for the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Simon, the Baron of Ko≈ïikos, attended the coronation of King Levon I in 1198/99. Subsequent Armenian nobles maintained authority in the area (with a few brief interruptions) until 1360, when Peter I, the King of Cyprus, removed the Mamelukes and assumed suzerainty. In the late 14th century it fell again to the Turks. From 1448 or 1454 it belonged alternately to the Karamanids, the Egyptians, the Karamanids a second time, and finally to the Ottoman Empire. Archaeological surveys published in 1982 and 1987 found that the Armenians maintained (with occasional repairs) the mainland castle‚Äôs simple Byzantine plan with its rectangular double walls, square towers, and two chapels, all of which were built with masonry taken from the nearby late antique city. The only original Armenian construction is one small chapel.Edwards, Robert W., ‚ÄúEcclesiastical Architecture in the Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: First Report, Dumbarton Oaks Papers 36, 1982, pp.173-75, pls.38-42. Kizkalesi (castle) on the island has the extensive remains of Armenian rebuilding. The island was once connected to the mainland fort by a breakwater. Views of the Fortress and ruins of the town (c. 1860) The ruins of the city are extensive. Among them are a triumphal arch, a necropolis with a beautiful Christian tomb, sarcophagi, etc. The two medieval castles, one on the shore, the other in an islet, connected by a ruined pier, are partially preserved; the former was reputed impregnable. The walls of the castle on the mainland contain many pieces of columns; and a mole of great unhewn rocks projects from one angle of the fortress about a hundred yards across the bay. Three churches are also found, one decorated with frescoes. The walls of the ancient city may still be traced, and there appear to be sufficient remains to invite a careful examination of the spot. Bishopric The city figures in the Synecdemus of Hierocles, and in a Notitia Episcopatuum of about 840.Sim√©on Vailh√©, \\"Corycus\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1908) The bishopric of Corycus was a suffragan of Tarsus, the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia Prima, to which Corycus belonged. Of the bishops of the see, Germanus was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381; Sallustius took part in the Council of Ephesus in 431John Fulton, Index Canonum: The Greek Text, an English Translation, and a Complete Digest of the Entire Code of Canon Law of the Undivided Primitive Church (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 16 Sep 2014 page 151. and a synod held in Tarsus in 434, and was represented at the Council of Chalcedon by his metropolitan bishop Theodorus, who signed the acts of the council on his behalf; Archelaus went to a synod called by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople in 536; Cyprianus was at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553; and Ioannes participated in the Third Council of Constantinople in 680 and the Trullan Council in 692. In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, Corycus became the seat of Latin Church bishops, one of whom, named Gerardus, took part in a council at Antioch in 1136.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 879-882Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 435Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, vol. 1 , p. 210; vol. 6, pp. 184‚Äì185H.

Corycian Cave In the Corycian Cave (now Cennet ve Cehennem), 20 stadia inland, says Strabo, the best crocus (saffron) grows. He describes this cave as a great hollow, of a circular form, surrounded by a margin of rock, on all sides of a considerable height; on descending into this cavity, the ground is found to be uneven and generally rocky, and it is filled with shrubs, both evergreen and cultivated; in some parts the saffron is cultivated: there is also a cave here which contains a large source, which pours forth a river of pure, pellucid water, but it immediately sinks into the earth, and flowing underground enters the sea: they call it the Bitter Water. Pomponius Mela (i.13) has a long description of the same place apparently from the same authority that Strabo followed, but more embellished. This place is probably on the top of the mountain above Corycus. This place is famed in Greek mythology. It is the Cilician cave of Pindar (Pythian Ode i. 31), and of Aeschylus (Prom. Vinct. 350), and it is the lair of Zeus' fiercest opponent, the monster Typhon or Typhoeus.

From 2001 to 2006 they were lead by Mike Peters of the Alarm and Kirk Brandon, of Spear of Destiny, with a varying cast of musicians. Since 2015, they split into two bands, one lead by Peters called the Jack Tars, and another lead by Brandon keeping the Dead Men Walking name. Career The band started in 2001, with Brandon and Peters being joined by Pete Wylie (Wah!) and Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols) for the first live album. For the second album, Wylie was replaced by Billy Duffy (The Cult) and a drummer was added in Slim Jim Phantom (Stray Cats). For the third album, Duffy was replaced by Bruce Watson (Big Country). For the fourth and fifth albums, Watson dropped out and Matlock was replaced by Captain Sensible (The Damned) on bass. The Peters/Brandon/Sensible/Phantom line-up recorded an original album in 2008, but it was never released as there were disagreements between the band members. Eventually Peters revived the band in 2014 with Chris Cheney (The Living End) replacing Brandon. This line- up produced the first album of original material by the band, Easy Piracy, the previous releases having all been live albums. Brandon also formed a new version of the band, with Jake Burns (Stiff Little Fingers) and Dave Ruffy and John \\"Segs\\" Jennings (both of Ruts DC). After a name dispute, Brandon kept the name and Peters renamed his band as the Jack Tars.

This image shows 7 of them; the others are symmetric with respect to 90¬∞ rotations through the origin and reflections through the two blue axes. In mathematics, a bitangent to a curve C is a line L that touches C in two distinct points P and Q and that has the same direction as C at these points. That is, L is a tangent line at P and at Q. Bitangents of algebraic curves In general, an algebraic curve will have infinitely many secant lines, but only finitely many bitangents. B√©zout's theorem implies that a plane curve with a bitangent must have degree at least 4. The case of the 28 bitangents of a quartic was a celebrated piece of geometry of the nineteenth century, a relationship being shown to the 27 lines on the cubic surface. Bitangents of polygons The four bitangents of two disjoint convex polygons may be found efficiently by an algorithm based on binary search in which one maintains a binary search pointer into the lists of edges of each polygon and moves one of the pointers left or right at each steps depending on where the tangent lines to the edges at the two pointers cross each other. This bitangent calculation is a key subroutine in data structures for maintaining convex hulls dynamically . describe an algorithm for efficiently listing all bitangent line segments that do not cross any of the other curves in a system of multiple disjoint convex curves, using a technique based on pseudotriangulation. Bitangents may be used to speed up the visibility graph approach to solving the Euclidean shortest path problem: the shortest path among a collection of polygonal obstacles may only enter or leave the boundary of an obstacle along one of its bitangents, so the shortest path can be found by applying Dijkstra's algorithm to a subgraph of the visibility graph formed by the visibility edges that lie on bitangent lines . Related concepts A bitangent differs from a secant line in that a secant line may cross the curve at the two points it intersects it. One can also consider bitangents that are not lines; for instance, the symmetry set of a curve is the locus of centers of circles that are tangent to the curve in two points. Bitangents to pairs of circles figure prominently in Jakob Steiner's 1826 construction of the Malfatti circles, in the belt problem of calculating the length of a belt connecting two pulleys, in Casey's theorem characterizing sets of four circles with a common tangent circle, and in Monge's theorem on the collinearity of intersection points of certain bitangents.

Basti city is the district headquarters. In the freedom struggle of 1857, about 250 martyrs of Amorha State were hanged by the British Government from peepal trees located at Chhawani.  Origin of name and history  Basti came from the original name Vasisthi. The sage Vasishtha's ashram was situated in this area. Sher Shah Suri made a well and a sarai here and hence receiving the name. In 1801, the town Basti became a tehsil headquarter, and in 1865, it was chosen as the headquarters of the newly established Basti district of Gorakhpur Commissionary. Amorha Khas is a historical place situated at a distance of 41 km from the district headquarters. Its old name is Amorha, and it was once a province (state) of Raja Zalim Singh. Raja Zalim Singh's Mahal is here, old wall of mahal is still there with the mark of a bullet used by the English. The famous temple Ramrekha Mandir is here. Ramrekha Temple is one of the most ancient Hindu Mandir of Lord Ram and Goddess Sita. Lord Shri Ram stayed here for one day during his journey of Janakpur-Ayodhya. Lord Shri Rama and Sita with Lakshmana journeyed towards Ayodhya by the road called Ram Janki Marg (present-day State Highway 72) near Chhawani. Geography The district lies between the parallels of 26¬∞ 23' and 27¬∞ 30' North Latitude and 82¬∞ 17' and 83¬∞ 20' East longitude. Its maximum length from north to south is about 75 km. and breadth from east to west about 70 km. The district lies between newly created district Sant Kabir Nagar on the east and Gonda on the west on the south, the Ghaghra river near Amorha Khas previously known as Amorha Province or State of Raja Zalim Singh separates it from the Faizabad and newly created district Ambedkar Nagar. On the north it is bounded by district Sidharth Nagar.  Demographics  According to the 2011 census, Basti district had a population of 2,464,464, of which only 5.6% lived in urban areas.

There is a daily Intercity express between Gorakhpur, Basti, Gonda, and Lucknow. National Highway 28, a part of the East West Corridor project of Government of India and NHAI, also passes through Basti.  Flora and fauna  The forest cover of the district has dwindled with increasing use of land for agriculture. There are areas with high prevalence of mango (Mangifera indica), mahua (Madhuca longifolia), sal (Shorea robusta), and bamboo (Bambusa arundinacea) trees. Some of the wild animals of the district are the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), antelok (Anelok cervicapra), pig (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus), jackal (Conis aureus), fox (Vulpes bengalensis), hare (Lepus ruficandatus), monkey (Macaca mulatta), wild cat (Felis bengalensis) and the porcupine (Hystric leucura). Several species of game birds are also seen, including the peafowl (Pavo cristatus), the black partridge (Frencolinus francolinus) and the gray partridge (Francalinus pondicervanus). A number of migratory water fowls visit the water bodies of the district in winter, such as the goose (Anser anser), common teal (Anas crecca), red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), white-eyed pochard (Aythya rufa) and the wigeon (Mareca penelope). The cobra (Naja naja), krait (Bungarus caeruleus), and rat-snake (Ptyas mucosus) are commonly found.

In this area lives a population of Greek tortoise. Its course has been for the most part covered since ancient times, and was only visible outside the ancient walls in the district of Kerameikos. The river was rediscovered during the excavations for the Athens Metro subway in the late 1990s, and its waters caused considerable technical problems at times. Because of the Metro works, its seasonal flow through the Kerameikos cemetery was disrupted, as the waters were apparently and inadvertently redirected to some new underground path. As of April 2007, the stream of the river, as it flows through Monastiraki Square, has been excavated. It had been covered with a brickwork tunnel since classical times, and the brickwork had been repaired at least twice, in the imperial Roman and early Byzantine eras. The brick tunnel now forms part of a small open-air museum at Monastiraki Square, next to the Metro station, and the waters of the Eridanos are from inside the tunnel.

Culcheth is primarily residential, with a large village green at its heart where the annual Community Day is held. The old railway line is now known as Culcheth Linear Park. History On Saxon maps showing South Lancashire the village is marked as \\"Calchuth\\" or \\"Celchyth.\\" On these very early maps and deeds the name is also written as \\"Kilcheth\\", \\"Kylchith\\" and \\"Kilshaw.\\" It is derived from the British language \\"cil\\" and \\"coed\\", 'at the edge of a wood,' 'black wood' or 'retreat in a wood'. Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names There are a few examples of this name-formation today, such as the Welsh name for Caldicot, Monmouthshire, Wales is \\"Cil-y-coed\\", and possibly Culgaith, Cumbria. The first element in the name might also be *c«ñl, meaning 'narrow'. However, another claim is that the name is of Norman origin, but all four families of French descent which settled in the area took local names, such as de Culcheth, de Kenyon, de Risley and de Holcroft. The area is known to have been established before or around the time of the Norman conquest, from its mention in the Domesday Book. Culcheth Hall was latterly owned by the Withington family until its demolition after the Second World War.www.culcheth.org The infamous Colonel Thomas Blood, who nearly succeeded in stealing the Crown Jewels, was married at Winwick, and lived for a while at Holcroft Hall (on Holcroft Lane, Culcheth). The Culcheth Laboratories were established in 1950, in the south-west of the village. Until 1974, Culcheth was in the Golborne Urban District in Lancashire but was moved into the Borough of Warrington in Cheshire by the local government reorganisation. On 1 April 1998, the Warrington Unitary Authority was created of which Culcheth is a part. Governance and politics Culcheth and Glazebury Parish Council operates as part of the Warrington Borough Council, covering the matters the borough has delegated to the parish councils within Warrington. Following the 2016 local elections, Culcheth and Glazebury Parish Council comprises 6 Labour councillors and 4 Conservatives. Culcheth (along with its neighbouring villages Glazebury and Croft) form the Warrington Borough Council ward of Culcheth, Glazebury and Croft. In the 2016 elections, the Labour Party took all three seats from this ward.http://culcheth.org.uk/blog/electionresults2016 The ward forms part of the Warrington North parliamentary constituency, which is been represented by Labour MP Charlotte Nichols since 2019. Nichols replaced Helen Jones as MP, who lives in the village centre with her family. At the 2012 municipal elections, Chris Vobe (son of Helen Jones MP) became the first Labour Party Councillor for Culcheth since the mid-1990s, taking his seat on Warrington Borough Council at the Town Hall on 14 May 2012, with Culcheth having been represented on Warrington Borough Council by three Conservative councillors from 1996 to 2012. Chris Vobe stood down from his position in 2016. Cheshire Constabulary has established a police community base in Culcheth Scout Centre in agreement with the local scout group. This innovation allows local police officers to spend more time in the community and makes it easier for people to contact them. Without this arrangement police officers would have to be based at Warrington Police Station, which is several miles away from their 'beat'. Transport =Road= One of the reasons for Culcheth's popularity as a place to live is its proximity to the main road links into Warrington (A574), and the M62 motorway into Liverpool and Manchester. It is also accessible via Common Lane (the B5207 from Lowton), linking to the A580 East Lancashire Road, and Holcroft Lane (the B5212) which meets the A57 Warrington-Manchester road near Warburton Toll Bridge. =Bus= Warrington's Own Buses operate two bus services between Warrington town centre and Leigh via the village centre. A combined 30-minute frequency is provided by services 19 and 28/28A on Monday to Saturday daytimes, with a combined 30-minute frequency on Sundays and an hourly 28E service Monday to Saturday evening. The two services operate via the same route to Leigh, but the route to Warrington alternates between Croft/Winwick (service 19)http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/tables_pdf/19%20TT.pdf and Birchwood/Padgate (service 28/28A).http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/tables_pdf/386%20586%20TT.pdf =Rail= Between 1884 and 1964, Culcheth was served by two railway stations on the Great Central Railway (GCR) line from Manchester Central between Glazebrook and Wigan Central railway station. These have been turned into Culcheth Linear Park, with the park's HQ situated on top of Culcheth station's foundations. The nearest operating railway stations are at Birchwood and Glazebrook, both on the line from Liverpool Lime Street to Manchester Piccadilly. Economy The science and business parks at nearby Birchwood employ around 5,000 people. The Taylor Industrial Estate / Taylor Business ParkWarrington Office Business Park provides rented premises and facilities to many small and medium-sized businesses on the outskirts of the village on the road between Culcheth and Risley. There are two supermarkets in the village centre, the Co-Op and Sainsbury's, as well as a wide range of smaller specialist shops. There is also CPS shopping centre which is located in the centre of Culcheth village, and has been home to a wide variety of small independent shops for more than 50 years. There are three pubs in Culcheth: the Cherry Tree, the Culcheth Arms (formerly Harrow Inn) and the Pack Horse. Nearby Glazebury also has several pubs: the Raven Inn (now closed), the Glazebury (formerly Chat Moss Hotel), the Grey Horse, the Comfortable Gill and the George and Dragon. Partridge Lakes Fishery on Glaziers Lane is a recreational coarse fishery with a lakeside dog friendly cafe. Bent's Garden Centre, located on the outskirts of Glazebury in the grounds of the former Hurst Hall, is a large upmarket enterprise which also has a restaurant. Religion Culcheth has four churches: Newchurch Parish Church, Culcheth Methodist Church, Culcheth Christian Fellowship, Hob Hey Lane and the Grace Fellowship Church which meets at Culcheth High School. The nearest Roman Catholic church is St Lewis's, which is in the nearby village of Croft. Education The village is well provided with schools. Culcheth High School opened in 1931, and received a 'good' rating by Ofsted (2014), with 'The Class of 2013' attaining the best results the school has produced so far, with 79% of pupils attaining 5 A*-C GCSEs including English and Maths. The school also had a successful sixth form which closed in 2014. The school was picked as Warrington's 'Pathfinder' school under the now-defunct 'Building Schools for the Future' scheme, and the brand new school buildings opened in July 2010. The old school buildings were demolished to make way for the new school playing fields. The village also has three primary schools: Twiss Green Community Primary School (rated \\"outstanding\\" by OFSTED), Culcheth Community Primary School and Newchurch Community Primary School. Sport Leigh Golf Club is located to the north of Culcheth. The Culcheth Sports Club (formerly the Daten) provides a wide range of sports facilities such as table tennis, cricket, tennis, croquet and bowls. The Sports Club also has teams in various leagues in different sports, including numerous table tennis teams, a football team, a tennis league and a croquet team. Culcheth Eagles ARLFC is a successful rugby league team, which runs many youth teams and an open age team, which all compete in the North West Counties leagues. FC Culcheth Sports is a newly established football club in the village with teams in the Wigan and District Amateur League and the Warrington Sunday League. Culture and community The Culcheth and Glazebury Christmas Market (formerly Victorian Day) is a popular village event held in late November each year with gazebos and market stalls complementing the Gift and Craft Fayres taking place in the Parish and Methodist Halls. The whole event is crowned by carols and the Christmas light switch-on at the village green.

His major works are the epic poem Iohannis and the panegyric In laudem Iustini minoris. Corippus was probably the last important Latin author of Late Antiquity. Biography He was a native of Africa, and in one of the manuscripts is called grammaticus (teacher). He has sometimes been identified, but on insufficient grounds, with Cresconius Africanus, a Catholic bishop (7th century), author of a Concordia Canonum, or collection of the laws of the church. Nothing is known of Corippus beyond what is contained in his own poems. He appears to have held the office of tribune or notary (scriniarius) under Anastasius, imperial treasurer and chamberlain of Justinian I, at the end of whose reign he left Africa for Constantinople, apparently in consequence of having lost his property during the Vandalic War and the subsequent Moorish revolts. Works =Iohannis= He was the author of two poems, of considerable importance for the history of the times. One of these, Iohannis (\\"Tale of John\\") or De bellis Libycis (\\"On the Libyan war\\"), the earlier of the two, was not discovered till the beginning of the 19th century. It was dedicated to the nobles of Carthage and relates the overthrow of the Moors by John Troglita, magister militum of Africa in a series of battles that lasted until 548. Iohannis is in eight books (the last is unfinished) and contains about 5000 hexameters. The narrative commences with the despatch of John to the theatre of war by Justinian, and ends with the decisive victory near Carthage (548). Although Johannes Cuspinianus in his De Caesaribus et Imperatoribus professed to have seen a manuscript of it in the library at Buda (destroyed by Suleiman I in 1527), it was not till 1814 that it was discovered at Milan by Cardinal Mazzucchelli, librarian of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, from the codex Trivultianus (in the Biblioteca Trivulziana, the library of the marchesi Trivulzi), the only manuscript of the Johannis extant. The Johannis \\"is not only a valuable historic source but a work of marked poetic merit.\\"M.L.W. Laistner, Thought and Letters in Western Europe (Cornell: University Press, 1957), p. 113. It provides a description of the land and people of Late Roman Africa, which conscientiously records the impressions of an intelligent native observer; many of his statements as to manners and customs are confirmed both by independent ancient authorities (such as Procopius) and by our knowledge of the modern Berbers. =In laudem Iustini minoris= The other poem, In laudem Iustini minoris (\\"In praise of the younger Justin\\"), in four books, contains the death of Justinian, the coronation of his successor Justin II (November 13, 565); and the early events of his reign. It is preceded by a preface, and a short and fulsome panegyric on Anastasius, the poet's patron. The work was published at Antwerp in 1581 by Michael Ruyz Azagra, secretary to Emperor Rudolf II, from a ninth- or tenth- century manuscript. Style and influences Virgil, Lucan, and Claudian were the poet's chief models. In laudem Iustini minoris, which was written when he was advanced in years, although marred by a \\"Byzantine\\" servility and gross flattery of a by no means worthy object, throws much light upon Late Roman court ceremony, as in the account of the accession of Justin and the reception of the embassy of the Avars. On the whole the language and metre of Corippus, considering the age in which he lived and the fact that he was not a native Italian, is remarkably pure. That he was a Christian is rendered probable by negative indications, such as the absence of all the usual mythological accessories of an epic poem, positive allusions to texts of Scripture, and a highly orthodox passage (In laudem Iustini minoris iv. 294 ff).

J., Bishop-Kay, C., Kroonenberg, S. B., 2002. The Late Cenozoic Eridanos delta system in the southern North Sea Basin: a climate signal in sediment supply? Basin Research, 13: 293‚Äì312. Its river system was better known as the \\"Baltic River System\\".Bijlsma, S., 1981. Fluvial sedimentation from the Fennoscandian area into the North-West European Basin during the Late Cenozoic. Geologie en Mijnbouw, 60: 337‚Äì345.Gibbard, P. L., 1988. The history of the great northwest European rivers during the past three million years. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, B.318: 559‚Äì602. The Eridanos began about 40 million years ago in the Eocene. By about 12 million years ago in the Miocene, the Eridanos had reached the North Sea area, where sediments carried by the river built an immense delta. The Eridanos disappeared in the early Middle Pleistocene, about 1 million years ago, when the Ice Age glaciers excavated the Baltic Sea bed. The Neogene uplift of the South Swedish Dome deflected Eridanos river from its original path across south-central Sweden into a course south of Sweden in the Pliocene. Description The geological Eridanos was most important during the Baventian Stage about two million years ago in the late early Pleistocene, when it was about long, a little shorter than the modern Danube. It began in Lapland, and then flowed through the area of the modern-day Gulf of Bothnia and Baltic Sea to western Europe, where it had an immense delta, which, it is reckoned, was comparable in size to that of the current-day Amazon River. Eridanos deposits in the Netherlands dating from the late Early Pleistocene Menapian glacial stage show the presence of Scandinavian erratic boulders (\\"Hattem Layers\\").Zandstra, J. G., 1971. Geologisch onderzoek in de stuwwal van de Oostelijke Veluwe bij Hattem en Wapenveld. Mededelingen Rijks Geologische Dienst, NS 22: 215‚Äì260. These erratics are supposed to be transported by fluvial drift ice and are the first indicators in this part of the North Sea Basin of a major glaciation in the Scandinavian mountains. Most probably the reshaping of the Eridanos source areas in the Scandinavian mountains had already started during this glacial stage. During the succeeding Bavel Interglacial the fluvial system reached its largest size, but sedimentation rates already dropped at that time. The repeated buildup of the Scandinavian ice cap during successive ice ages after this interglacial resulted in a complete destruction of the source area, decapitating the fluvial system, and in the birth of a glacially excavated area surrounding the Scandinavian mountainous areas, in which region the Baltic Sea would later came into existence. During the first glacial stage of the Cromerian Complex, about 0.7 Ma ago, sedimentation in the Netherlands of the Baltic River System came to an end, indicating the end of the Eridanos. Remnants of the Eridanos are found all through northern Europe, from the current North Sea and the Netherlands at its western end to sediments in northern Lapland. Eridanos sediments in the Netherlands and the neighbouring North Sea can be recognized by a high content of transparent blue-grey, lightgrey, and colorless quartz in the sand, as well as in the gravel fractions. The color of the mainly coarse sands is grey-white, and in the Netherlands these deposits are, therefore, known as the White Sands (\\"Witte Zanden\\"). During the Early Pleistocene in the Netherlands fluvial deposits of eastern provenance mix with fluvial deposits of the river Rhine. At that time the Rhine was far less important than the Eridanos. Sediment mixing can be recognized by the presence of a high proportion of \\"milky quartz\\" that is highly characteristic of sands and gravels deposited by the river Rhine. After the disappearance of the Eridanos, the river Rhine is left as the most important river in this part of the North Sea Basin.

Formal definition A birational invariant is a quantity or object that is well-defined on a birational equivalence class of algebraic varieties. In other words, it depends only on the function field of the variety. Examples The first example is given by the grounding work of Riemann himself: in his thesis, he shows that one can define a Riemann surface to each algebraic curve; every Riemann surface comes from an algebraic curve, well defined up to birational equivalence and two birational equivalent curves give the same surface. Therefore, the Riemann surface, or more simply its genus is a birational invariant. A more complicated example is given by Hodge theory: in the case of an algebraic surface, the Hodge numbers h0,1 and h0,2 of a non-singular projective complex surface are birational invariants. The Hodge number h1,1 is not, since the process of blowing up a point to a curve on the surface can augment it. References *.

The population at the 2011 census was 1,169. Its name is derived from ‚ÄúNorlegh‚Äù, which means ‚Äúnorth clearing‚Äù. History In the Domesday Book, Norley was included under the manor of Kingsley. During the reign of Henry III the manor of Norley was granted to Richard de Kingsleigh, and Roger de Norley was granted land within the manor. Later the area was dominated by two estates, Norley Hall and Norley Bank. =Norley Hall= The first Norley Hall was built at the beginning of the 15th century and the present hall dates from 1782 when it was built by William Hall. In the 19th century the hall was bought by the Woodhouse family of Liverpool. It was later occupied by Charles F. Bell and then the Dronsfield family. It has now been divided into apartments. =Norley Bank= Norley Bank was built by James Croxton in the 18th century and later acquired by Rev. Rowland Egerton. His eldest son was Rowland Egerton-Warburton who inherited the Arley and Warburton estates, and who built the present Arley Hall. Hon. Arthur Lascelles bought the house in about 1852 and it remained in private ownership until in the Second World War when it was used as a British Red Cross hospital. In 1953 it was bought by Liverpool Corporation with the intention of converting it into an approved school, but this did not materialise and in 1957 it was sold and demolished. Geography Norley lies in rural farmland to the north of Delamere Forest and is connected to the surrounding villages by unclassified roads. To the northwest is Kingsley, to the north Crowton, and to the east are Cuddington and Sandiway. Landmarks The Church of St John the Evangelist stands to the northwest of the village. It is a Grade II* listed building dating from 1879 which was designed by J. Loughborough Pearson. In the churchyard is a monument to the Woodhouse family which is listed Grade II. The other Grade-II-listed building in the village is Norley Hall and its adjoining farm. The public house in the village is the Tiger's Head. This was originally a farmhouse and opened as a beerhouse in 1840. There's also a shop called the stores that services the local area. Education Norley Church of England School was founded in 1836 as a Sunday school and became a day school in 1844. It was paid for by Samuel Woodhouse of Norley Hall and later supported by the Lascelles family of Norley Bank. In 1989 it was replaced by Norley Church of England County Primary School in Hough Lane.

Diagonals The six lines of a complete quadrangle meet in pairs to form three additional points called the diagonal points of the quadrangle. Similarly, among the six points of a complete quadrilateral there are three pairs of points that are not already connected by lines; the line segments connecting these pairs are called diagonals. Due to the discovery of the Fano plane, a finite geometry in which the diagonal points of a complete quadrangle are collinear, some authors have augmented the axioms of projective geometry with Fano's axiom that the diagonal points are not collinear,; . while others have been less restrictive. A set of contracted expressions for the parts of a complete quadrangle were introduced by G. B. Halsted: He calls the vertices of the quadrangle dots, and the diagonal points he calls codots. The lines of the projective space are called straights, and in the quadrangle they are called connectors. The \\"diagonal lines\\" of Coxeter are called opposite connectors by Halsted. Opposite connectors cross at a codot. The configuration of the complete quadrangle is a tetrastim.G. B. Halsted (1906) Synthetic Projective Geometry, page 14 These terms were never widely accepted and are only of historical interest. Projective properties KLMN is a complete quadrangle; D is the projective harmonic conjugate of C with respect to A and B. As systems of points and lines in which all points belong to the same number of lines and all lines contain the same number of points, the complete quadrangle and the complete quadrilateral both form projective configurations; in the notation of projective configurations, the complete quadrangle is written as (4362) and the complete quadrilateral is written (6243), where the numbers in this notation refer to the numbers of points, lines per point, lines, and points per line of the configuration. The projective dual of a complete quadrangle is a complete quadrilateral, and vice versa. For any two complete quadrangles, or any two complete quadrilaterals, there is a unique projective transformation taking one of the two configurations into the other. Karl von Staudt reformed mathematical foundations in 1847 with the complete quadrangle when he noted that a \\"harmonic property\\" could be based on concomitants of the quadrangle: When each pair of opposite sides of the quadrangle intersect on a line, then the diagonals intersect the line at projective harmonic conjugate positions. The four points on the line deriving from the sides and diagonals of the quadrangle are called a harmonic range. Through perspectivity and projectivity, the harmonic property is stable. Developments of modern geometry and algebra note the influence of von Staudt on Mario Pieri and Felix Klein . Euclidean properties In the Euclidean plane, the four lines of a complete quadrilateral must not include any pairs of parallel lines, so that every pair of lines has a crossing point. describes several additional properties of complete quadrilaterals that involve metric properties of the Euclidean plane, rather than being purely projective. The midpoints of the diagonals are collinear, and (as proved by Isaac Newton) also collinear with the center of a conic that is tangent to all four lines of the quadrilateral. Any three of the lines of the quadrilateral form the sides of a triangle; the orthocenters of the four triangles formed in this way lie on a second line, perpendicular to the one through the midpoints. The circumcircles of these same four triangles meet in a point. In addition, the three circles having the diagonals as diameters belong to a common pencil of circlesWells writes incorrectly that the three circles meet in a pair of points, but, as can be seen in Alexander Bogomolny's animation of the same results, the pencil can be hyperbolic instead of elliptic, in which case the circles do not intersect. the axis of which is the line through the orthocenters. The polar circles of the triangles of a complete quadrilateral form a coaxal system.Johnson, Roger A., Advanced Euclidean Geometry, Dover Publications, 2007 (orig. 1960).

It is the headquarters of Azamgarh division, which consists of Ballia, Mau and Azamgarh districts. Azamgarh is situated on the bank of Tamsa River (Tons). It is located east of the state capital Lucknow. History Azamgarh, one of the easternmost districts(a district in Purvanchal sub-region) of Uttar Pradesh, once formed a part of the ancient Kosala kingdom, except its north-eastern part. Azamgarh is also known as the land of the sage Durvasa whose ashram was located in Phulpur tehsil, near the confluence of Tamsa and Majhuee rivers, north of the Phulpur. The district is named after its headquarters town, Azamgarh, which was founded in 1665 by Azam, son of Vikramajit. Vikramajit was a descendant of Gautam Rajputs of Mehnagar in Pargana Nizamabad who like some of his predecessors had embraced the faith of Islam. He had a Muslim wife who bore him two sons Azam and Azmat. While Azam gave his name to the town of Azamgarh, and the fort, Azmat constructed the fort and settled the bazaar of Azmatgarh pargana Sagri. After the attack of Chabile Ram, Azmat Khan fled northwards followed by the interior forces. He attempted to cross the Ghaghra into Gorakhpur, but the people on the other side opposed his landing, and he was either shot in mid stream or was drowned in attempting to escape by swimming. In 1688 A.D. during Azmat's lifetime, his eldest son Ekram took part in the management of the state, and after Azam's death he was perhaps left in possession together with Mohhabat, another son. The remaining two sons were taken away and for a time detained as hostages for their brothers' 'good behaviour'. The successor of Ikram finally confirmed the title of his family to the Jamidari. Ikram left no heirs and was succeeded by Iradat, son of Mohhabat. But the real ruler all along had been Mohhabat, and after Ikram's death, he continued to rule in his son's name.  Geography  Azamgarh has an average elevation of 64 metres (209 feet). The district consists of a series of parallel ridges, whose summits are depressed into beds or hollows, along which the rivers flow; while between the ridges are low-lying rice lands, interspersed with numerous natural reservoirs.

It is also known as land of the sage Durvasa whose ashram was located in Phulpur sub-district, near the confluence of Tons and Majhuee river, north from the Phulpur sub-district headquarters. History Towards the end of the 16th century, a Gautam Rajput from Azamgarh district was assimilated into the Mughal court at Delhi, where he had gone in search of greater influence. His mission was a success, with the royal court eventually awarding him 22 parganas in the Azamgarh region that marked the establishment of a family line which culminated in his descendants becoming rajas of the area. This was a typical route whereby relatively obscure lineages rose to prominence. =Colonial era= The district was ceded to the British in 1801 by the wazirs of Lucknow. Both Hindu and Muslim landowners (known as Rautaras) of Azamgarh aided the Sepoy Mutiny against the British in 1857. On 3 June 1857 the 17th Regiment of Native Infantry mutinied at Azamgarh, murdered some of their officers, and carried off the government treasure to Faizabad. The district became a centre of the fighting between the Gurkhas and the rebels, and was brought under control in October 1858 by Colonel Kelly. The most notable rebels were Late. Janab Lal Mohammed Chivtahvin. Later, many of the local land owners were crushed by the British. Later, residents of Azamgarh participated in various national movements including the Civil Disobedience Movement and the Quit India Movement in 1942. The historian, social reformer, nationalist Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan was born in Kanaila village in this district. Geography Azamgarh district has an area of .

It is located near City Palace and Hawa Mahal. The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy which was shared by many civilizations. The monument features instruments operating in each of the three main classical celestial coordinate systems: the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system, and the ecliptic system. The kanmala Yantraprakara is one that works in two systems and allows transformation of the coordinates directly from one system to the other. The monument was damaged in the 19th century. Early restoration work was undertaken under the supervision of Major Arthur Garrett, a keen amateur astronomer, during his appointment as Assistant State Engineer for the Jaipur District.Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 81, p. 257 Name The name jantar is derived from yantra a Sanskrit word, meaning \\"instrument, machine\\", and mantar from mantrana also a Sanskrit word \\"consult, calculate\\"). Therefore, Jantar Mantar literally means 'calculating instrument'.  Purpose  Jai Singh noticed that the Zij, which was used for determining the position of celestial objects, did not match the positions calculated on the table. He constructed five new observatories in different cities in order to create a more accurate Zij. The astronomical tables Jai Singh created, known as the Zij-i Muhammad Shahi, were continuously used in India for a century. (However, the table had little significance outside of India.) Also, it was used to measure time.  History  Exactly when Jai Singh began construction in Jaipur is unknown, but several instruments had been built by 1728, and the construction of the instruments in Jaipur continued until 1738. During 1735, when construction was at its peak, at least 23 astronomers were employed in Jaipur, and due to the changing political climate, Jaipur replaced Delhi as Jai Singh's main observatory and remained Jai Singh's central observatory until his death in 1743. The observatory lost support under Isvari Singh (r.1743-1750) because of a succession war between him and his brother. However, Mado Singh (r. 1750-1768), Isvari Singh's successor, supported the observatory, although it did not see the same level of activity as under Jai Singh. Although some restorations were made to the Jantar Mantar under Pratap Singh (r.1778-1803), activity at the observatory died down again. During this time, a temple was constructed and Pratap Singh turned the site of the observatory into a gun factory. Bhairav Temple - located within the Jantar Mantar Complex Ram Singh (r. 1835-1880) completed restoring the Jantar Mantar in 1876, and even made some of the instruments more durable by inserting lead into the instruments' lines and using stone to restore some of the plaster instruments. However, the observatory soon became neglected again, and was not restored until 1901 under Madho Singh II (r. 1880-1922) Description Jantar Mantar deploys all three ancient coordinate systems of the five celestial coordinate systems known. In the image above, the red (ecliptic) and blue (equatorial) coordinate systems are two of the three classical systems that feature in the monument's instruments. Laghu samrat yantra The observatory consists of nineteen instruments for measuring time, predicting eclipses, tracking location of major stars as the earth orbits around the sun, ascertaining the declinations of planets, and determining the celestial altitudes and related ephemerides. The instruments are (alphabetical): #Chakra Yantra (four semicircular arcs on which a gnomon casts a shadow, thereby giving the declination of the Sun at four specified times of the day. This data corresponds to noon at four observatories around the world (Greenwich in UK, Zurich in Switzerland, Notke in Japan and Saitchen in the Pacific); this is equivalent of a wall of clocks registering local times in different parts of the world.) #Dakshin Bhitti Yantra (measures meridian, altitude and zenith distances of celestial bodies) #Digamsha Yantra (a pillar in the middle of two concentric outer circles, used to measure azimuth of the sun and to calculate the time of sunrise and sunset forecasts) #Disha Yantra #Dhruva Darshak Pattika (observe and find the location of pole star with respect to other celestial bodies) #Jai Prakash Yantra (two hemispherical bowl-based sundials with marked marble slabs that map inverted images of sky and allow the observer to move inside the instrument; measures altitudes, azimuths, hour angles, and declinations) #Kapali Yantra (measures coordinates of celestial bodies in azimuth and equatorial systems; any point in sky can be visually transformed from one coordinate system to another) #Kanali Yantra #Kranti Vritta Yantra (measures longitude and latitude of celestial bodies) #Laghu Samrat Yantra (the smaller sundial at the monument, inclined at 27 degrees, to measure time, albeit less accurately than Vrihat Samrat Yantra) #Misra Yantra (meaning mixed instrument, it is a compilation of five different instruments) #Nadi Valaya Yantra (two sundials on different faces of the instrument, the two faces representing north and south hemispheres; measuring the time to an accuracy of less than a minute) #Palbha Yantra #Rama Yantra (an upright building used to find the altitude and the azimuth of the sun) #Rashi Valaya Yantra (12 gnomon dials that measure ecliptic coordinates of stars, planets and all 12 constellation systems) #Shastansh Yantra (next to Vrihat Samrat Yantra) This instrument has a 60-degree arc built in the meridian plane within a dark chamber. At noon, the sun's pinhole image falls on a scale below enabling the observer to measure the zenith distance, declination, and the diameter of the Sun.) #Unnatamsa Yantra (a metal ring divided into four segments by horizontal and vertical lines, with a hole in the middle; the position and orientation of the instrument allows measurement of the altitude of celestial bodies) Unnatamsa Yantra #Vrihat Samrat Yantra (world's largest gnomon sundial, measures time in intervals of 2 seconds using shadow cast from the sunlight) #Yantra Raj Yantra (a 2.43-metre bronze astrolabe, one of the largest in the world, used only once a year, calculates the Hindu calendar) Yantra Raj The Vrihat Samrat Yantra, which means the \\"great king of instruments\\", is high; its shadow tells the time of day. Its face is angled at 27 degrees, the latitude of Jaipur. The Hindu chhatri (small cupola) on top is used as a platform for announcing eclipses and the arrival of monsoons. Jai Prakash Yantra at Jantar Mantar, Jaipur The instruments are in most cases huge structures. The scale to which they have been built has been alleged to increase their accuracy. However, the penumbra of the sun can be as wide as 30 mm, making the 1mm increments of the Samrat Yantra sundial devoid of any practical significance. Additionally, the masons constructing the instruments had insufficient experience with construction of this scale, and subsidence of the foundations has subsequently misaligned them. The samrat yantra, for instance, which is a sundial, can be used to tell the time to an accuracy of about two seconds in Jaipur local time. The Giant Sundial, known as the Samrat Yantra (The Supreme Instrument) is one of the world's largest sundials, standing 27 metres tall. Its shadow moves visibly at 1 mm per second, or roughly a hand's breadth (6 cm) every minute, which can be a profound experience to watch. =Materials of construction= Observation deck of the vrihat samrat yantra (the world's largest sundial) Built from local stone and marble, each instrument carries an astronomical scale, generally marked on the marble inner lining. Bronze tablets, bricks and mortar were also employed in building the instruments in the monument spread over about 18,700 square metres. It was in continuous use until about 1800, then fell in disuse and disrepair. Restored again several times during the British colonial rule, particularly in 1902, the Jantar Mantar was declared a national monument in 1948. It was restored in 2006. The restoration process in early 20th century replaced some of the original materials of construction with different materials. Jantar Mantar is managed under the Archeological Sites and Monuments Act of Rajasthan since 1961, and protected as a National Monument of Rajasthan since 1968.THE RAJASTHAN MONUMENTS ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES AND ANTIQUITIES RULES, 1968 Theory The Vedas mention astronomical terms, measurement of time and calendar, but do not mention any astronomical instruments. The earliest discussion of astronomical instruments, gnomon and clepsydra, is found in the Vedangas, ancient Sanskrit texts. The gnomon (called Shanku, ‡§∂‡§ô‡•ç‡§ï‡•Å) found at Jantar Mantar monument is discussed in these 1st millennium BCE Vedangas and in many later texts such as the Katyayana Sulbasutras. Other discussions of astronomical instruments are found in Hinduism texts such as the 4th century BCE Arthashastra, Buddhist texts such as Sardulakarna-avadana, and Jainism texts such as Surya-prajnapti. The theories behind the instruments are found in texts by the 5th century CE Aryabhatta, 6th century CE Brahmagupta and Varahamihira, 9th century Lalla, 11th century Sripati and Bhaskara. The texts of Bhaskara have dedicated chapters on instruments and he calls them Yantra-adhyaya. The theory of chakra-yantra, yasti-yantra, dhanur-yantra, kapala-yantra, nadivalaya-yantra, kartari-yantra, and others are found in the ancient texts.  The telescope in India  Although Jai Singh's observatories did not use telescopes, Jai Singh himself had several which he occasionally used for his observations, and telescopes were being built in India. However, telescopes built at the time were not very accurate for measuring celestial objects. In Europe, the telescope sights were first being used and increased the accuracy of measuring celestial objects. However, the telescope sight was still a new invention in Europe and had not yet reached India. European innovations in Astronomy were only slightly more accurate than the medieval Hindu instruments that Jai Singh had created. Filming location It was used as a filming location for the 2006 film The Fall as a maze. Storm Thorgerson photographed the sundial for the cover of Shpongle's DVD, Live at the Roundhouse 2008. It was photographed by Julio Cort√°zar with the collaboration of Antonio G√°lvez for the book Prosa del Observatorio (Editorial Lumen: Barcelona, 1972).

On the obverse is Virtus. The reverse depicts the consul Manius Aquillius raising an allegory of Sicily, an allusion to his victory in the Second Servile War. The gens Aquillia or Aquilia was a plebeian family of great antiquity at ancient Rome. Two of the Aquillii are mentioned among the Roman nobles who conspired to bring back the Tarquins, and a member of the house, Gaius Aquillius Tuscus, was consul in 487 BC.Titus Livius, Ab Urbe Condita ii. 4.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Origin The nomen Aquilius or Aquillius is probably derived from aquila, an eagle. On coins and inscriptions the name is almost always written Aquillius, but in manuscripts generally with a single l. The oldest branch of the family bore the cognomen Tuscus, suggesting that the gens may have been of Etruscan origin, although the nomen of the gens is indisputably Latin, and the name Tuscus could have been acquired in other ways.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. This cognomen is nonetheless dubious as only found in late sources; Robert Broughton mentions that it could have also been Sabinus.Broughton, vol. I, p. 20 (note 1). From the imagery of their coins, it seems that the Aquillii had a special devotion for Sol, a rare occurrence under the Republic. Praenomina The oldest families of the Aquillii bore the praenomina Gaius, Lucius, and Marcus, which were the three most common names at all periods of Roman history. However, one family, which rose to considerable prominence in the final century of the Republic, preferred the less-common praenomen Manius.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Branches and cognomina Denarius of Augustus and Lucius Aquillius Florus, 19 BC. Augustus is portrayed on the obverse. The flower on the reverse alludes to Florus' name. The cognomina of the Aquillii under the Republic are Corvus, Crassus, Florus, Gallus, and Tuscus.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. Tuscus, the oldest surname of the gens, means \\"Etruscan\\", and this branch of the family is thought by some writers to have been patrician, since they were among the Roman nobility at the beginning of the Republic, and according to tradition, the consulship was closed to the plebeians until the lex Licinia Sextia of 367 BC. However, modern scholarship suggests that the nobility of the Roman monarchy was not exclusively patrician, and that a number of early consuls belonged to families that were later regarded as plebeian. Still, as most patrician gentes also had plebeian branches, the possibility that some of the early Aquilii were patricians cannot be discounted.Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, pp. 252‚Äì256. Corvus refers to a raven. This surname is more famous from the gens Valeria. The Aquillii Flori first appear during the First Punic War, although they must have existed since the fourth century BC, and flourished at least until the time of Augustus. Their name simply means \\"flower\\". Gallus may refer to a cock, or to a Gaul, even though the Galli were from Lanuvium.Wiseman, New Men, p. 185. Crassus, a surname common in many gentes, may be translated as \\"thick,\\" \\"dull,\\" \\"simple,\\" or \\"crude.\\"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, Editor. The last cognomen to appear was Felix, meaning \\"lucky\\". In the last century of the Republic, two Aquillii who reached the consulship are not recorded with a cognomen, but they belonged to the Flori, since this cognomen is found on coins and inscriptions of their descendants.

Most European countries also have local pornography producers, from Portugal (e.g. Naturalvideo) to Serbia (e.g. Hexor), who face varying levels of competition with international producers. The legal status of pornography varies widely in Europe; its production and distribution are illegal in countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Bulgaria, while Hungary is noted for having liberal pornography laws.  Albania  In Albania, pornography is illegal only for producing, delivery, advertising, import, selling and publication of pornographic materials in persons under 18 years old. Child pornography is strictly prohibited.  Austria  In 1990, the \\"Federal Act Against Obscene Publications and for the Protection of Youth Morally Endangered\\" was passed to regulate pornography in Austria. In 1994 a prohibition on child pornography was added to the law. Under these regulations the minimum age for buying softcore pornography in Austria is 16 and the minimum age for buying hardcore pornography is 18. Publication of pornography or material depicting bestiality is illegal.  Azerbaijan  In Azerbaijan in accordance with article 3 of the Media Act of 7 December 1999, \\"pornographic materials\\" are defined as works of art, photographic reproductions of paintings, information and other materials the main content of which is the crude and undignified depiction of the anatomical and physiological aspects of sexual relations. Pornography in Azerbaijan is easily and cheaply obtainable in Baku, although not in most other places. There are reports of bribes being charged for taking hardcore pornography across the country's borders. Meanwhile, the legal activity to combat child pornography is governed by 1998 Rights of the Child Act, 1999 Media Act, the Plan of Measures to Solve the Problem of Homeless and Street Children and the National Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.  Belarus  Pornography is illegal in Belarus. Production, distribution, promotion, exhibition as well as possession with intent of distribution or promotion of pornographic materials or objects of pornographic nature is punished by Belarusian criminal law and results in compulsory community service, fine or up to 4 years imprisonment.Republic of Belarus Criminal Code ‚Äî Article 343. \\"Production and distribution of pornografic materials or objects of pornographic nature\\".  Belgium  Pornography is legal in Belgium. Pornographic products, mainly magazines and DVDs, are typically imported from the 3 neighbouring European countries of France, Germany, and the Netherlands, or from North America. There is also a little local production, mostly amateur.  Bulgaria  In the People's Republic of Bulgaria (1946‚Äì1990) pornography was only available to a comparatively limited number of people. What pornographic materials there were (mostly magazines and videocassettes) were smuggled into the country. The abandonment of censorship in the early post-communist period resulted in pornography becoming widely available. In the early 1990s pornographic magazines were sold at newsstands, pirated foreign pornographic videocassettes became available and foreign pornographic television stations were accessible. The first Bulgarian pornographic film was made in 1992. The production and distribution of pornography is illegal in Bulgaria. The filming of pornography and the online distribution of sexual content are illegal. There are no Bulgarian pornographic production companies. Accessing, possessing or storing pornographic materials is not illegal (except for child pornography). The penalty for production or distribution of pornography is up to one year imprisonment (or up to two years if the criminal used the Internet) and a fine of to . The penalty for distribution or possession of child pornography is up to one year imprisonment or a fine of up to . Authorities tolerate illegal distribution of hardcore porn in designated shops, and on TV after 11 pm. Softcore material is rarely censored. Magazines and pornographic papers have become increasingly available since the fall of communism in 1989, and local editions of many international porn magazines are published. Society is often exposed to sexual content in advertising.  Croatia  Pornography is legal in Croatia. Hardcore pornographic material may not be sold to persons under the age of 18. Distribution or possession of child pornography is illegal and punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.  Cyprus  Pornography is legal in Cyprus. Selling pornographic material to people under 18 years old is illegal. Child pornography is strictly illegal.  Czechia  Pornography in Czechia was legalized in 1993 following the Velvet Revolution, when the country ceased to be a communist state and returned to liberal democracy. Among the Czech companies that produce pornography are LegalPorno Studios, based in Prague. The sale and distribution of child pornography is illegal and is punishable by imprisonment for up to 3 years. Possession of child pornography was made illegal in 2007 and carries a penalty of up to 2 years in prison. The Czech penal code also bans the sale and distribution of pornography depicting sexual intercourse with an animal and pornography depicting violence or disrespect to human beings, with a penalty of up to 1 year in prison.  Denmark  A ban on pornographic literature was lifted in 1967. In 1969, Denmark became the first country in the world to legalize pornography.Denmark in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality ‚Äì \\"...Denmark was the first country in the world to legitimize written pornography in 1967 (followed by pictorial pornography in 1969).\\". People in Denmark have free access to pornography. Pornography including minors younger than 18 years is prohibited, and possession of the same is also illegal.  Estonia  Pornography is legal, distribution or production is regulated by law.  Finland  In Finland, child pornography is illegal, along with violent and bestial pornography. It is legal to sell pornography in any store, but magazines may not be sold to buyers less than 15 years of age, and hardcore is restricted to buyers aged at least 18. Prior to 1 January 1999, all indecent publishing, including the import and export thereof, was banned. France In 1976, a law that put considerable sanctions on pornographic films in distribution and taxation, known popularly as Code X was imposed, creating a situation that led pornography to develop itself on its own right. Since then, pornography has been a growing economy in France, now existing in various forms from magazines to satellite TV broadcasting. Germany Pornography is legal with the exception of child pornography. Like in many other countries, child pornography in Germany is illegal. German prosecution authorities and legal bodies of Germany's sixteen states handle the definition of child pornography very differently. The German Edathy affair of 2013/14 following the neglected cooperation of BKA within the Canadian child pornography uncoverings gave way for new legislation procedures in parliament to define the status of either posing or exhibitive pictures of minors. New laws were still in parliamentary debating as lately as 19 December 2014.  Greece  Pornography in Greece is legal by selling or publishing material, but it is illegal to minors under 18 years old. Despite the fact, the practice is still commonly done because the law is weakly enforced. Pornographic material is sold in sex shops, DVD-clubs, mini markets, and kiosk shops. There is also a local pornographic production which began unofficially in the 1970s, which then became official and full legal since 2008. Child pornography is illegal and is punished by imprisonment and money penalties. Hungary In Hungary, the production of pornography mainly dates from the period after the fall of communism in 1989. The production and distribution of pornography was illegal under communism, but the laws were liberalised with the emergence of democracy. Permissive government policies soon propelled the country to the forefront of the European pornography industry. Several foreign directors were attracted to the country's liberal legislation, cheap production costs and large supply of attractive female performers. Eventually, domestic producers began to prosper as well, and several female actresses made big names for themselves within the industry. Hungarian pornography is different from that produced in America in the more natural appearance of its performers. The sex scenes also tend to be more extreme, with frequent use of anal sex and various forms of multiple penetration.  Iceland  Publication of pornography is illegal in Iceland, and is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 6 months. Publication of child pornography is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to 2 years. In 2013 the Icelandic government proposed banning violent Internet pornography and Iceland's parliament began debating a ban on online pornography.  Ireland  Other than regulations regarding pornographic movies, no laws against pornography, other than child pornography (a child is defined as someone under 17), exist. Italy Although Italy had accumulated a lot of softcore pornography in the 1970s, hardcore pornography was not a usual trend until the 1980s. The first pornographic film in Italy was Il Telefono rosso (The red telephone) in 1983 by Riccardo Schicchi with Ilona Staller (aka \\"Cicciolina\\"). The film caused much controversy and it was restrained from legal release until 1986 with an alternate revision of Italian censorship laws.  Latvia  In Latvia, the distribution of pornographic material is allowed under very similar legal conditions as in Poland. Pornographic or erotic material is rarely to never sold in places accessible to general public.  Lithuania  In Lithuania, commercial distribution of pornographic material is prohibited by the Article 309 of the country's Criminal Code which states that \\"A person who, for the purpose of distribution, produces or acquires pornographic material or distributes such material shall be punished by community service or by a fine or by restriction of liberty or by imprisonment for a term of up to one year\\".  Malta  In Malta, pornography and obscene material was outlawed until later 2016, regardless of whether it has a commercial interest or whether it is directed to an adult audience. The relevant law in this respect was Article 208 (1) of the Criminal Code of Malta which prohibited the manufacture, print, importation, circulation and exportation of pornographic or obscene print, painting, photograph, film, book, card or writing, or any other obscene article whatsoever, whether for gain, or for distribution, or for display in a public place. In a decision given on 21 February 2011, the Maltese Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the criminal conviction of Mr. Alexander Baldacchino who was found guilty of exhibiting soft and hardcore pornographic films at the City Lights Theatre in Valletta. In another judgement, student editor Mark Camilleri and author Alex Vella Gera were found not guilty under Article 208 (1) of the Criminal Code and Article 7 of the Press Act (obscene libel) for the publication of an obscene story entitled Li Tkisser Sewwi (translated in English to 'Repair that which you break') in student newspaper Realt√† (distributed for free on campus at the University of Malta) by the Court of Magistrates (Malta). The decision was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal. In 2015, the Minister of Social Justice Owen Bonnici started to work on legislation to allow both services or art to create pornographic material while also giving official right to access pornographic material. By late 2016 the parliament of Malta gave the green light for most pornographic material.http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&itemid;=27811&l;=1 Pornography involving minors, disabled and extreme forms of expression, including threats with the use of such material, remain illegal.http://www.justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&itemid;=27845&l;=1  Netherlands  * Article 240a indirectly prohibits giving pornographic pictures to children younger than 16 years. Maximum imprisonment is one year, or a fine of the 4th category (‚Ç¨19,500). * Article 240b prohibits child pornography, which is defined as a picture showing a person younger than 18 performing sexual acts. Maximum imprisonment is 4 years or a fine of the 5th category (‚Ç¨78,000). It also prohibits making a profession or habit of it. The maximum imprisonment in that case is 6 years or a fine of the 5th category (‚Ç¨78,000). * Article 248e prohibits online dating with minors (0‚Äì15 years old) in order to have sex or to make porn with him/her. The maximum imprisonment in that case is 2 years or a fine of the 4th category (‚Ç¨19,500). * Article 254a prohibits bestiality porn. Maximum imprisonment is 6 months or a fine of the 3rd category (‚Ç¨7,800).  Norway  In Norway, hardcore material was illegal until 2006 de jure to distribute, or sell, but legal to possess. Production, however, was not explicitly illegal, thus both photo and movie shoots occurred. One could acquire pornography abroad, on the Internet, or via satellite TV. Illegal porn shops also existed, especially in larger cities. To satisfy legal requirements, editors of erotic magazines, domestic TV channels, and cable TV obscured sexual organs in activity using black rectangles and the like. After the Supreme Court of Norway unanimously acquitted a former magazine editor on 7 December 2005 for publishing unobscured hardcore pornography in 2002, it became understood that printed hardcore pornography was no longer illegal. Pornography became legal on March 14, 2006. Regular and cable TV tend to abide by the old standards, seeing that edited TV is regulated by a separate law and thus is not affected by the Supreme Court decision. Video-on-demand, however, is not regulated by the TV laws, and, thus, pornography is legal to order. The depiction of illegal sexual activities, including those involving children, animals, necrophilia, rape, violence, or the use of force, remains illegal.  Poland  In Poland, as of September 1998, Article 202 of the national Penal Code makes pornography legal except for the production or possession of pornographic materials containing minors, bestiality (zoophilia), and \\"scenes of violence/rape\\". Also illegal is presenting or showing pornographic materials to people who do not want to have any contact with them, and to persons under 15 years of age.Art. 200 ¬ß 3 and art. 202 of the Penal Code  Portugal  In Portugal, hardcore pornographic movies can only be shown in adult cinemas. Videos and magazines are openly sold in newsstands but are forbidden by law to be supplied to minors under the age of 18 years. Additionally, hardcore pornographic movies are banned from open-channel TV and can only be broadcast through encrypted/pay-per-view channels. Child pornography (i.e., pornography depicting children or juveniles below the age of 18) is illegal. Although the national age of consent is 14, the age of legal responsibility (i.e., the age a person can sign contracts consenting to appear in pornography) is 18.  Romania  Pornography is legal in Romania. Magazines must be enclosed in plastic bags (or something equivalent) with a small red square printed on the enclosing material. Pornographic TV channels offered by cable operators must be encrypted. Pornographic materials cannot be sold to minors under 18. Russia Most Russian pornography is produced in Moscow and in St. Petersburg where the largest adult film producer, SP-Company, is based. The types of Russian adult films may range from gonzo pornography to adaptations of Russian classics (Eugene Onegin (by Tatiana Taneyeva (2003)), The Master and Margarita (by Armen Oganezov & Sergei Pryanishnikov (2002)) etc.) and these productions basically aim the domestic market. Much of the pornography is produced for the international internet market. According to Russian law, consumption of pornography is allowed though the production of it is not. The illegal production, distribution, and \\"public demonstration\\" of pornography is punishable by a 2- to 6-year prison term. Roskomnadzor, the Russian government's media overseer, has the power to order the blocking of pornographic websites. In 2015 the agency required the blocking of the Russian-language version of Pornhub and 10 other pornographic sites on the basis of a court ruling.  Serbia  Pornography is legal in Serbia. Hardcore pornographic material may not be sold to persons under the age of 18. Distribution or possession of child pornography or pornography involving minors (under 18) is illegal and punishable by law.  Spain  Pornography was illegal in Francoist Spain, although some people travelled to France to see films such as Last Tango in Paris and some group tours to French X-rated cinemas were organised. For climate reasons, a number of Private movies were shot though not released in Spain. The censorship of that period ended with Franco's death in 1975. For less than a year there was no censorship at all, and hardcore porn was sometimes shown in main cinemas. Subsequently the S-rating for films was introduced, allowing softcore pornography to be shown in mainstream cinemas. The film genre that arose was known as destape (undressing) and included popular films such as Las er√≥ticas vacaciones de Stela (Stela's Erotic Vacations), El mundo maravilloso del sexo (The Marvellous World of Sex), Trampa sexual (Sexual Trap) and La org√≠a (The Orgy). The magazine Intervi√∫, founded in 1976, had revealing covers of famous actresses and included nude photographs inside. In 1983 the S-rating was replaced by the more permissive X-rating. Barcelona has long been the most liberal major city in Spain; the Club Bagdad and an open prostitute quarter are there. The pornography industry in Spain has been located in or near it, with little in the ‚Äì by comparison ‚Äì more conservative Madrid. Pornography is now legal in Spain, and enforcement of obscenity laws is lax. It is illegal to display pornographic material at newsstands, but it is commonly found there. In many cities and towns there is a variety of sex shops. E-commerce merchants from all around the world use I.P.S.P. (Internet clearing services) from Spanish banks. The headquarters of Private Media Group, Europe's biggest pornographic company, are in Barcelona.  Sweden  Like Denmark and the Netherlands, Sweden does not regulate pornography and the country has no age laws for the possession or viewing of pornography. Some shops follow a voluntary limit and do not sell to minors. Material that involves animals is legal, though it is subject to animal-welfare laws. BDSM is classified as an \\"illegal depiction of violence\\" (olaga v√•ldsskildring). It is illegal for people under the age of 18 to act or pose for pornography in Sweden. Pornographic photographs and films depicting children are illegal even if the material was legal in the originating country. Examples of Japanese Hentai and Lolicon have also been deemed to be illegal in Sweden as a result of court judgements. In cases when the court has considered them to represent persons under 18 years of age they have been treated as instances of child pornography.  Switzerland  Pornography in Switzerland is defined by the Article 197 of the Swiss criminal code. The first alinea states that ¬´Any person who offers, shows, passes on or makes accessible to a person who is under the age of 16 pornographic documents, sound or visual recordings, depictions or other articles of a similar nature or pornographic representations, or broadcasts any of the same on radio or television is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty.¬ª Furthermore, it is illegal to produce, import, store, market, advertise, exhibit, offer, show, pass on or make accessible pornography that depicts sexual acts involving children (under 16 years old) or animals, human excrement, or acts of violence, called \\"hard pornography\\". Since July 2014, La consommation de pornographie dure est punissable √† partir du 1er juillet 2014, Cybercrime Coordination Unit Switzerland, Federal Department of Justice and Police, retrieved 29-08-2014 human excrement and urine are not considered being \\"hard pornography\\" anymore. Until June 2014, actors aged 16 and above could participate in a pornography production; however, since July 2014, if a person \\"looks\\" or is under 18 years of age, the material is considered as pedo-pornography. This is due to the Swiss ratification of the Lanzarote Convention. The age of viewing pornography stays fixed at 16 years old (Art. 197 al. 1 of the Swiss criminal code). The same materials cited above are nevertheless not regarded as pornographic if they have a cultural or scientific value that justifies their protection by law.Swiss Criminal Code Art. 197 ‚Äì Pornography, admin.ch. Retrieved 2014-05-11.  Turkey  Turkey, which is a formally secular state with a Muslim majority, was the first country to legally produce pornographic materials in the Muslim world. After a long period of producing Italian-inspired softcore comedies in the 1970s, the hardcore film √ñyle Bir Kadƒ±n Ki was distributed in 1979. Around 2007, the Turkish government began to block all pornographic websites.  Ukraine  Pornography was outlawed in Ukraine in 2009 when the then president Victor Yushchenko signed new legislation. The law has been overwhelmingly approved by the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament). The possession, distribution, sale and manufacture of pornographic materials are illegal, with laws strictly enforced. Possession of pornographic material can carry a fine or up to three years imprisonment. Pornography is defined by the law as \\"vulgar, candid, cynical, obscene depiction of sexual acts, pursuing no other goal, the explicit demonstration of genitals, unethical elements of the sexual act, sexual perversions, realistic sketches that do not meet moral criteria and offend honor and dignity of the human by inciting low instincts\\". Pornography for \\"medical purposes\\" remains legal. Wiska, one of Ukraine's internationally known pornstars, alleges continuous and unconstitutional persecution for her work abroad, and has unsuccessfully applied for political asylum in the European Union.–ß–µ—Ö—ñ—è –æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ –≤—ñ–¥–º–æ–≤–∏–ª–∞ –∫–æ–ª–∏—à–Ω—ñ–π –ø–æ—Ä–Ω–æ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—Ü—ñ Wiska –≤ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—É—Å—ñ –±—ñ–∂–µ–Ω–∫–∏ United Kingdom \\"In Britain, where pornography is already more restricted than it is anywhere else in the English-speaking world or in Western Europe\\", wrote Avedon Carol in 1995, \\"sexual media is easily smeared for an audience that is seldom given an opportunity to see what really is sold under the name of 'pornography'\\". However the current British legislative framework including the Obscene Publications Act 1959 (in England and Wales), the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 and the Video Recordings Act 1984 leads to a confusing situation in which there is a theoretical ban on the publication and distribution (but not possession) of pornographic material in any form, which is in practice unenforcable due to the vagueness of the legal test of material that \\"depraves and corrupts\\". In practice, hardcore material on video and DVD was until recently banned by the requirement under the Video Recordings Act to be certified by the BBFC, while mainstream hardcore material in other forms such as magazines and websites is essentially unrestricted. Continental European, American and British hardcore pornographic magazines are now openly sold in many British newsagents, for instance. Due to liberalisation in BBFC policy, mainstream hardcore DVDs now receive R18 certificates, legalising them but restricting their sale to licensed sex shops such as those in Soho. British-made pornography tends to focus on a rough-and- ready semi-amateur look rather than the more stylized glamorous look of Continental European pornography. The UK is still the only Member State of the European Union that prohibits private imports of adult pornography by consumers coming from other Member States of the European Union. In the 2004‚Äì2005 fiscal year, the agents of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs seized 96,783 items of pornographic media carried by people travelling into the UK. In 2005, the UK porn industry was estimated to be worth about ¬£1 billion.

It is the administrative headquarters of Bulandshahr District. This city is part of the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR). According to the Government of India, the district Bulandshahr is one of the Minority Concentrated Districts of India on the basis of the 2011 census data on population, socio-economic indicators and basic amenities indicators. The distance between Bulandshahr and New Delhi is 68 km and it takes 1 hour 26 mins to reach there.  History  A king named Ahibaran is said to have laid the foundation of a fort called Baran here and established his capital named baranshahr. It was called Baran city and the name changed to Bulandshahr in official usages. Since it was perched on a highland it came to be known as \\"high city\\" (), which translates as Bulandshahr in Persian language during the Mughal era. There is a present-day place called Upper Court (Hindi: ‡§ì‡§™‡§∞‡§ï‡•ã‡§ü) which is believed to be the Fort of Raja Ahibarna and old Baran was limited to this area. The kingdom of Baran came to an end probably during the 12th century. In 1192 CE when Muhammad Ghauri conquered parts of India, his general Qutubuddin Aibak surrounded Fort Baran and conquered it and the Raja Chandrasen Dodiya was killed and Aibak took control of the Baran kingdom. The ancient ruins found at places in Bhatora Veerpur, Ghalibpur, etc. are indicative of the antiquity of Bulandshahr. There are several other important places in the District from where statues belonging to the medieval age and objects of ancient temples have been found. Even today, several of these historical and ancient objects such as coins, inscriptions etc. are preserved in the State Museum Lucknow. Demographics As per provisional data of 2011 census, Bulandshahr urban agglomeration had a population of 235,310, out of which males were 125,549 and females were 111,761. Population in the age groups of 0 to 6 years was 30,886. The total number of literates were 160,203, of which 90,761 were males and 69,442 were females.

This is in contrast to a one- pass compiler, which traverses the program only once. Each pass takes the result of the previous pass as the input, and creates an intermediate output. In this way, the (intermediate) code is improved pass by pass, until the final pass produces the final code. Multi-pass compilers are sometimes called wide compilers, referring to the greater scope of the passes: they can \\"see\\" the entire program being compiled, instead of just a small portion of it. The wider scope thus available to these compilers allows better code generation (e.g. smaller code size, faster code) compared to the output of one-pass compilers, at the cost of higher compiler time and memory consumption. In addition, some languages cannot be compiled in a single pass, as a result of their design.  Typical multi-pass compiler  300px = Lexical analysis = This stage of a multi-pass compiler is to remove irrelevant information from the source program that syntax analysis will not be able to use or interpret. Irrelevant information could include things like comments and white space. In addition to removing the irrelevant information, the lexical analysis determines the lexical tokens of the language. This step means that forward declaration is generally not necessary if a multi-pass compiler is used. This phase is focused on breaking a sequence of characters into tokens with attributes such as kind, type, value, and potentially others, as well. = Syntax analysis = Syntax analysis is responsible for looking at syntax rules of the language (often as a context-free grammar), and building some intermediate representation of the language. An example of this intermediate representation could be something like an Abstract Syntax Tree or a Directed Acyclic Graph. = Semantic analysis = Semantic analysis takes the representation made from syntax analysis and applies semantic rules to the representation to make sure that the program meets the semantic rules requirements of the language. For example, in the example below at the stage of semantic analysis if the language required that conditions on if statements were boolean expressions the cond would be type-checked to make sure it would be a valid boolean expression. if(cond) { ... } else { ... } In addition to performing semantic analysis at this stage of compilation, often symbol tables are created in order to assist in code generation. = Code generation = This final stage of a typical compiler converts the intermediate representation of program into an executable set of instructions (often assembly). This last stage is the only stage in compilation that is machine dependent. There can also be optimization done at this stage of compilation that make the program more efficient. Other passes of compiler include intermediate code generation phase which takes place before code generation and code optimization phase which can take place when the source program is written, or after intermediate code generation phase, or after code generation phase.  Advantages of multi-pass compilers  Machine Independent: Since the multiple passes include a modular structure, and the code generation decoupled from the other steps of the compiler, the passes can be reused for different hardware/machines. More Expressive Languages: Multiple passes obviate the need for forward declarations, allowing mutual recursion to be implemented elegantly. The prime examples of languages requiring forward declarations due to the requirement of being compilable in a single pass include C and Pascal, whereas Java does not have forward declarations.

It consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments. The site is one of five built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, from 1723 onwards,revising the calendar and astronomical tables. There is a plaque fixed on one of the structures in the Jantar Mantar observatory in New Delhi that was placed there in 1910 mistakenly dating the construction of the complex to the year 1710. Later research, though, suggests 1724 as the actual year of construction. Its height is . The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and movements of the sun, moon and planets. Some of these purposes nowadays would be classified as astronomy. Completed in 1724, the Delhi Jantar Mantar had decayed considerably by 1857 uprising. The Ram Yantra, the Samrat Yantra, the Jai Prakash Yantra and the Misra Yantra are the distinct instruments of Jantar Mantar. Purpose of individual structures The 4 distinct instruments within the observatory of Jantar Mantar in New Delhi: the Samrat Yantra, the Jayaprakash, Rama Yantra and the Misra Yantra. * Samrat Yantra: The Samrat Yantra, or Supreme Instrument, is a giant triangle that is basically an equal hour sundial. It is 70 feet high, 114 feet long at the base, and 10 feet thick. It has a hypotenuse that is parallel to the Earth's axis and points toward the North Pole. On either side of the triangle is a quadrant with graduations indicating hours, minutes, and seconds. At the time of the Samrat Yantra's construction, sundials already existed, but the Samrat Yantra turned the basic sundial into a precision tool for measuring declination and other related coordinates of various heavenly bodies. * Jaya Prakash Yantra: The Jaya Prakash consists of hollowed out hemispheres with markings on their concave surfaces. Crosswires were stretched between points on their rim. From inside the Ram, an observer could align the position of a star with various markings or a window's edge. * Rama Yantra: Two large cylindrical structures with open top, used to measure the altitude of stars based on the latitude and the longitude on the earth. * Misra Yantra: The Misra Yantra (literally mixed instrument) is a composition of 5 instruments designed as a tool to determine the shortest and longest days of the year. It could also be used to indicate the exact moment of noon in various cities and locations regardless of their distance from Delhi. The Misra yantra was able to indicate when it was noon in various cities all over the world and was the only structure in the observatory not invented by Jai Singh II. Other observatories Between 1727 and 1734 Jai Singh II built five similar observatories in west-central India, all known by the name Jantar Mantar.

Created in 1939, the lake has developed as a popular spot for water sports and outdoor recreation including fishing. Surrounding the lake are a number of resorts and vacation homes which cater to tourists. History =Lake creation= Lake Caliraya was created after the construction of Caliraya Dam, an embankment dam started in 1939 by US Army Corps of Engineers Chief in the Philippines, Lieutenant Colonel (later Major General) Hugh J. Casey, with the approval of Philippine Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon. The Caliraya River was dammed at its outlet from a large flat plateau area providing a large water reservoir for generating hydroelectric power for Southern Luzon. The dam was over high from which a diversion canal was constructed several miles to the head of a steep slope about 950 feet above Laguna de Bay. Large penstocks were constructed diverting water down to the powerhouse below, with tailrace to the bay. The high head permitted the use of high-speed turbines and generators at relatively low unit costs. Initial estimate for the project was $5 million, or 10 million pesos, and an output of 40,000 horsepower.Casey, Hugh J., ed. (1993) \\"Major General Hugh J. Casey, Engineer Memoirs\\", United States Department of the Army, Washington, D.C. =World War II= During World War II, the dam was sabotaged by retreating Americans to prevent use by invading Japanese who rebuilt it, then, themselves sabotaged it as their own defeat approached. It was rebuilt and inaugurated in 1953 by the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR). For his pioneering endeavors in this area, President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines in 1972 bestowed on Casey the honorary title of ‚Äúthe father of water power development in the Philippines.Hugh John Casey\\". Arlington National Cemetery Website. Retrieved on 2011-02-19. =Development of the area= Lake Caliraya was rediscovered in the late 60's by the Nieto and De Padua families who then popularized the lake to Manila's elite and expatriate communities. By the acquisition and consolidation of land titles surrounding the lake, they constructed a residential resort subdivision known as Sierra Lakes and the Dos Lagos Club for residents (now known as Lagos del Sol). Property values increased even more so when the main road to the lake was paved courtesy of a grant from the Japanese government and the refurbishing of the hydroelectric plant in 2004. Lake Caliraya eventually became a high-end neighborhood of vacation homes for the rich and famous.History of Caliraya Lake\\". Caliraya Lake. Retrieved on 2011-03-01. During the 1980s, Lake Caliraya's surroundings were occupied by the local squatters and bandits posing as NPA New People's Army, which affected tourism and development. Nevertheless, since 1985, there has been major real estate developed with the construction of several small resorts and Caliraya Springs, a golf course and country club. Despite the proliferation of squatters on the roadside due to the negligence of government agencies such as the DPWH (Dept of Public Works and Highways) and Napocor (National Power Corporation), Caliraya continues to be a haven for the rich and the elite, with activities including largemouth bass fishing, wind surfing, kite boarding, wake boarding, jet skiing, water skiing, boating, golf, camping, and other sporting and recreational outdoor activities. Property values remain high, and a new generation of developments, both private and commercial, are slowly coming onstream. Jetskiing in Lake Caliraya Geography and geological phenomenon Lake Caliraya is situated approximately 1,200 feet above sea level, and is perched high in the Sierra Madre. The lake experiences cool climate all year round. Winds start blowing in Lake Caliraya from the beginning of September up to late May. Lake Caliraya's bottom, as well as the surrounding hills, are characterized by a reddish clay topsoil. The lake's floor has a very soft clay bottom. Local residents of the lake's surroundings still tell stories about certain areas in the lake that are reputed to have sucked boats down - an unfounded claim typical among superstitious locals. Lake Caliraya as seen from Cavinti, Laguna Lake surroundings and islands The lake's surroundings have been compared to various North American resorts, as suggested by the abundance of pine trees which were introduced by some of the early developers to replace many of the coconut trees, as well as year-round cool climate, and verdant hills. Also, numerous islands of various shapes and sizes have been formed during the creation of the dam lake. All are unnamed. The biggest island is approximately as big as Rizal Park, while the smallest is actually a sandbar about 3 square meters often submerged during high water. This tiny island can be viewed from Lagos del Sol Resort. Bass fishing The early developers (Kalaw, Nieto and the De Padua families) seeded the lake with largemouth bass, and through the years, the lake has remained the most popular bass fishing spot in the country.

There is no direct relationship to financial credit scores used in lending decisions, as insurance scores are not intended to measure creditworthiness, but rather to predict risk. Insurance companies use insurance scores for underwriting decisions, and to partially determine charges for premiums. Insurance scores are applied in personal product lines, namely homeowners and private passenger automobile insurance, and typically not elsewhere.  Background  Insurance scoring models are built from selections of credit report factors, combined with insurance claim and profitability data, to produce numerical formulae or algorithms. A scoring model may be unique to an insurance company and to each line of business (e.g. homeowners or automobile), in terms of the factors selected for consideration and the weighting of the point assignments. As insurance credit scores are not intended to measure creditworthiness, they commonly focus on financial habits and choices (i.e., age of oldest account, number of inquiries in 24 months, ratio of total balance to total limits, number of open retail credit cards, number of revolving accounts with balances greater than 75% of limits, etc.) Therefore it is possible for a consumer with a high financial credit score, and excellent payment history, to receive a poor insurance score. Insurers consider credit report information in their underwriting and pricing decisions as a predictor of profitability and risk of loss. Various studies have found a strong relationship between credit-based insurance scores and profitability or risk of loss. The scores are generally most predictive when little or no other information exists, such as in the case of clean driving records, or claims-free policies; in instances where past claims, points, or other similar information exist on record, the personal histories will typically be more predictive than the scores. Insurers consider credit report information, along with other factors, such as driving experience, previous claims and vehicle age, to develop a picture of a consumer's risk profile and to establish premium rates. The correlation, between credit-based insurance scores and overall insurance profitability and loss, has not been disputed.  Support and opposition  The use of credit information in insurance pricing and underwriting is heavily disputed. Proponents of insurance credit scoring include insurance companies, the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA),The Use of Credit History for Personal Lines of Insurance, American Academy of Actuaries the Insurance Information Institute (III), Insurance Information Institute, Topic: Credit Scoring and credit bureaus such as Fair IsaacFair Isaac (For Consumers) Fair Isaac, FICO Insurance Risk Scores (For Insurers) and TransUnion. Active opponents include many state insurance departments and regulators, and consumer protection organizations such as the Center for Economic Justice,Center for Economic Justice, Topic: Insurance Credit Scoring the Consumer Federation of America,Robert Hunter, Director of Insurance, Consumer Federation of America, Insurance Journal (February 2010) the National Consumer Law CenterCredit Scoring and Insurance: Costing Consumers Billions and Perpetuating the Economic Racial Divide, The National Consumer Law Center (June 2007) and Texas Watch.Ban Texas Insurance Scoring , Texas Watch As a result of successful lobbying by the insurance industry, credit scoring is legal in nearly all states. The state of Hawaii has banned all use of credit information in personal automobile underwriting and rating, and other states have established restrictions. A number of states have also made unsuccessful attempts to ban or restrict the practice. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has acknowledged that a correlation does exist between insurance scores and losses, but asserts that the benefit of credit reports to consumers has not yet been established.National Association of Insurance Commissioners , Topic: Credit Scoring  Public information  Insurance credit-scoring models are considered proprietary, and a trade secret, in most cases. The designers wish to protect their models from view for a number of reasons: they may provide competitive advantage in the insurance marketplace, or they anticipate consumers might attempt to alter results, by changing the information they provide, if the computations were common knowledge. Thus there is little public information available about the details of insurance credit-scoring models. * One actuarial study has been published, The Impact of Personal Credit History on Loss Performance in Personal Lines, by James Monaghan, ACAS MAAA.The Impact of Personal Credit History on Loss Performance in Personal Lines, by James Monaghan ACAS MAAA * Allstate has published a private passenger automobile credit scoring model, the ISM7 (NI) Scorecard (where \\"NI\\" indicates no inquiries are considered).ISM7 (NI) Scorecard, Allstate Property & Casualty Company  Key reports and studies  Credit-Based Insurance Scores: Impacts on Consumers of Automobile Insurance, A Report to Congress by the Federal Trade Commission.Credit-Based Insurance Scores: Impacts on Consumers of Automobile Insurance, Federal Trade Commission (July 2007) This study found that insurance credit scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed that African-Americans and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC stated that little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers. The report was disputed by representatives of the Consumer Federation of America, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Consumer Law Center, and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry, which was not open to examination.Consumers Dispute FTC Report on Insurance Credit Scoring, www.consumeraffairs.com (July 2007) The Impact of Personal Credit History on Loss Performance in Personal Lines, by James Monaghan ACAS MAAA.

Insurance Credit Scoring: An Unfair Practice, Center for Economic Justice.Insurance Credit Scoring: An Unfair Practice, Center for Economic Justice (January 2005) This report argues that insurance scoring: is inherently unfair; has a disproportionate impact on consumers in poor and minority communities; penalizes consumers for rational behavior and sound financial management practices; penalizes consumers for lenders‚Äô business decisions unrelated to payment history; is an arbitrary practice; and undermines the basic insurance mechanism and public policy goals for insurance.

Use of Credit Information by Insurers in Texas, Report to the 79th Legislature, Texas Department of Insurance.Use of Credit Information by Insurers in Texas, Texas Department of Insurance (December 2004) This study found a consistent pattern of differences in credit scores among different racial/ethnic groups. Whites and Asians were found to have better scores than Blacks and Hispanics. Differences in income levels were not as pronounced as for racial/ethnic groups, but average credit scores at upper income levels were better than those at lower and moderate income levels. The study found a strong relationship between credit scores and claims experience on an aggregate basis. In 2002, the Texas Department of Insurance received a peak of 600 complaints related to credit scoring, which declined and leveled to 300 per year. Insurance Credit Scoring in Alaska, State of Alaska, Department of Community and Economic Development, Division of Insurance.Insurance Credit Scoring in Alaska, State of Alaska, Division of Insurance (February 2003) The study suggested unequal effects on consumers of varying income and ethnic backgrounds. Specifically, the higher income neighborhoods and those with a higher proportion of Caucasians were the least impacted by credit scoring. Although data available for the study was limited, the state of Alaska determined that some restrictions on credit scoring would be appropriate to protect the public.

However, failing to establish himself he returned to Italy, and lived precariously as a literary man until 1870, when his reputation was established by the unexpected success of his first acted tragedy, Nero. From this time to his death Cossa continued to produce a play a year, usually upon some classical subject. Cleopatra, Messalina, Julian, enjoyed great popularity, and his dramas on subjects derived from Italian history, Rienzi and The Borgias, were also successful. Plautus, a comedy, was preferred by the author himself, and is more original. Incidental music for some of his plays was written by celebrated Italian composers, notably Luigi Mancinelli. The entry for Cossa in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica evaluated his style as follows: Cossa died at Livorno in 1881. His collected Teatro poetico was published in 1887.

First established in 1999, the program allowed food products that met predetermined nutritional guidelines to be marketed using a Health Check seal, identifying the product as being endorsed by the Heart and Stroke Foundation. Distributors and restaurants were required to pay a fee to the Heart and Stroke Foundation to license the logo. The Health Check program was discontinued in 2014; the program had been criticized by University of Ottawa professor Yoni Freedhoff for endorsing products with high sugar and sodium contents as purportedly being healthy options. Criteria Products that qualify for a Health Check symbol must meet category-specific nutrient criteria:Helping You Eat Well  Heart&Stroke; Health Check Program The amount of nutrients required is determined from the Canada Food Guide. * total fat * saturated fat * trans fat * fibre * sodium * sugar * protein * vitamins and minerals More specifically the criteria is based on nutrients Canadians should incorporate into their diet such as fibre and vitamins, and also those they should eat less of such as sodium, fat and sugar.FAQ  Heart&Stroke; Health Check Program The grocery items are divided into categories related to the Canadian Food Guide food groups which include: Vegetable and Fruit, Grain Products, Milk and Alternatives, Meat and Alternatives plus Oil and Fat. There is also a category for food that incorporate more than one of these called Combination Foods.http://www.healthcheck.org/page/nutrient-criteria-grocery-0 The Health Check website has a list of criteria for the products, some examples include: Vegetable and Fruit Fruit juice must be: * made from 100% fruit juice with no added sugar * an excellent source of vitamin C (50%) or vitamin A (25%) or folate (25%) or source of fibre (2 grams) Frozen and Canned Vegetables, both seasoned and sauced, must have * no more than 240 milligrams of sodium * no more than three grams of fat Grain Products Breakfast cereal must have: * no more than three grams of fat * at least two grams of fibre * no more than 240 milligrams of sodium * no more than six grams of sugar (excluding sugars from pieces of fruit) except if four grams or more of fibre * no more than five percent of total fat from trans fat Milk and Alternatives Yogurt must have: * no more than two percent milk fat * at least fifteen percent of the daily recommended calcium * no more than 140 milligrams of sodium * no added sugar Meat and Alternatives Plain meat or poultry must have: * no more than ten percent fat * no added salt or sodium * no more than five percent of fat from trans fat An independent company randomly evaluates the items, on an annual basis, to ensure that products indeed meet the criteria. Criticism The Health Check program was criticized for giving misleading endorsements to unhealthy products. Obesity expert and University of Ottawa assistant professor Dr. Yoni Freedhoff was a notable critic of the program, having criticized it for endorsing products with high sugar and sodium contents. In 2012, he criticized the program's endorsement of products from Canadian fast food burger chain Harvey's with the seal. While endorsed for protein and vegetable contents and use of multi-grain buns, Freedhoff pointed out that the endorsed grilled veggie and grilled chicken burgers respectively contained 930 and 950 mg of sodium, \\"virtually half of recommended daily intake.\\" The following year, he criticized the program for endorsing Sun- Rype's Fruitsource Fruit Bites product despite its high sugar content. He argued that \\"abusing the public's trust to sell candy to kids under the guise of fruit is not what the Heart and Stroke Foundation is supposed to be doing\\". These issues were a factor in the discontinuation of the program in 2014. Program director Terry Dean felt that the Health Check model had become outdated and \\"just didn‚Äôt allow us to have the footprint that we needed\\". He stated that the Heart and Stroke Foundation would shift its focus towards \\"broader\\" advocacy at the corporate and government levels.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Created by Wizards of the Coast in August 2001, the game was designed to compete with the Yu-Gi- Oh!, Pok√©mon and Magic: The Gathering card games. Its release was timed to coincide with the theatrical premiere of the first film in the series. The game was praised for the way it immersed children in the Harry Potter universe. At one point the game was the second best selling toy in the United States; however, it is now out of print. Game play The game is for two players, each with 60-card decks (with the addition of a starting Character; see below). The aim is to force the opposite player to run out of cards from their deck first. When cards do \\"damage\\" to a player, cards from the deck are placed into the discard pile. Each player begins with a hand of seven cards, and draws a card before each of their turns. =Types of cards= There are eight different types of cards in the Harry Potter Trading Card Game. * Lessons are the basic units of the game. Each provides 1 \\"Power\\", which is needed to play other cards. The number of Lessons in play determines the player's capabilities to play cards with different costs. There are five different Lesson cards, each of which has a different symbol and colour that is used to identify it on other cards. * Spells are cards that are played directly into the discard pile and have a given effect. They have a printed Power cost; there are Spells for each Lesson type. * Creatures stay on the table when played. All Creatures have a printed Power cost, and require Care of Magical Creatures Lessons to play. They have a Health number that determines how much damage they can take, and a \\"Damage each turn\\" number that dictates the amount of damage done to the opposing player each turn. Not all Creatures do damage; some have special abilities. * Characters do not have a printed Power cost or Lesson type and thus do not require Lessons to play, although they do require two Actions. Characters stay on the table and have special abilities that can be used by the player; some also provide Power. Each player must have a starting Character to represent them: the starting Character begins the game on the table and cannot be discarded from play. Only Characters with the \\"Witch\\" or \\"Wizard\\" keyword designation can be used as starting Characters. * Adventures, like Characters, do not require Lessons to play, and require two Actions. They have an Effect on the opposing player; a \\"To Solve\\" condition that must be accomplished for the opposing player to remove the Adventure; and a Reward, which the opposing player receives when they have solved the Adventure. Each player can have only one Adventure in play at a time. * Items stay on the table when played. They have a printed Power cost and can be of any Lesson type. Some have effects that can be used, while others provide extra Power. * Matches were introduced in the Quidditch Cup expansion. They all have a printed Power cost of one, requiring Quidditch Power. They have a condition \\"To Win\\", and a \\"Prize\\" for the first player to fulfill that condition. Only one Match is allowed in play at one time. * Locations were introduced in the Diagon Alley expansion. They have a printed Power cost and can be of any Lesson type. Locations have the same effect on both players. There can be only one Location in play at any one time; playing a Location removes any previous Locations from play. =Lesson types= There are five Lesson types in the game, each applying to different cards. There is no limit on the Lesson cards in a player's deck: a player may have as many different types as they prefer. * Care of Magical Creatures (brown) is mostly used for Creature cards, although there are also a small number of Spells, Items and Locations requiring this Lesson. Care of Magical Creatures focus mainly on dealing damage. * Charms (blue) can be used for Spells, Items and Locations. Charms specialises in low but versatile damage and some other effects, such as locating cards from a player's deck. * Potions (green) can be used for Spells, Items and Locations. Potions cards are often very powerful and require comparatively low Power costs, although they usually require a sacrifice of a certain number of Lessons. * Quidditch (yellow) can be used for Spells, Items, Locations and Matches. This Lesson type was introduced in the Quidditch Cup expansion, and specialises in cards that have two effects at once. * Transfiguration (red) can be used for Spells, Items and Locations. These cards specialise in the removal of Creatures, Lessons and other cards from play while not directly damaging the opposition. =Keywords= Some cards have keywords in addition to their card type. These keywords allow other cards to refer to a specific type of card. The \\"Wizard\\" or \\"Witch\\" designation on Character cards is an example of a keyword, as is the \\"Healing\\" designation on some other cards. Other common keywords include designations representing each of the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Some cards (including all Characters) have the keyword \\"Unique\\", which indicates that only one of them can be in play at a time (for either player). The only exception is if both players have the same starting Character. History =Card sets= The expansions are represented by a symbol on each card. The first set of cards, now commonly called the base set, was introduced in August 2001. Since the 116-card base set was first released, four expansion sets have been introduced to vary play and expand card availability. The first three expansions, which each consist of 80 cards plus 30 Foil or Hologram Portrait Premium rares, include Quidditch Cup (November 2001), Diagon Alley (March 2002), and Adventures at Hogwarts (June 2002). Notable differences in these expansions include the addition of the Quidditch lesson type and Match cards introduced in the Quidditch Cup expansion, location cards introduced in the Diagon Alley expansion, and a larger pool of adventure cards in the Adventures at Hogwarts expansion. The fourth and final expansion released was Chamber of Secrets, which has 140 cards plus 55 Foil or Hologram Portrait Premium rares (October 2002). This last expansion features cards based on the Chamber of Secrets book, where all previous cards were based on the Sorcerer's Stone book. From its conception in 2001 through 2003, the Harry Potter Trading Card Game was popular among many age ranges and several gaming leagues were formed. After releasing the last expansion set in 2003, Wizards of the Coast decided not to continue making HPTCG cards, though no explanation was given to the public for this decision. =Card value= Each card has its own specific value, the most valuable being \\"rare\\" and the least being \\"common\\". The value of a card is shown by a symbol at the bottom right of the card, followed by the expansion set symbol and set number. A circle means that the card is common, and therefore not very valuable; a diamond means the card is uncommon, so the card has a bit of value; and a star means the card is rare, and is more valuable. There are also cards of more value than \\"rare\\" cards: foils and holofoils. \\"Foil premium\\" cards are partially \\"shiny\\", having thunderbolts and stars as theme for the \\"additional covering\\". These are normally rare cards, but common and uncommon foils do exist. \\"Holo-portraits premium\\", (colloquially \\"holofoil\\") are the most rare and the most valuable of all types of cards. These cards are only available for \\"character\\" cards, which have the portrait of the character on them (origin of name). They are similar to foils, except that the picture of the character has a holographic quality that gives the impression of \\"popping out\\". Given the variety of card values, single cards have a price range of $0.05‚Äì15.00. =Card availability= The cards from this game are sold in three ways: booster packs, starter decks, and theme decks. Booster packs were released for every set. Each pack contains eleven cards, which includes one rare card, two uncommon cards, six common cards, and two Lessons. If a premium card was included in a base set booster pack, it replaced the rare card. In the expansions, a premium card replaced one of the common cards. Starter decks were made with the Base set, Diagon Alley set, and the Chamber of Secrets set. Each included two introductory decks of 40 cards, a playmat, additional instructions and two premium cards. Theme decks, a special kind of starter pack, were released to the public with the Chamber of Secrets set. These decks are the Percy Weasley Potions deck and the Twin Trouble deck. Included in each was a full 60-card deck, playable right out of the box. The packaging for two additional theme decks (Hannah Abbott's Spellcaster and Dean Thomas' Restrike) was made for a toy fair in 2001, but the products were never produced. =Playing online= Virtual card games LackeyCCG and Apprentice allow for online play. =Lawsuit= In 2002, Wizards of the Coast filed a lawsuit against former vice president of operations Charles Federline, alleging that he cost the company more than $93,000 by undermining the bidding process for the print work for the cards. = Revival = Since 2015, there are new plans for an unofficial revival of the game through organizing yearly tournaments at the Gen Con.

Following his service in the Canadian militia during the Red River Rebellion (1870) and the Northwest Rebellion (1885), he was commissioned as an inspector in the North-West Mounted Police in 1886. After serving in Banff and Regina, he was sent to examine conditions in the Yukon district in 1894 as the government was concerned about the influx of American miners and the liquor trade. He forecast that a gold rush was imminent and reported that there was an urgent need for a police force. In the following year, he went back to the Yukon with a force of 20 men who were in place when the Klondike Gold Rush started in 1897. Constantine's efforts ensured that law was maintained during the gold rush, that Canadian sovereignty was assured and helped create the Mounties' international reputation. He left the Yukon in 1898, replaced by Sam Steele and returned to the prairies after being promoted to Superintendent. In 1902, he returned to the north to establish forts at Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories and Herschel Island off the Yukon Arctic Ocean coast. This was the first foray by the NWMP north of the Arctic circle. After returning to the Athabasca District in 1905, Constantine was responsible for building a trail from Fort St. John, British Columbia to Teslin Lake in the Yukon, although work on the trail was abandoned in 1908. He died in 1912 in California following an operation.  Family  In 1873, Constantine married Henrietta Anne Armstrong.

It was later upgraded to the 956B in 1984. In 1983, driven by Stefan Bellof, this car established a record that would stand for 35 years, lapping the famed 20.832 km (12.93 mi) N√ºrburgring Nordschleife in 6:11.13 during qualifying for the 1000 km Sports Car race. The record was finally surpassed by Timo Bernhard in a derestricted Porsche 919 Evo on 29 June 2018.5:19.55 minutes ‚Äì Porsche 919 Hybrid Evo takes record on Porsche Newsroom Development Built to comply with the championship's new Group C regulations which were introduced in 1982, the car was a replacement for Porsche's successful 936 model which competed in the previous Group 6 category of the World Championship. The project began in June 1981, and the first prototype chassis was completed on March 27, 1982, in time for the beginning of the World Championship season. J√ºrgen Barth tested the first chassis at Porsche's private test track. The 956 features a chassis made of an aluminium monocoque, a first for the company, helping to allow the car to meet the weight minimum in Group C. The engine is the same as the one used in the Porsche 936/81, the Type-935 2.65 L turbocharged Flat-6, producing approximately (originally developed as an Indycar engine; hence the cubic capacity used). The very first dual clutch gearbox was also designed for the 956, mated to a traditional 5-speed manual. An improved chassis with better fuel efficiency from a Bosch Motronic electric system was developed for 1984, being termed the 956B. In total, twenty-eight 956s would be built by Porsche from 1982 to 1984, with an unofficial 29th chassis built from spare parts by Richard Lloyd Racing. The 956 was also the first Porsche to have ground effect aerodynamics. As a comparison, the ground effects Porsche 956 produced over three times as much downforce as the older model Porsche 917 that raced over a decade earlier. In 1983, 956 chassis #107 was used by Porsche as a testbed for their P01 Formula One engine, later badged as TAG and used exclusively by McLaren. The car was able to test some of the characteristics of a Formula One car in order to develop the engine. The engine became highly successful in F1, and while never the most powerful on the grid, between 1984 and 1987, the turbocharged TAG-Porsche would win 25 Grands Prix and help McLaren to two Constructors and three World Driver's Championships. As of the 2012 German Grand Prix, the TAG-Porsche engine sits in 7th place on the list of F1 race winning engines. The Porsche 956 mounted upside down at the Porsche Museum to symbolize its legendary downforce.Porsche tested its Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe (PDK) dual-clutch transmission in the 956 in the early 1980s. PDK would be used in the Porsche 962, and would eventually make its way into production Porsches with the 2009 997 Carrera and Carrera S. The Porsche 956 also appeared with two different rear wing designs. The cars were fitted with a larger, high downforce rear wing for most events. For the Circuit de la Sarthe at Le Mans however where top speed on the almost long Mulsanne Straight was essential, the 956 was fitted with a much lower and smaller 'low drag' wing to enable the cars to reach speeds of around . Some of the privateer teams would also experiment with a front wing attached to the cars at the tighter circuits in an effort to increase front downforce, but wind tunnel testing eventually found that these wings were disrupting the airflow over the car and actually increased the aerodynamic drag making the cars slower in a straight line. Notably, the factory backed Rothmans Porsche team did not make use of the smaller front wings. Many attributed this to the fact that the Rothmans cars used a one piece body undertray which helped increase the downforce generated by the ground effect aerodynamics while the customer 956's used a twin undertray which disrupted the air flow and slightly decreased the downforce.Porsche 956 at Ultimatecarpage.com The 956 would be officially replaced by the Porsche 962 in 1985, an evolution in the 956's design. Racing history J√§germeister sponsored 956 run by privateer Brun Motorsport. Four customer Porsche 956s. The 956 made its debut at the Silverstone 6 Hour race, the second round of the World Championship for Makes with Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell driving for the factory. After missing the following round at the 1000 km N√ºrburgring for developmental reasons, the Ickx/Bell unit reappeared at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. They led the race for the entire 24 hours, eventually taking the overall win - their third win together. As they had already won in 1981 with a Porsche 936 that had used an early version of the 956 engine, their car had started number 1. The two other factory 956 followed them, so the three factory Porsches finished 1-2-3 in the order of their starting numbers. Boosted by this success, Porsche sold customer versions of the 956 to privateer teams such as Joest Racing, Obermaier Racing, John Fitzpatrick Racing, Richard Lloyd Racing, Kremer Racing and Brun Motorsport who raced them independently of the factory. The overall all-time lap record for the demanding 20 km N√ºrburgring-Nordschleife circuit in the Eifel Mountains was achieved during the qualifying session for the 1983 1000km of N√ºrburgring, by Stefan Bellof, who drove his 956 around in 6 minutes 11.13 seconds, at an average speed of . The race lap record is held by the same Bellof, during the 1983 1000 km N√ºrburgring, the lap being clocked at 6:25.91. At the 1985 1000 km of Spa, Bellof died after his Brun Motorsport's 956 collided with the factory team's newer 962 that being driven by Jacky Ickx. Safety concerns over the 956 led to its eventual end as teams upgraded to the safer 962. The 956's last win would come courtesy of Joest Racing in the last race of the 1986 WEC season, in what also turned out to be the 956's last race.

Barker (April 2, 1886 - February 23, 1945) was a pioneer film director. Biography Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, Barker's family moved to Scotland when he was an infant and then to the United States. Living in California, Barker wrote, produced, and acted in his first play at the age of sixteen following which he acted and handled stage manager duties with a traveling stock company. At age nineteen, he went to New York City where he worked as a stage manager for Henry Miller. Barker made his Broadway acting debut in 1910 in the Shubert brothers production of \\"Mary Magdalene\\" written by Maurice Maeterlinck. Fascinated by the fledgling film business, Barker soon joined the Bison Motion Pictures division of the New York Motion Picture Company. At the company's studio/ranch in California, he worked under film producer and screenwriter Thomas H. Ince. Acting was not Barker's forte and he trained as an assistant director until 1912 when he directed his first film, a twenty-minute western titled \\"On the Warpath\\" starring Art Acord. Barker went on to direct more than eighty films, including the acclaimed 1915 American Civil War drama The Coward. That same year he directed The Italian but because Thomas H. Ince was notorious for credit-grabbing, Barker originally went uncredited on this film. \\"The Italian\\" has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The following year, with the United States still not involved in World War I, Barker co-directed the famous anti- war feature, Civilization. During his career, Reginald Barker directed early stars such as Geraldine Farrar, William S. Hart, Sessue Hayakawa, Gladys Brockwell, Hoot Gibson, Willard Mack, and Myrna Loy. In his first talkie, \\"The Toilers\\" (1928) he directed Douglas Fairbanks Jr.. Barker made his last film in 1935. Titled \\"The Healer,\\" it starred Ralph Bellamy, Karen Morley and Mickey Rooney. Reginald Barker retired to Pasadena, California where he and his wife operated a gift shop until his death from a heart attack in 1945. He is interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.

Description  These terrestrial orchids have root tubers instead of pseudobulbs. They are extremely diverse in appearance. They produce an erect stem. The inflorescence is a cylindrical to globular spike, long, with yellow, red to purple flowers. They start flowering at the base, slowly progressing upwards, except for the Monkey orchid (Orchis simia), which flowers in reverse order. The original genus Orchis used to contain more than 1,300 names. Since it was polyphyletic, it has been divided by Pridgeon et al., into several new genera (see Reference): Ponerorchis, Schizodium, Steveniella.

In Set√∫bal, Jorginho's first year was short of impressive, scoring two goals in 32 games. In the 2002‚Äì03 campaign, while he netted ten times, he saw Vit√≥ria sink to the second division, but helped them return to the top flight in the immediate year with a career-best 17 goals. Jorginho would help Set√∫bal achieve a secure mid-table position in 2004‚Äì05 ‚Äì which was at risk following Jos√© Couceiro's departure to FC Porto ‚Äì and while he could have left Set√∫bal during the January 2005 transfer window on a free transfer, he remained at the club and was presented with a victory in the Cup of Portugal: after scoring twice in the side's 3‚Äì1 semi-final defeat of Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es, he played the entire 2‚Äì1 final win against S.L. Benfica,Meyong magic seals Set√∫bal joy; UEFA.com, 29 May 2005 and added nine league goals. Jorginho eventually left for Porto, where he gained the confidence of manager Co Adriaanse (despite being signed still with Couceiro in charge), playing an attacking trio with Benni McCarthy, Lisandro L√≥pez and Adriano. Towards the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, he proved decisive in a thrilling Sporting Clube de Portugal vs Porto title-decider, having scored the winning goal during the last minutes of the 8 April 2006 match (1‚Äì0 final result);Jorginho breaks Sporting hearts; UEFA.com, 8 April 2006 Porto went on the conquer the title (he had also scored in the first encounter between the two sides in Porto, a 1‚Äì1 draw). The following campaign, under Jesualdo Ferreira, Jorginho featured much less, but managed to score against former side Vit√≥ria in a 5‚Äì1 home success. On 30 August 2007, he signed with perennial UEFA Cup qualification candidates S.C. Braga, on a four-year link.Braga seal Jorginho coup; UEFA.com, 30 August 2007 In August 2009, Jorginho left Portugal and joined Turkish team Gaziantepspor on a two-year contract. He signed alongside Braga teammate Roland Linz, returning to Portugal after two years and joining Rio Ave F.C. also from the top flight.

'sociolinguistics' full text: \\"Fundamental notions such as 'language' and 'dialect' are primarily social, not linguistic, constructs, because they depend on society in crucial ways.\\" The adage was popularized by sociolinguist and Yiddish scholar Max Weinreich, who heard it from a member of the audience at one of his lectures. Weinreich This statement is usually attributed to Max Weinreich, a specialist in Yiddish linguistics, who expressed it in Yiddish: The earliest known published source is Weinreich's article Der YIVO un di problemen fun undzer tsayt ( \\"The YIVO Faces the Post-War World\\"; literally \\"The YIVO and the problems of our time\\"), originally presented as a speech on 5 January 1945 at the annual YIVO conference. Weinreich did not give an English version. In the article, Weinreich presents this statement as a remark of an auditor at a lecture series given between 13 December 1943 and 12 June 1944: In his lecture, he discusses not just linguistic, but also broader, notions of \\"yidishkeyt\\" (◊ô◊ô÷¥◊ì◊ô◊©◊ß◊ô◊ô◊ò ‚Äì lit. Jewishness). The sociolinguist and Yiddish scholar Joshua Fishman suggested that he might have been the auditor at the Weinreich lecture. However, Fishman was assuming that the exchange took place at a conference in 1967, more than twenty years later than the YIVO lecture (1945) and in any case does not fit Weinreich's description above. Other mentions Some scholars believe that Antoine Meillet had earlier said that a language is a dialect with an army, but there is no contemporary documentation of this.William Bright, editorial note in Language in Society, 26:469 (1997): \\"Some scholars believe that the [Yiddish] saying is an expansion of a quote from Antoine Meillet, to the effect that a language is a dialect with an army. Up to now the source has not been found in the works of Meillet.\\" Jean Laponce noted in 2004 that the phrase had been attributed in \\"la p√©tite histoire\\" (essentially anecdote) to Hubert Lyautey (1854‚Äì1934) at a meeting of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise; Laponce referred to the adage as \\"la loi de Lyautey\\" 'Lyautey's law'.

Negotiations with France shortly before World War II had shown that the French government was willing to make appropriate changes in the boundaries between Thailand and French Indochina, but only slightly. Following the Fall of France in 1940, Major- General Plaek Pibulsonggram (popularly known as \\"Phibun\\"), the prime minister of Thailand, decided that France's defeat gave the Thais an even better chance to regain the vassal state territories that were ceded to France during King Chulalongkorn's reign. The German military occupation of Metropolitan France rendered France's hold on its overseas possessions, including French Indochina, tenuous. The colonial administration was now cut off from outside help and outside supplies. After the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in September 1940, the French were forced to allow Japan to set up military bases. This seemingly subservient behavior lulled the Phibun regime into believing that France would not seriously resist a military confrontation with Thailand. Opposing forces =French= French colonial troops poster The French military forces in Indochina consisted of an army of approximately 50,000 men, 12,000 of whom were French, organized into forty-one infantry battalions, two artillery regiments, and a battalion of engineers. The French army had a shortage of armor, and it could field only 20 Renault FT tanks against the nearly one hundred Royal Thai Army armored vehicles. The bulk of the French forces stationed near the Thai border consisted of the Indochinese infantry of the 3rd and 4th Regiments of Tirailleurs Tonkinois (Tonkinese Rifles), together with a battalion of Montagnards (indigenous Vietnamese highlanders), French regulars of the Colonial Infantry, and French Foreign Legion units.Rives, Maurice. Les Linh Tap. page 90 The French navy in Indochina had one light cruiser and four Avisos. The Arm√©e de l'Air (French Air Force) had approximately 100 aircraft, of which roughly 60 could be considered front line. These included thirty Potez 25 TOE reconnaissance/fighters-bombers, four Farman 221 heavy bombers, six Potez 542 bombers, nine Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters, and eight Loire 130 reconnaissance/bombers flying boats. =Thai= Plaek Phibunsongkhram inspecting troops during the war The slightly larger Thai Army was a relatively well-equipped force. Consisting of 60,000 men, it was made up of four armies. The largest were the Burapha Army with five divisions and the Isan Army with three divisions. Independent formations under direct control of the army high command included two motorized cavalry battalions, one artillery battalion, one signals battalion, one engineer battalion, and one armored regiment. The artillery was a mixture of Krupp guns and modern Bofors guns and howitzers, while 60 Carden Loyd tankettes and 30 Vickers 6-ton tanks made up the bulk of the army's tank force. The Royal Thai Navy included two Thonburi coastal defense ships, 12 torpedo boats, and four Japanese-made submarines.Young, Edward M. (1995) Aerial Nationalism: A History of Aviation in Thailand. Smithsonian Institution Press. The Thai navy was inferior to the French naval forces, but the Royal Thai Air Force held both a quantitative and qualitative edge over the local Arm√©e de l'Air units. Among the 140 aircraft that composed the air force's first-line strength were 24 Mitsubishi Ki-30 light bombers, nine Mitsubishi Ki-21 heavy bombers, 25 Curtiss Hawk 75N fighter planes, six Martin B-10 medium bombers, and 70 Vought O2U Corsair observation/attack aircraft.Royal Thai Air Force. (1976) The History of the Air Force in the Conflict with French Indochina. Bangkok. Campaign While nationalist demonstrations and anti-French rallies were being held in Bangkok, several border skirmishes erupted along the Mekong frontier. The superior Royal Thai Air Force then conducted daytime bombing runs over military targets in Vientiane, Phnom Penh, Sisophon, and Battambang with impunity. The French retaliated with their own air attacks, but the damage they caused was less than equal. The activities of the Thai air force, particularly in the field of dive-bombing, was such that Admiral Jean Decoux, the governor of French Indochina, grudgingly remarked that the Thai planes seemed to have been flown by men with plenty of war experience.Elphick, Peter. (1995) Singapore: the Pregnable Fortress: A Study in Deception, Discord and Desertion. Coronet Books. French troops used a handful of World War I-era Renault FT tanks during the conflict. The French Arm√©e de l'Air flew Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters (a preserved specimen is shown). The Vickers light amphibious tank saw service in the Thai (Siamese) army. On 5 January 1941, following the report of a French attack on the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet, the Thai Burapha and Isan Armies launched an offensive on Laos and Cambodia. French response was instantaneous, but many units were simply swept aside by the better-equipped Thai forces. The Thai army swiftly overran Laos, but the French forces in Cambodia managed to rally and offer more resistance.Vichy versus Asia: The Franco-Siamese War of 1941 The naval Battle of Ko Chang, January 17, 1941 At dawn on January 16, 1941, the French launched a large counterattack on the Thai-held villages of Yang Dang Khum and Phum Preav, initiating the fiercest battle of the war. Due to poor coordination and nonexistent intelligence against the entrenched and well-prepared Thai forces, the French operation was stopped and fighting ended with a French retreat from the area. However, the Thais were unable to pursue the retreating French, as their forward tanks were kept in check by the gunnery of French Foreign Legion artillery. With the situation on land rapidly deteriorating for the French, Admiral Decoux ordered all available French naval forces into action in the Gulf of Thailand. In the early morning of 17 January, a French naval squadron caught a Thai naval detachment by surprise at anchor off Ko Chang island. The subsequent Battle of Ko Chang was a tactical victory for the French and resulted in the sinking of two Thai torpedo boats and the disabling of a coastal defense ship, with the French suffering no casualties.\\"The Battle of Koh Chang (January 1941)\\" netmarine.net Fearing the war would turn in France's favor, the Japanese intervened, proposing an armistice be signed. On 24 January, the final air battle took place when Thai bombers raided the French airfield at Angkor, near Siem Reap. The last Thai mission bombing Phnom Penh commenced at 07:10 on 28 January, when the Martins of the 50th Bomber Squadron set out on a raid on Sisophon, escorted by thirteen Hawk 75Ns of the 60th Fighter Squadron. Armistice The provinces ceded from Cambodia by France to Thailand were regrouped into new Thai provinces: Phra Tabong, Phibunsongram, and Nakhon Champassak Japan subsequently stepped in to mediate the conflict. A Japanese- sponsored \\"Conference for the Cessation of Hostilities\\" was held at Saigon, and preliminary documents for a ceasefire between the governments of Marshal Philippe P√©tain's French State and the Kingdom of Thailand were signed aboard the cruiser Natori on 31 January 1941. A general armistice had been arranged to go into effect at 10:00 on 28 January. On 9 May, a peace treaty was signed in Tokyo, with the French being coerced by the Japanese to relinquish their hold on the disputed border territories. France ceded the following provinces to Thailand from Cambodia and Laos: * Battambang and Pailin, which were reorganized as Phra Tabong Province * Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey and Oddar Meanchey, which were reorganized as Phibunsongkhram Province * Preah Vihear, which was merged with a part of Champassak Province of Laos opposite Pakse to form Nakhon Champassak Province * Xaignabouli, including part of Luang Prabang Province, which was renamed Lan Chang Province Treaty The resolution of the conflict was widely acclaimed by the people of Thailand, and was seen as a personal triumph for Phibun. For the first time in its history, Thailand had been able to extract concessions from a European power, albeit a weakened one. For the French in French Indochina, the conflict was a bitter reminder of their isolation after the Fall of France. They felt that an ambitious neighbor had taken advantage of a distant colony being cut off from a weakened parent. Without hope of reinforcements, the French had little chance of offering a sustained resistance. To commemorate the victory, Phibun erected the Victory Monument in Bangkok. Thailand invited Japan and Germany to join in the celebration of its construction. The Japanese wanted to maintain both their working relationship with Vichy and the status quo; therefore, the Thais were forced to accept only a quarter of the territory that they gained from the French, in addition to having to pay six million piastres as a concession to the French. However, the real beneficiaries of the conflict were the Japanese, who were able to expand their influence in both Thailand and Indochina. The Japanese wanted to use Thailand and Indochina as their military bases to invade British Burma and British Malaya later. The Japanese won from Phibun a secret verbal promise to support them in an attack on Malaya and Burma. Phibun did not keep his word.Charivat Santaputra (1985) Thai Foreign Policy 1932-1946. Thammasat University Press. Relations between Japan and Thailand were subsequently stressed, as a disappointed Phibun switched to courting the British and Americans to ward off what he saw as an imminent Japanese invasion.Judith A. Stowe. (1991) Siam becomes Thailand: A Story of Intrigue. University of Hawaii Press. However, on 8 December 1941, the Japanese invaded Thailand at the same time as the Japanese invasion of Malaya. It was immediately before the attack on Pearl Harbor because of the International Date Line. Pearl Harbor was attacked one-and-a-half hours after Malaya and Thailand were. Fighting between Japanese and Thai forces lasted only five hours before a ceasefire was agreed. Thailand would be allied with Japan until 1945. After the war, in October 1946, northwestern Cambodia and the two Lao enclaves on the Thai side of the Mekong River were returned to French sovereignty when the French provisional government threatened to veto Thailand's membership in the United Nations.Terwiel, B.J. (2005) Thailand's Political History: From the Fall of Ayutthaya to Recent Times. River Books. Casualties The French army suffered a total of 321 casualties, of whom 15 were officers. The total number of missing after 28 January was 178 (six officers, 14 non-commissioned officers and 158 enlisted men). The Thais had captured 222 men (17 North Africans, 80 Frenchmen, and 125 Indochinese). The Thai army suffered 54 men killed in action and 307 wounded. 41 sailors and marines of the Thai navy were killed, and 67 wounded. At the Battle of Ko Chang, 36 men were killed, of whom 20 belonged to HTMS Thonburi, 14 to HTMS Songkhla, and two to HTMS Chonburi. The Thai air force lost 13 men. The number of Thai military personnel captured by the French was just 21. About 30 percent of the French aircraft were rendered unserviceable by the end of the war, some as a result of minor damage sustained in air raids that remained unrepaired. The Arm√©e de l'Air admitted the loss of one Farman F221 and two Morane M.S.406s destroyed on the ground, but its losses were really greater. In its first experience of combat, the Royal Thai Air Force claimed to have shot down five French aircraft and destroyed 17 on the ground, against the loss of three of its own in the air and another five to 10 destroyed in French air raids on Thai airfields.

History =First bridge= The original bridge at the site was a wooden covered bridge with six spans, probably utilizing Burr trusses. It was built in 1819 by a contractor named Lothrop. =Second bridge= In 1859, the second Sixth Street Bridge was built by John Roebling, who built this bridge as his third and final bridge in Pittsburgh. It had two main spans of with shore spans of . The floors were suspended from wire hangers that were then suspended from wire catenaries. This bridge was demolished in 1892, as modern transportation rendered it too narrow and fragile. =Third bridge= In 1892, the third Sixth Street Bridge was built by an engineer named Theodore Cooper for the Union Bridge Company. The main spans were long, each having through trusses of the camel-back type with upward-angled upper chords, and were twice as wide as the previous bridge. In 1927 the bridge had to be taken apart because the steelwork was too brittle for safety. So in 1927, the main spans were somewhat trimmed down temporarily from their height which were then lowered onto barges and floated down the Ohio River to the back channel of Neville Island to become part of the Coraopolis Bridge. Finally in 1994 the steel was scrapped.Kidney, Walter C. Pittsburgh's Bridges: Architecture and Engineering. Pittsburgh, PA: Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation, 1999. Print. =Current bridge= The current bridge was completed on September 29, 1928. It is one of the ‚ÄòThree Sisters‚Äô bridges, which also include the 7th and 9th Street Bridges. The three bridges are nearly identical self-anchored, eye- bar suspension type, so called because the horizontal pull of the top cords is resisted by the steel girders along each side of the roadway. The suspension system consists of 14\\" eye-bars extending from end to end having two pins on the top of each tower and carrying the roadway by 4\\" eye-bar suspenders at the panel points. The stiffening system consists of triple web plate girders placed parallel to the road grade. The girders are thus subjected to stresses due to bending combined with direct compression. All three bridges were fabricated and erected by American Bridge (AB). In an innovative approach, AB turned the eye-bar catenary/deck girder system temporarily into a truss by adding a diagonal to enable erection by balance cantilever and avoiding falsework in the river. Significance Named for the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball player Roberto Clemente, it is one of three parallel bridges called The Three Sisters, the others being the Rachel Carson Bridge and the Andy Warhol Bridge. The Three Sisters are self-anchored suspension bridges and are significant because they are the only trio of nearly identical bridges‚Äîas well as the first self-anchored suspension spans‚Äîbuilt in the United States. Over 720 bridges link the city districts.Pittsburgh. (2010). In The Hutchinson Unabridged Encyclopedia with Atlas and Weather guide. Retrieved from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/heliconhe/pittsburgh The Sixth Street Bridge's piers were built with arched openings beneath the river bed in order to accommodate future subway tunnels, following the recommendation of transportation planner Bion J. Arnold.Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) No. PA-490, \\"Three Sisters Bridges\\" , p. 36. The North Shore Connector tunnels completed in 2012 did not make use of this provision, but were bored further west (downstream) and do not pass beneath the bridge. The bridge was renamed on August 6, 1998, as part of a compromise after the Pirates sold the naming rights to PNC Park to locally based PNC Financial Services. Before the naming rights were sold, there was hugely popular sentiment in Pittsburgh to name the park itself after Clemente. It is closed to vehicular traffic on Pirates' and Steelers' game days, providing a pedestrian route to PNC Park and Heinz Field. When PNC Park was built, a statue of Roberto Clemente, originally erected at Three Rivers Stadium, was placed at the southeast corner of the park, right at the north anchorage of the Roberto Clemente Bridge. The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation in cooperation with the Riverlife Task Force, the City of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne Light Company, funded and managed the architectural lighting of the bridge. On November 20, 2002, the bridge was lit for the first time. Plaque on the North Shore of the Sixth Street Bridge.

It was created through the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, Foreign Assistance Act 1969 as an experimental alternative to traditional foreign assistance that operates government-to-government on a much larger scale. The IAF receives its funds through annual allocations by Congress and from the Social Progress Trust Fund, Social Progress Trust Fund administered by the Inter-American Development Bank and consisting of payments on U.S. government loans extended under the Alliance for Progress to various Latin American and Caribbean governments. Since beginning operations in 1972, the IAF has awarded 4,920 grants worth more than $665 million., IAF Annual Report. The IAF has had a low profile because of its comparatively small budget. However, during the mid-1980s, the IAF received some national attention when it became a political battleground for President Ronald Reagan and Congressional Democrats. Beginnings Representative Dante B. Fascell (D-Fla.) was the architect of the legislation to establish the Inter-American Foundation, which redesigned foreign aid to benefit the poorest of people in developing countries.[proust.library.miami.edu/findingaids/index.php?p.], Dante B. Fascell Bio With his articles in Foreign Affairs and his book The Engines of Change, Harvard professor George C. Lodge significantly influenced the intellectual climate that led to the passage of the IAF's enabling legislation. Most notably, Lodge wrote that poverty was the greatest threat to U.S. interests in the Americas. In ‚ÄúU.S. Aid to Latin America: Funding Radical Change,‚Äù which appeared in Foreign Affairs in July 1969.,, U.S. Aid to Latin America: Funding Radical Change he urged creation of an ‚ÄúAmerican Foundation [to] find and fund the engines of change which work directly to revolutionize Latin American social and political structures.‚Äù Lodge was appointed to the IAF's founding board of directors in 1971., George C. Lodge Bio. Mission statement ‚Äú‚Ä¶it shall be the purpose of the foundation, primarily in cooperation with private regional and international organizations, to # strengthen the bonds of friendship and understanding among the peoples of this hemisphere; # support self-help efforts designed to enlarge the opportunities for individual development; # stimulate and assist effective and ever wider participation of the people in the development process; # encourage the establishment and growth of democratic institutions, private and governmental, appropriate to the requirements of the individual sovereign nations of this hemisphere.‚Äù ‚ÄîPart IV, Section 401(b), Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 The guiding principle of the Inter-American Foundation is responsiveness to the ideas of organized people who are willing to invest and risk their own resources. Grant program The IAF funds initiatives received in response to its call for proposals from grassroots groups and the organizations that support them in Latin America and the Caribbean. Projects are selected for funding on the basis of merit rather than by sector. Successful applicants receive between US$25,000 and US$400,000 over a period of from one to five years. IAF grantees are required to contribute in cash or in kind toward the success of their projects and are encouraged to mobilize resources to continue their impact after their IAF funding has ended. The IAF does not accept proposals presented or directed by government entities or by entities outside the country in which the project is located; proposals from individuals; proposals associated with political parties or partisan movements; proposals for purely religious or sectarian activities; proposals for pure research; proposals for welfare projects of any kind; proposals from charitable institutions; or proposals solely for construction and/or equipment. The IAF looks for the following in a project it funds: innovative solutions; creative use of community resources; feasibility; a diverse array of community voices in project development and execution; substantial beneficiary engagement in (a) the identification of the problem addressed, (b) the approach chosen to solve it, (c) the design of the project, and (d) management and evaluation of activities; partnerships with local government, the business community and other civil society organizations; a potential for strengthening all participating organizations and their partnerships; evidence of eventual sustainability; counterpart contributions from beneficiaries and other sources as well as from the proponent; the potential to generate learning; measurable results; evidence of enhanced capacity for self-governance., IAF Grant Program Fellowship program The IAF is the only institution that specifically funds research targeting grassroots development in Latin America and the Caribbean. Its Fellowship Program launched in 1974 has supported doctoral students, post- doctoral researchers, master's degree candidates and, between 1991 and 1995 a handful of outstanding Latin American and Caribbean grassroots leaders awarded the Dante B. Fascell Inter-American Fellowship to pursue independent study. Alumni now total 1,047 individuals; they worked in 35 countries and represent 117 U.S. universities in 36 states.

Features Its features include CD ripping and burning, access to LAUNCHcast and the Yahoo! Music Unlimited music subscription service, playlist creation, transfer of music to select portable devices such as mp3 players and USB flash drives. The program allows Yahoo! Messenger users to stream music to one another (not to be confused with uploading and downloading or filesharing) and browse one another's playlists. Only those subscribed to Yahoo! Unlimited can add entire songs to their collections, however. Non-subscribers are limited to a thirty-second sample. One can rip songs in a variety of formats including .wav, .mp3, and .wmv. One cannot rip songs in the .wma format, despite the fact that songs purchased from Yahoo! are encoded using that format. Another strange format issue within the player, the CD burner; it can burn .mp3 CD's, however, the player itself is incapable of playing an .mp3 CD. The engine also has a number of plugins available for free download from the program's official website below. The programming interfaces for the engine are open; anyone may create a plug-in or skin to modify the behavior of the engine.

The film is a semi- autobiographical story about a young fiction writer who becomes tetraplegic fully paralyzed in a hiking accident and works to rehabilitate his body and mind at a rehabilitation center. The title refers to a dream recounted by Raymond Hill, Snipes' character, about dancing on the surface of a lake. Since, in Raymond's dream, he must continue dancing on the lake to avoid sinking and drowning, the dream may be a metaphorical reference to the necessity of continually coping with the world.  Plot  Joel Garcia (Eric Stoltz) is a writer who, after a hiking accident at a mountain, must struggle with paralysis. At the same time, he carries a relationship with Anna (Helen Hunt), a married woman, with whom he was having an affair at the time of the accident. The lovers attempt to carry on their affair during his emotional and difficult rehabilitation as a paraplegic.

The first event was held in March 2004 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, while the second event was held in September 2005 in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Organisers Flags from across Asia, at FOSSAP II. FOSSAP was organised by the International Open Source Network, which is part of the United Nations Development Programme's Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme. FOSSAP-II was sponsored by UNDP-APDIP with Intel Corporation as its co- sponsors. Local hosts were the National ICT Development Authority (NiDA) of Cambodia and the Open Forum, Cambodia. Goals According to the organisers, FOSSAP II was aimed at providing \\"an effective policy-level platform for the exchange of information and experiences in the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for development\\". FOSS has earlier been described as FLOSS, or Free/Libre and Open Source Software. They also argued that \\"there is a growing need for awareness on the benefits of FOSS, assistance with formulation of national policies, and case studies of FOSS implementation. This consultation sees its primary target as policy-makers \\"who can influence national Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policies\\".  FOSSAP-II  FOSSAP-II was a three-day event, held September 1‚Äì3, 2005, in Siem Reap. It had participants from twenty countries in Asia, including FOSS campaigners, supporters, funders, software developers and government officials. The focus was on capacity building, localisation, development paradigms of Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS), open content, and e-governance. Cambodian deputy prime minister Sok An, in a speech delivered on his behalf, argued that Free and Open Source Software could help a country like Cambodia to have a \\"lot of savings in license fees\\", make software readily available locally and reduce usage costs drastically, eliminate software piracy, and enable Cambodian students to closely study the software code and \\"understand its behaviour\\". Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, said at the end of the conference: \\"People here represent a broad spectrum in beliefs and their goals. There are people from both the Free Software and Open Source movements. It looks like we can work together and make programs that ensure users can be in control of the software they use. I've seen a lot of useful things come up here.\\" Software localisation‚Äîor translating software into local languages‚Äîwas another issue strongly discussed. There were interesting issues that came up about localisation of software into the Khmer language. One of the suggestions to come up was that FOSS needed its \\"global ambassador\\" to promote its case. Kharil Yusuf (left) of Malaysia and Sunil Abraham (India), managers of the IOSN.

Leath Cuinn was the island north of the Esker Riada (east-west drumlin belt from Dublin to Galway Bay). Conn C√©tchathach, for whom this division is named, was a retrospective ancestor of the Connachta and U√≠ N√©ill dynasties. Ireland's legendary ancient division into Leath Cuinn (Conn's Half) and Leath Moga (Mugh's half) resulted from the battle of Maigh Nuadad in 123 A.D. Conn, defeated by Eoghan Mor (also known as Mug Nuadat), was forced to accede to the division of Ireland into two halves: * The North - taking in Connacht, Ulster and Meath - would be Conn's Half * The South - taking in Munster, Osraighe and Leinster - would be Eoghan's Half. To solidify the arrangement, Conn's daughter, Sadhbh was married to Ailill Aulom, son of Eoghan. The Eoganacht dynasty in Munster claimed, as descendants of Oiloill Olum, the historical right as overkings of Leath Moga (i.e. overlordship of Leinster as well as Munster) in the early medieval age, a claim disputed by the Ui Neill. In the twelfth century, the north-south division of Ireland was used as a basis for the new division of dioceses in Ireland at the Synod of R√°th Breasail.

Early life Nightingale was born in West Kensington, London. He attended Christopher Wren Boys' School, in Shepherd's Bush, where he met Paul Cook and Steve Jones, who were also pupils.Jones & Cook interview, 'There'll Always be an England', Julien Temple, Freemantle Home Entertainment (DVD), 2008. The Strand & The Swankers In 1972, at the end of their school years, Nightingale told Cook and Jones they should start a band.Jones & Cook interviews, The Filth and The Fury, Julien Temple, Film Four (DVD), 2000 The three called themselves The Strand, after Roxy Music's song \\"Do the Strand\\"; Jones was the singer, Nightingale played guitar, and Cook was the drummer. Jones and Nightingale stole high-quality instruments and equipment from professional headline musical acts (including Bob Marley, Rod Stewart, and David Bowie) by breaking into venues where they were due to perform. The band began rehearsing at Nightingale's home in East Acton during the day when his parents were out at work. They soon added Del Noones (Paul Cook's brother-in-law) as a bassist, as well as a couple of Steve Jones's friends from Christopher Wren Boys' School, Steve Hayes and Jimmy Macken. They briefly had a conga player named Cecil as well. By late 1974, the band had begun rehearsing at one of the sound stages of Riverside Studios where Nightingale's father was working. Noones was fired from the band for not attending rehearsals; he was replaced by Glen Matlock, a part-time shop assistant at Malcolm McLaren's clothing shop, where Jones and Cook had begun socialising. During this period Nightingale wrote the music for \\"Did You No Wrong\\", a song which eventually became the B-side of the Sex Pistols' single \\"God Save the Queen\\". By this time, Bernie Rhodes had shown an interest in managing the band (which was now called The Swankers), but their only public performance was in early 1975 at a birthday party for one of Cook's friends in Chelsea. At the short three-song gig, the line-up consisted of Jones on vocals, Nightingale on guitar, Matlock on bass and Cook on drums. Jones, who was impressed by McLaren's prior involvement with the New York Dolls, repeatedly requested that McLaren become the band's manager, and in mid-1975 he agreed.'Malcolm McLaren: Artful Dodger', television documentary, British Broadcasting Corporation, 2010. However, McLaren thought Nightingale did not fit the image of the band he had in mind, and told Jones and Cook he would only manage them if they fired Nightingale. Jones, who did not feel comfortable in the singer's role, had been covertly working hard for several months to learn to play guitar. Nightingale was informed that he was being fired upon his arrival for a rehearsal. The Sex Pistols With Nightingale gone, the band changed its name to QT Jones & his Sex Pistols at McLaren's suggestion, but the name was soon shortened to The Sex Pistols. McLaren began looking for a new singer, and settled on John Lydon, who frequently hung around his shop. The Sex Pistols played their first gig on 6 November 1975, six months after Nightingale's departure. In a later interview Nightingale recalled watching them perform at the 100 Club in Oxford Street, commenting that his old bandmates Jones and Cook: \\"wouldn't even talk to me. In hindsight I suppose I'm proud to have been involved in the punk scene, though I don't go around telling everyone of it. After I left (the band) Steve and the others slagged me off in the music press really badly. I never really knew why, I never did them any harm?\\" However, with regard to his views in retrospect on McLaren's part in removing him from the band, in the same interview Nightingale stated: \\"McLaren was devious and clever. He'd see things which other people didn't see, and I suppose that's what gave him his edge. Malcolm made the Sex Pistols.\\" Later life After being forced out of the band, Nightingale continued to pursue a music career, but with limited success. He co-founded a band named Key West in 1981, and a demo of four songs written by Nightingale and Ron Evans was submitted to Warner Bros. Records, who initially showed interest. The band performed shows, had an MTV video filmed and aired, and recorded some demos at Fastbuck Studios in Chiswick. Key West ultimately failed to earn a recording contract and disbanded after two years. After his father's death in 1981, Nightingale developed an addiction to narcotics, and was subsequently imprisoned in the early 1980s for six months for a conviction associated with it. Nightingale's subsequent public musical appearances were rare and sporadic. He appeared as a one-off guest guitarist with the Brentwood punk rock band Beat of the Beast in 1989. In November 1995 he played guitar on the song \\"Rich Girls\\" on Mat Sargent's Sex, Drugs & HIV album. During the same month he also performed live with the HIV charity awareness project band the Rock'n'Roll Gypsies. Death Nightingale died on 6 May 1996 of a drug-related illness at the age of 40. Song writing credits The band that went on to become the Sex Pistols played mainly cover versions of other bands' work, and wrote only two original songs before the arrival of Glen Matlock and John Lydon. One was called \\"Scarface\\" (with music by Nightingale and lyrics written by Nightingale's father, according to Glen Matlock) which was never released. The other song was \\"Did You No Wrong\\", for which Nightingale composed the music and Jones wrote the original lyrics. Jones' lyrics to the latter song were subsequently rewritten by John Lydon in 1977, but Nightingale's musical arrangement remained unchanged, and the song was commercially released as the b-side to the Sex Pistols' second single ‚ÄúGod Save The Queen‚Äù. It was later included on the compilation album Flogging a Dead Horse, and was regularly performed live by the band during their reunion tours in the 1990s and 2000s. The Warner Chappell Music database recognizes Nightingale as the song's co-author. Fictional portrayal A character based upon Nightingale, billed as \\"Wally Hairstyle\\", appeared in the 1986 Sid Vicious biographical film Sid & Nancy, played by Graham Fletcher-Cook.

He followed this degree with another in law at Columbia University in New York. He is licensed to practise law in the state of Louisiana and in Washington, D.C.. Law career in US Stafford Smith worked for the Southern Prisoners' Defense Committee, based in Atlanta, now known as the Southern Center for Human Rights, and on other campaigns to help convicted defendants sentenced to capital punishment. He was featured in Fourteen Days in May (1987), a documentary showing the fortnight prior to the execution of Edward Earl Johnson in Mississippi State Penitentiary. It was aired on the BBC. Stafford Smith had acted as Johnson's attorney and was seen trying to halt the execution. In a follow-up documentary, Stafford Smith conducted his own investigation into the murder case for which Johnson had been executed. In 1993, he helped set up a new justice center for prisoner advocacy in New Orleans. Formerly named the Louisiana Crisis Assistance Center, it is now known as the Louisiana Capital Assistance Center (LCAC). He represented the paedophile Ricky Langley, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The jurors accepted that the accused was suffering from mental illness, but condemned Langley to capital punishment. Stafford Smith made him apologise to the mother of his victim, Jeremy Guillory. Lorilei Guillory asked the DA for a reprieve, which was denied. She said on the witness chair \\"I think he is mentally ill.\\" Later, Stafford Smith, began a group to end the automatic death penalty in USA. In 2002, Stafford Smith became a founding board member of the Gulf Region Advocacy Center, a non- profit law office based in Houston, Texas. It was designed to bring his legal methods developed at LCAC into the \\"capital of capital punishment\\", as Texas had the highest number of executions in the United States.

Smith had to wait until 27 August 2005 to publicly reveal that the hunger strikes had started again on 5 August 2005. Two of his clients, Binyam \\"Benjamin\\" Mohammed and Hisham Sliti, participated in the hunger strikes. In an interview broadcast by BBC television evening news on 9 September 2005, Stafford Smith said that the second hunger strike was to protest against the imprisonment of juveniles under the age of 18 in Guantanamo Bay. Stafford Smith contributed to The Guardian with an opinion piece on the significance of the U.S. Supreme Court's 29 June 2006 ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, which found the Combatant Status Review Tribunals and military commissions to be unconstitutional. The Court held that the executive branch did not have the authority to set up a justice system outside the existing civil and military legal systems.\\"A good day for democracy: The ruling against the Guantanamo tribunals is good news for everyone ‚Äî even George Bush\\" , The Guardian, 30 June 2006. Stafford Smith thought that George W. Bush should have been secretly relieved that the more conservative members of the Supreme Court, who supported the administration's appeal against the lower court's ruling, were in the minority. He wrote: > In the end, I suspect there was a collective sigh of relief from the White > House that the lunatic fringe did not prevail. The Bush administration has > finally recognized that it must close Guant√°namo but ‚Äî for all that Bush > bangs on about the importance of personal responsibility ‚Äî it wanted someone > else to take the blame. Stafford Smith published a memoir about his experiences at Guantanamo, Bad Men: Guant√°namo Bay and the Secret Prisons (2007). It was shortlisted for the 2008 Orwell Prize for political writing.\\"Shortlist 2008\\" , The Orwell Prize Interviewed by Jon Snow of Channel 4 News on 26 March 2009, Stafford Smith said about the treatment of detainees, \\"I would go one step further: the torture decisions were being made in the White House, by the National Security Council, Dick Cheney and Condoleezza Rice.\\" He asserted that although the British had not carried out the torture, they were complicit in it. Stafford Smith concluded that, in trying to keep the torture allegations secret, the US authorities were \\"confusing national security with national embarrassment\\". In July 2010, Stafford Smith accused former Foreign Secretary David Miliband of fighting to prevent the release of vital documents during the Binyam Mohamed case. On 9 June 2015, he told an audience that he had visited the facility 34 times. In 2013, he went on hunger strike as part of a campaign for the release of Guantanamo detainee Shaker Aamer, who was finally released in 2015.

Haley (November 15, 1861 - January 5, 1939) was a teacher, unionist, and Georgist land value tax activist,Arnesen, Eric. Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-class History. New York: Routledge, 2007. who was dubbed the \\"lady labor slugger\\". Haley was the first business representative of the Chicago Teachers' Federation and a pioneer leader in organizing schoolteachers. During her long career with the CTF, Haley fought to correct tax inequalities, increase the salaries of teachers, and expose unfair land leasing by the Chicago Board of Education. Early life and teaching career Haley was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1861 to Irish immigrant parents; her mother came from Dublin, Ireland and her father was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to Irish immigrants from County Clare, Ireland. For the first six years of her life, she lived on a farm. Her parents supported agrarian activism, including the grange. Economic upheaval in the 1880s and the depression of the 1890s contributed to her later activism. At the Illinois Normal School in Bloomington, Illinois. Haley imbibed the lessons of single-tax advocate Henry George. At the Cook County Normal School and the Buffalo School of Pedagogy, she received instruction from progressive educators Francis Wayland Parker and William James. Family financial troubles prompted Haley to begin teaching at age 16 at a country school in Grundy County, Illinois. She moved to Chicago in 1882 to teach in the Cook County school system. In 1884, she took a position as a sixth grade teacher at the Hendricks School in the Stockyards district on Chicago's South Side. She remained there until ending her career as a teacher in 1900. Chicago Teachers' Federation Haley joined the Chicago Teacher's Federation in 1898, and was one of the organization's first district vice- presidents. The fight against the Harper Commission in 1898 constituted Haley‚Äôs first major fight as a member of the Chicago Teachers' Federation. William Rainey Harper, president of the University of Chicago, headed a commission that proposed a complete restructuring of the Chicago school system. The Harper Report called for the superintendent‚Äôs increased power, the instilling of corporate-like efficiency in the schools, the reduction of the school board‚Äôs size, the increase of ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in educational leadership positions, and the introduction of a salary system based on merit that would favor male high school teachers and administrators over the largely female elementary school teachers. Perhaps most well known, the Harper Commission also proposed ninety-nine year leases, not subject to taxation, of school property for Chicago businesses. An illustration in the Chicago Tribune from January 29, 1900, depicts Margaret Haley and Catharine Goggin as key figures in the fight against corporate tax dodgers In late 1899, Haley also joined the ‚Äútax fight‚Äù to ensure that the public schools received due funding, and to keep teachers from having to beg for salary increases and security of pay when the Board of Education pursued inequitable tax and lease policies. After the Harper Bill‚Äôs defeat, Haley and Catherine Goggin strengthened their rule over the CTF, thus purging any opposition within the union and making it one of the most prominent workers' organizations in America. Haley was hired as the CTF's permanent business representative in 1901 during her ongoing work on the tax situation. During the time of the ‚Äútax battle,‚Äù 1900-1904, the Chicago Teachers‚Äô Federation joined the Chicago Federation of Labor, headed by Margaret Haley‚Äôs friend John Fitzpatrick, which led the CTF to become Local 1 of the American Federation of Teachers. Historians debate to what degree labor accepted the teachers, and vice versa. The Chicago Board of Education used the teachers' affiliations with labor as a tool against them. During the 1915-1916 school year the Board of Education created the Loeb rule, which prohibited any alliance between teachers and organized labor. To make matters worse, the Board refused to rehire 68 teachers (38 of whom were members of the CTF) in the aftermath of the decision. The fight went before the Illinois Supreme Court, which ruled against the teachers. The CTF was required to disaffiliate with labor, and it continued as a quasi-legal organization until 1924. The CTF also tied its fortunes to city politics; in 1905 it supported the mayoral bid of Edward Dunne. Like Haley, Dunne favored the municipal ownership of streetcar lines and the principle of popular control. During Dunne's first two-year stint as mayor the power of ‚Äúadministrative progressives‚Äù over teachers diminished. As part of Dunne's ‚ÄúKitchen Cabinet‚Äù, Haley advised the mayor on school issues. Dunne appointed women and CTF supporters to the school board to ensure that business interests did not dominate school policies. Haley took a stand at the national level. In 1901, three years before Haley became president of the National Federation of Teachers, she became the first elementary school teacher to speak before the National Education Association at the St. Louis convention. She presented the famous speech, ‚ÄúWhy Teachers Should Organize‚Äù. She pushed for greater numbers of women in leadership roles at the local and national levels of teachers' unionization. She played in instrumental role in Ella Flagg Young‚Äôs election to president of the National Education Association in 1910, which then paid greater attention to the needs of classroom teachers. Death and legacy Margaret Haley died of a heart attack at Englewood Hospital in Chicago on January 5, 1939, aged 77.

Established in Bohemia in 1756, the company is managed by Georg Riedel and Maximilian Riedel. History =Josef Riedel, The Elder= Josef Riedel The Elder (sixth generation, 1816‚Äì94) was born in the time of the industrial revolution. He owned eight glassworks in 1858 to include two textile factories and coalmines. His glassworks produced glass jewellery, beads and chandelier parts and in 1873, they began producing luxury hollow glass products too. He received many accolades for his achievements: he was awarded the ‚ÄòGrand Prix‚Äô at the World Fair in Vienna in 1873, honorary citizenship by local authorities in Franzesbad and Wiesenthal and he was awarded an Order by the Pope. Through hard work and diligence, he was a contemporary model for success in business. His employees respectfully addressed him as ‚ÄòMr. Father‚Äô and his contemporaries referred to him as the ‚ÄòGlass King of the Iser Mountains‚Äô. Josef Riedel dedicated his life to building an empire with solid foundations. He did not discount prices ‚Äì on the contrary, he offered only quality products and customers appreciated this. In addition, Josef was an extensive landowner, and a well-known banker and financier in the mountainous region. He helped businesses that needed capital, provided loans at 6% interest, and even assisted them financially to find export markets. It was his financial support in 1861, for example, which allowed the company Gebr√ºder Feix in Albrechtsdorf to get started, which went on to become one of the largest manufacturers of buttons, black fashion jewellery and crystal wares in the land. It was in this company where Daniel Swarovski later began his career. The Riedel company operated retail warehouses in all major manufacturing locations around Gablonz. The owners of these companies regularly informed the Riedels about current demand, competition, and big orders that exporters then forwarded to their suppliers for production. Josef Riedel was also respected as a glass expert in his own right. The industrial magnate Josef Schreiber, head of Vienna's big glass company Josef Schreiber & Neffen, even called him the greatest expert on glassmaking in Bohemia. Josef was known as ‚ÄòThe Glass King of the Jizera Mountains‚Äô (1844‚Äì94). Shortly after his death, Josef's sons registered the first Riedel logo in 1895. =The Beginning: Building a Solid Foundation= After Franz Riedel's (Fifth Generation, 1786‚Äì1844) death, his son-in-law Josef and daughter Marie Anna moved into the manor house in Antoniwald and Josef took over the reins of the Klein Iser and Antoniwald Works. However, he did not own any share of his wife's businesses. In 1840, the glassworks in Antoniwald produced an annual 761 tons of clear and coloured glass, small bottles, chandelier trimmings and glass rods. Antoniwald also saw the birth of the couple's sons Hugo (1848‚Äì1883), Wilhelm (1849‚Äì1929) and Otto (1853‚Äì1901). The Klein Iser Works were left in the capable hands of his kinsman Karl Kittel. Kittel retired in 1853 and was replaced by Johann Bengler, a bookkeeper from Christiansthal, who headed up the works for nearly forty years. Begler invented a number of coloured glass types including jet black, lily yellow, antimony ruby, marble-like variations, and the Venetian aventurine. He was awarded the Empire's Golden Service Cross as a tribute to his glassmaking skills. In the early 1850s two long ‚Äòpulling rooms‚Äô were added to the glassworks. These were used to stretch glass to make tubes for the six faceted cut and polished seed beads then in demand. On 6 March 1849, Josef Riedel bought a new glassworks, with his own money, from Ignaz Friedrich, a textile entrepreneur and glass trader. The new glassworks was based in Polaun near Klein Iser and had a wood-burning furnace. It was perfectly located: in 1847, a main road was laid through the Giant Mountains between Reichenberg, Gablonz and Trautenau. This road finally created a connection between Iser and the Giant Mountains with a central Bohemian road network. Under Josef's contract, Friedrich was unable to build a new glass factory for ten years; he agreed to purchase glass solely from Josef; and gave Josef the first right of refusal on any eventual sale of lands in the vicinity of the foundry. After five years, Josef Riedel wanted to update the newly acquired glassworks in Polaun to meet expectations of modern jewellery component production facilities. He rebuilt in 1854‚Äì1856 and added a second furnace and ‚Äòpulling‚Äô facility in 1858. In 1855 his wife Marie-Anna died at the early age of thirty five, leaving Josef as the sole heir. The widowed Josef Riedel and his children remained in Antoniwald until the lease to the works ran out. Only in 1858 did he move his family to Polaun, where he settled in House Number 358, which still stands. This house also formerly belonged to Ignaz Friedrich. For seven years Josef Riedel had been travelling from Antoniwald to Polaun at least three times a week to oversee the rebuilding and later to run the glassworks. He paid the craftsmen, suppliers and glassmakers with his own funds during each trip. In the next decade, the craft of glassmaking turned into an industry and the impoverished region became home to a widely known commodity. In 1859 Josef Riedel married Johanna Neuwinger (1836‚Äì1920), the daughter of the Clam-Gallas's chief forester from Ruppersdorf (near Reichenberg). It was an advantageous marriage, since Josef's glassworks were located on the count's lands and he sourced his timber for Polaun from the Count's forests. =Expansion= At the beginning of the century the Iser Mountains had also become an important hub for the Bohemian textile industry with the mills ranking among the largest in the Empire. Josef wanted to be involved in textiles: in 1858, he began to build a modern cotton mill on the main Giant Mountain road at Gr√ºnthal on the Iser River. The mill was fully operational in 1862 and continued to expand as business was good; 5,000 spindles of cotton were produced here annually. In 1868 the mill was rebuilt again and production doubled to 10,000 spindles per annum. Some of the equipment came from a mill in Polaun, which Josef Riedel had bought at auction in the previous year from none other than Ignaz Friedrich. On 1 September 1863, Josef registered his company under the name of ‚ÄòJosef Riedel‚Äô at the Regional Court of Reichenberg. The second half of the 1860s saw the biggest boom in the history of Gablonz glass bead jewellery. The capacity of local glassworks became inadequate and it was time for investment. Josef Riedel who was fully self-sufficient understood the need to invest. In 1865, he added a second and third furnace to his glassworks in Klein Iser. In 1866, he built a completely modern glassworks in stone, with two furnaces. In 1867 Josef established another works with two furnaces in Gr√ºnthal. The Gr√ºnthal works specialised in the production of chandelier trimmings and glass jewellery rods. In 1868 and 1869, Josef modernised the furnaces at the Neuwiese and Polaun glassworks ‚Äì they were no longer heated by wood and switched to wood gas. Josef was the first to incorporate the groundbreaking regenerative flue gas heat recovery system (first using wood, later using coal) to heat his glass furnaces. This new technology was invented by German engineer Friedrich Siemens between 1856 and 1861 and translated into a saving of 30-50%. In 1878, a competitive (but similar) system from Siebert (patented in 1878) was incorporated in Riedel's factories. Production primarily consisted of jewellery and small glassware. These were purchased in the 1860s and 70s by the large Gablonz trading companies: Josef Pfeiffer, Eduard Dressler and Wilhelm Klaar, as well as smaller businesses in the Iser Mountains. Josef supplied blown hollow glass, small bottles and chandelier trimmings to Steinsch√∂nau and Haida in the B√∂hmisch Leipa region, with key customers including the well-known Steinsch√∂nau chandelier factory owned by Elias Palme. Steinsch√∂nau and Haida were known as the home of chandelier-making. However, the chandelier components came primarily from the Riedel Glassworks in the Iser Mountains. Josef donated a huge chandelier to the Franciscan church in Haindorf in 1853; it had been assembled in Steinsch√∂nau by Josef Helzel & Co. but its parts came from the Josef Riedel glassworks. This was true for similar gifts until Josef established his own factory in Polaun, which could assemble chandeliers. Before that the Polaun glass factory mainly supplied its hollow glass jewellery and small glass goods to customers in London, Vienna, Berlin, Constantinople, Paris and Amsterdam. =Overcoming the Global Crisis: Investment= The 1870s was defined by the first global economic crisis. Dreams of endless economic growth suddenly ended and were replaced by an unprecedented, deep depression. Josef rode the storm and even expanded his empire thanks to a solid business foundation. He survived the crisis by making successful investments. Josef Riedel understood that one of the foundations of successful industrial management was inexpensive energy. He therefore decided to opt for the newly available coal gas to heat his furnaces. On 23 February 1870, he bought mining rights in Hostomitz (in the Teplitz region) and set up mines on the land between 1874 and 1875. On 29 September 1876, Josef also purchased the nearby coalmines from the Saxo-Austrian Brown Coal Mining Company. Josef built a branch line from the nearby station in Tannwald in order to easily transport the coal from Hostomitz to his works in Polaun. The railway line was completed in 1874 and ran from Tannwald to Eisenbrod (which in turn was connected to the main Bohemian railway network). However, the quality of coal that arrived was disappointing ‚Äì as such, the main customers for the Hostomitz mines weren't the Riedel factories at all, but a chemical factory in Aussig and several others in Saxony, for which coal was delivered down the Elbe river. Josef Riedel's fondness for spas and modern medical treatments did not go unsatisfied. In 1870 he bought a spa in Wurzelsdorf and installed peat bath treatments. The spa, under the management of the Bad Wurzelsdorf mills, opened its doors in 1872 and catered for patients suffering from rheumatism, neuralgia, and anaemia. Regardless of these other business ventures, Josef Riedel continued to focus primarily on glass. In 1871 a third furnace was installed in Polaun and the lands surrounding the glassworks changed hands from the Clam-Gallas family to the Riedels. That same year Josef handed over the management of Polaun to his eldest son Hugo Riedel (1848‚Äì1883).  Family  =Hugo Riedel (1848‚Äì1883)= On 1 May 1873, Hugo switched production on one of the furnaces to decorated hollow glass as the demand for glass jewellery was declining while the demand for decorated glass was increasing internationally. Josef had never decorated his glassware in his factories himself before, choosing to concentrate on the base products, including hollow glass, which he would send to be decorated elsewhere ‚Äì or simply let his customers do it. From that moment on, in 1873, Riedel began to produce luxury glass items. This initial move into glass decoration was not without difficulties but success came relatively quickly. In 1873 the Riedels participated in the World Exhibition in Vienna, where they won a gold medal for their wares, including the all-new hollow decorative glass. This was their first award at a prestigious and internationally famous event. The new hollow glass was sold through Riedel's own distributors abroad, directly to foreign partners in Germany, Great Britain and France and to domestic merchants from B√∂hmisch Leipa region and Vienna. Soon after 1873, Hugo installed a chemical lab and a two-pot experimental kiln in Polaun. It was here that new coloured glass and other technological innovations were created and patented. Hugo initiated the production of ruby glass coloured with Dukat Gold, added fine turbid and wound cones used to layer glass, invented Rozalin, came up with new processes to decorating glass with enamel and even designed some of the decorative glass. In 1876, the Polaun glassworks completely switched to coal in its kilns. =Wilhelm Riedel (1849‚Äì1929)= In the first half of the 1870s Josef Riedel brought his two sons Wilhelm and Otto into the business. Josef put Wilhelm Riedel (1849‚Äì1929) at the helm of the flax mill in Untermaxdorf and the Hostomitz coal mines. In 1874 Otto Riedel (1853‚Äì1901) became the director of the Gr√ºnthal mill. In 1877, when Josef turned 61, he took the decision to transform his company into a family business, and so, on 17 February his sons Hugo, Wilhelm and Otto became shareholders in the company ‚ÄòJos. Riedel‚Äô. From that point onward, all four took decisions relative to the future interests of the company. They held meetings every Thursday in Polaun where they evaluated past developments and made plans for what came next. In 1878 Wilhelm Riedel switched the Maxdorf mill from processing flax to hemp. That same year, Jos. Riedel built a new glassworks next door which started production on 6 January 1879. Wilhelm Riedel drew up the plans for what was to be the most modern glass foundry in the region. The design of the building had a distinctly English allure, no doubt due to the six months the young businessman spent in Britain as a volunteer apprentice in the late 1860s. In 1870s the Iser Mountains became known all over the world for the production of perfume bottles, cruets for salt, pepper, oil and other spices. Wilhelm Riedel invented and patented the technology of ‚Äúusing compressed air to shape hollow glass in metal moulds‚Äù. This outstanding innovation was responsible for the rapid exceeding success of the company. The decorative element was applied through machine-blowing that imitated cutting elements. The company where this new technology (patented on 23 September 1879) was executed was the foundry in Untermaxdorf. On 13 December 1879 the Polaun company bought the Neudorf glassworks near Gablonz, expanded and adapted its furnace to use coal gas rather than a wood-burning kiln. In 1879, the Polaun company operated 11 wood gas or coal gas furnaces and a total of 76 pots in the Iser Mountains. In 1880, the six works in Polaun, Wurzelsdorf, Neudorf, Maxdorf and Klein Iser melted over 5,000 tons of glass. Jewellery accounted for the largest amount (2,100 tons), followed by perfume bottles (2,000 tons) and hollow glass (900 tons). In 1881, Wilhelm Riedel designed a glassworks in Stefansruh, close to Polaun. For this project the Riedel family decided to fully utilise the railroad tracks they had built five years previously to transport the coal required to heat the glass furnaces. The factories in Wurzeldorf and Neudorf were closed, the glassmakers were transferred to the new built Stefansruh. In 1882 the two coal gas-burning furnaces in Stefansruh began to produce glass rods. In 1883, the family was devastated by the sudden death of Hugo Riedel, eldest son of Josef Riedel and director of the family glass empire. The first repercussion of Hugo Riedel's death was that construction of textile dyeing factory was stopped. Wilhelm Riedel at the age of 34 became director of the Riedel companies and moved to the headquarters in Polaun =Otto Riedel ‚ÄòThe Glassking‚Äô (1853‚Äì1901)= After the death of his brother Hugo, the management of the Wurzelsdorf textile mill which had 30,000 spindles, fell on Otto Riedel (3rd son of Josef and Anna). =Josef Riedel Jr. (1862‚Äì1924, Seventh Generation)= Josef Riedel Jr. was the last to join the firm and became a shareholder in 1886. Josef Jr. gained his technical chemical education at the Mochmann Institute in Dresden and l'√âcole Municipale de Chimie Industrielle in M√ºhlhausen where he studied for four terms in 1881‚Äì82, he was perfectly prepared for the new role he was about to embrace. In 1883, Jos. Riedel built a foundry for the production of bronzes where the Riedels began to manufacture for their own use metal-pressing moulds, tools, machines as well as functional and decorative appliances for glassware, and numerous other items. They began to develop metal moulds for their private label customers, glass decorators and merchants. Josef Riedel Jr. was put in charge to manage this operation, supported by Hermann Kittel, a famous girdler and metal-plater, as Technical Head of Operations. In 1884 decorative bronze was replaced with plated zinc, which could imitate bronze as a decoration. The interest and demand for metal- cast and metal-encased glass grew with products sold globally due to the trading relations of the Riedel's customers. =Lighthouse Customers= Josef Riedel the elder was an early adopter of new technology. When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, the Riedels implemented a private phone line in the forests to improve communication amongst their factories in 1883. When Thomas Alva Edison patented the first electric light bulb in 1881, the Riedels introduced electric light to the Riedel factories in 1883, primarily for safety reasons to limit fire risk. The modern era of lighthouses began at the turn of the 18th century and lighthouse construction boomed. The first Fresnel lens was used in 1823 - its light could be seen from more than 20 miles (32 km) out. In 1883, the Riedel production catalogues introduced moulded optical crystal Fresnel lenses for lighthouses, and speciality glass products began to play a significant role in the Jos. Riedel product mix. These were successfully exported until 1914 when World War I started. Competition In 1870, Josef Schmiedel's Hundorf glassworks began making glass for beads - they were fierce competitors for Riedel offering them to the market for less. Instead of reducing the price, Josef Riedel the elder, would buy out competitors. On December 22, 1883, the Riedel company bought Hundorf glassworks and it was the first time the Riedel ‚ÄòGlass Empire‚Äô expanded beyond the Iser Mountains. Mechanisation ‚Äì Innovation ‚Äì Focus The Klein Iser glassworks, built by Franz Riedel in 1828, was closed in 1884 as it was the last non-industrial glass manufacturer whose operation had become prohibitively expensive. Riedel diversified in 1885 into coal mining in the region of Hostomitz, 150 km west from the factory ‚Äì the coal was not used for glass manufacturing but sold for other use. In the same year the Riedels widened their hemp manufacturing by acquiring a rope- and cable-making factory. It sold its finished goods through wholesalers to the world market. Expansion continued in 1886 with an additional glass factory in Stefansruh. The new factory was dedicated to glass rods and tubes, which replaced the production of the shut down Klein Iser factory. In 1886 the central administrative office was established in Polaun, which became the Jos. Riedel company headquarters. However, in the same year, Venetian glassmakers developed a special machine to machine-cut and polish seed beads into perfect tiny donuts. The Bohemian bead production became instantly out-dated and could no longer compete. Josef Riedel Jr. travelled to Venice and recruited three Italian technicians. Their names were Tocellan, Morichetto and Giordani. With the input of Wilhelm and Josef junior, the three Venetian engineers improved and developed the original Venetian cutting machine in the Riedel bronze foundry. It was able to produce 3.000 tons of machine-cut seed beads per year. At the same time, glass manufacturer Ludwig Breit introduced his glass-cut- off-machine. Mechanisation in the Iser Mountains led to significant unemployment. This led to the homeworkers' uprising at the beginning 1890 which culminated in the Wiesenthal Rebellion where workers died in a clash with police. The local government declared a state of emergency. The labour disturbances became so serious that the governor, Count Franz von Thun, visited the Iser region in person. The Riedel family, on the other hand, helped to ease the crisis and supported the unemployed homeworkers with financial grants. Riedel expanded and purchased the world-class glass decorator ‚ÄòVincenz Pohl in Neuwelt‚Äô which opened additional business opportunities to the luxury glass market. The decorated glass produced in this workshop with colourful enamels became extremely popular in Venice, the French market as well as overseas in South America. The demand for luxury glass surpassed supply which made it necessary to open an additional decoration workshop at the Polaun plant. The Polaun plant became increasingly important for business because of its packaging department, paint shop, kilns for firing painted glass, and last but not least a showroom for customers. In 1887, Wilhelm Riedel invented a patented process to machine colour a scalloped edge instead of using hand paint. That same year, the company displayed its first- ever luxury glassware at the prestigious Leipzig Fair. =Year 1888= The company was greatly honoured in 1888, when it was invited to be one of only seven glass factories in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to participate in the Exhibition of the Emperor's 40th Jubilee in Vienna. The Riedels were awarded medals for their lavishly decorated glass and seed beads. On September 26, 1888, the Emperor bestowed the Knight's Cross of the Order of Emperor Franz Joseph I on Josef Riedel the elder. At the exhibition, the Viennese specialist journal Centrallblatt focussed on Jos. Riedel's coloured glass, which often appeared with decorative metal details. The magazine called the Riedel designs \\"truly special works of art\\". Not every department of the business was prospering. Riedel's coal mining was closed that year. =Year 1889= At the age of 27 Josef Jr. visited the World Exhibition in Paris (where Gustave Eiffel inaugurated the tower). At the exhibition he noticed that all the electric lamps on display featured only metal shades. He immediately seized the opportunity. The first glass lampshades to come out of the Riedel factories were shaped like bowls and flowers, and they instantly became an important part of the company's repertory. =Final Years= On 24 April 1894, Josef died in his villa in Polaun after a short illness. He left behind six working glassworks, two glass finishing and decorating factories, a glass bead factory, a bronze foundry, and two textile mills. In 1894, the group of companies represented half of the state's entire revenue from the Polaun region and employed 1,250 people (350 in the glassworks, 900 in the textile plants). Josef Riedel the elder was named Glass King of the Iser Mountains and in 1888, he was decorated with the papal Order of Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice. He was an honorary citizen of Wiesenthal an der Neisse as he had given the village land on which to build a church in 1880, and was an honorary citizen of Franzensbad (1858). He was also a member of the Reichenberg Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Committee of the District Office in Tannwald, an honorary curator of the Museum of Northern Bohemia in Reichenberg: the oldest institution celebrating industrial arts in the Czech Republic today and an honorary member of the sixteen other associations in the Iser Mountains and beyond. In 1889 Josef the elder requested architect Adolf Burger to build his funeral chapel. The chapel is located and can still be viewed today on the ridge above the Polaun and Stefansruh glassworks. The impressive Neo-gothic structure is in full view of the main road. Made of Muchdorf granite and the Horitz sandstone, it was completed in 1890. After consecration of the tomb, the first family members were buried: Josef Riedel Sr. (father of Josef the elder), Marie Anna (+1855), the first wife of Josef the elder, their first born son Hugo (+1883), and Franz Riedel (5th generation, +1844) Josef Riedel's funeral took place three days after his death. Glassmakers carried the cask from his villa on their shoulders and company clerks lay him in his tomb. Josef's contemporaries remembered him for his efficiency, piety and benevolence. He valued his employees, and was also compassionate towards the poor and the sick. Furthermore, based on his wishes, a pension fund was set up for the company's staff and glassmakers on the day he died. His sons also decided ‚Äì for the first time in the company's history ‚Äì to grant power of attorney to three accountants. This was entered into the Commercial Register on 8 May. After his death, Josef's widow Johanna moved to Reichenberg, where she lived up until her own death in 1920 at the age of 84. The Iser Mountains lost one of their most prominent native businessmen. However, since Josef Riedel had, little by little, passed the running of all aspects of the company he had built to his sons, he left behind his empire with sound foundations.

Erkelenz is a town in the Rhineland in western Germany that lies southwest of M√∂nchengladbach on the northern edge of the Cologne Lowland, halfway between the Lower Rhine region and the Lower Meuse. It is a medium-sized town (over 44,000) and the largest in the district of Heinsberg in North Rhine-Westphalia. Despite the town having more than 1,000 years of history and tradition, in 2006 the eastern part of the borough was cleared to make way for the Garzweiler II brown coal pit operated by RWE Power. This is planned to be in operation until 2045. Over five thousand people from ten villages have had to be resettled as a result. Since 2010, the inhabitants of the easternmost village of Pesch have left and most have moved to the new villages of Immerath and Borschemich in the areas of K√ºckhoven and Erkelenz-Nord.  Geography  The Erkelenz countryside near L√∂venich = Landscape = The area is characterised by the gently rolling to almost level countryside of the J√ºlich-Z√ºlpich B√∂rde, whose fertile loess soils are predominantly used for agriculture. Settlements and roads cover about 20 per cent of the area of the borough and only 2 per cent is wooded.Landesbetrieb Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen (IT.NRW), Kommunalprofil Erkelenz Percentages are rounded off The Wahnenbusch, the largest contiguous wooded area, is located south of the town of Tenholt and covers . In the north the b√∂rde gives way to the forests and waterways of the Schwalm-Nette-Plateau, part of the Lower Rhine Plain. In the west on the far side of the town, lies the Rur depression, some . Its transition is part of the Baal Riedelland. Here, streams have created a richly varying landscape of hills and valleys. In the east is the source region of the River Niers near Kuckum and Keyenberg. To the south the land climbs up towards the Jackerath loess ridge. The lowest point lies at above sea level (NN) (Niers region in the northeast and near the Ophover Mill in the southwest) and the highest point is above NN (on the boundary of the borough near Holzweiler/Immerath in the south). = Climate = The climate is influenced by the Atlantic Gulf Stream at the crossover between maritime and continental climates. The prevailing winds are from the southwest and there is precipitation all year round. Annual precipitation amounts to about , whereby August is the wettest and September the driest month. Summers are warm and winters mild. In July the average temperature is and, in January, . The length of the cold season with a minimum temperature below is less than 60 days, the number of summer's days with temperatures above averages 30, with an additional eight \\"tropical\\" days with daytime temperatures of more than and night temperatures over , and there are an average of 20 days of thunderstorms. The onset of spring, which is reckoned from the budding of cherry, apple and pear trees, occurs between 29 April and 5 May. High summer, which begins with the harvest of winter rye, starts between 10 and 16 July.Diercke, Weltatlas, Westermann Verlag, Brunswick 1957, p. 22 f.Debra Zizkat and Hans-Wilhelm Cuber, Cusanus Gymnasium Erkelenz, Wetterstation Erkelenz/Haus Hohenbusch, = Geology = The Erkelenz B√∂rde is the northernmost extent of the J√ºlich B√∂rde and is formed from a loess plateau that has an average thickness of over eleven metres in this area. Beneath it are the gravels and sands of the main ice age terrace, laid down by the Rhine and the Meuse. Embedded in the loess in places are lenses of marl that were mined until the 20th century in order to obtain lime by driving shafts and galleries underground.Hans Frohnhofen, Mergeln im L√∂venicher Feld in: Heimatkalender der Erkelenzer Lande, Erkelenz 1959, p. 18 ff. In the Tertiary period the Erkelenz horst was formed along geological fault lines. East of the horst runs the Venlo fault block (Scholle), to the west is the Rur Scholle, to the south the Erft Scholle and the Jackerath Horst. A small section of the horst is part of the Wassenberg Horst. Thick seams of brown coal from the Tertiary and of black coal from the Carboniferous are located underground. The Erkelenz Horst is part of the Cologne Lowland Earthquake Region. = Borough = The town's administrative territory, or borough, is across from east to west and from north to south. Its neighbouring administrative units, clockwise from the north, are: * Town of Wegberg ( north, Heinsberg district) * Independent town of M√∂nchengladbach, ( northeast) * Municipality of J√ºchen ( east, Rhein-Kreis Neuss district) * Municipality of Titz ( southeast, D√ºren district) * Town of Linnich ( southwest, D√ºren district) * Town of H√ºckelhoven ( west, Heinsberg district) * Town of Wassenberg ( northwest, Heinsberg district) Eastern villages that are to give way to the Garzweiler II open-cast coal mine. The town of Erkelenz emerged in its present configuration as a result of the Aachen land reform bill of 21 December 1971 (the Aachen-Gesetz). According to this law inter alia the former districts of Erkelenz and Geilenkirchen-Heinsberg were to be merged on 1 January 1972. Erkelenz lost its status as the county town to Heinsberg and was amalgamated with the municipalities of Borschemich, Gerderath, Golkrath, Granterath, Holzweiler, Immerath, Keyenberg, K√ºckhoven, L√∂venich, Schwanenberg and Venrath, as well as the parishes of Geneiken and Kuckum. The area of its borough increased from . According to the law, the borough of Erkelenz is divided into nine districts with a total of 46 villages and hamlets (population as at 31 October 2009): * District 1: Erkelenz with the villages of Oestrich and Buscherhof as well as Borschemich, Borschemich (new), Bellinghoven and Oerath, a total of 20,173 inhabitants * District 2: Gerderath with Fronderath, Gerderhahn, Moorheide and Vossem, a total of 5,179 inhabitants * District 3: Schwanenberg with Geneiken, Genfeld, Genhof, Grambusch and Lentholt, a total of 2,265 inhabitants * District 4: Golkrath with Houverath, Houverather Heide, Hoven and Matzerath, a total of 2,039 inhabitants * District 5: Granterath and Hetzerath with Commerden, Genehen, Scheidt and Tenholt, a total of 3,488 inhabitants * District 6: L√∂venich with Katzem and Kleinbouslar, a total of 4,147 inhabitants * District 7: K√ºckhoven, a total of 2,250 inhabitants * District 8: Keyenberg and Venrath with Berverath, Etgenbusch, Kaulhausen, Kuckum, Mennekrath, Neuhaus, Oberwestrich, Terheeg, Unterwestrich and Wockerath, a total of 3,468 inhabitants * District 9: Holzweiler and Immerath (new) with L√ºtzerath and Pesch, a total of 2,372 inhabitants Coat of arms The coat of arms is parted horizontally. The upper part is blue, and contains the golden lion of the duchy of Guelders (Geldern). In the silver (white) lower part is a red medlar, also called rose of Geldern. The coat of arms shows the centuries- old connection to the duchy. The colours from the shield became the colours of the city: blue and white. History = Pre- and early history = There have been discoveries of Old and New Stone Age flint-knapping sites across the whole of the present area of the borough.J√ºrgen Driehaus, Die urgeschichtliche Zeit im Landkreis Erkelenz, in: Heimatkalender der Erkelenzer Lande, Erkelenz 1967, pp. 105 ff. Near Haberg House, north of L√∂venich, there is a site of national renown. Near K√ºckhoven a wooden well was discovered in 1990 that belonged to a settlement of the Linear Pottery culture and had been built around 5,100 B.C. This makes it one of the oldest wooden structures in the world.J√ºrgen Weiner, Eine bandkeramische Siedlung mit Brunnen bei Erkelenz- K√ºckhoven, in: Schriften des Heimatvereins der Erkelenzer Lande, Vol. 12, Erkelenz 1992, pp. 17 ff. North of the old village of Erkelenz, on the present day Mary Way (Marienweg), lay three cremation graves (Brandgr√§ber), northwest to south of numerous fields of rubble. Roman bricks, hypocaust bricks and shards come from the marketplace south of the town hall. Here in the southwest corner and east of the chancel of the Roman Catholic parish church there are urn graves enclosed by glacial erratics of the early Frankish period from 300 to 500 A.D. On the south and southeast edge of the market, round jars were also found in the style of Badorf ceramics from Carolingian times.Institut f√ºr geschichtliche Landeskunde der Rheinlande an der Universit√§t Bonn, Rheinischer St√§dteatlas, III Nr. 15, Cologne 1976, p. 1 In 1906 a Roman Jupiter Column from the beginning of the 3rd century A.D. was discovered in Kleinbouslar. The Erkelenz chronicler Mathias Baux wrote in the 16th century that \\"the bushes in the middle period were cleared and the soil turned into fertile fields, so that out of the harsh wilderness a corn-rich land and overall a breezy paradise was established.\\"Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al. Geschichte der Stadt Erkelenz, Erkelenz, 1926, p. 2 From Mathias Baux's perspective, the middle period was the 8th century, which corresponds to the emergence of the Carolingian Empire. Under the present-day Catholic church lay Frankish and medieval graves without any grave goods as well as broken pieces of Badorf Ceramic and Roman bricks.K. B√∂hner et al., Fr√ºher Kirchenbau im Kreis Heinsberg, Museumsschriften des Kreises Heinsberg Band 8, Heinsberg 1987, pp. 206 ff. Jacob van Deventer shows the layout of streets in the town centre - still largely preserved - with the town defences, town hall and church = Origin of the name = The overwhelming theory is that the name Erkelenz belongs to the group of Gallo-Romance placenames. According to this view the name of the town, which first appears in the records in a document dating to 966 A.D. sealed by Otto the Great as herclinze, comes from fundus herculentiacus: Herculentian estate (Estate of Herculentius). From the original adjectival character of the personal name the neuter noun Herculentiacum developed. However a continuity of settlement from Roman to Frankish times cannot be proven.Leo Gillessen, Zur Ortsnamen- und Siedlungskunde des Kreises Erkelenz (Part I) in: Heimatkalender der Erkelenzer Lande, Erkelenz 1967, p. 145. Derselbe Zur Ortsnamen- und Siedlungskunde des Kreises Erkelenz (Teil II) in: Heimatkalender der Erkelenzer Lande, Erkelenz 1968, p. 82 As a result, it is also postulated that the name does not have Roman, but Old High German origins, according to which the word linta = lime tree.Paul ter Meer, Ortsnamen des Kreises Erkelenz - Ein Versuch zu ihrer Deutung, Erkelenz 1924, pp. 8 f. In 1118 A.D. the name of the place finally appears as Erkelenze. = Manorialism = On 17 January 966, St. Mary's Abbey in Aachen (Marienstift zu Aachen) was given inter alia the settlements of Erkelenz and its neighbour, Oestrich, in the County of Eremfried in the M√ºhlgau as part of an exchange with the Lotharingian Count Immo. Emperor Otto the Great confirmed this exchange in the aforementioned deed at an imperial assembly (Hoftag) in Aachen.Theodor Joseph Lacomblet, Urkundenbuch f√ºr die Geschichte des Niederrheins, D√ºsseldorf 1840, p. 63; Friedel Krings et al., 1000 Jahre Erkelenz, Ein R√ºckblick auf die 1000-Jahr-Feier, Erkelenz 1967, Vorspann, Kopial der Urkunde aus dem 13. Jahrhundert (at Commons); Theo Schreiber, Erkelenz - eine Stadt im Wandel der Geschichte in: Schriften des Heimatvereins der Erkelenzer Lande, Vol. 12, Erkelenz 1992, pp. 43 ff., weiteres Kopial der Urkunde From then on the abbey was the owner of the entire estate in Erkelenz and the surrounding villages with the proviso that territorial lordship was exercised by the count.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pp. 13 f. Later the estates owned by the abbey were divided between the provost and chapter. The farms were not managed independently, but were leased. Not until 1803 did the abbey lose these rights of ownership, when France introduced secularisation into the Rhineland.Friedel Krings, Zur geldrischen Geschichte der Stadt Erkelenz, in: Heimatkalender der Erkelenzer Lande, Erkelenz 1960, p. 53 Coat of arms of the town of Erkelenz from the chronicle of Mathias Baux, 1562 = Town rights = Erkelenz received its town rights in 1326 from Count Reginald II of Guelders, as can be read in the town chronicle by Matthias Baux.Friedel Krings, op. cit., p. 54 But no deed granting town rights exists, which is why it has been suggested that there was no fixed date but, instead, a long drawn-out process of becoming a town over many years that may have dragged on into the 14th century.Klaus Flink, Stadtwerdung und Wirtschaftskr√§fte in Erkelenz, Schriftenreihe der Stadt Erkelenz, Vol. 2, Cologne, 1976, pp. 8 fSeverin Corsten, Erkelenz erh√§lt Stadtrechte, in: Studien zur Geschichte der Stadt Erkelenz vom Mittelalter bis zur fr√ºhen Neuzeit, Schriftenreihe der Stadt Erkelenz, Vol. 1, Cologne, 1976, pp. 137 ff However, against that is the fact that there is a jury seal dating to the year 1331,Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels, et al., op. cit., p. 4 and that Erkelenz appears on the Guelders urban diet on 1 December 1343.Herbert Claessen, Hrsg. Geschichte der Erkelenzer Lande, Aus einem Vortag des Landrates Claessen im Jahre 1863, in: Schriften des Heimatvereins der Erkelenzer Lande, Band 20, Erkelenz 2006, p. 92. In 1359 Erkelenz is described in a document as a Guelders town and bears the Guelders lions and rose on its seal and coat of arms. = Territorial lordship = From the end of the 11th century the counts of Guelders, the first being Gerard III of Wassenberg, also known as Gerard I, Count of Guelders,Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 4th edition, Vol. 7, Leipzig and Vienna, 1890, pp. 52 f. also possessed the lordship in Erkelenz. They were advocates appointed by the Holy Roman Empire and exercise jurisdiction, trade protection and military command.Friedel Krings, op. cit., p. 55 In 1339 Emperor Louis the Bavarian elevated Guelders to a dukedom, under Rainald II, that was divided into four \\"quarters\\" (Quartiere). Erkelenz and its surrounding villages belonged to the upper quarter (Oberquartier) of Guelders with its main centre at Roermond and was an exclave of Guelders within the Duchy of J√ºlich. It formed the Amt of Erkelenz, together with the non-isolated villages of Wegberg, Kr√ºchten and Brempt, headed by the Amtmann (Drossard).Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., p. 10 The town's constitution and administration was consistent with those of the other towns in Guelders. Seven magistrates (Sch√∂ffen) who, like the mayors, had to possess wealth in the town or the county, and ten common councillors put forward two candidates for the office of town mayor (Stadtb√ºrgermeister) and two for that of county mayor (Landb√ºrgermeister) for a period of office of one year, but they were elected only by the magistrates, who actually ran the administration of the town, whilst the council only fulfilled representative functions.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., loco citato pp. 7 ff. Guelders stately castle (Landesburg) from the year 1349 Im Pangel street Soon after its elevation to town status, work began on the brick fortifications of the place. These probably consisted of basic ramparts as had been common since time immemorial for the defence of settlements, which had been started in the 11th century.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., p. 154. Although the castle was not documented until 1349,Friedel Krings, Die mittelalterlichen Befestigungswerke der Stadt Erkelenz, in: Heimatkalender der Erkelenzer Lande, Erkelenz 1957, p. 57 the town appeared to have developed under the protection of the castle along the Pangel, the oldest mentioned street (in deme Pandale, 1398) which was in its immediate vicinity. The nearby Johannismarkt (alder mart , Engl.: old market, 1420) and the more distant square known today simply as Markt (\\"market\\"), then referred to as the (Engl.: new market, 1480), were also mentioned.Institut f√ºr geschichtliche Landeskunde der Rheinlande an der Universit√§t Bonn, Rheinischer St√§dteatlas, III No. 15, Cologne, 1976, p. 3 In addition the castle had clearly been built within the town walls, so that it must have been there at least when town rights were granted in 1326.Friedel Krings op. cit., p. 56Edwin Pinzek, in: Bedeutende Bau- und Kunstwerke in Erkelenz, eine Reihe der Stadt Erkelenz It is also hardly likely that an undefended place would have been elevated to the status of a town. Finally, the first and strongest town gateway, the Br√ºck Gate (Br√ºcktor, on Br√ºckstra√üe) was built in 1355 on the Cologne Military Road (K√∂lner Heerbahn) that came from Roermond to Erkelenz and ran along the Theodor-K√∂rner Road, M√ºhlenstra√üe and Wockerath to Cologne.Institut f√ºr geschichtliche Landeskunde der Rheinlande an der Universit√§t Bonn, Rheinischer St√§dteatlas, III No. 15, Cologne, 1976, p. 4 In a feud between Edward of Guelders, who was a son of Duke Reginald II and adversary of his elder brother, Reginald III, Count Engelbert III of the Mark conquered the now insufficiently fortified town in 1371 and partly destroyed it.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pages 4 ff, 104 The childless Edward fell in the same year on the battlefield of Baesweiler fighting on the side of his brother in law, Duke William II of J√ºlich, against Duke Wenceslaus I of Brabant.Herbert Claessen, op. cit., p. 92 When in that year his brother, Rainald III, also died without issue, fighting broke out repeatedly over the inheritance and possession of the Duchy of Guelders under which Erkelenz, as an exclave of Guelders in the state of J√ºlich, suffered particularly severely from the burdens of war, quartering of soldiers, robbery and plundering.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pp. 5 f. The construction of fortifications at Erkelenz was brought forward to meet the strategic requirements of its local lords. Built in 1416 under Reginald IV of Guelders, opposite the Br√ºck Gate (Br√ºcktor) on the other side of town, was the Maar Gate (Maartor, Aachener Strasse), which faced the J√ºlich, south of the town. In 1423, the Duchy of Guelders, and thus the town of Erkelenz, fell to Arnold of Egmond, and, in 1425, to Adolphus of J√ºlich- Berg. After his nephew and successor, Gerhard II of J√ºlich-Berg had defeated Arnold of Egmond in the Battle of Linnich, the Oerath Gate (Oerather Tor, Roermonder Stra√üe)) was completed in 1454, that faced Roermond. Despite the increasing cost of work on the fortifications, the town was able to afford it. In 1458 it immediately started work on a new bell tower, that has survived until today, after the tower of the old Romanesque church had collapsed. The Guelders exclave of Erkelenz in the manuscript atlas by Christian Sgrothen, before 1573 In 1473 the town came into the possession of Charles the Bold of Burgundy who, whilst at war against Lorraine in 1476, personally accepted the homage of the townsfolk of Erkelenz. In 1481 the town fell to Maximilian I of Austria and, in 1492, to the son of Arnold of Egmond, Charles of Egmond, who also presented himself personally in the same year at Erkelenz. At that time the fortress of Erkelenz was so strong that Maximilian I instructed the Dukes of J√ºlich and Kleve, who were allied with him against Guelders, not to engage in a bombardment of the town, but to take them with the aid of storming bridges (Sturmbr√ºcken). Using that method, an army of 3000 foot soldiers and 1,000 horse under William IV of J√ºlich took them by surprise in August 1498.Herbert Claessen, op. cit., pp. 93 ff. In 1500 the town fell again to Charles of Egmont, so that in 1514 the gate opposite the Oerath Gate opposite the Bellinghoven Gate (Bellinghovener Tor, K√∂lner Stra√üe) was built, which sealed a gap facing Julich. There were 14 defensive towers in the town wall with its four gate castles (Torburgen) and, in front of it was a second wall, separated by a moat. The town was thus considered impregnable. In 1538 Guelders fell to William of J√ºlich, Cleves and Berg During that period the great town fire of 1540 occurred on 21 June of that year. The fire broke out during a summer heatwave, almost entirely razing the town apart from few houses by the Br√ºck Gate and on Maarstra√üe. Help came from the neighbouring Guelders towns of Roermond and Venlo. Emperor Charles V who, in 1543, following the capture of D√ºren and Julich during his march on Roermond with a 30,000 strong army, stayed personally in Erkelenz.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pp. 6 fHerbert Claessen, Weltgeschichte zu Gast in Erkelenz, in: Schriften des Heimatvereins der Erkelenzer Lande, Vol. 20, Erkelenz, 2006, pp. 144 f. ended the Guelders succession wars at the Treaty of Venlo. The town now ended up, together with the Duchy of Guelders, under to the Spanish House of Habsburg and was part of the Spanish Netherlands, then the richest country in Europe. So, for example, the town was able, as the inscription on a rock near the entrance testifies, to replace the destroyed town hall as early as 1546 with a new building that is still standing.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al. Geschichte der Stadt Erkelenz, Erkelenz, 1926, pp. 5 Siege of Erkelenz during the War of the J√ºlich succession in 1610 Lasting peace did not, however, return to the land and several times epidemics struck the town. In 1580 it was almost completely depopulated by the plague.Friedel Krings, Zur geldrischen Geschichte der Stadt Erkelenz, in: Heimatkalender der Erkelenzer Lande, Erkelenz, 1960, p. 51 During the Spanish-Dutch War in 1607, Dutch troops took the town and plundered it. After Erkelenz had been unsuccessfully besieged in 1610 during the J√ºlich-Cleves War of Succession, the army of the French king, Louis XIV, allied with the troops of the Archbishop of Cologne, was finally in a position to take the town on the evening of 9 May 1674. This attack which took place during the French-Dutch War only succeeded on the fourth assault using the newly invented cannons, when two of the four gates fell. On that day, the town ceased to be a fortification. The attackers are reported to have lost 400 dead, the defenders just six. The invaders forced the townsfolk to breach the walls and blew up the Bellinghoven and Oerath gates, both of which blocked free passage to the Netherlands.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels u.a., op. cit., p. 155.Friedel Krings, Die mittelalterlichen Befestigungswerke der Stadt Erkelenz, op. cit., pp. 59 f In the War of Spanish Succession, Erkelenz was occupied by Prussian troops in 1702 who did not leave again until 1713. In the Treaty of Utrecht in 1714 Duke John William of J√ºlich and Elector Palatine (of Palatinate-Neuburg) was given Erkelenz; the town not paying him homage until 1719. The town thus lost its centuries-old affiliation with the Upper Quarter of Guelders. From 1727 to 1754 the territory of Erkelenz (Herrlichkeit Erkelenz) was pledged to Freiherr von Francken, who also stayed from time to time in the town. From 1794 to 1815 it belonged to France, along with the lands left of the Rhine, and was given a permanent contingent of French troops. Initially Erkelenz formed a municipality (Munizipalit√§t), from 1800 a mairie (mayoralty) and, from 1798, was the seat of the canton of Erkelenz in the arrondissement of Crefeld, which was part of the d√©partement of Roer.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pp. 57 ff In 1815 the King of Prussia became the new landlord following Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. In the years 1818/19 the tumbledown town walls and gates were demolished. Instead of walls the four present-day promenade streets were built, each named after their respective points of the compass.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al. op. cit., pp. 73 ffJosef Lennartz, Die Beschwerde des Franz Schaeven and Das Ende der Stadtmauer, Schriften des Heimatvereins der Erkelenzer Lande, Vol. 1, Erkelenz 1981, pp. 20 ff From 1816 to 1972 Erkelenz was the seat of the rural district of Erkelenz (Kreis Erkelenz). = Industrialisation = Around 1825 Andreas Polke from Ratibor took up residence in the town and founded a pin factory. The nearby region around Aachen was a leading light in this trade at the time. In 1841 Polke employed 73 workers in his factory, of whom 36 were child workers under 14; for those of school age he ran a factory school. Pins were made in Erkelenz until about 1870. In 1852 Erkelenz was connected to the Aachen‚ÄìM√∂nchengladbach railway and, in addition to a railway station for passenger services, was also given a goods station with marshalling sidings, a hump and a turntable. The increased volume of traffic into Erkelenz station necessitated an upgrade of the four roads radiating from the town to something like chaussee standardJosef Gaspers, Leo Sels u. a., op. cit. p. 83 and in the succeeding decades a development of the town beyond its medieval town boundaries along the present K√∂lner Stra√üe towards the station. In the 19th century hand weaving with looms was the predominant activity of the surrounding villages. The Industrial Age in Erkelenz first began with the introduction of mechanical weaving looms for making cloth. In 1854 the Rockstoff Factory I.B. Oellers, was established on the present Parkweg; it was a mechanical weaving mill which, at times, employed 120 workers and 20 salesmen. In 1872 the mechanical plush weaving mill of Karl M√ºller (corner of K√∂lner Stra√üe and Heinrich Jansen Weg) was founded; it employed 60 hand weavers in Erkelenz and another 400 in the regions of Berg and the Rh√∂n area for the main Erkelenz operation. In 1897 the Halcour Textile Factory appeared on Neu√üer Stra√üe, which had 67 male and 22 female workers in 1911 in its factory-owned health insurance department.Josef Lennartz und Theo G√∂rtz, Erkelenzer Stra√üen, Schriften des Heimatvereins der Erkelenzer Landes, Vol. 3, Erkelenz 1982, pp. 105, 128 Historic fa√ßades on the Kaiserstra√üe (Theodor- K√∂rner-Stra√üe) and the water tower, 1907 The town's actual step into the Industrial Age took place in 1897 when the industrial pioneer, Anton Raky, moved the head office of the International Drilling Company (Internationaler Bohrgesellschaft), known locally as the Bohr, to Erkelenz. Key factors in choosing this location were the favourable railway links to the Ruhr area and the Aachen Coalfield. In the years that followed industrial workers and engineers flocked to Erkelenz, creating a shortage of housing, a situation that could only be alleviated by establishing a charitable building association.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et. al., o. cit. p. 77 Between the town centre and the railway line, a new quarter emerged, known colloquially as Kairo (pronounced: Kah-ee-roh) due to the little foreign looking towers on many of the houses. In 1909 the drilling firm employed 50 staff and 460 workers. During the wartime year of 1916 it had as many as 1,600 employees. When, on 10 May 1898, a bronze statue of Emperor William I was erected on the market place, it was illuminated, at Raky's initiative, with electric lighting from arc lamps. That marked the introduction of electricity into the public arena in Erkelenz. In the same year the first street lamps were erected in Bahnhofstra√üe (today K√∂lner Stra√üe) and the first mains electricity was delivered to houses. Gr√ºnderzeit house fa√ßades are witnesses to the development at the turn of the century. In the next two decades the town built the waterworks on the present Bernhard-Hahn-Stra√üe with its water tower visible for kilometres, the electricity works, the slaughterhouse, the swimming baths and a large school building for the gymnasium on the S√ºdpromenade. The founding of a korn distillery, a brewery, a malthouse and a dairy acted as new outlets for agriculture. In 1910 Arnold Koepe built an engineering workshop in the former Karl M√ºller plush weaving mill in order to manufacture coal wagons for the mines. In 1916 Ferdinand Clasen took over the operation and in 1920 founded the Erkelenz Engineering Factory (Erkelenzer Maschinenfabrik) from this firm on Bernhard-Hahn-Stra√üe that employed up to 200 workers.Josef Lennartz und Theo G√∂rtz, op. cit. p. 66 = World wars and inter-war years = During the First World War the local economy also ground to a halt as a result of conscription, the priority given to the transportation of troops and war materiel on the railways as well as the large contingents of troops that marched through the town with their resulting demands. To alleviate the lack of labour, prisoners of war, mainly Russians who had been interned in 1915 in a POW camp on the land of the International Drilling Company, were employed, mainly in agriculture. In order to meet the wartime demand for metal, the townsfolk had to give up relevant implements and the church had to donate some of its bells in return for little compensation. The lost war cost the lives of 142 Erkelenz townsfolk in Army service and another 155 were injured, some seriously.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et. al., op. cit., pp. 95 ff After this war, which also saw the end of the German Empire 2,000 soldiers were stationed here between 1918 and 1926. French troops were quartered here until 19 November 1919 and then Belgian troops took over from 1 December 1919. Huts were erected on Neusser Stra√üe and Tenholter Stra√üe as soldiers' quarters, in addition to commandeered houses, flats were built on Freiheitsplatz, on Graf-Reinald-Stra√üe and Gl√ºck-auf-Stra√üe for the officers and NCOs.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pp. 99, 129 Because gold and silver had to be given up at the beginning of the war and the gold standard had been replaced by paper money, the cost of all goods rose dramatically, despite the command economy, to paper money prices that were scarcely affordable, so that the supply of paper money finally ran out and the communal authorities were permitted to print their own paper money. In 1921 the town had emergency money printed in the shape of paper notes with values of 50 and 75 pfennigs to a total value of 70,000 marks. This emergency currency went into partial circulation, but was withdrawn again in 1922.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pp. 96, 101 f. When the French and Belgians occupied the Ruhr in January 1923, in order to take coal and steel back to their own countries, there was passive resistance, which later became known as the Battle of the Ruhr (Ruhrkampf). In Erkelenz this passive resistance was carried out especially by railwaymen, in the course of which the Belgian secret police expelled 14 families, including small children, who had been reported by narks. They were abandoned, in some cases using force, in remote places at night and in fog.Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pp. 99 f Right from the start of the occupation France and Belgium had tried unsuccessfully to annexe the Rhineland. Now, using the excuse of the resistance that had flared up, they tried to take it by force. In Aachen Separatist troops, which had established themselves by force of arms in various Rhenish towns, called for a Rhenish Republic. On 21 October 1923 such a force also appeared in Erkelenz, hoisted the Rhenish flag over the town hall and the courthouse by force of arms under the protection of the Belgians and demanded that the municipal and state officials now serve the Rhenish Republic. Officials and townsfolk refused and hauled down the separatist flag the following day. To the great joy of the population, the occupying troops pulled out a year later on 31 January 1926 in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. The bells of all the churches rang at midnight, their hour of freedom,Josef Gaspers, Leo Sels et al., op. cit., pp.100 ff and that year Erkelenz also celebrated the 600th anniversary of being granted its town rights. After Hitler had seized power on 30 January 1933 and after the Reichstag and local elections had been held in March 1933, the Nazis in Erkelenz under the leadership of Nazi Kreisleiter, Kurt Horst, began, using the authority of the municipal \\"parliaments\\", to rename all the roads and squares after their own leaders.W. Frenken et al. in: Der Nationalsozialismus im Kreis Heinsberg, Museumsschriften des Kreises Heinsberg, Vol. 4, Heinsberg 1983, p. 55 For example, from April 1933 Erkelenz had an Adolf Hitler Platz (Johannismarkt), a Hermann G√∂ring Platz (Martin Luther Platz) and a Horst Wessel Stra√üe (Br√ºckstra√üe).Josef Lennartz und Theo G√∂rtz, op. cit., pp. 94, 122, 51 In May 1933 they forced the incumbent democratic mayor, Dr. Ernst de Werth, out of office under threat of taking him into \\"protective custody\\", made Adolf Hitler an honorary citizen and pursued political dissidents, trades unionists and clergymen.W. Frenken et al., op. cit., pp. 103 ff, 57 ff, 75 ff In July 1933 a so-called Hereditary Health Court was established at the district courthouse in Erkelenz as in all districts in the German Empire, whose task was to direct the forced sterilisation of mentally and physically handicapped people as part of what later became Hitler's \\"Euthanasia Programme\\", known after the war as Action T4. This programme of Nazi violence saw the systematic murder of those seen by the Nazis as \\"asocial\\", \\"inferior\\" and \\"unworthy of living\\". In Erkelenz, such people ended up in Nazareth House in Immerath.Harry Seipolt, ‚Äû‚Ä¶ stammt aus asozialer und erbkranker Sippe\\". Zwangssterilisation und NS-Euthanasie im Kreis Heinsberg 1933‚Äì1945, in: Heimatkalender des Kreises Heinsberg, 1992, pp. 112 ff. By April 1933 the NSDAP had organised a boycott of Jewish businesses in the town,W. Frenken et al., op. cit., pp. 93 ff. whilst the 1938 November pogroms (the so-called Reichskristallnacht) finally led to anti-Semitic acts of violence. The synagogue on the Westpromenade was devastated by mobs commanded by the SS and SA, Jews were arrested and Jewish businesses in the town were plundered and demolished.W. Frenken et al., op. cit., p. 96 In March/April 1941 Jews all over Germany were evacuated from their homes and concentrated in so-called Jew houses (Judenh√§usern), to which they were only permitted to take the absolute essentials from their property.Jack Schiefer, Tagebuch eines Wehrunw√ºrdigen, Grenzland-Verlag Heinrich Hollands, Aachen 1947, p. 110; Schriften des Heimatvereins der Erkelenzer Lande, Vol. 12, Erkelenz 1992, p. 229 In Erkelenz on 1 April 1941 the Nazis forced the remaining Jews in the town of Erkelenz to leave their homes and take up residence in the Spiess Hof, a farmstead in Hetzerath, from where they were deported in 1942 via the Izbica Ghetto to the extermination camps.W. Frenken et al., op. cit., p. 98 Towards the end of the Second World War, as the Allies advanced towards Germany's western border in the middle of September 1944, Erkelenz was gradually cleared out, like many other places in the Aachen region. Whilst long streams of refugees moved eastwards across the Rhine, as well as groups of fieldwork labourers there were large units of armed SA in the border region who tyrannised and robbed the remaining population.Jack Schiefer, op. cit., pp. 301 f.; op. cit., p. 236 As part of the \\"Rur Front\\", anti-tank ditches were dug west of the town in a semi-circular arc, minefields were sewn and infantry positions were constructed with extensively branched trenches in order to create a strong hedgehog defence. The first major carpet bombing air raid took place on 8 October 1944 over the town. During the second air raid on 6 December 1944 44 people died. Between the major carpet bomb attacks, non-stop fighter bomber raids went on from dawn to dusk and often into the night, continuing the work of destruction by strafing and bombing. From December 1944 the town also came within the range of allied artillery. During a further bombing raid on 16 January 1945, 31 people were killed, including 16 in one bunker on Anton Raky Allee. Amongst the SS combat troops, the command was issued from the top to the lowest level to pull out and they did so, as did the local party functionaries, who had been burning their records for days. The fourth and heaviest air raid on the now abandoned town took place on 23 February 1945. About 90 four-engined bombers flew over in two waves. Everything that had survived the war to that point now lay in ashes: the churches, the community hall, the courthouse, the swimming baths, the hospital, the schools and the kindergarten; only the tower of the Roman Catholic parish church remained standing, albeit badly damaged. When, three days later, on 26 February 1945, American armoured units of the 102nd US Infantry Division of the 9th US Army entered the town and the surrounding villages, the warning signs on the minefields indicated the safe lanes because there was no one left who could have removed them. About Volkssturm troops gave themselves up without a fight. At the end of this war, Erkelenz was largely destroyed and counted 300 killed in air raids, 1,312 dead and 974 wounded within the county of Erkelenz.Jack Schiefer, Zerst√∂rung und Wiederaufbau im Kreise Erkelenz, Grenzland-Verlag Heinrich Hollands, Aachen 1948, pp. 8 ff., 17 ff., 153 f.Josef Lennartz, Als Erkelenz in Tr√ºmmer sank, Stadt Erkelenz 1975, pp. 4 ff., 52 ff., 102 ff. = The post-war period = As Allied forces invaded the area, the inhabitants of the surrounding villages had to leave their houses and for many days and weeks, they were driven from one place to another or concentrated in camps without enough supplies, whilst their homes were plundered, wrecked and, in many cases, set on fire. In addition, former Russian forced labourers, who were concentrated into the nearby village of Hetzerath, armed themselves with war materiel that had been left lying around and threatened town and country by robbing, killing and starting fires. The logistic troops of the invading forces also stole on a grand scale. By the end of March 1945 about 25 people still lived in Erkelenz and, as the town gradually filled up with retreating evacuees, they lacked all the basic necessities.Jack Schiefer, op. cit., pp. 24 ff, 49 f In early June 1945, British troops replaced the Americans. Several of the leading Nazis, who were found among those retreating, were arrested and placed on trial. So-called \\"Persil notes\\" (Persilscheine) were much sought after. The majority of the lower-ranking Nazis and their followers were forced into clearing rubble and cleaning up the town. But the remaining townsfolk, especially farmers who still had a horse or ox and cart, were also called upon to supply manual labour or transport. Even the youth were encouraged to volunteer for work details in order to help with the rebuilding of the town. The nature of most of the work was self-help and the newly reorganised town government only focussed on those building regulations that were absolutely necessary. The first general municipal elections took place on 15 September 1946. From 1947‚Äö CARE Packages arrived in the town, filled with food and such like, mainly sent by Americans of German origin. Apart from the returning population of the town, increasing numbers of refugees from Germany's eastern territories had to be absorbed, so that in the 1950s a new quarter of the town, Flachsfeld, was built. At the same time, the town also spread out over the fields between the few houses of Buscherhof and the Oerath Mill, forming a new large quarter, the Marienviertel. Almost all its roads, which lay on both sides of the old Marienweg, a Marian pilgrimage route that ran to Holtum, bore the names of east German towns. Not until 1956 and 1957 did the town's population receive the last repatriates from the war and from POW camps at Erkelenz Station.

This article deals with the former definition, that of a type of building. An insula housed most of the urban citizen population of ancient Rome, including ordinary people of lower- or middle-class status (the plebs) and all but the wealthiest from the upper-middle class (the equites). The term was also used to mean a city block. The traditional elite and the very wealthy lived in a domus, a large single-family residence, but the two kinds of housing were intermingled in the city and not segregated into separate neighborhoods. The ground-level floor of the insula was used for tabernae, shops and businesses, with the living space upstairs. Like modern apartment buildings, an insula might have a name, usually referring to the owner of the building.Names known from inscriptions or literary sources include Bolaniana, Sertoriana, Vitaliana, Eurcapriana, Felicles or Felicula, Cuminiana, and Arriana Polliana. Construction An insula dating from the early 2nd century A.D. in the Roman port town of Ostia Antica Strabo notes that insulae, like domus, had running water and sanitation, but this kind of housing was sometimes constructed at minimal expense for speculative purposes, resulting in insulae of poor construction. They were built in timber, mud brick, and later Roman concrete, and were prone to fire and collapse, as described by Juvenal, whose satiric purpose in writing should be taken into account. Among his many business interests, Marcus Licinius Crassus speculated in real estate and owned numerous insulae in the city. When one collapsed from poor construction, Cicero purportedly stated that Crassus was happy that he could charge higher rents for a new building than the collapsed one.Aldrete, Gregory. The Roman City, p 80 Living quarters were typically smallest in the building's uppermost floors, with the largest and most expensive apartments being located on the bottom floors. Reconstruction of the Casa dei Dipinti at Ostia The insulae could be up to nine storeys, before Augustus introduced a height limit of about 20 metres. The notably large Insula Felicles or Felicula was located near the Flaminian Circus in Regio IX; the early Christian writer Tertullian condemns the hubris of multiple-story buildings by comparing the Felicles to the towering homes of the gods.Tertullian, Against the Valentinians 7, as cited by John W. Humphrey, John P. Oleson, and Andrew N. Sherwood, Greek and Roman Technology: A Sourcebook (Routledge, 1998), p. 256 online; Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 209. Jerome Carcopino hyperbolically calls it a \\"sky-scraper\\" in his classic work Daily Life in Ancient Rome, pp. 26 and 28 online in an unknown edition. A single insula could accommodate over 40 people in only ; however, the entire structure usually had about six to seven apartments, each had about 1000 sq ft (92 sq m). The only surviving insula in Rome is the five storey Insula dell'Ara Coeli dating from the 2nd century AD, which is found at the foot of the Capitoline Hill. Because of safety issues and extra flights of stairs, the uppermost floors were the least desirable, and thus the cheapest to rent. Regulation and administration Augustus instituted reforms aimed at increasing the safety of buildings in the city of Rome.Strabo 5.3.7 http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus- grc1:5.3.7 Because of the dangers of fire and collapse, the height of the insulae were restricted by Augustus to 70 Roman feet called the pes (20.7 m), and again by Emperor Nero down to 60 Roman feet (17.75 m) after the Great Fire of Rome.Robert Draper. \\"Rethinking Nero.\\" National Geographic September 2014 http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/09/emperor-nero/draper-text According to the 4th-century Regionary catalogues, there were about 42,000‚Äì46,000 insulae in the city, as compared to about 1,790 dom≈´s in the late 3rd century. Data on the number of insulae and to a lesser extent dom≈´s are used for classical demography. The city's population in the late 3rd century is thought to have fluctuated between 700,000‚Äì800,000, down from more than 1 million, based also on figures for the amount of grain required to feed the population in Rome and surrounding areas.

It is loosely based upon the character Emmanuelle created by Emmanuelle Arsan in the 1960s and featured in dozens of softcore films over the years. The series was produced by Alain Siritzky, whose production company proceeded to make many Emmanuelle films for screen and TV during the 1990s and 2000s.  Plot  The series starred Krista Allen as Emmanuelle, a hedonistic young woman who finds herself teaching the ways of sexuality to a group of aliens who land on Earth, and Paul Michael Robinson as an alien space captain. The story follows an extraterrestrial space crew that finds Emmanuelle on Earth and enlists her help to understand human love and sexuality. As in the case with the other Emmanuelle films, Emmanuelle in Space contains much nudity and sexual content. Today, the various episodes of Emmanuelle in Space are generally available edited together into feature-length productions on DVD and occasionally show up on broadcasters such as Cinemax and cable networks outside the U.S.  Cast and characters  * Krista Allen as Emmanuelle: After breaking up with her boyfriend, she is propositioned by Captain Haffron to teach his crew and him about life and sex on Earth. Emmanuelle is pansexual and is very liberal in her sexual endeavors. She soon falls in love with Haffron. * Paul Michael Robinson as Captain Haffron Williams: The captain of the alien space craft, he propositions Emmanuelle to teach him about sex. He transfers his knowledge to his crew. Haffron was asexual before Emmanuelle arose desire in him. He teaches her view of multiple partners and pansexuality to the others. He becomes somewhat of a serial love maker. He soon falls in love with Emmanuelle, but cannot define his emotions. From Emmanuelle 4: Concealed Fantasy, Haffron is inferred to have once been part of a top-secret government project and was monitored.

The station's frequency is 103.7 MHz and it broadcasts at a power of 100 kW. WLLR (commonly known as \\"#1 Country\\") is owned by iHeartMedia, with studios located in Davenport. Other stations located in the same complex are KMXG, KUUL-FM, KCQQ-FM, WFXN and WOC. History of 103.7 MHz The Davenport allocation for 103.7 FM ‚Äì representing the second FM station in the Quad Cities ‚Äì dates to October 1948, when the station signed on as WOC-FM, a companion to its AM sister station, WOC (1420 AM). The station was owned by the Palmer family, a well-known Quad Cities family that started the Palmer College of Chiropractic. As with most FM radio stations in the 1950s and 1960s, WOC-FM played mostly easy listening and classical music. The frequency's first major format change came in February 1972, when WOC-FM became the Quad-Cities market's first full-time FM rock station. Adopting a Top 40/CHR format, the station's call letters changed to KIIK, and was known to fans as \\"KIIK 104.\\" KIIK quickly became very popular with Quad Cities-area listeners, and soon became the market's top-rated station. By the late 1980s, with new competitor station WPXR-FM (\\"Power 98.9\\") having taken over the CHR/Top 40 gauntlet, KIIK changed to a rock oldies station. As KUUL-FM, the station played music from the 1950s through early 1970s; the first song under the new format was \\"Nobody but Me\\" by The Human Beinz. The format change became effective in May 1989, and fans soon identified the \\"KUUL Red Radio\\" (a jumbo-sized boombox replica) with the station at its live remote broadcast sites. The most recent change to the station came in March 1998, when KUUL and WLLR (which had used a country format at 101.3 FM since 1983) swapped frequencies. KUUL's 50s and 60s format moved to 101.3 FM, while WLLR's country format took over 103.7 FM. In December 1985, WLLR briefly gained national attention when a disc jockey played the Christmas song \\"Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer\\" 27 times back-to-back during the morning show. Station management was eventually able to pull the jockey off the air and suspended him. The disc jockey was reportedly depressed and upset that a co-worker had left employment at the station for an out-of- state job.United Press International, \\"Dj\`s Record Effort Pulls Him Off Air,\\" Chicago Tribune, December 19, 1985. Accessed 12-23-2017. Some of WLLR's best- known personalities include: Mike Kenneally, Ron Evans, Jack Carey, Andy Scott, Jack Daniels, Amy Jeffries, Pat Leuck, Dani Lynn Howe, Tim Carlson, JD Justice and Jim O'Hara. WLLR's stage at the Mississippi Valley Fair was featured in the Music Video for \\"Don't Ya Just Wanna Rock and Roll\\" by Rodney Atkins. In November 2013, WLLR won the CMA award for 'Small Market Station of the Year'. Since 1989, WLLR has remained the top-rated station in the Quad Cities, maintaining audience 12+ shares between 10 and 20 for the past 20 years. 103.7 HD2 On January 1, 2014, WLLR discontinued its Classic Country on the HD2 and began broadcasting a classic rock format. On August 21, 2015, at 1:04 p.m., WLLR-HD2 switched to an alternative rock format, branded as \\"ALT 104.5\\" (also broadcast on FM translator K283BV 104.5 FM Davenport).Alt 104.5 Debuts in Quad Citieshttp://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?realid=103 HD Radio Guide for Quad Cities, Iowa & Illinois References External links *#1 Country 103.7 WLLR  Category:Country radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:Radio stations in the Quad Cities Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WLLR-FM"},{"id":"2605808","text":"Hisham Sliti, is a citizen of Tunisia who was held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba.

The Slovak Spectator reports that Sliti was arrested by Slovak security officials, and the release of their arrest video stirred controversy. Official status reviews Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention.

It runs roughly north‚Äìsouth in a near straight route through the western part of the city centre and is the longest road in the city centre at over one mile in length. History Deansgate is one of the city's oldest thoroughfares. In Roman times its route passed close to the Roman fort of Mamucium and led from the River Medlock where there was a ford and the road to Deva (Chester). Along its length were several civilian buildings and a mansio in the vicinity of the Hilton Hotel. Part of it was called Aldport Lane from Saxon times. (Aldport was the Saxon name for Castlefield.) Until the 1730s the area was rural but became built up after the development of a quay on the river. The road is named after the lost River Dene, which may have flowed along the Hanging Ditch connecting the River Irk to the River Irwell, at the street's northern end. (\\"Gate\\" derives from the Norse gata, meaning way). By the late 19th century, Deansgate was an area of varied uses: its northern end had shopping and substantial office buildings while further south were slums and a working class area around St John's Church (St John Street remaining upper middle class). The Wood Street Mission began to address the social problems in 1869 and its work continues in a very different form. From Peter Street southwards, the eastern side was dominated by the viaducts of the Great Northern and Manchester South Junction Railways, while the Rochdale Canal crossed below Deansgate to connect with the other waterways beyond. In the late 20th century, Deansgate was home to the head office of the Manchester Evening News newspaper, now replaced by part of the Spinningfields development. Geography Deansgate begins at Victoria Street, a 19th-century creation. Its east side was occupied by the Victoria Buildings built on a triangular site by Manchester Corporation in 1876 but demolished during a bomb raid in the Manchester Blitz in December 1940.There were 31 shops on the ground floor of Victoria Buildings and many offices on the floors above. Victoria Arcade ran through the block and at the northern end was the Victoria Hotel with 100 rooms. A statue of Oliver Cromwell at the northern corner commemorated Manchester's support for Parliament in the English Civil War. The statue was a gift to the city by Mrs Abel Heywood in memory of her first husband, Thomas Goadsby and was the first large statue of Cromwell to be raised in the open anywhere in England.Hardy, Clive (2000) Francis Frith's Greater Manchester. Salisbury: Francis Frith Collection; pp. 67‚Äì69, 71 At the northern end of Deansgate is Victoria Street, on which lies Manchester Cathedral, and at the southern end is Deansgate railway station. At this point Deansgate connects with Bridgewater Viaduct and Chester Road (Whitworth Street West meets it at this point). The section to the south of Peter Street was known as Aldport Street until the end of the 18th century.Laurent (1793) \\"Plan of Manchester and Salford illustrated\\", in: Bradshaw (1985), p. 20 The street contains many shops including a House of Fraser department store known as Kendals from the 1830s until 2005, and Waterstones along with many public houses and bars including the Moon Under Water, formerly the Deansgate Cinema (or ABC Deansgate). At , able to accommodate 1,700 customers, and employing 60 staff, it has been listed in The Guinness Book of Records as the largest public house in Britain. Elliot House was the Manchester Registry Office and before that the offices of the corporation's Education Department. The northern end of the street adjoined the Shambles and was badly damaged in the 1996 Manchester bombing. The area was redeveloped and houses several new buildings, including No. 1 Deansgate and the Manchester branch of Harvey Nichols. Other buildings in the Deansgate area include the Royal Bank of Scotland, the Beetham Tower, and the redeveloped Great Northern Warehouse. Historic buildings include the John Rylands Library and the Barton Arcade shopping mall. The disused Manchester and Salford Junction canal runs directly underneath Deansgate below the Great Northern Warehouse. Deansgate electoral ward within Manchester City Council Transport Deansgate railway station: station frontage which features the previous \\"Knott Mill\\" name Today, the main transport links on Deansgate are the National Rail and Manchester Metrolink stations and a number of bus routes, including the Metroshuttle services. Deansgate Station was opened at Knott Mill on 20 July 1849 by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway. It is linked to Deansgate-Castlefield Metrolink station on the Metrolink system. In the first half of the 20th century, Deansgate was a route for trams operated by Manchester Corporation Tramways, and subsequently carried numerous bus services. During the 1970s, many bus routes were diverted or separated into two services terminating in the city centre and adjoining streets such as King Street were pedestrianised. In 2009, there were calls for traffic to be banned on Deansgate and for it to be pedestrianised. The calls were triggered in response to road works that closed parts of Deansgate. Some argued that the disablement of a major traffic route in the city centre could have a damaging economic effect while others argued that a vehicle-free Deansgate would attract more shoppers. Victoria Street, the short section at the North end of the road by Manchester Cathedral has been pedestrianised. in 2019 Extinction Rebellion occupied a section of the road from St Mary‚Äôs Gate to John Dalton Street for four days, with tents and organised talks on climate change, sustainable living and resistance. This reignited calls for it to be pedestrianised. Bus 1 runs between Piccadilly Station and Albert Square, via Chinatown, Deansgate and Spinningfields. Bus 2 runs between Piccadilly Station and Victoria Station, via Oxford Road Station and Deansgate Station. Bus 3 runs between Piccadilly and Victoria, via Deansgate.

In 2006, A1 Racing cars visited the city to launch A1 Grand Prix, and used Deansgate as part of the route. In August 2011 thousands packed the street as Jenson Button drove a McLaren MP4-23 along Deansgate as part of the Vodafone Vip Live Manchester festival. In 2001 the inaugural Great City Games took place on Deansgate, which featured a 150-metre sprinting track. The event has become an annual fixture on the Great Manchester Run weekend during mid-May.

The company is the largest privately held retail mortgage lender in the United States and the largest subprime lender by volume. ACCCH was founded by Roland Arnall. As well as Ameriquest Mortgage, the company also owned Argent Mortgage which made wholesale loans through mortgage brokers, and AMC Mortgage Services which carried out customer services activities for all ACCCH mortgages. Ameriquest closed in 2007, and the rest of the company was acquired by Citigroup. Company reorganization The risky nature of subprime loans, massive defaults of those loans, the softening of the real estate market, and ACC's own practices have led to a financial crisis: *In early 2006, Ameriquest Mortgage settled a class action lawsuit for US$325 million with the attorneys general of 49 of the 50 states over allegations of predatory lending practices. Allegations included usury and bait-and-switch tactics. *On May 2, 2006, ACC Capital Holdings announced the closure of all of its Ameriquest Mortgage branch offices as part of a plan to consolidate its retail mortgage lending operations into four regional call centers.Branch closure Thousands of employees were fired via conference call. The employees were given five minutes to get their personal belongings and leave the office. Ameriquest would soon be joined by other American mortgage companies in announcing massive layoffs. On February 28, 2007 ACC Capital Holdings announced that Citi was providing working capital and access to credit. Citi also gained the option to purchase Argent and AMC, but this option did not extend to Ameriquest.LA Times article on ACCCH and Citigroup, retrieved 3/11/2007 On September 9, 2007, Argent Mortgage was sold to Citi for an undisclosed amount. Argent was renamed Citi Residential Lending. Citi Residential Lending operated for several months before it was shut down. On September 10, 2007, Ameriquest stopped accepting loan applications. Former employees from Ameriquest, which was United States's leading wholesale lender, described a system in which they were pushed to falsify documents on bad Ameriquest Mortgages and then sell them to Wall Street banks eager to make fast profits. There is growing evidence that such mortgage fraud may be at the heart of the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010.Road to Ruin: Mortgage Fraud Scandal Brewing May 13, 2009 by American News Project hosted by The Real News Sponsorships *In 2006, Ameriquest sponsored the \\"Ameriquest Dream Team\\" in the NASCAR Busch Series. Drivers Mark Martin (#6), Greg Biffle (#16), Matt Kenseth (#17), and Carl Edwards (#60) all drove Ameriquest racecars throughout the season. In 2007, Ameriquest transferred this sponsorship to NEXTEL Cup, sponsoring Biffle in the #16 car for most of the schedule. However, due to the continuing problems with the subprime loan industry, Ameriquest has announced that it will not sponsor the #16 past the 2007 season, and, judging by the end of the naming rights deal for the baseball park (see below), this deal could be terminated earlier. *In 2004, Argent commenced a sponsorship deal with IndyCar driver Danica Patrick, but it did not follow her when she switched to Andretti-Green Racing for the 2007 season. *From 2004 to 2007, Ameriquest owned the naming rights to the home stadium of the Texas Rangers baseball team. During this time the park was called Ameriquest Field. In March 2007, in an undisclosed agreement between the two entities, Ameriquest relinquished those rights, and the stadium was renamed Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, just one word off from the ballpark's original name. Political donations In 2005, Ameriquest Capital and three of its subsidiaries comprised four of the 53 entities that each contributed the maximum of $250,000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush. Writes USA Today, \\"Inaugural fundraisers Dawn and Roland Arnall found a creative way to pump more than the $250,000 limit into the event. Their mortgage firm, Ameriquest Capital, contributed the maximum, as did three subsidiaries, for a total of $1 million. The company declined to comment on its political giving.\\" Arnall's contributions to Republican Bush were a change of heart, and the result of Arnall's support for Bush's middle east policies post 9/11. Previously, Arnall was a long-time Democratic Party supporter and fundraiser. His wedding to Dawn Arnall was officiated by Democratic California Governor Gray Davis.

\\"stand\\") was from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century the title of the head of a church in the Reformed Churches in Switzerland. It was the highest office in churches with synodal church governance. The word was used first in 1525 as an unofficial title of honor for Huldrych Zwingli in Zurich, then in 1530 for Johannes Oecolampadius in Basel and in 1532 for Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. The antistes was elected by the great council (the parliament) of the city and also held besides this office a pastorship of one of the main churches. The antistes had to be an ordained minister. He was the official representative of the church. He presided over the synod, and over the theological examinations of candidates for the office of pastor. His direct rights were very limited, but a man with high leadership capabilities like Zwingli or Bullinger could exert a great influence on the church in this office. In the late nineteenth century the title was replaced by other office designations, e.g. church president or president of the church council.

It is the fourth of his five \\"Christmas Books\\", coming after The Cricket on the Hearth and followed by The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain. The setting is an English village that stands on the site of an historic battle. Some characters refer to the battle as a metaphor for the struggles of life, hence the title. Battle is the only one of the five Christmas Books that has no supernatural or explicitly religious elements. (One scene takes place at Christmas time, but it is not the final scene.) The story bears some resemblance to The Cricket on the Hearth in two respects: it has a non-urban setting, and it is resolved with a romantic twist. It is even less of a social novel than is Cricket. As is typical with Dickens, the ending is a happy one. It is one of Dickens's lesser-known works and has never attained any high level of popularity ‚Äì a trait it shares among the Christmas Books with The Haunted Man. Plot summary Two sisters, Grace and Marion, live happily in an English village with their two servants, Clemency Newcome and Ben Britain, and their good-natured widower father Dr Jeddler. Dr Jeddler is a man whose philosophy is to treat life as a farce. Marion, the younger sister, is betrothed to Alfred Heathfield, Jeddler's ward who is leaving the village to complete his studies. He entrusts Marion to Grace's care and makes a promise to return to win Marion's hand. Michael Warden, a libertine who is about to leave the country, is thought by the barristers Snitchey and Craggs to be about to seduce the younger sister into an elopement. Clemency spies Marion one night in her clandestine rendezvous with Warden. On the day that Alfred is to return, however, it is discovered that Marion has run off. Her supposed elopement causes much grief to both her father and her sister. Six years pass. Clemency is now married to Britain and the two have set up a tavern in the village. After nursing heartbreak, Alfred marries Grace instead of Marion and she bears him a daughter, also called Marion. On the birthday of Marion, Grace confides to Alfred that Marion has made a promise to explain her so-called \\"elopement\\" in person. Marion indeed appears that evening by sunset and explains her disappearance to the parties involved. It turns out that Marion has not \\"eloped\\" but has instead been living at her aunt Martha's place so as to allow Alfred to fall in love with Grace. Tears are shed and happiness and forgiveness reign as the missing sister is reunited with the rest. Warden also returns, and, forgiven by Dr Jeddler, marries Marion.

The SERT was formed in 1986 to provide a tactical capability to respond to major terrorist incidents throughout Canada. The unit was disbanded in 1993 when responsibility for counter terrorist response transferred from the RCMP to the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). History =HARP= In 1978, the RCMP commenced the Emergency Response Team (ERT) Program developing an Emergency Response Team Course and establishing 31 part-time Emergency Response Team tactical units across Canada. In 1981, the Solicitor General directed the RCMP to form a counter terrorist unit the Hostage Assault and Rescue Program (HARP) to be based in Ottawa from the best ERT members in the ERT Program. HARP was to provide security for the 7th G7 Summit to be held in July 1981 in Montebello. The selected members were trained at Canadian Forces Base Petawawa by the British Army 22 Special Air Service (22 SAS) with CAF support. In late June 1981, 28 members completed the program. The RCMP had decided to not establish HARP as a full-time unit with members after serving a three-month period required to rotate back to their ERT for a period of one and half months. The program ended after an agreement could not be reached with the members who had requested that HARP be made full-time so that they could be based permanently in Ottawa. In March 1985, terrorists attacked the Turkish embassy in Ottawa killing a security guard and holding the embassy occupants hostage for several hours. In May, the Solicitor General submitted a proposal to Cabinet to establish a full-time national counter terrorist unit by either the RCMP or the CAF. At the time, the CAF did not have a special operations force. Neither the RCMP or CAF wanted the responsibility. In June, terrorists placed a bomb on Air India Flight 182 in Toronto and also a bomb on CP Air Flight 003 in Vancouver. In December, Cabinet decided to form a unit and on 22 January 1986 selected the RCMP to create the unit. =Formation= In March 1986, the SERT was established tasked to respond to hostage incidents involving foreign diplomats or other crises beyond the capability of the ERT. SERT was confined to operating within Canadian territory and could not participate in operations to rescue Canadians involved in a terrorist incident abroad. SERT consisted of 49 operators divided into two sub-units of 24 who rotated on a monthly basis between on call and training, and if required, could deploy as a whole unit. The former HARP members formed the initial nucleus of the unit with additional operators recruited from the ERT Program which at the time had approximately 350 members. To be eligible to apply for SERT a volunteer must have had seven years of service with the RCMP. Volunteers had to pass a nine-day selection course and complete a six-month training course to respond to incidents on land such as barricaded strongholds, trains, planes and vehicles. The course was based on methods and tactics of the 22 SAS, the US FBI Hostage Rescue Team and the German Federal Police GSG 9. SERT had a limited capacity to respond to maritime counter-terrorism incidents such as at sea. In 1987, the RCMP purchased of land about from Ottawa for a training facility for Dwyer Hill. The Dwyer Hill Training Facility construction was completed in 1989 with the facility providing an indoor swimming pool, 50-metre indoor range, Close Quarter Battle House, Method of Entry building, four-storey concrete tower, large passenger bus, 300-metre range sniper range and a former Air Canada Douglas DC-8. In 1990, the Royal Canadian Air Force formed the SERT Assault Helicopter (SAH) Flight in 450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron to provide dedicated aviation support to SERT with three CH-135 Twin Huey helicopters. Earlier in 1987, a MOU had been agreed between the RCMP and the CAF for the provision of fixed wing and rotary wing support for SERT training and operations. Since inception, SERT had never been deployed on an operation. A SERT sub-unit pre-deployed in readiness to support law enforcement for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1987 held in Vancouver and in 1988 to the XV Olympic Winter Games in Calgary and to the 14th G7 Summit in Toronto. SERT had been concerned for sometime that due to its size it lacked the capacity to competently assault a wide-bodied aircraft and that it would require an increase to its size with the additional of a third sub-unit. In February 1992, the Solicitor General finally provided SERT with the authority to commence recruitment for an additional sub-unit which would bring the total strength of unit to 72 operators. The Senate Special Committee on Terrorism and the Public Safety produced a report in 1989 that criticized the RCMP for failing to have conducted training exercises between SERT and other Canadian police forces tactical units. The Committee's earlier report in 1987 had found that there was also a reluctance on the part of other police forces to train with the RCMP. There was a view in some large police forces that their own tactical units were as capable as SERT and that they would not require assistance from the RCMP to resolve a terrorist incident. =Disbandment= In February 1992, the federal government decided to transfer responsibility for national counter terrorism response to the Canadian Armed Forces. The government had reduced the budget of all federal departments who had to in- turn implemented cuts. The RCMP estimated that they would save approximately $5 million annually as a result of the transfer. The CAF view on raising a special operations force had changed from 1985 and it was now open to a proposal being driven by the Deputy Minister of National Defence Robert Fowler to assume the responsibility from the RCMP. The CAF formed a special operations force Joint Task Force 2 (JTF 2) with SERT formally handing over responsibility to JTF 2 on 31 March, with the unit becoming operational the following day on 1 April 1992. SERT operators provided training to the initial JTF 2 volunteers based on their own selection and training course. The SERT Dwyer Hill Training Centre was handed over to JTF 2. The JTF 2 role remained the same as the SERT of counter terrorist response ('black role') until 1994 when the Chief of the Defence Staff approved an expansion of JTF 2 to include the additional role of war time special operations ('green role'). In 2001, JTF 2 began to develop a maritime-counter terrorism capability.

relational, and multidimensional data. The term has widespread use in various contexts, but is primarily associated with specialized software designed specifically for data analysis.  Common data drilling operations  There are certain operations that are common to applications that allow data drilling. Among them are: Query operations: * tabular query * pivot query = Tabular query = Tabular query operations consist of standard operations on data tables. Among these operations are: * search * sort * filter (by value) * filter (by extended function or condition) * transform (e.g., by adding or removing columns) Consider the following example: Fred and Wilma table (Fig 001): gender , fname , lname , home male , fred , chopin , Poland male , fred , flintstone , bedrock male , fred , durst , usa female , wilma , flintstone , bedrock female , wilma , rudolph , usa female , wilma , webb , usa male , fred , johnson , usa The preceding is an example of a simple flat file table formatted as comma-separated values. The table includes first name, last name, gender and home country for various people named fred or wilma. Although the example is formatted this way, it is important to emphasize that tabular query operations (as well as all data drilling operations) can be applied to any conceivable data type, regardless of the underlying formatting. The only requirement is that the data be readable by the software application in use. = Pivot query = A pivot query allows multiple representations of data according to different dimensions. This query type is similar to tabular query, except it also allows data to be represented in summary format, according to a flexible user-selected hierarchy. This class of data drilling operation is formally (and loosely) known by different names, including crosstab query, pivot table, data pilot, selective hierarchy, intertwingularity and others. To illustrate the basics of pivot query operations, consider the Fred and Wilma table (Fig 001). A quick scan of the data reveals that the table has redundant information. This redundancy could be consolidated using an outline or a tree structure or in some other way. Moreover, once consolidated, the data could have many different alternate layouts. Using a simple text outline as output, the following alternate layouts are all possible with a pivot query: Summarize by gender (Fig 001): female flintstone, wilma rudolph, wilma webb, wilma male chopin, fred flintstone, fred durst, fred johnson, fred (Dimensions = gender; Tabular fields = lname, fname;) Summarize by home, lname (Fig 001): bedrock flintstone fred wilma Poland chopin fred usa ... (Dimensions = home, lname; Tabular fields = fname;)  Uses  Pivot query operations are useful for summarizing a corpus of data in multiple ways, thereby illustrating different representations of the same basic information. Although this type of operation appears prominently in spreadsheets and desktop database software, its flexibility is arguably under-utilized. There are many applications that allow only a 'fixed' hierarchy for representing data, and this represents a substantial limitation. Drillup Drillup is the opposite off drilldown. For example, if you drilldown for to see the revenue of one product, then you might want to drillup to see the revenue of all products.

It is one of the smallest communities in Kent, and over the years large parts of the parish have been transferred to other neighbouring communities.Notes on the history of the civil parish Acol is situated just north of the Western end of the runway at Manston Airport. History Acol was recorded in 1270 under the name Acholt meaning Oak Wood. The condition for labourers throughout Kent at the end of the Napoleonic War deteriorated to the point where unrest brought about the start of the Swing Riots in 1833‚Äì4. At the same time, many labourers left Kent, often with the grateful assistance of their parish councils who did not want to keep supporting them, to take up new lives in the colonies in North America and particularly Australia and New Zealand. About 1880, Henry Perry Cotton, of Quex Park north of Acol, developed land in Kilburn, London, naming one street Acol Road;; there in the 1930s Acol Bridge Club members developed the Acol bidding system used by most British contract bridge players.; St Mildred's Church The Anglican parish church of St Mildred was designed by the architect C. N. Beazley, built in 1876 to serve as both a church and a school. The church, located on Plumstone Road towards the south of the hamlet, was built out of flint rubble in a Gothic Revival style. The construction utilises an inside stock brick walling faced externally with stone quoins, pilasters and buttresses, while the panels set between the stone work are filled using flint. The south side of the building is cut into the ground, providing extended interior space despite the exterior's diminutive size. The building's apse, which replaces the usual chancel arch found in similar churches of its size, contains stained glass windows which depict Christ's Crucifixion, Our Lady and St John the Evangelist, and were designed by Gibbs & Howard, who work out of Charlotte Street in Fitzroy Square, London.John E. Vigar's Kent Churches: St Mildred, Acol The Smugglers Leap Close by Acol is the famous chalk pit where Exciseman Gill and Smuggler Bill met their deaths as told in the well-known poem, The Smuggler's Leap by Richard Harris Barham. Exciseman Gill sold his soul for a demon horse that had the ability to catch Smuggler Bill. In the swirling mist on that night in Thanet, just as Exciseman Gill caught up to the Smuggler, he drove his horse off the top of the chalk pit as did the Riding Officer. The bodies of the two men and only one horse were found later and are still said to haunt the area.

It is often said to have been the first ever concert held at the stadium, but a pop concert featuring the bands Status Quo and Yes had been held as part of the Oxfam Walk 1969 charity event at the stadium on 13 July 1969. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, many rock and roll performers from the 1950s experienced major career revivals due to a temporary upswing of interest in their form of music. The revival was marked by a series of major concerts in the United States, and also spread to Europe where events such as the Wembley concert attracted thousands of fans who came out to see the performers behind the music. The concert included performances by major stars including Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Bill Haley and His Comets. The concert ended with an extended performance by Chuck Berry, who at the time was enjoying major chart success in Britain and the US with his \\"My Ding-a-Ling\\". Originally billed rock and roll era acts The Platters, The Drifters and The Coasters were unable to perform due to work permit issues. The show was opened instead with sets from British rock and rollers The Houseshakers, Joe Brown, Emile Ford & the Checkmates, Screaming Lord Sutch, Heinz (backed by Wilko Johnson and John Sparks from Dr. Feelgood) and Billy Fury; as well as songs from Jerry Lee Lewis's sister Linda Gail Lewis.

Publisher difficulties led to it having a protracted development cycle. Originally intended to be published by Merit as a DOS-based title, it was ultimately released on February 28, 1997, as 7th Level's first 3D game. Reviews upon release were unenthusiastic, as critics found that while the main selling point (that characters could leave their mechs and commandeer others) was innovative, the overall execution of the game was weak. G-Nome was followed up by a real-time strategy spin-off called Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3, developed by 7th Level, but acquired and released by Ion Storm. Gameplay A Union soldier entering a vehicle. The entirety of G-Nome's gameplay is based around close-surface combat, by the means of direct foot movement or the occupancy of vehicles. The majority of the vehicles are bipedal assault machines called \\"HAWCs\\", (Heavy Armored Weapons Chassis), that usually carry between two and four weapon mounts, which vary between laser pulse weapons, machine guns and missiles. Aside from the HAWCs, each of the races in the game maintain hovercrafts and armored support vehicles, for strategic insurance and variability. Larger vehicles are capable of carrying passengers, although the well-being of the pilot and the vehicle's maintenance greatly affects the longevity in which the passengers may occupy the vehicle. Foot combat is generally disadvantaged to opponents occupying vehicles; however, ground soldiers are equipped not only with low-energy laser rifles, but non-lethal grenade launchers called GASHRs, which upon impact, will eject the occupants of any vehicle or structure. G-Nome features four alien factions- the Darken, the Union, the Mercs and the Scorp. Each of these races represent a certain environmental theme; the Darken are desert-themed, the Union-centered portion takes place in a volcanic land, the Mercs are snow and ice-themed and the Scorp are nature-themed. All the races maintain similar naming conventions and strength orientation in regards to their vehicles and structures, with certain attributes of one vehicle having a relative advantage over the other. The one exception to this would be the Mercs, whose faction features an extra vehicle and all their vehicles do not feature auto-eject systems upon destruction, causing a guaranteed fatality, if not attended to. Story The game takes place in the year 2225, A.D., on the remote world of Ruhelen in the Omicron Reticuli star system. This planet has been a contested territory between the Darken, Union, Mercs and the Scorp, which are the Union's greatest threat. The discovery of the mineral-rich Phygos star system nearby has upset the tenuous strategic balance of the four races, leading to speculation of an inevitable war. The player assumes the role of Sergeant Joshua Gant, a retired Union Intelligence Acency, (UIA), operative, who for ten years prior, has been experiencing horrifying nightmares from a mission that resulted in the loss of his best friend and comrade, Ron Pearl. Following one of Gant's nightmares, the sergeant is contacted by UIA director General Allance Wilkins, who reinstates Gant immediately for a mission of the utmost importance. According to Wilkins, the Scorp have been conducting top-secret biological warfare experiments upon human prisoners of war, in order to create a mutated super- soldier dubbed the \\"G-Nome\\". Gant is commanded to euthanize the G-Nome and destroy the Scorp facility that has been housing the experiments. For assistance, Gant is assigned a team that includes his old friend and munitions expert, Sergeant Stephen Kylie, Union's most accomplished geneticist, Doctor Victoria Thane and an undisclosed final member of the team operating within the Scorp territory. Gant begins his mission by traversing the Darken Republic on foot and strategically taking out any opposition that would hinder his objective of rendezvousing with Kylie. United once again, the duo embark across the Merc territory to meet Thane, who has been on a separate assignment. Upon Wilkins' disposition, Thane identifies some specialized Merc technology stored away at a facilitated structure called the Citadel upon a mesa called Caracon as the means of neutralizing the G-Nome. After acquiring the technology, the team heads for the Scorp territory. Gant and his team bypass the heavily-defended Scorp border, where he is introduced to the final member of his team: Major Jack Sheridan, a Scorp specialist and the man responsible for the loss of Pearl ten years prior. After several precarious skirmishes with the intent of acquiring Scorp vehicles for bypassing mine fields and learning of the G-Nome facility's location, Sheridan leads the team directly to the laboratory. The mission is compromised, however, when Sheridan attempts to kill Gant, captures the G-Nome and allows for Kylie to be captured by Scorp reinforcements. Soon after, however, the Scorp ally with Gant, with recognizing Sheridan and the G-Nome as a greater threat. The Scorp and UIA realize that Sheridan has a genetic recombination laboratory located within the volcanic Shalten Frontier, where not only is he backed by a sizable army, but he intends to clone the G-Nome. After gaining reinforcements from Wilkins and a large confrontation at the secret facility, Sheridan kills Kylie immediately after Gant destroys the laboratory. While the Union finish off Sheridan's forces, Gant gives chase after Sheridan, with the G-Nome in tow. Gant disables Sheridan's powerful vehicles and kills him. Gant confronts and subdues the G-Nome and while examining a marker upon its paw, he discovers that Pearl was the G-Nome. In an act of mercy, Gant allows Pearl to survive and tells him to run away before the Union forces arrive. The G-Nome is seen heading toward the sunset in the ending credits of the game. As Sheridan's forces are defeated, Wilkins rummages through the remains of the recombination lab and comes across a petri dish labelled \\"G-NOME: PEARL\\". Wilkins grabs the dish and departs. In the aftermath the Scorp declares war on the Union, in retaliation for the mission. Reports leak through of a covert Union operation intended to destroy the Scorp G-Nome facility, but are denied by both the Union and the Scorp, while Wilkins unexpectedly resigns, causing public speculation that the alleged operation ended in failure. Development G-Nome made its first public appearance in the form of conceptual video footage shown at publisher Merit's booth at the Summer 1994 Consumer Electronics Show. Merit suffered from a number of financial setbacks, delaying the game, and the game's developer, Distant Thunder, was later acquired by 7th Level. Producer Todd Porter commented on the advantages of switching the development environment to Windows 95: \\"It's a real time, 3D, texture-mapped, polygon game. We're getting benchmarks that are just incredible right now. We're already a Windows-based company, so working with DirectDraw and Direct Access was a no-brainer. We did the Direct Access in October and what we saw was an immediate increase in speed. Another great thing about it is that we can play in any resolution, 320x200 all the way to 1280x1024.\\" Reception A Next Generation critic hailed the ability to exit one's mech, wander around on foot, and take over other characters' mechs as a never-before-seen feature, and praised the mission designs for their combination of fun \\"blast-fests\\" with ingenuously conceived infiltration missions. He nonetheless concluded that \\"While it admittedly introduces some interesting new elements, G-Nome doesn't put much of a dent in the MechWarrior genre.\\" Stephen Poole similarly remarked in GameSpot, \\"The good news is that G-NOME has several unique (and pretty cool) features that you won't find in any other mech game; the bad news is that muddy control, graphics glitches, and a sparse manual keep it from being the best it can be.\\" Besides the ability to take over mechs, he was pleased with the high level of control over one's teammates, but found that control issues make even basic maneuvers unreasonably difficult. He particularly criticized the fact that when on foot, the player character fires in the direction he's running instead of the direction he's facing. His final assessment was that players who can master the frustrating controls would still find the game worthwhile for its gameplay innovations.

Early life Of Syrian descent, Al-Husri was born in Sana'a, Yemen, to a government official from a wealthy Aleppine family. Frequent moving meant that he never received a formal education from a madrasah but instead spent his formative years studying at the Mekteb-i M√ºlkiye, a public administration college in Constantinople. Before studying the Arabic language, he learned Turkish and French. When he spoke, he reportedly had a Turkish accent.Dawisha, p.49. Career as an educationalist In 1900, he graduated from the Royal Academy, and worked as a schoolteacher in Ioannina in Epirus, then part of the European territories of the Ottoman Empire. During this period, he began to show an interest in questions of nationality and was exposed to the competing strands of European nationalism. After five years in Yanina, he took up a high-ranking administrative position in Macedonia, where the officers who would later form the Committee for Union and Progress (CUP) had a strong presence. After the Young Turk revolution of 1908, he was appointed in May 1909 director of the Teachers' Institute, Dar√ºlmuallimin in Constantinople, where he initiated major reforms in pedagogy and the public education system. In this period he became editor of two important educational reviews (\\"Tedrisat-ƒ± ƒ∞btidaiye Mecmuasƒ±\\", \\"Muallim\\").Kara, pp. 264-293. From 1910 to 1912, he visited European countries to examine modern educational methods.Charif, pp. 239-240. Initially a supporter of Ottomanism and the Young Turks, from 1916 on he moved towards Arabism. The Ottoman government granted al-Husri the post of director- general of education in the Syria Province at the beginning of World War I in 1914. In 1919, after the establishment of an independent Arab state in Syria under Faisal, al-Husri moved to Damascus where he was appointed Director General of Education, and later Minister of Education. Al-Husri followed Faisal to Iraq in 1920 after the French imposed their mandate on Syria, and from 1921 to 1927 held the position of Director of General Education. During this time, he published Al-Qiraa Al-Khaldouniya, the first modern Arabic language primer which was adopted by the ministry of education for about a century. In addition to other positions, he subsequently held the post of head of the Higher Teachers' Training College until 1937. During these years he played an influential role in promoting Arab nationalism through the educational system, and brought in teachers from Syria and Palestine to teach Arabic history and culture. According to Malik Mufti, his \\"chief accomplishment was to inculcate into the political and military elites of the country a permanent commitment to the vision of a strong and integrated Iraq destined one day to lead the entire Arab world.\\"Mufti, pp. 28-29 In 1941 nationalist army officers, from the first generation to have come under the influence of al-Husri's ideas,Mufti, p. 34 carried out a coup d'√©tat against the pro-British monarchy and government, briefly installing a pro-Axis regime under Rashid Ali al-Gailani. When British forces restored the monarchy, al- Husri was deported as were over a hundred of the Syrian and Palestinian teachers he had induced to come to Iraq.Mufti, p. 37n. Al-Husri's next major enterprise was the reform of the educational system in Syria. In 1943 the newly elected Syrian president Shukri al-Kuwatli invited him to Damascus, then still under the French mandate, to draw up a new curriculum along Arab nationalist lines for the country's secondary education system. Al-Husri established a curriculum informed by his nationalist ideas which considerably reduced the French cultural element and broke away from the French educational model. Against the bitter opposition of the French, and the reservations of various political figures, the new curriculum was introduced in December 1944, but the sudden change caused confusion and shortages of the new schoolbooks did nothing to improve its reception. A year later, the former curriculum was restored.Moubayed, p. In 1947, al-Husri moved to Cairo, taking up a position in the Cultural Directorate of the League of Arab States. He would remain there for 18 years, during which he produced most of his works. He returned to Baghdad in 1965, and died there in December 1968. Ideological views Al- Husri's approach to Arab nationalism was influenced by nineteenth-century European thinkers, especially German romantic nationalists such as Herder and Fichte. Historian Maher Charif describes him as having a \\"cultural- sentimental\\" approach to nationalism. Al-Husri's conception of the nation is a primordialist one. He viewed the nation as a living entity, and like other thinkers of his school insisted on its long-standing historic existence, even if its members were unconscious of that or refused to be considered an Arab. For al-Husri, the basic constituent elements of a nation were a shared language and a shared history. He rejected the idea that other factors, such as state action, religion, or economic factors, could play a part in bringing about nationalist sentiment; this was solely an emotional phenomenon arising from unity of language and culture.Charif, p. 204. Al-Husri rejected the idea of an Islamic nation on the basis that this would cover cultural and geographic scopes that are too broad. He argued that even if this were to be the ultimate goal, it would nevertheless be impossible to achieve without achieving Arab unity first. He also sought to distance Arabic from Islam, arguing that both the Arabs and Arabic existed before it.Al-Husri, Sati‚Äò. ‚ÄúMuslim Unity and Arab Unity.‚Äù In Islam in Transition: Muslim perspectives, 2nd edition, edited by John J. Donohue and Jon L. Esposito, 49-53. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007. Al-Husri saw localist tendencies as the main obstacle to the realisation of nationalist goals, but pointed to the German and Italian experiences as indications that they would eventually be overcome. Communist internationalism was also a threat, but by the mid-1920s, with the Caliphate abolished, al-Husri was confident that the challenge posed by pan- Islamism was vanquished.Charif, p. 205. Charif states that al-Husri \\"established a barrier between civilisation on the one hand, and culture on the other hand, taking the view that the first, which comprises the sciences, technology and modes of production, is intrinsically 'universal', while the latter, which comprises customs and language, is as such 'national'.\\" The Arab nation should, therefore, adopt all that the west had to offer in the first sphere, but jealously preserve its own culture. This distinction was influential among later nationalist theorists.Charif, pp. 204-205. Al-Husri paid particular attention to questions of language, a difficult issue in the Arab world due to widespread diglossia. He considered that a language reform was necessary given the situation whereby most Arabs were unable to use Classical Arabic, the universal Arab written language, yet could not communicate successfully with each other in the greatly differing spoken dialects of the Arab world. His proposal was that, at least as a temporary measure pending improved education, a somewhat simplified form of Classical Arabic should be developed which would be to some degree closer to the spoken dialects, yet retain its position as a universal language common to all Arabs. Quotes *Every Arab-speaking people is an Arab people. Every individual belonging to one of these Arabic-speaking peoples is an Arab. And if he does not recognize this, and if he is not proud of his Arabism, then we must look for the reasons that have made him take this stand. It may be an expression of ignorance; in that case we must teach him the truth. It may spring from an indifference or false consciousness; in that case we must enlighten him and lead him to the right path. It may result from extreme egoism; in that case we must limit his egoism. But under no circumstances, should we say: \\"As long as he does not wish to be an Arab, and as long as he is disdainful of his Arabness, then he is not an Arab.\\" He is an Arab regardless of his own wishes. Whether ignorant, indifferent, undutiful, or disloyal, he is an Arab, but an Arab without consciousness or feeling, and perhaps even without conscience.

Following a period of dormancy, the website was revived in December 2001, by Chris Saribay and Andrew Wilkinson. It was under extensive redevelopment and recently has an almost all-new masthead of authors, editors and designers. It was under the management of Daniel Hollister when the site went down. History Macteens (branded as \\"MacTeens\\") was originally formed as collaborative weblog formed in late 1998 by Neil Sroka and Jonathan Claydon. The website continually featured daily entries that noted news and the opinions of contributors. This early version of the website did not have any interactive portions, but had partnered with a website named MacParty to jointly host community discussion forums. This original incarnation of Macteens was also the first to discover the existence of Apple's Power Mac G4 Cube in 2000, before its official unveiling due to an accidental posting of specifications on ATi's website. Later, in that same year, the website was shut down, citing a floundering interest in the concept. The website was closed until late 2001, when Chris Saribay and Andrew Wilkinson began working to restore the website to its past glory. In 2002, with the assistance of Clark Mueller and Colin Winslow, the rebranded \\"Macteens\\" was launched, complete with new content from Macworld Conference and Expo. The website continued to grow and evolve, eventually incorporating discussion forums and image galleries. Unique magazine-style content was added, including tutorials, reviews and investigative reports. Such reports would occasionally be referenced by those in the traditional media, including an article in the Baltimore Sun that included excerpts of a Macteens report; noting several government related features in Mac OS X. Macteens contributors have also been interviewed by television news crews, including G4techTV, CBC and MSNBC. Today, Macteens continues to publish magazine-style content on its website, focusing on special event coverage of Mac events, such as Macworld Conference and Expo and Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, in addition to daily news, new product reviews and industry analysis. As of July 28, 2011, the site has been offline for a very long time, and has missed several deadlines to be back online. Currently the site reads: \\"returning soon. seriously.\\" with the Macteens logo in the middle. On their Twitter page, it is claimed that the latest missed deadline is because of @notdaniel vacationing to Europe.  Third Generation  Headed by Daniel Hollister, Macteens intended on shifting focus back onto a magazine format with regular articles, reviews and how-tos. Multimedia is also intended to be implemented, with a series of podcasts and screencasts featuring discussions, tutorials and Mac- related news stories. Extended projects, \\"teens\\" franchise Macteens has a history of launching companion websites to further its reach into its target market. Some of these websites have a specific message (as in the case of DontBuyMusic, see below), while others extend the website's reach into other operating systems, such as Linux and Microsoft Windows. =DontBuyMusic.com= In April 2003, Apple Computer had announced its new online-based music store, the iTunes Music Store, selling songs for 99¬¢. Shortly after the launch of this product, in August, a competing vendor (BuyMusic.com) began offering a similar product, selling music online. However, instead of using the companies' own marketing resources and assets, they closely mimicked and replicated Apple's marketing. Notably, this included both companies' television advertisements; both featured people singing their favorite songs, aided by an MP3 player. Aside from a different title card noting the respective websites of each vendor at the end of each advertisement, the advertisements were identical. Macteens quickly took note of this, and began creating a parody of the website, named DontBuyMusic.com. Days later, lawyers representing Direct Response Network, parent company of BuyMusic.com, sent a legal order to Macteens' hosting providers, ordering that the site be deconstructed and removed, ironically citing that the use of copyrighted materials was prohibited. Despite being protected by fair use laws, Macteens decided to shut down DontBuyMusic for a short period of time, while they worked to create a very similar website using their own code-base and graphics. As time progressed, BuyMusic.com began changing its marketing (and was eventually assimilated into Buy.com), and the website declined in popularity. As of this writing, DontBuyMusic.com forwards to the Macteens website. =Linuxteens= April 2004 brought the second member of the \\"teen franchise\\" for Macteens, with the creation of Linuxteens. Linuxteens was established with the same goals set in mind for Macteens: providing a community for teenagers, this time being users of the Linux operating system. Aside from covering news and including interactive portions such as discussion forums, the site also aims to develop and distribute its own version of Linux (development currently shelved). In early 2007, Linuxteens left the Macteens group (becoming www.teenlug.com). Teenlug is an entirely separate and unrelated network.

He competed in five consecutive editions of the Tour de France from 2001 to 2005. Riding as an all-round rider who rode well in hilly terrain, S√∏rensen was a valued support for the team leader without many wins of his own. Biography S√∏rensen only started his cycling career at the age of 19, having been a runner before that. He became a professional road bicycle racer in 1999 for team Team Chicky World. After the team closed down, S√∏rensen switched to another Denmark based team, Team Fakta where he made a good name for himself on the Danish stage as one of the strongest cards of Team Fakta, securing himself a place on the Danish team for the 2000 Olympics. Before the 2001 season, S√∏rensen was on the verge of joining British Linda McCartney Racing Team but instead opted to stay in Denmark with Team CSC ‚Äì World Online, as Team Saxo Bank was then known. In his first year with the team he participated in the 2001 Tour de France where he got a taste of success with a fourth place on stage 16. After then, S√∏rensen was a consistent part of the Tour setup for Team CSC, riding the biggest race in the cycling calendar every year from 2001 to 2005, his highlights including the overall GC rank of 20th in 2002. Another highlight was S√∏rensen's instrumental role in team captain Tyler Hamilton's win on stage 16 of the 2003 Tour de France when S√∏rensen, who was in a break away, sacrificed his own chances in order to pull Hamilton and thereby allow Tyler Hamilton to conserve the strength needed to win on the day. Nicki S√∏rensen started the 2005 season on a high note with a win in GP d'Ouverture la Marseillaise and a fourth place in Tour M√©diterran√©en during February, and during the season he prolonged his contract with Team CSC until 2007. In September Nicki S√∏rensen clinched stage 18 of the Vuelta a Espa√±a after defeating Pascual Rodriguez in the sprint. On 16 July 2009, S√∏rensen won Stage 12 of the 2009 Tour de France. He was in an early breakaway with five other riders and attacked the small group with 20 km to cover to win solo. S√∏rensen retired after riding the 2014 Giro di Lombardia. The last victory of his career was the 2012 Gran Premio Bruno Beghelli. Team management After his retirement he remained with as a directeur sportif and coach. For the 2016 season he moved across to the Israeli Cycling Academy Team. In October 2016 the new team announced that S√∏rensen would join them as a sports director for their inaugural season in 2017.

The asana does not have formally named variations, but several playful variants are used to assist beginning practitioners to become comfortable in the pose. Downward Dog stretches the hamstring and calf muscles in the backs of the legs, and builds strength in the shoulders. Some popular sites have advised against it during pregnancy, but an experimental study of pregnant women found it beneficial. Downward Dog has been called \\"deservedly one of yoga's most widely recognized yoga poses\\" and the \\"quintessential yoga pose\\". As such it is often the asana of choice when yoga is depicted in film, literature, and advertising. The pose has frequently appeared in Western culture, including in the titles of novels, a painting, and a television series, and it is implied in the name, \\"YOGŒõ\\", of a foldable computer.  Etymology and origins GajƒÅsana, Elephant Pose. Hand- drawn illustration in Sritattvanidhi, 19th century Mysore Palace manuscript. The instruction to perform this pose \\"over and over again\\" in the 18th century Ha»õhƒÅbhyƒÅsapaddhati is suggestive of the repetition of Downward Dog in the Surya Namaskar sequence. The name comes from the pose's similarity to the way a dog stretches when getting up. The Sanskrit name is from adhas (‡§Ö‡§ß‡§∏‡•ç) meaning \\"down\\", mukha (‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ) meaning \\"face\\", ≈õvƒÅna (‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§®) meaning \\"dog\\", and ƒÅsana (‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®) meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". The name is not found in the medieval hatha yoga texts, but a similar posture, GajƒÅsana (Elephant Pose), was described in the 18th century Ha»õhƒÅbhyƒÅsapaddhati; the text calls for it to be repeated \\"over and over again\\" from a prone position. Bhawanrao Shriniwasrao Pant Pratinidhi popularised the Sun Salutation in his 1928 book. The sequence uses Downward Dog Pose twice (numbers 4 and 7). A similar pose, together with a 5-count format and a method of jumps between poses resembling Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga's system, was described in Niels Bukh's early 20th century Danish text Primitive Gymnastics, which in turn was derived from a 19th-century Scandinavian tradition of gymnastics; the system had arrived in India by the 1920s. Indian gymnastics, too, had a system of postures, called \\"dands\\" (from Sanskrit ‡§¶‡§£‡•ç‡§° da·πá·∏ça, a staff), linked by jumps, and one of the dands is close to Downward Dog. In addition, in the 1920s, Bhawanrao Shriniwasrao Pant Pratinidhi, the Rajah of Aundh, (1868‚Äì1951; in office 1909‚Äì1947) popularized and named the practice of Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation), describing it in his 1928 book The Ten-Point Way to Health: Surya Namaskars. Downward Dog appears twice in its sequence of 12 postures. Neither the dand exercises nor Surya Namaskar were considered to be yoga in the 1930s. Swami Kuvalayananda incorporated Downward Dog into his system of exercises in the early 1930s, from where it was taken up by his pupil the influential yoga teacher Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. He in turn taught B. K. S. Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois, the founders of Iyengar Yoga and Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga respectively.  Description  The pose has the head down, ultimately touching the floor, with the weight of the body on the palms and the feet. The arms are stretched straight forward, shoulder width apart; the feet are a foot apart, the legs are straight, and the hips are raised as high as possible. The pose is approached differently in different schools of yoga. In Iyengar Yoga, the pose can be entered from a prone position, with the hands beside the chest, setting the distance between hands and feet. In schools such as Sivananda Yoga, the pose is practised as part of Surya Namaskar, the Salute to the Sun, for example following Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana (Upward Dog Pose) by exhaling, curling the toes under, and raising the hips. In the Bihar School of Yoga, the pose is named Parvatasana, Mountain Pose, the hands and feet somewhat closer to each other so that the angle at the hips is sharper; it is entered from a lunge (Ashwa Sanchalanasana) in a variant of Surya Namaskar.  Variations  Downward Dog is a restorative pose for experienced practitioners, but can be hard work for beginners. The pose can be varied by bending the knees, allowing the heels to lift slightly; by supporting the heels, such as with a rolled-up yoga mat; by lowering one forearm to the floor, extending the other hand forward; and by combinations of these. and its sub-pages. Other variations include bending one knee and lowering the hip on that side; alternately \\"pedalling\\" by bending one knee and raising the ankle on that side, then the other, and then hooking each foot in turn behind the other ankle; raising one leg, either stretching it straight out, or bending the knee, and flexing and extending the foot; alternating between bending both knees and straightening the legs while bringing the shoulders forward directly above the hands; and twisting the body, reaching back with one hand to grasp the opposite ankle. A variety of props can be used to assist in Downward Dog. For example, the pose can be supported with a strap from a secure waist-level wall anchor around the hips, or with a bolster under the forehead‚Äîcombined if required with a rolled blanket or towel under the feet. The pose can also be modified with the back horizontal and the hands on top of the back of a chair, putting less pressure on the shoulders; this is useful for people with an injury. Effects and contra-indications Downward Dog has positive effects on the musculoskeletal system. It stretches the hamstring and calf muscles in the backs of the legs, and builds strength in the shoulders. The pose has sometimes been advised against during pregnancy in popular sources, but that advice has been contested by a 2015 study which found no ill-effects from any of the 26 asanas investigated, including Downward Dog. The study examined the effects of the set of asanas on 25 healthy women who were between 35 and 37 weeks pregnant. The authors noted that apart from their experimental findings, they had been unable to find any scientific evidence that supported the previously published concerns, and that on the contrary there was evidence that yoga was suitable for pregnant women. Twentieth century yoga gurus such as B. K. S. Iyengar made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar claimed that Downward Dog \\"remove[d] fatigue\\", especially for runners. He claimed that sprinters would develop \\"speed and lightness in the legs\\", and that the pose would soften calcaneal spurs, strengthen the ankles, counteract stiffness and arthritis in the shoulders, strengthen the abdominal muscles, and slow the heart.  In culture  Lenovo \\"YOGŒõ\\" computer Yoga Journal has called Downward Dog \\"deservedly one of yoga's most widely recognized yoga poses\\". The Tico Times and others have called it the \\"quintessential yoga pose\\", noting that it is often chosen by film-makers when they need to depict a yoga class in progress. Mukti Jane Campion, presenter of the BBC programme The Secret History of Yoga, called the pose \\"iconic\\". Yoga teacher and author Erin Stewart writes that Downward Dog has been used in advertising for the Lenovo \\"YOGŒõ\\" device which can be folded (hence its name) to serve as a laptop computer or as a tablet, so that \\"it's the gadget itself that's doing the pose\\". A form of yoga practised by dog owners with their dogs, Doga, founded in America at the start of the 21st century, is typified by dog pose, though the author and Doga teacher Mahny Djahanguiri states that whatever the appearance, dogs do not really do yoga. Downward dog and yogi: Doga Downward Dog Pose is mentioned in many artistic and literary contexts: for example, Saatchi Art features an acrylic on canvas painting entitled \\"Downward Dog\\" by Steve Palumbo, and the name of the pose was chosen for an American Broadcasting Company television comedy show which ran in 2017, as well as the title of a 2013 novel by Edward Vilga. Chantel Guertin named her 2013 chick lit novel, balancing relationships, yoga, and cosmetic surgery Stuck in Downward Dog, while the yoga teacher and author Tracy Weber named her series of crime novels The Downward Dog Mysteries. Texas Monthly used the name for its review of the downfall of the Anusara Yoga founder, John Friend. The mindful yoga instructor Anne Cushman's 2014 book Moving into Meditation invites the reader to take the \\"Journey of Downward Dog\\", a playful exploration of variations of the pose, \\"with an eye to awakening the flow of aliveness\\".

Kidston, \\"Northern Cheyenne break vow of silence\\", Helena Independent Record, 28 June 2005, accessed 23 Oct 2009 Biography During the Battle of the Rosebud, the Cheyenne and Lakota, allied under the leadership of Crazy Horse, had been retreating, and they left the wounded Chief Comes in Sight on the battlefield. Suddenly Buffalo Calf Road Woman rode out onto the battlefield at full speed and grabbed up her brother, carrying him to safety.Page 290, Dee Brown, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, Henry Holt (1991), Trade paperback, 488 pages, Her courageous rescue caused the Cheyenne to rally, and they defeated General George Crook and his forces. In honor of Buffalo Calf Road Woman, the Cheyenne called the Battle of Rosebud \\"The Fight Where the Girl Saved Her Brother\\". Buffalo Calf Road Woman is documented as also having fought at the Battle of Little Bighorn. There she fought alongside her husband Black Coyote. In June 2005, the Northern Cheyenne broke their more than 100 years of silence about the battle. In a public recounting of Cheyenne oral history of the battle, tribal storytellers spoke of how it was Buffalo Calf Road Woman who had struck the blow knocked Custer off his horse before he died in the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Moreover, in a June 2017 article for mentalfloss.com, Wallace Bearchum, Director of Tribal Services for the Northern Cheyenne, mentions how Buffalo Calf Road Woman was an \\"excellent markswoman\\", but it was a club-like object she used and not a gun to knock General Custer off his horse. After surrendering to the U.S., Buffalo Calf Road Woman, her husband Black Coyote, and their two children were relocated with most of the Northern Cheyennes to the Southern Cheyenne Reservation in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). In September, 1878 she and her family were part of the Northern Cheyenne Exodus, a breakout from the Oklahoma reservation to their home in Montana. Along the way, her husband shot and killed a Cheyenne chief named Black Crane, and their family totaling 8 people was banished from Little Wolf's band of Cheyennes. After this, Black Coyote and two other Cheyenne men attacked two U.S. soldiers along Mizpah Creek in Montana, killing one. Soldiers came from Fort Keogh and hunted the family down, capturing them 5 days later on April 10, 1879. This event became known as the Mizpah Creek incidents. The small group was taken to Miles City, Montana, where the three men including Black Coyote were tried for murder and scheduled to be executed on June 8, 1879. While her husband was in prison, Buffalo Calf Road Woman died of diphtheria or malaria in May, 1879 at Miles City, Montana. When Black Coyote learned of this, he hanged himself in prison. She was also known as Buffalo Calf Trail Woman.

An electron capture detector (ECD) is a device for detecting atoms and molecules in a gas through the attachment of electrons via electron capture ionization. The device was invented in 1957 by James Lovelock and is used in gas chromatography to detect trace amounts of chemical compounds in a sample. Gas chromatograph detector Electron capture detector developed by James Lovelock in the Science Museum, London Electron capture detector, Science History Institute The electron capture detector is used for detecting electron-absorbing components (high electronegativity) such as halogenated compounds in the output stream of a gas chromatograph. The ECD uses a radioactive beta particle (electron) emitter in conjunction with a so-called makeup gas flowing through the detector chamber. The electron emitter typically consists of a metal foil holding 10 millicuries (370 MBq) of the radionuclide . Usually, nitrogen is used as makeup gas, because it exhibits a low excitation energy, so it is easy to remove an electron from a nitrogen molecule. The electrons emitted from the electron emitter collide with the molecules of the makeup gas, resulting in many more free electrons. The electrons are accelerated towards a positively charged anode, generating a current. There is therefore always a background signal present in the chromatogram. As the sample is carried into the detector by the carrier gas, electron-absorbing analyte molecules capture electrons and thereby reduce the current between the collector anode and a cathode. Over a wide range of concentrations the rate of electron capture is proportional to the analyte concentration. ECD detectors are particularly sensitive to halogens, organometallic compounds, nitriles, or nitro compounds.  Response mechanism  It is not immediately obvious why the capture of electrons by electronegative analytes reduces the current that flows between the anode and cathode: the molecular negative ions of the analyte carry the same charge as the electrons that were captured. The key to understanding why the current decreases is to ask where charged entities can go besides being collected at the anode and cathode. The answer is recombination of negative ions or electrons with the positive ions of the makeup gas before these charged entities can be collected at anode and cathode respectively. Negative and positive ions recombine much more rapidly than electrons and positive ions; it is this more rapid neutralization that is the origin of the observed decrease in current. Examination of the rate balance equation with all charge production and loss mechanisms considered reveals that the current collected when the electron capture detector is saturated with analyte is not zero: it is half the current collected when no analyte is present. To laboratory chromatographers this theoretical result is a well known experimental observationSiegel, M.W., and McKeown, M.C., Ions and electrons in the electron capture detector: Quantitative detection by atmospheric pressure mass spectrometry. J. Chromatogr. 122 397 (1976).. Sensitivity Depending on the analyte, an ECD can be 10-1000 times more sensitive than a flame ionization detector (FID), and one million times more sensitive than a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). An ECD has a limited dynamic range and finds its greatest application in analysis of halogenated compounds. The detection limit for electron capture detectors is 5 femtograms per second (fg/s), and the detector commonly exhibits a 10,000-fold linear range. This made it possible to detect halogenated compounds such as pesticides and CFCs, even at levels of only one part per trillion (ppt), thus revolutionizing our understanding of the atmosphere and pollutants.

Later, the area covered by the present municipality was crossed by Roman roads, traces of which are still visible, near Rakitna for example. The Ljubljanica River was navigated by boatmen. The Romans redirected it towards Podpeƒç, a village known for its good quality stone. The nearby forests and the settlements proximity to Ljubljana, have positively influenced the development of agriculture, trade, and enterprise in the area. Many old crafts, such as lime, stone, and wood processing, and wickerwork have survived to the present day.

He was also a painter and theatre set designer. Biography W≈Çadys≈Çaw Hasior was born in Nowy SƒÖcz on May 14, 1928. From 1947-1952, he studied under Professor Antoni Kenar at the State Secondary School of Visual Art Techniques in Zakopane. In 1952 he started his studies in sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. He graduated from the Academy in 1958. From 1959-60, he stayed in Paris as a holder of a scholarship of the French Ministry Culture and studied under Ossip Zadkine. His first individual exhibition was in 1961 at the Jewish Theater in Warsaw. Since then his works have been displayed at over seventy individual exhibitions in Poland and Europe. In 1968 Hasior had returned to his first school and became a teacher there until 1968. Hasior‚Äôs art meant to provoke and shock the beholder. He continuously experimented with forms, techniques and materials by creating spatial compositions, assemblages and collages. He also authored many unconventional monuments and plein air sculptures, both in Poland and abroad. Since 1984 artist focused on the continuous arrangement of the authors Gallery.

The beginning of the modern age of open water swimming is sometimes taken to be May 3, 1810, when Lord Byron swam several miles to cross the Hellespont (now known as the Dardanelles) from Europe to Asia. In the first edition of the modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, the swimming competition was held in open water. In 2000, the Olympic Games first included a triathlon with a 1500 m swim leg, and in 2008, a 10 km open water swim. The FINA World Aquatics Championships has featured open water swimming events since 1992. The FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships was held from 2000 to 2010. Since 2007, the FINA 10 km Marathon Swimming World Cup is held in several events around the world. The activity has grown in popularity in recent years with the publication of bestselling books on \\"wild swimming\\" by authors such as Kate Rew and Daniel Start, and Waterlog by Roger Deakin. Popular media coverage of \\"The Great British Swim,\\" Ross Edgley's swim around mainland Great Britain, brought renewed attention to the activity. Events such as the Midmar Mile in South Africa (attributed to Wayne Ridden), Great Swim in the UK (attributed to Great Swim with idea by Colin Hill), have helped create and grow interest in participation of the sport.  Racing techniques  Acclimatisation to the 14.5C water at Salford Quays in September 2010 Followed by warm-up exercises And walk into the water:the start of the one mile course. = Stroke = Though most open water races do not require a specific stroke, most competitors employ the front crawl also known as freestyle. The efficiency of this stroke was demonstrated by Gertrude Ederle, who, as the first woman to swim the English Channel, employed it to beat the existing world record by more than 2 hours. = Sighting = When covering large distances, swimmers may head off course due to current, waves, wind, and poor visibility. Typically, buoys are stationed periodically across a large expanse to provide guidance. However, buoys are often invisible due to interference from choppy water and reduced visibility through goggles. Swimmers are encouraged to 'triangulate' by looking for two aligned, easily visible objects on land that are directly behind the destination (such as the end of a pier as it lines up with a hilltop), and to make sure they continue to appear aligned during the race. = Drafting = Drafting, which is prohibited by some race regulations, is the technique of following another swimmer so closely that water resistance is reduced. When swimming closely alongside or behind a swimmer in the lead swimmer's wake, resistance is reduced and the amount of effort to swim at the same speed is correspondingly reduced. In calmer conditions, or when facing surface chop, swimmers can also significantly benefit from swimming immediately behind or closely alongside a swimmer of comparable or faster speed. Not all race organizers permit drafting, and swimmers can run the risk of disqualification if they are caught. = Beach starting/exiting = When entering the water, swimmers can use techniques to take advantage of the shallow water. One such technique is walking along the bottom. Another technique is \\"dolphining\\", which involves diving down to the bottom and launching oneself upwards and forwards. This technique can also help to avoid incoming waves. When exiting the water, swimmers can body surf to take advantage of waves.  Equipment used in competitions  Start at Vansbro In some competitions, a floating bag is used for extra visibility The equipment allowed in a race depends on the sanctioning body and/or the race organizers. For example, races may have divisions for wetsuits and/or relays; may require escort boats / kayakers / paddleboards; and may require specifically colored swim caps. Some swimmers tend to keep it simple, using a basic swimsuit, goggles, and swim cap. Many records are based on that attire, which is known as 'channel attire' because it is stipulated in the rules for English Channel crossings and the rules for other long swims. = Wetsuit usage = For triathlons, competitive rule 4.4 of USA Triathlon, states that \\"each age group participant shall be permitted to wear a wetsuit without penalty in any event sanctioned by USA Triathlon up to and including a water temperature of .\\" The ITU rule is that wetsuits are allowed for elite triathlons at below if or more, and below if shorter. Wetsuits are mandatory in triathlons below if or more. Various types of wetsuits of varying thicknesses are used in open water swimming. Some employ high-tech materials and workmanship, others are of basic materials found in surfing and diving wetsuits. Some designs cover the torso, arms and legs, while other designs leave the arms and shoulders exposed. When a person floats motionless in the water, their legs tend to sink. When a person swims freestyle, the legs rise toward surface because water passing underneath the body pushes the legs up, similar to how the wind can lift a kite into the air. In addition, a proper kicking technique will bring the legs all the way to the surface, creating a more streamlined profile for the arms to pull through the water. Both of these mechanisms of becoming horizontal require a small amount of energy from the swimmer. When a person wearing a thick wetsuit floats motionless in the water, their legs tend to float on the surface. Theoretically, this obviates the small energy expenditure mentioned above, although an additional small amount of energy is required to continually flex the wetsuit during swimming motions. High-end triathlon wetsuits have extra flexibility that provides easier range of motion than a surfing or diving wetsuit. Some triathlon wetsuits have varied thickness by way of panels that provide custom flotation that aids the wearer in keeping an efficient position in the water.

M. Perperna was praetor in 135 BC, in which year he had the conduct of the war against the slaves in Sicily, and in consequence of the advantages which he obtained over them received the honour of an ovation on his return to Rome. He was consul in 130 BC with Lucius Cornelius Lentulus (and consul suffectus Appius Claudius Pulcher), and was sent into Anatolia against Aristonicus, who had defeated one of the consuls of the previous year, Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus. Perperna, however, soon brought the war to a close. He defeated Aristonicus in the first engagement, and followed up his victory by laying siege to Stratonikeia, whither Aristonicus had fled. The town was compelled by famine to surrender, and the king accordingly fell into the consul's hands. Perperna did not, however, live to enjoy the triumph, which he would undoubtedly have obtained, but died in the neighbourhood of Pergamum on his return to Rome in 129 BC. It was the above-mentioned Perperna who granted the right of asylum to the temple of Diana in the town of Hierocaesareia in Lydia.

Wheaton and William H. Tucker of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club in 1845. They have previously been considered to be the basis for the rules of the modern game, although this is disputed. The rules are informally known as the \\"New York style\\" of baseball, as opposed to other variants such as the \\"Massachusetts Game\\" and \\"Philadelphia town ball\\". Dispute Modern scholarship has cast doubt on the originality of these rules, as information has come to light about the New York clubs that predated the Knickerbockers, in particular the rules devised by William R. Wheaton for the Gotham Club in 1837. Baseball historian Jeffrey Kittel has concluded that none of the Knickerbocker Rules of 1845 was original, with the possible exception of three-out innings. Nonetheless, the Knickerbocker Rules are enormously significant for baseball historians because they are the earliest extant rules from which the evolution of modern baseball can be lineally traced, and whether or not they can claim to be \\"first,\\" certainly describe the kind of game played by the New York-area amateur clubs from which the modern game developed. The rules Several of the rules are still around in some form today, while others are in direct contrast to current rules. A few of the more interesting examples are shown below. The list as presented, except for the commentary, is taken directly from the \\"Rules\\" as published in the 1860 Beadle's Dime Base Ball Player, edited by Henry Chadwick (website below): 4th. The bases shall be from \\"home\\" to second base, forty-two paces; from first to third base, forty-two paces, equidistant. *If a pace is taken to be 3 feet, that works out to diagonally across the square that makes up the infield, or 89.1 feet between consecutive bases (the corners of the square). The rules currently specify the same method for marking off the bases, only at 127 feet 3-3/8 inches, which works out to between bases. On the other hand, all contemporary sources, such as Noah Webster's dictionary, define a \\"pace\\" as 2-1/2 feet, which would make the bases approximately 75 feet apart. The first rule which definitively established the basepaths at 30 yards (90 feet) was enacted by the Convention of 1857. 8th. The game to consist of twenty-one counts, or aces; but at the conclusion an equal number of hands must be played. *These original terms are recognizably card-playing jargon. The winner was the first team to score 21 \\"aces\\" (now called \\"runs,\\" a cricket term), after an equal number of turns at bat or \\"hands\\". This rule, in combination with Rule 15, determined the length of the game in general. The game is now defined to be a certain number of \\"innings,\\" another cricket term. In theory, a baseball game could be completed after just one inning, as long as one team scored the requisite 21 runs. *The standard game length of nine innings was introduced in 1857. However, there are many circumstances in which baseball games, and variants such as softball, are shorter (or longer) than nine. 9th. The ball must be pitched, not thrown, for the bat. *The ball had to be literally \\"pitched,\\" like a horseshoe. Overhand pitching in baseball was not allowed until 1884, although the progression from underhand to overhand was gradual, and pitchers stretched the limits of the rule by increasing speed and developing movement from the underhand position.Morris, Peter (2009) Catcher How the Man Behind the Plate Became an American Hero, Ivan R.

A ball knocked out of the field, or outside the range of the first and third base, is foul. *In most (but not all) versions of early baseball or town-ball, as in rounders and cricket, there was no foul territory and every batted ball was \\"fair\\" no matter its direction. *A ball knocked between the baselines and beyond the field was not initially a home run but a foul, to be ignored (after finding the ball). This was largely a moot issue, as the early ball fields had very deep fences (if any) and an over-the-fence knock was an unlikely event. *Foul balls were not initially \\"strikes.\\" Many years later, when it became clear that a batter might hit foul balls endlessly in an effort to get a good pitch to hit, the pitcher was given a break by a rule (NL 1901, AL 1903) that declared any foul ball to be a strike unless there were already two strikes on the batter. After the bunt came into existence as a strategy, it became clear that a batter could literally bunt all day to try to get his pitch. To retain some balance, the rule was amended, in 1894, to declare any foul bunt a strike. *Note the colloquial term \\"knock\\", suggestive of the sound made when bat meets ball, and which is still used as a synonym; for example, a \\"base hit\\" is sometimes called a \\"base knock.\\" 11th. Three balls being struck at and missed and the last one caught, is a hand-out; if not caught it is considered fair, and the striker bound to run. *\\"For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out!\\" is an ancient rule. The added detail, that a batter (\\"striker\\") can try to run to first on a missed third strike, also exists today, except that if there are fewer than two outs and first base is occupied, the batter is automatically out. This is to supersede the catcher dropping the ball on purpose to set up force plays ‚Äî the same idea behind the infield fly rule. *Note the lack of reference to the strike zone, called strikes, or the concept of a \\"ball\\" or a \\"base on balls.\\" Those adjustments developed over time to counter \\"ungentlemanly\\" strategies, and hurry the game up: Patient batters would refuse to swing at any pitch they did not like, and delay the game. The concept of the \\"called\\" strike - originally an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for persistent refusal to swing, after being duly warned - was introduced in 1858. Over-cautious pitchers would throw the ball wide, and delay the game, or alternatively throw at the batter in an effort to intimidate. The called \\"ball\\" was introduced in 1863, as a parallel to the called-strike rule: a penalty the umpire could impose, after a warning and multiple offenses, for a persistent failure to deliver \\"good balls,\\" along with a limit on how many the pitcher could deliver before the batter was automatically awarded first base. The number of balls constituting a \\"base on balls\\" was initially three. It was tinkered with through the years (to as high as 9) until the count of four was settled upon in 1889. Note that this meant that many pitches had no effect at all; it would be years before the modern view took hold in which every pitch results in either a swing, a called strike or a ball. Through the 1860s and into the '70s many umpires were reluctant to impose the penalty calls, with their implication of unsportsmanlike conduct, and some were criticized for being overzealous with them. The strike zone did not come into being until 1887; before that season, it was left to the umpire's judgement whether a pitch was \\"good\\" or \\"unfair.\\" *Foul balls were also not considered strikes initially, as discussed under rule 10. 12th. If a ball be struck, or tipped, and caught, either flying or on the first bound, it is a hand out. *Catching a fair ball on the first bounce counted as an out until the 1865 season. Catching a foul bound for an out persisted until 1883. This was before gloves were used (or allowed), and obviously it was easier to catch that hard ball on the first bounce. This also provided the game with some balance, as the underlying assumption in Rule 8 is that many runs were likely to be scored. Also, the catcher played well back of the plate, for safety reasons, the various protective gear not having been developed yet. 13th. A player running the bases shall be out, if the ball is in the hands of an adversary on the base, or the runner is touched with it before he makes his base; it being understood, however, that in no instance is a ball to be thrown at him. *The important part of the rule is not allowing a player to be put out by hitting him with the ball. This was sometimes called \\"soaking\\" or \\"plugging\\" the runner. One schoolyard version of the game, kickball, using a large inflated ball, still allows players to be put out by hitting them (below the head area) with this much-softer ball. *Note that under this rule a runner could be put out by tagging the base he was attempting to reach whether he was \\"forced\\" or not; an 1848 amendment limited this practice to first base only. The modern force-out at the other bases appeared in 1854. 15th. Three hands out, all out. *Three outs per half-inning, a novel rule. Earlier forms of townball and related games were either \\"all out, all out\\" as in cricket, or \\"one-out, all out\\" (any putout ends the team's at-bat). Referring again to card-playing terminology, a \\"hand\\" is now called an \\"at-bat\\", or more generally, the progression of a specific batter and/or runner, at bat and/or around the bases. *This is a fundamental difference from baseball's cousin, cricket, in which all of the batsmen take their respective turns at bat in a single inning. 16th. Players must take their strike in regular turn. *Specifies that the batting order is fixed. Another ancient rule that still applies to the modern game. 18th. No ace or base can be made on a foul strike. *States that the batter and baserunners do not advance on a foul ball (a foul having been defined in Rule 10). Another rule that still applies to the modern game. 20th. But one base allowed when a ball bounds out of the field when struck. *Outfields in the early days were assumed to be boundless, in general. The only \\"home run\\" was a literal dash around the bases, on a ball hit between outfielders. However, since there was often only minimal foul territory, with spectators practically standing on the foul lines, it was not uncommon for fair balls to bounce into the crowd; and in such cases the rule is still in effect, although invoked very rarely given modern seating arrangements. *This rule was superseded, with respect to the far playing boundary, not later than 1876: a ball which cleared the outfield fence in fair ground, whether on the fly or on the bounce, was now a home run. The so-called \\"ground rule double\\" (it is not, properly, a ground rule), awarding two bases when the ball bounces over the outfield fence, was introduced in 1929 (AL) and 1931 (NL). *However, to this day one base is awarded if a defensive error sends the ball out of play.

In 1881, Stark married Miriam Melissa Lutcher (1859‚Äì1936), the daughter of Henry J. Lutcher, a partner in the Lutcher and Moore Lumber Company. In the early 1880s, Stark's expertise in the lumber business would soon land him the position of managing two mills belonging to his father-in-law's firm in Louisiana. Stark's success in the lumber industry led him to invest in other businesses such as iron and coal production, real estate, and ranching. His innovative ideas, including development of the deep water ports on the Sabine River and an irrigation system that provided needed resources for the region's rice industry, led to increased population growth for the city of Orange. Stark also served as a regent for the University of Texas System, 1911‚Äì15, an office later held by his son H.J.Lutcher Stark, who became chairman of the University Board. Stark died on October 8, 1936, and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Orange, Texas. The Texas Historical Commission has constructed a marker to commemorate his contributions to the city.

The land was acquired in 1854 by Wilmer McLean who owned it until 1867. Background Blackburn's Ford, 1862 On July 18, 1861, it was the site of the Battle of Blackburn's Ford, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell's initial probe of Confederate defenses in what would become the first major land battle of the Civil War, First Manassas. Due to heavy resistance from the fortified Confederate position that he encountered here, McDowell decided against a direct attack on the Manassas railroad junction and chose instead a flanking maneuver. During the actual battle on July 21, the ford was again the site of action as Brig. Gen. James Longstreet first crossed the Bull Run but found his position exposed to Union artillery. Later he sent reconnaissance missions that discovered McDowell had sent his forces to cross Sudley Ford on the Confederate left. In the final stages of the battle Longstreet again sent forces across the ford in an attempt to rout the retreating Union Army but rear guard action halted his advance.

The original release was limited in number and soon went out of print, however it was re- released in CD format in 2002 by singer/guitarist John Reis on his Swami Records label as part of the compilation album Hot Charity/Cut Carefully and Play Loud. The LP was supported by a 6-week \\"free tour\\" using money from the band's Interscope Records contract to cover the costs, so that fans would not have to pay admission to any of the band's shows for the duration of the tour. This was an unusual move and demonstrated particular faith in the band on the part of the label, especially considering that Rocket had not yet recorded anything for Interscope (the band had negotiated an unusual clause in their contract which allowed them to record vinyl releases for other labels). Hot Charity was the second of three releases by Rocket from the Crypt in 1995. The EP The State of Art is on Fire and album Scream, Dracula, Scream! were both also recorded and released that year, and singer/guitarist John Reis would later refer to these three records as a \\"trilogy\\". Recording the LP According to Reis' liner notes included in the CD re-release, Hot Charity was intended to be an experiment of sorts, using funds from the band's recently signed contract with major label Interscope to record in a large professional studio. The first attempt at recording the LP occurred over a five-week period in Hollywood with a label-suggested producer. The band was unsatisfied with the final tone and mixes of the tracks and attempted to salvage the recordings by sending them to a mixing engineer in New York for remixing. They still found the results unsatisfactory, however, and returned to Hollywood a month after the original sessions to completely re-record the tracks with producer Sally Browder. They found these recordings much more satisfactory and recorded a new song, \\"My Arrow's Aim.\\" In an attempt to save money the band mixed the tracks at a cheap, poorly maintained studio which went bankrupt days after their session ended. The master tapes were seized by the bank, making it nearly impossible for the band to have access to them. Though they were still not completely satisfied with the final mixes, the LP was released and the band was relieved to have finished the project.

Great performances for Bielefeld in the 2004‚Äì05 season earned Owomoyela interest from German top clubs, and in 2005, he joined SV Werder Bremen. In his first season, Owomoyela was the undisputed starter at right back and helped Bremen reach second in the league. With the arrival of Clemens Fritz the following season, however, he lost his starting position due to injuries and bad displays.

Rebecca's joy for life inspires her aunts, but she faces many trials in her young life, gaining wisdom and understanding. Wiggin wrote a sequel, New Chronicles of Rebecca. New Chronicles of Rebecca, Kate Douglas Wiggin, Houghton, Mifflin and Company, The Riverside Press, Cambridge, April 1907, copyright 1906 and 1907 by Charles Scribner's Books, copyright 1907 Kate Douglas Wiggin, reprinted in June 1986 by Buccaneer Books, . Eric Wiggin, a great-nephew of the author, wrote updated versions of several Rebecca books, including a concluding story. The story was adapted for the theatrical stage and filmed three times, once with Shirley Temple in the title role, as well as a Japanese animated short as part of the Anime Tamago project. Synopsis The novel opens with Rebecca's journey from her family's farm to live with her two aunts, her mother's older sisters Miranda and Jane Sawyer, in their brick house in Riverboro. Rebecca is the second-oldest of seven children. Most of the children have fanciful names, such as Marquis and Jenny Lind, influenced by their father's artistic background; Rebecca is named after both the heroines in Ivanhoe. The family is quite poor, due to the number of children, Mr. Lorenzo DeMedici Randall's inability to stick to a job, and the farm being mortgaged. As the novel begins, the family is barely scraping by three years after the father's death. Rebecca's stay with her aunts is a chance to improve her opportunities in life and to ease the strain on her family's budget. Despite her impoverished background, Rebecca is imaginative and charming. She often composes little poems and songs to express her feelings or to amuse her siblings. It is she who named their farm \\"Sunnybrook\\". Miranda and Jane had wanted Hannah, the eldest sister, because of her household skills and pragmatic nature, but her mother needs her at home for the same reasons and sends Rebecca instead. Miranda is unimpressed by Rebecca's imagination, chatter, and dark complexion, calls her the image of her shiftless father, and determines to train Rebecca to be a proper young lady who won't shame the Sawyer name. Jane becomes Rebecca's protector and acts as a buffer between her and Miranda. Jane teaches Rebecca to sew, cook, and manage a household. Rebecca's liveliness and curiosity brighten Jane's life and refresh her spirit. Although Rebecca strives to win Miranda's approval, she struggles to live up to Miranda's rigid standards, as Miranda views her as \\"all Randall and no Sawyer.\\" The middle of the novel is mainly a description of life at Riverboro and its inhabitants. Important characters are Jeremiah and Sarah Cobb, who first encounter Rebecca's charm; Rebecca's schoolmate and best friend, Emma Jane Perkins; and young businessman Adam Ladd, who takes an interest in Rebecca's education. Adam meets Rebecca when she and Emma Jane are selling soap to help a poor family receive a lamp as a premium; Rebecca nicknames him \\"Mr. Aladdin.\\" Poster for the stage adaptation of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm starring 201px Rebecca proves to be a good student, especially in English, and goes on to attend high school in Wareham. In the book's last section she has become a young lady with the same high spirit and a talent for writing. She applies for a teaching job in Augusta, but her mother has an accident and Rebecca must go home to look after her and the farm. While she's away, Miranda dies and leaves the Sawyer house and land to Rebecca. A railway company will buy Sunnybrook Farm for construction purposes, which will give the Randall family a sufficient living, and Miranda's will provides Rebecca enough money to become an independent woman who can help her siblings. The novel ends with her exclaiming, \\"God bless Aunt Miranda! God bless the brick house that was!

The main part of the works, the North Road Shops was located on the northeast side of the Stockton and Darlington Railway (now part of the Tees Valley Line) History =NER period= The first new locomotive was built at the works in 1864. Though the railway had amalgamated with the North Eastern Railway (NER) in 1863, it continued to build its own designs for a number of years. In 1877 the first North Eastern designs appeared. Additionally works (paint and boilershop) were constructed west of the S&DR; railway in the Stooperdale area of Darlington.Ordnance survey, 1:2500, 1915 Grandiose offices for the NER were also constructed in the Stooperdale area in 1911, to the design of William Bell. The offices were used by NER chief mechanical engineer Vincent Raven until 1917. In 1914 a class of NER Bo-Bo electric locomotives was built at the works to run between Shildon and Newport. Ten of these 1500 volt direct current locomotives were completed. Sir Vincent Raven designed the NER Class T2 0-8-0 freight locomotive in 1913, and by 1921 the works had built 120 of the engines, which were later designated Q6 by the LNER. The heavier and more powerful Raven NER Class T3 0-8-0 (LNER Q7) followed in 1919, 15 engines being completed by 1924. =LNER period= Under the LNER it continued to play a major role, producing a new engine each week, with Gresley's K3 class 2-6-0 appearing in 1924. Both the class V2 and A1 express locomotives were also built. By 1927 the works was the town's largest employer. Darlington works built six LNER Class K4 2-6-0 locomotives in 1937/38 for operation on the West Highland Line. No. 3442 (later 61994) The Great Marquess has been preserved in full working order and in 2009 was still hauling special steam trains on the UK main line network. =British Railways period= After nationalisation, Darlington built both steam and diesel locomotives, including BR standard class 2. The equivalent of the NER Class E1 (LNER J72) 0-6-0 tank locomotive had been built, virtually unchanged since 1898. In 1954 during the modernisation of British Railways the works was enlarged and had grown to cover over , but in 1962 the BR Workshops Division was formed and, with rationalisation, the works was run down and closed in 1966. The land of the Stooperdale part of the works was sold to Whessoe in 1962. Current use of the site The site since about 1979/80, is occupied by the Morrisons supermarket, and the adjacent Bowls Hall, with the original clock which was restored, was re-erected by contractors Fairclough Building Ltd onto the east wall of the supermarket overhanging North Road. The Stooperdale offices were grade II listed in 2001.

It was introduced along with the pin index safety system during the 1950s. Attachment and detachment of a gas cylinder leads to constant wear and tear, due in part to mechanical distress and to gaseous compression and expansion. Adiabatic effects in rapidly expanding compressed gases can generate very low temperatures, necessitating a sufficiently durable and cold-resistant material such as neoprene. Prior to the introduction of the Bodok seal, the traditional fibre washer would frequently splay and cause leakage or adhere to the regulator, thus requiring the use of pliers and considerable force to remove it. The Bodok seal consists of a neoprene washer with a peripheral metal reinforcing ring to prevent splaying. The seal is incombustible and resistant to the high pressures imposed upon it by cylinder gases, approximately in a full cylinder. Care must be taken when replacing gas cylinders that the Bodok seal does not stick to the cylinder valve face, and is thus 'lost' when the new cylinder is fitted, preventing a gas tight seal. Bodok seals are also used in emergency oxygen kits used in first aid for underwater diving, but diving regulators used for scuba cylinders generally use a conventional o-ring seal with either a DIN 477 or CGA 850 yoke connector.

Under the stage name Andre Candre, Inoue debuted in 1969 and released a single \\"Candre Mandre\\" by CBS Sony Records. After he changed his stage name and signed onto Polydor, he recorded the first studio album Danzetsu in 1971. Inoue gained recognition as a folk-rock singer-songwriter through his 1973 K≈çri no Sekai album, which became the first long-playing record that sold more than a million copies in Japan alone. Inoue has released 22 solo studio albums, and also produced 2 albums with Tamio Okuda. He has been one of the most commercially successful Japanese male solo recording artists of the last 40 years, selling in excess of 10.9 million copies on the country's Oricon albums chart up to May 2009 and has had seven number-one albums; Kori no Sekai, Nishoku no Koma, Good Pages, Shoutaijou no Nai Show, 9.5 Carats, Under the Sun, and the compilation Golden Best which was released in 1999 and has shipped over 2 million units. Biography = Early life = On August 30, 1948, Akimi Inoue was born in Koubukuro, Kaho, Fukuoka, Japan. His father, Wakami Inoue, was a dentist who had formerly worked as a surgeon for the Japanese army during World War II, and wanted his sole son to take over the business of his clinic. When Akimi was six years old, he moved to Itoda, Tagawa with his family, and spent his childhood there until he decided to become a musician. The existence of The Beatles inflated Inoue's interest in music at a young age. Around 1966, Inoue is said to have written his first song. This song has never been recorded, but Inoue has performed the song occasionally during his concerts. = Early career; \\"Andre Candre\\" = In 1969, he recorded the song \\"Candre Mandre\\" at his house, in order to be played on the radio program Smash!! 11 which was aired on RKB Mainichi Broadcasting. It received a lot of requests from listeners of the program but, in fact, most of them were from Inoue's friends. However, pretense favorable reaction gave him an opportunity to make a debut. He moved to Tokyo and recorded \\"Candre Mandre\\" at the studio, with the arranger Hitoshi Komuro and his band, Rokumonsen. A newly recorded version of the song was released as a single by the CBS Sony label in September 1969, under the distinctive stage name \\"Andre Candre\\". Reportedly, the artist name was initially credited to \\"Mandre\\", but altered after it was refused by a director of Smash!! 11. He anticipated that \\"Candre Mandre\\" would gain success, but it couldn't receive any reactions. Andore Kandore released three singles but, follow-ups \\"Beautiful Wonderful Birds\\" and \\"Hana ni sae, Tori ni sae (Let Our Hearts Be)\\" (composed by Takeshi Matsuyama and Kazuhiko Kato) also failed commercially. Though results of his earliest projects were not outstanding, close relationships with some musicians who worked with him at that time continued for years. Particularly, Hitoshi Komuro supported Inoue till he became a star. Then-unknown Kiyoshiro Imawano, a frontman of RC Succession, wrote several songs including \\"Kaerenai Futari\\" and \\"Machibouke\\" with Inoue. = 1971‚Äì1975; Polydor years = In 1971, Inoue contracted with the Polydor Records with the support of the company's director Hidenori Taga, and launched the recording of his first studio album entitled Danzetsu. The album features Takao Kisugi (who were still not debuted as a singer-songwriter) on guitar. He changed stage name to \\"Yosui Inoue\\", and debuted again under the Polydor in the following year. His first single was \\"Jinsei ga Nido Areba\\", a song later included on the Danzetsu album. It features his emotional vocals, like sobbing. Later materials also feature similar extremely melancholic renditions. \\"Yume no Naka e\\", a song somewhat more accessible than his previous effort, was released as a single in March 1973 and became the first hit for Inoue, entering the top-20 on the Japanese Oricon charts. To promote Inoue's popularity, Polydor asked him to record a new album as soon as possible. Thereupon he recorded concerts held at Shinjuku Kosei Nenkin Kaikan on April 14, 1973. It was issued as the live album Modorimichi in that year's July. During the mid-1970s, the album was successful, owing to the hits of its follow-ups. It is still one of the best- selling live recording albums on the Japanese albums charts, selling over 800,000 copies. K≈çri no Sekai, the third studio album recorded by Inoue and released in December 1973 led him to the stardom. It received unprecedented commercial success in the history of Japanese music industry at the time. K≈çri no Sekai topped Oricon album chart for 35 weeks (longest ever), and remained the Top 10 for 113 weeks. The album retailed in excess of a million copies in 1975, becoming the first million-selling album of Japan. Nishoku no Koma, a follow-up to K≈çri no Sekai released in 1974, also topped the chart, and retained its position for ten consecutive weeks. The album features harder arrangements than his early folk-oriented albums, enlisting the studio musicians including David T. Walker, Jesse Ed Davis, Ray Parker Jr., Harvey Mason, and Jack Nitzsche. Inoue reached the pinnacle of his popularity as a musician in the mid-1970s. The breakthrough providing him with the nickname \\"Emperor of Japanese Folk-rock\\", and introduced his more early efforts to listeners (the songs including \\"Jinsei ga Nido Areba\\", \\"Ai wa Kimi\\", \\"Kasa ga Nai\\", \\"Tsumetai Heya no Sekai Chizu\\", \\"Yoru no Bus\\", \\"Natsu Matsuri\\", \\"Kannazuki ni Kakomarete\\", \\"Kami Hikouki\\", \\"Nokonoshima no Kataomoi\\" became popular particularly). = 1975‚Äì1990 = His fifth studio album Shoutaijou no Nai Show was released in 1976, under the newly founded label For Life which was distributed by Canyon Records. Project of forming a record label was initiated by Hitoshi Komuro and Takuro Yoshida, and Inoue and Shigeru Izumiya joined as the co-founders. It was the first example that Japanese musicians came to control a record label. Inoue has released all their albums and singles through For Life for over 30 years, although the label has changed its distributing companies several times. Inoue contributed three songs for Seri Ishikawa (a singer married to him in 1978) on her 1977 Kimagure album. One of them, \\"Dance wa Umaku Odorenai\\" was later covered by an actress Mio Takaki and became a hit. The U.S. studio musicians who took part in the recording of Inoue's albums tempted him to take the drugs which were rigidly prohibited in his home country. In late July 1977, he purchased marijuana tobacco called Buddha Sticks. And he was arrested in September for possession of them, followed by other sixty Japanese celebrities because of similar suspicions. Inoue made his comeback as a musician laterin the same year and released an album called White in 1978, but his popularity was lost hugely owing to his law breaking. His 1980 album entitled Every Night is the effort that Katz Hoshi (an arranger who had worked on Inoue's works since Danzetsu album) did not participate in the recording for the first time. Production of his recording was radically changing at that time, featuring alternative arrangers including Masayoshi Takanaka (who participated in Inoue's 1979 Sneaker Dancer album) and Yuji Kawashima (also known by pseudonym \\"Banana\\", who has worked with Inoue since Ayashii Yoru wo Matte album released in 1981 and been one of the significant collaborators for him). Except for a hit single \\"Jealousy\\", most of Inoue's efforts after his comeback were not as successful as his previous works, but some materials like \\"Nazeka Shanghai\\", \\"Umi e Kinasai\\", \\"Tomadou Perican\\" and \\"Canary\\" are regarded as his notable songs throughout his career. In addition, \\"Riverside Hotel\\" was widely recognized and becoming a hit in later years. In 1982, Hokkaido-based Inoue's then-backing band called Anzen Chitai made debut, and he contributed lyrics for their materials composed by a group's frontman Koji Tamaki. One of them, \\"Wine Red no Kokoro\\" was released as a single in 1983 and led the group to fame. It reached the number-one on the chart in a following year and became a massive hit, selling more than a 600,000 copies. The song won the 26th Japan Record Award for \\"Gold Prize\\", and has been well known as a signature song for the group. Inoue also wrote the lyrics for some of the group's subsequent releases, including a song \\"Koi no Yokan\\" that became the second top-ten hit for the band. Also in 1984, Inoue contributed another number-one hit \\"Kazari ja nai no yo Namida wa\\" for a pop idol Akina Nakamori. In addition, Inoue himself scored the top-ten hit \\"Isso Serenade\\" in a same year, four his compositions dominated the Japanese singles chart at the same week in December 1984. His subsequent studio album called 9.5 Carats is a blockbuster that features \\"Isso Serenade\\" and his own renditions of above mentioned hit singles. The album mainly consists of his compositions (some of them were co-written by other composers or lyricists such as Tamaki, Yumi Matsutoya, and Takashi Matsumoto) that he already contributed for other performers including Kenji Sawada, Yutaka Mizutani and Inoue's spouse Seri Ishikawa. It topped the Oricon chart and became one of the most commercially successful LP in Japan during 1985. He carried out the concert with Anzen Chitai again, and also released a single \\"Natsu no Owari no Harmony\\" (written and sung by Inoue and Tamaki) together. Their concert held at Jingu Stadium was aired on TV, and later its live recordings were released as the album and the video. = 1990s = During the 1990s, Inoue produced two top-3 charting singles on the Japanese chart. \\"Shounen Jidai\\" (Boyhood), a song he wrote with Natsumi Hirai was initially featured on the same-titled film adaptation of a manga Childhood Days (written by Fujiko Fujio (A), based on the novel Nagai Michi by Hyouzou Kashiwabara). It was released as a single in 1990, and also appeared on his Handsome Boy album came out in the same year. Because of television advertising for Sony Handycam which featured the song, \\"Shounen Jidai\\" became well-known and a huge hit around the early 1990s. As a result, it has been one of his most famous songs throughout his longtime career. Another smash hit was \\"Make-up Shadow\\" featured on the television drama Subarashikikana Jinsei. It was peaking at the number-two on the chart, and the song's co-writer/arranger Jun Sato received the honor of winning the 35th Japan Record Awards for \\"Best Arrangements\\" category which were given for the magnificently arranged songs. Under the Sun, his 1993 album which features \\"Make-up Shadow\\", is the last chart-topping non-compilation for Inoue as of 2009. Tamio Okuda, a member of the band Unicorn who suspended the group's work and began his solo career in 1994, became a collaborator for Inoue during the mid-1990s. Reportedly, sending a letter from Inoue (who was impressed by the Unicorn's song \\"Yuki no Furu Machi\\" written by Okuda) to Okuda became a trigger for them to form a songwriting team. At first, they contributed a song \\"Tsuki Hitoshizuku\\" for a pop idol/actress Ky≈çko Koizumi (who also wrote part of the lyrics with them). \\"Asia no Junshin\\", a debut single for Puffy (the duo that Okuda produced), is the most successful song that they wrote together. It was released on CD in March 1996 and sold more than a million copies, peaking at the number-three on the Japanese chart. Along with \\"Nagisa ni Matsuwaru Et Cetera\\", another massive hit they wrote for Puffy in 1997, it has been Inoue's live favorites in recent 10 years. Inoue and Okuda formed the group called \\"InoueYosuiOkudaTamio\\" in 1997. After their duet \\"Arigato\\" became a smash hit, they released an album entitled Shopping. It comprises 12 songs Inoue and Okuda recorded together, including \\"Arigato\\" and their own adaptation of \\"Asia No Junshin\\" and \\"Tsuki Hitoshizuku\\". In 1999, for celebrating the 30th anniversary of Inoue's career as a recording artist, a double compilation album entitled Golden Best was released. It debuted at the number-one on the Oricon and remained the chart for a year, with the sales of over a million copies. After a year from the album's release, a sequel entitled Golden Bad came out. And in 2003, when the album shipped more than 2 million units, an expanded edition called Golden Best Super was released. = 2001‚Äìpresent; United Cover and recent career = He scored two smash hit singles \\"Coffee Rumba\\" and \\"Hana no Kubikazari\\". Both songs were the 1960s kayokyoku (The former was remake of Venezuelan song \\"Moliendo Caf√©\\" originally composed in 1958). Likewise, a follow-up studio album United Cover is mainly composed of cover versions of the songs that were popular in Japan during the postwar Showa period. United Cover debuted at #2 on the Japanese Oricon chart and sold more than 500,000 copies up to 2002, and has been certified triple platinum by RIAJ for shipments of over 800,000 copies to date. It has been one of the most commercially successful cover albums by Japanese artists in the 2000s, along with Fukuyama Engineering by Masaharu Fukuyama and Vocalist series by Hideaki Tokunaga. During the compilation and cover album became a hit, Inoue embarked the concert tour, and live performance was later released on DVD entitled United Tour. He has continued concert touring repeatedly after 2004. His latest album as a solo artist is Love Complex, released in 2006. Also in 2006, he restarted the project with Tamio Okuda.

It also organises the Inter-Provincial Series (which includes the Inter- Provincial Championship, Inter-Provincial Cup and Inter-Provincial Trophy), Super 3s, and three All-Ireland club competitions: Irish Senior Cup, National Cup and the All-Ireland T20 Cup. It achieved Test-status for women in 2000, and then for men in 2017 when it was made a Full Member of the ICC in June 2017. History An early forerunner of the Irish Cricket Union was formed in 1890, though its only function was to select the Irish international team.Gerard Siggins (2005), Green Days:Cricket in Ireland 1792-2005. Nonsuch Publishing Ltd., p.40 The Irish Cricket Union was officially founded in 1923, and is made up of five provincial unions, namely the Leinster Cricket Union, the Munster Cricket Union, the Northern Cricket Union, the Connacht Cricket Union and the North West Cricket Union. Retrieved on 3 November 2008. Its powers initially were strictly limited and it was reconstituted in 1933.Siggins (2005), p.61 Ireland was accepted as an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council on 6 July 1993. In common with a number of other Ireland sporting governing bodies, the Union represents all of the island of Ireland, rather than just the Republic of Ireland. In common with its counterparts for rugby union and field hockey, the organisation, therefore, does not use the Irish tricolour, but instead employs its own flag.Official Cricket Ireland site showing use of flag International Cricket Council official site Ireland was initially of the teams in Division 1 of Associate Members of International Cricket Council who has One Day International and T20 International status. Ireland's greatest cricketing success to date was to reach the Super 8 of the 2007 Cricket World Club following victory over Pakistan and a tied game with Zimbabwe in the groups stages. The most significant, and most publicised, success in a one-off match occurred four years later, with a three-wicket victory over England in 2011 Cricket World Cup in which Kevin O'Brien scored the World Cup's fastest ever century and Ireland set a World Cup record with by \\"chasing\\" 327 runs. During 2007 World Cup Ireland had major success with their victory by three wickets over Pakistan in a 2007 Cricket World Cup group match. The victory over Pakistan in 2007 was overshadowed by the sudden death of the Pakistan Coach Bob Woolmer that night. Ireland also managed to beat the West Indies in their prime in 1968 at Sion Mills, 25 years before Ireland were accepted as an associate by the ICC. The Irish Cricket Union was formally dissolved and then formed afresh as a limited company on 3 February 2008, at its annual general meeting. After the tremendous success at International stage, Cricket Ireland has applied for Full Membership from the International Cricket Council. Ireland have recently won the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier 2008 and 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier and qualified for 2009 World Twenty20 and 2011 Cricket World Cup. Being a full member will allow Ireland to be a permanent One Day International and eventually granting them Test status. In August 2011, Cricket Ireland announced its plans to put in place a first-class structure, which is a major achievement for the nation on their path to gaining Test status.Ireland plan first-class structure ESPN Cricinfo. Retrieved 24 August 2011 In 2012, Cricket Ireland announced that it had found the pathway to Test status for their tremendously successful men's team by 2020. Targets include an increase in the number of people playing the game in Ireland to 50,000, reaching eighth in the world rankings and establishing a domestic first-class structure. A number of commercial deals have been secured, allowing Ireland to unveil their strategic plan to 2015 and target their ultimate ambition of securing Test status. Cricket Ireland has offered a record 23 professional contracts to players, in three categories, for 2012, a development Phil Simmons says is vital for their continued improvement. Simmons, the Ireland coach, has also agreed a two-year extension to his contract which will take him through to at least the end of Ireland's World Cup qualifying campaign late next year. Initiatives to swell participation numbers to 50,000 will include the establishment of regional academies; a Get into Cricket scheme which will seek to attract six to 12-year-olds to take up the game in clubs and schools; a Better Clubs Initiative, which will encourage clubs to improve their facilities; and the Cricket Ireland national awards which will recognise contributions ranging from players to volunteers.

Often called Santry Stadium, it is the centre for athletics events in Dublin city and the home track of Clonliffe Harriers. It has also been the home ground for several Irish association football clubs including Shamrock Rovers and Dublin City. The modern capacity of the ground is 8,800 mortonstadium.ie with a single 800-seat covered stand.  History  =1958-1970= Athletics The stadium was opened in 1958 with a cinder track. An inaugural series of meetings was held, and on 6 August 1958, Australian Herb Elliott shattered the world record for the mile run with a time of 3 minutes 54.5 seconds. This was the first race in which five athletes had run a four-minute mile. Cycling Billy Morton, the businessman and administrator who started the track development for running, decided to arrange a cycling event in 1959, inspired by the progress of Ireland's first continental racing star, and only professional cyclist, Shay Elliott. He persuaded Lord Moyne, then Chairman of Guinness plc to pay for a banked cycle racing track, in tarmac, in celebration of the company's 200th anniversary. He then secured contractors to build it in just six weeks, after Lord Moyne turned the first sod on 1 May. The track was built around the running track, 515 yards long and 25 feet wide. Morton, with help from the CRE, also arranged for a small number of European cycling professionals to come for the headline race, with an \\"undercard\\" of Irish amateur riders. His achievements saw him voted as one of Ireland's \\"ten most popular public figures\\" by readers of the Irish Independent. The professional race featured was headlined by Fausto Coppi, as well as Elliott, Brian Robinson, Andr√© Darrigade, Albert Bouvet and Roger Hassenforder. At 4 a.m. on June 15, the stadium was damaged when a bomb exploded across the road; the Republican movement denied responsibility, stating ‚Äúno member of the movement was involved in this affair‚Äù and some blamed the longstanding feud between the internationally-recognised CRE and another cycling group, the NCA. The stadium was repaired and the race meeting proceeded the same day, with Elliott winning the sprint, Darrigarde the points race, and then Elliott and Coppi facing off for the 4000m individual pursuit, which Elliott won at a time of 5:07. Christy Kimmage won among the amateurs. The cycling track had fallen into disrepair by the late 1960s, and was later removed. =1970-= In 1978 the stadium was resurfaced with a tartan track, making it the second such facility in the Republic of Ireland, after the now-defunct UCD track at Belfield.Kilfeather, S. 1977.

Products handled by such systems typically include: *Oxygen *Medical air *Nitrous oxide *Nitrogen *Carbon dioxide *Medical vacuum *Waste anaesthetic gas disposal (US) or anaesthetic gas scavenging system (ISO) Source equipment systems are generally required to be monitored by alarm systems at the point of supply for abnormal (high or low) gas pressure in areas such as general ward, operating theatres, intensive care units, recovery rooms, or major treatment rooms. Equipment is connected to the medical gas pipeline system via station outlets (US) or terminal units (ISO). Medical gas systems are commonly color coded to identify their contents, but as coding systems and requirements (such as those for bottled gas) vary by jurisdiction, the text or labeling is the most reliable guide to the contents. Emergency shut-off valves, or zone valves, are often installed in order to stop gas flowing to an area in the event of fire or substantial leak, as well as for service. Valves may be positioned at the entrance to departments, with access provided via emergency pull-out windows. Oxygen BeaconMedaes oxygen, vacuum, and medical air medical gas supply outlets on a ceiling at Campbell County Memorial Hospital in Gillette, Wyoming Oxygen may be used for patients requiring supplemental oxygen via mask. Usually accomplished by a large storage system of liquid oxygen at the hospital which is evaporated into a concentrated oxygen supply, pressures are usually around ,NFPA 99: Health Care Facilities Code (2015)CSA Z7396.1-17 - Medical gas pipeline systems - Part 1: Pipelines for medical gases, medical vacuum, medical support gases, and anaesthetic gas scavenging systems or in the UK and Europe, .ISO 7396-1:2016 Medical gas pipeline systems - Part 1: Pipeline systems for compressed medical gases and vacuum This arrangement is described as a vacuum insulated evaporator or bulk tank.http://www.frca.co.uk/article.aspx?articleid=100342 In small medical centers with a low patient capacity, oxygen is usually supplied by a manifold of multiple high-pressure cylinders. In areas where a bulk system or high- pressure cylinder manifold is not suitable, oxygen may be supplied by an oxygen concentrator. However, on site production of oxygen is still a relatively new technology. Medical air Medical air is compressed air supplied by a special air compressor, through a dryer (in order to maintain correct dew point levels), and distributed to patient care areas by half hard BS:EN 13348 copper pipe and also use isolation ball valve for operating the services of compressed air 4 bar. It is also called medical air 4 bar. In smaller facilities, medical air may also be supplied via high-pressure cylinders. Pressures are maintained around . Nitrous oxide Nitrous oxide is supplied to various surgical suites for its anaesthetic functions during preoperative procedures. It is delivered to the hospital in high-pressure cylinders and supplied through the Medical Gas system. Some bulk systems exist, but are no longer installed due to environmental concerns and overall reduced consumption of nitrous oxide. System pressures are around , UK. Nitrogen Nitrogen is typically used to power pneumatic surgical equipment during various procedures, and is supplied by high-pressure cylinders. Pressures range around to various locations. Instrument air/surgical air Like nitrogen, instrument air is used to power surgical equipment. However, it is generated on site by an air compressor (similar to a medical air compressor) rather than high-pressure cylinders. Early air compressors could not offer the purity required to drive surgical equipment. However, this has changed and instrument air is becoming a popular alternative to nitrogen. As with nitrogen, pressures range around . UK systems are supplied at to the local area and regulated down to at point of use.

The series focuses on the life of a teenage half- dragon. The story has been told in a mini-series (2003) and a one-shot (2004). An ongoing series started in May 2008, and a movie based on the series aired on Cartoon Network on November 24, 2010. Publication history The character was originally part of a Young Avengers proposal that Hester put together for Marvel Comics, initially conceived to be the son of Fin Fang Foom.http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/12/01/comic-book-urban- legends-revealed-27/ It was reworked into a miniseries at Image Comics in 2003. A one-shot followup, The Iron Saint was published in 2004. The character returned in an ongoing series in 2008. Plot =Firebreather Volume 1: (Firebreather #1-4)= Duncan begins his first day at yet another new school, trying to fit in despite his unusual physical appearance. However, there are a great many obstacles to this goal, particularly his new principal and a bully named Troy. He does, however, make a few friends amongst other outcasts. At his father's, Duncan goes through rough training for the weekend. Belloc is training him not only to be powerful, but he wants Duncan to learn things the hard way. Duncan goes back to school where he has a principal that doesn't want him there and a jerk that won't get off his case. So for a little payback, Troy tries to set Duncan up by hiding a gun. It works, but the reaction is far more than what Troy wanted. This leads to Duncan seriously thinking about his control over his emotions and if he truly belongs in the world with humans. When he returns home, it is demolished and Margaret is missing. He tracks down his mother and her kidnapper, a monster from Monster Island. He and the monster have a brutal fight which ends (at least as far as Duncan is concerned) with Duncan blasting the monster with flame, leaving the monster badly burned but alive. This changes when Belloc arrives on the scene and impales the monster with his tail. Duncan figures out that Belloc arranged the kidnapping to test him and threatens to kill him if he ever endangers his mother again. After Duncan flies away, Belloc smiles to himself, saying, \\"That's my boy\\". =Firebreather: The Iron Saint (one-shot)= Duncan's class is taken abroad by \\"Mr. M\\" the Spanish teacher, who shows them the sights of London, before making their way to Spain. While in London, the group hears the story of \\"The Iron Saint\\", a long forgotten being that was created to fight, and survive, the King of the Monsters. The suit of armor has been passed down for generations and generations, and now it's just a museum piece. Duncan learns of its history, and its connection to him, and can't help but be curious. When he and his friend investigate, they find that the suit has been brought back to life and it's out to get Duncan. The wearer of the armor turns out to be Mr. M, who is revealed to be not only an S.O.S. escort but a survivor of an attack on a Cuban village. He attempts to use the armor to kill Duncan as revenge. However, Duncan is saved due to his half-human heritage, since the armor cannot draw human blood or else it will be destroyed, and kill humanity, and all life on earth. =The Pact= In the first issue, Shadowhawk, Invincible, Firebreather, and Zephyr Noble, come together to fight Belloc who was going to see his son on Father's Day.

It is the smallest of North America's gray wolves,Mech, L. David (1981), The Wolf: The Ecology and Behaviour of an Endangered Species, University of Minnesota Press, p. 350, and is similar to C. l. nubilus, though it is distinguished by its smaller, narrower skull and its darker pelt, which is yellowish-gray and heavily clouded with black over the back and tail.Bailey, V. (1932), Mammals of New Mexico. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Biological Survey. North American Fauna No. 53. Washington, D.C. Pages 303-308. Its ancestors were likely the first gray wolves to enter North America after the extinction of the Beringian wolf, as indicated by its southern range and basal physical and genetic characteristics. Though once held in high regard in Pre-Columbian Mexico, it is the most endangered gray wolf in North America, having been extirpated in the wild during the mid-1900s through a combination of hunting, trapping, poisoning and digging pups from dens. After being listed under the Endangered Species Act in 1976, the United States and Mexico collaborated to capture all lobos remaining in the wild. This extreme measure prevented the lobos' extinction. Five wild Mexican wolves (four males and one pregnant female) were captured alive in Mexico from 1977 to 1980 and used to start a captive breeding program. From this program, captive-bred Mexican wolves were released into recovery areas in Arizona and New Mexico beginning in 1998 in order to assist the animals' recolonization of their former historical range.Nie, M. A. (2003), Beyond Wolves: The Politics of Wolf Recovery and Management, University of Minnesota Press, pp. 118-119, As of 2017, there are 143 Mexican wolves living wild and 240 in captive breeding programs. Taxonomy The Mexican wolf was first described as a distinct subspecies in 1929 by Edward Nelson and Edward Goldman on account of its small size, narrow skull and dark pelt. This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). In 2019, a literature review of previous studies was undertaken by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The position of the National Academies is that the historic population of Mexican wolf represents a distinct evolutionary lineage of gray wolf, and that modern Mexican wolves are their direct descendants. It is a valid taxonomic subspecies classified as Canis lupus baileyi. =Lineage= Gray wolves (Canis lupus) migrated from Eurasia into North America 70,000‚Äì23,000 years ago and gave rise to at least two morphologically and genetically distinct groups. One group is represented by the extinct Beringian wolf and the other by the modern populations. One author proposes that the Mexican wolf's ancestors were likely the first gray wolves to cross the Bering Land Bridge into North America during the Late Pleistocene after the extinction of the Beringian wolf, colonizing most of the continent until pushed southwards by the newly arrived ancestors of C. l. nubilus. A haplotype is a group of genes found in an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. A 2005 study compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences of modern wolves with those from thirty-four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915. The historic population was found to possess twice the genetic diversity of modern wolves, which suggests that the mDNA diversity of the wolves eradicated from the western US was more than twice that of the modern population. Some haplotypes possessed by the Mexican wolf, the extinct Great Plains wolf, and the extinct Southern Rocky Mountain wolf were found to form a unique \\"southern clade\\". All North American wolves group together with those from Eurasia, except for the southern clade which form a group exclusive to North America. The wide distribution area of the southern clade indicates that gene flow was extensive across the recognized limits of its subspecies. In 2016, a study of mitochondrial DNA sequences of both modern and ancient wolves generated a phylogenetic tree which indicated that the two most basal North American haplotypes included the Mexican wolf and the Vancouver Island wolf. In 2018, a study looked at the limb morphology of modern and fossil North American wolves. The major limb bones of the dire wolf, Beringian wolf, and most modern North American gray wolves can be clearly distinguished from one another. Late Pleistocene wolves on both sides of the Laurentide Ice Sheet ‚Äî Cordilleran Ice Sheet possessed shorter legs when compared with most modern wolves. The Late Pleistocene wolves from the Natural Trap Cave, Wyoming and Rancho La Brea, southern California were similar in limb morphology to the Beringian wolves of Alaska. Modern wolves in the Midwestern USA and northwestern North America possess longer legs that evolved during the Holocene, possibly driven by the loss of slower prey. However, shorter legs survived well into the Holocene after the extinction of much of the Pleistocene megafauna, including the Beringian wolf. Holocene wolves from Middle Butte Cave (dated less than 7,600 YBP) and Moonshiner Cave (dated over 3,000 YBP) in Bingham County, Idaho were similar to the Beringian wolves. The Mexican wolf and pre-1900 samples of the Great Plains wolf (Canis lupus nubilus) resembled the Late Pleistocene and Holocene fossil gray wolves due to their shorter legs. =Hybridization with coyotes and red wolves= Skull Unlike eastern wolves and red wolves, the gray wolf species rarely interbreeds with coyotes in the wild. Direct hybridizations between coyotes and gray wolves was never explicitly observed. Nevertheless, in a study that analyzed the molecular genetics of the coyotes as well as samples of historical red wolves and Mexican wolves from Texas, a few coyote genetic markers have been found in the historical samples of some isolated individual Mexican wolves. Likewise, gray wolf Y-chromosomes have also been found in a few individual male Texan coyotes. This study suggested that although the Mexican gray wolf is generally less prone to hybridizations with coyotes compared to the red wolf, there may have been exceptional genetic exchanges with the Texan coyotes among a few individual gray wolves from historical remnants before the population was completely extirpated in Texas. However, the same study also countered that theory with an alternative possibility that it may have been the red wolves, who in turn also once overlapped with both species in the central Texas region, who were involved in circuiting the gene- flows between the coyotes and gray wolves much like how the eastern wolf is suspected to have bridged gene-flows between gray wolves and coyotes in the Great Lakes region since direct hybridizations between coyotes and gray wolves is considered rare. In tests performed on a sample from a taxidermied carcass of what was initially labelled as a chupacabra, mitochondrial DNA analysis conducted by Texas State University professor Michael Forstner showed that it was a coyote. However, subsequent analysis by a veterinary genetics laboratory team at the University of California, Davis concluded that, based on the sex chromosomes, the male animal was a coyote‚Äìwolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican wolf.\\"Texas State University Researcher Helps Unravel Mystery of Texas 'Blue Dog' Claimed to be Chupacabra\\". bionews-tx.com (2013-09-01)Long, Sonny (October 31, 2008) \\"DNA results show chupacabra animal is mixture of coyote, Mexican wolf\\". Victoria Advocate. It has been suggested that the hybrid animal was afflicted with sarcoptic mange, which would explain its hairless and blueish appearance. A study in 2018 that analyzed wolf populations suspected to have had past interactions with domestic dogs found no evidence of significant dog admixture into the Mexican wolf. Another study in the same year was published in the PLOS Genetics Journal which analyzed the population genomics of gray wolves and coyotes from all over North America. This study detected the presences of coyote admixtures in various western gray wolf populations, all previously thought to be free of coyote-introgression, and found that the Mexican wolves carry 10% coyote admixture. The study's author also suggests that the admixture from coyotes may have also played a role in the basal phylogenetic placement of this subspecies. Distribution Early accounts of the distribution of the Mexican wolf included southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, sometimes western Texas, USA and the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico. This past distribution is supported by ecological, morphological, and physiographic data. The areas described coincide with the distribution of the Madrean pine-oak woodlands, a habitat which supports Coues‚Äô white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus couesi) that is the Mexican wolf's main prey. In 2017, there are at least 143 Mexican wolves living wild in Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico. There are 240 in captive breeding programs in the USA and Mexico. History The Aztec god Xolotl, depicted here in the 15th century Codex Fejervary-Mayer, may have been based on the Mexican wolf rather than a dog as once believed. The Mexican wolf was held in high regard in Pre-Columbian Mexico, where it was considered a symbol of war and the Sun. In the city of Teotihuacan, it was common practice to crossbreed Mexican wolves with dogs to produce temperamental, but loyal, animal guardians. Wolves were also sacrificed in religious rituals, which involved quartering the animals and keeping their heads as attire for priests and warriors. The remaining body parts were deposited in underground funerary chambers with a westerly orientation, which symbolized rebirth, the Sun, the underworld and the canid god Xolotl.Valadez, R., Rodr√≠guez, B., Manzanilla, L. & Tejeda, S. (2006), Dog-wolf hybrid biotype reconstruction from the archaeological city of Teotihuacan in prehispanic central Mexico , in Dogs and People in Social, Working, Economic or Symbolic Interaction, ed. L. M. Snyder & E. A. Moore, pp. 121-131, Oxford, England: Oxbow Books (Proceedings of the 9th ICAZ Conference, Durham, England, 2002. The earliest written record of the Mexican wolf comes from Francisco Javier Clavijero's Historia de M√©xico in 1780, where it is referred to as Cuetzlachcojotl, and is described as being of the same species as the coyote, but with a more wolf-like pelt and a thicker neck.Clavijero, Francisco Javier (1817) The history of Mexico, Volume 1, Thomas Dobson, p. 57 Zuni wolf fetish. =Decline= There was a rapid reduction of Mexican wolf populations in the Southwestern United States from 1915-1920; by the mid-1920s, livestock losses to Mexican wolves became rare in areas where the costs once ranged in the millions of dollars.USFWS, (1982), Mexican wolf recovery plan, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Vernon Bailey, writing in the early 1930s, noted that the highest Mexican wolf densities occurred in the open grazing areas of the Gila National Forest, and that wolves were completely absent in the lower Sonora. He estimated that there were 103 Mexican wolves in New Mexico in 1917, though the number had been reduced to 45 a year later. By 1927, it had apparently become extinct in New Mexico. Sporadic encounters with wolves entering Texas, New Mexico and Arizona via Mexico continued through to the 1950s, until they too were driven away through traps, poison and guns. The last wild wolves to be killed in Texas were a male shot on December 5, 1970 on Cathedral Mountain Ranch and another caught in a trap on the Joe Neal Brown Ranch on December 28. Wolves were still being reported in small numbers in Arizona in the early 1970s, while accounts of the last wolf to be killed in New Mexico are difficult to evaluate, as all the purported \\"last wolves\\" could not be confirmed as genuine wolves rather than other canid species. The Mexican wolf persisted longer in Mexico, as human settlement, ranching and predator removal came later than in the Southwestern United States. Wolf numbers began to rapidly decline during the 1930s-1940s, when Mexican ranchers began adopting the same wolf-control methods as their American counterparts, relying heavily on the indiscriminate usage of 1080. =Conservation and recovery= A pair of Mexican wolves with pups at Sevilleta Wolf Management Facility in Socorro, New Mexico The Mexican wolf was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1976, with the Mexican Wolf Recovery Team being formed three years later by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The Recovery Team composed the Mexican Wolf Recovery Plan, which called for the reestablishment of at least 100 wolves in their historic range through a captive breeding program. Between 1977 and 1980, four males and a pregnant female were captured in Durango and Chihuahua in Mexico to act as founders of a new \\"certified lineage\\". By 1999, with the addition of new lineages, the captive Mexican wolf population throughout the US and Mexico reached 178 individuals. These captive-bred animals were subsequently released into the Apache National Forest in eastern Arizona, and allowed to recolonize east-central Arizona and south-central New Mexico, areas which were collectively termed the Blue Range Wolf Recovery Area (BRWRA). The Recovery Plan called for the release of additional wolves in the White Sands Wolf Recovery Area in south-central New Mexico, should the goal of 100 wild wolves in the Blue Range area not be achieved. By late 2012, it was estimated that there were at least 75 wolves and four breeding pairs living in the recovery areas, with 27% of the population consisting of pups. Since 1998, 92 wolf deaths were recorded, with four occurring in 2012; these four were all due to illegal shootings.USFWS (2012), Mexican Wolf Recovery Program: Progress Report #15, US Fish and Wildlife Service Releases have also been conducted in Mexico, and the first birth of a wild wolf litter in Mexico was reported in 2014. A study released by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in February 2015 shows a minimum population of 109 wolves in 2014 in southwest New Mexico and southeast Arizona, a 31 percent increase from 2013.Humphrey, Jeff and Lambert, Lynda (February 13, 2015) 2014 Mexican Wolf Population Survey Complete - Population Exceeds 100. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service According to a survey done on the population of the Mexican wolf in Alpine, Arizona, the recovery of the species is being negatively impacted due to poaching. In an effort to fight the slowing recovery, GPS monitoring devices are being used to monitor the wolves.\\"How Mexican gray wolves are tracked in the wild\\". USA Today (2016-01-28). In 2016, 14 Mexican wolves were killed, making it the highest death count of any year since they were reintroduced into the wild in 1998. 2 of the deaths were caused by officials trying to collar the animals. The rest of the deaths remain under investigation. As of July 2017, approximately 31 wild Mexican gray wolves inhabited Chihuahua and Sonora, Mexico, in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental. As of November 2017, 114 Mexican gray wolves were living in the wild in Arizona and New Mexico, distributed in 22 packs across the two states. In February 2018, five more wolves were released in Chihuahua, bringing the total wild population in Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua) to thirty-seven wolves. In 2018, six Mexican wolf pups from the Endangered Wolf Center were sent to dens in Arizona and New Mexico for their survival. In 2019, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services discovered that 52 of 90 wolf pups born earlier in 2018 had survived to adulthood. These new wolves brought the number of Mexican gray wolves in Arizona and New Mexico to 163, with 87 wolves in New Mexico and 76 in Arizona. Eight Mexican wolf cubs were born at the Desert Museum in Saltillo, Coahuila on July 1, 2020. Further reading * Holaday, B.

It also has an attached acting school. History A.C.T. was founded in 1965 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by theatre and opera director William Ball in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Playhouse and Carnegie Mellon University. Ball relocated the company to San Francisco after being invited by philanthropists and officials from that city to do so, and presented twenty-seven fully staged productions in rotating repertory, in two different theaters - the Geary Theater and the Marines Memorial Theatre - during the first 40-week season. San Francisco Chronicle critic Paine Knickerbocker called Ball's opening performance of Moli√®re's Tartuffe \\"a screaming, bellowing unbelievable triumph.\\" A.C.T.'s original twenty-seven member acting company featured Ren√© Auberjonois, Peter Donat, Richard Dysart, Michael Learned, Ruth Kobart, Paul Shenar, Charles Siebert, Ken Ruta, and Kitty Winn among others. Ball's mid-1970s productions of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, starring Marc Singer, and Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, starring Peter Donat and Marsha Mason, were televised by PBS and are available on video. In the mid-1980s, Ball, suffering from exhaustion and under accusations of financial mismanagement, was forced to relinquish his post as artistic director. He was succeeded by A.C.T. founding member and stage director Edward Hastings, who revived the company's fortunes until the Geary Theater was severely damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The company continued performing in a number of San Francisco venues while laying the groundwork for its restoration. Carey Perloff served as A.C.T.'s artistic director from 1992 to 2018. In 2007, A.C.T. released a cast album of Perloff's production of the Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill musical Happy End, produced by LucasArts studios. It includes the full score and is the first English language recording of this musical. Pam MacKinnon was appointed to succeed Perloff as artistic director, effective with the end of the 2017‚Äì2018 season.Staff (January 23, 2018) \\"Tony, OBIE, and Drama Desk Award Winner Pam Mackinnon Named New Artistic Director At American Conservatory Theater\\", BroadwayWorld Theaters A.C.T.'s primary home in San Francisco is the Geary Theater,\\"The Geary Theater\\" A.C.T. website located at 415 Geary Street near the corner of Mason Street in the Theatre District of San Francisco. Built in 1910 and designed by Bliss and Faville (Walter D. Bliss and William B. Faville) in the Classical Revival and Late Victorian styles, it was previously known as the Columbia Theater. The Geary Theater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 27, 1975, and was designated an official San Francisco Landmark on July 11, 1976.\\"San Francisco Preservation Bulletin No. 9: San Francisco Landmarks\\". In 2015, A.C.T. opened the Strand Theater at 1127 Market Street between 7th and 8th Streets, across from the U.N. Plaza in the Civic Center neighborhood of San Francisco. The building has a 283-seat theater as well as a 120-seat event and performance space. A.C.T. utilizes the theater to present educational workshops, cabaret performances and specially commissioned new works, as well as productions connected to their M.F.A. and Young Conservatory programs.\\"The Strand Theater\\", A.C.T. website. Acting school A.C.T.'s founder's vision was for it to be both a theater company and acting school. The conservatory currently offers a wide range of classes and is accredited to grant Master of Fine Arts degrees for actors. Its MFA program is extremely competitive, admitting only eight students per year among hundreds who audition. It was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of the top five graduate acting training programs in the U.S., along with schools like Juilliard, Yale, New York University, and Brown University/Trinity Repertory Company. The current director of the conservatory is Melissa Smith. Among the many notable alumni of the MFA program are Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Princess Sarah Culberson, Benjamin Bratt, Carlos Bernard, Wynn Harmon, Elizabeth Banks, Anna Belknap, Dileep Rao, Harry Hamlin, Anna Deavere Smith, Omar Metwally, Steven W. Bailey, and Anika Noni Rose. In addition to the MFA program, A.C.T. offers training through the Studio A.C.T., the Summer Training Congress, and Young Conservatory programs. Alumni of these programs include Nicolas Cage, Teri Hatcher, Delroy Lindo, Danny Glover, David Denman, Tom O'Brien, Milo Ventimiglia, Winona Ryder, Zendaya, Amy Irving, Camryn Manheim, Chelsea Peretti, Rozzi Crane, Adam Jacobs, Brie Larson, Darren Criss, and Chris Pine. =Young Conservatory= A.C.T.'s Young Conservatory is an internationally recognized professional theater training program for youth through the ages of 19. It was founded by Luanne and Ross Graham in 1971. Successive YC directors include Candace Birk, Sharon Newman, Linda Aldrich, and Susan Stauter. The program has been led since 1988 by Craig Slaight. The Young Conservatory is geared toward performing new works specifically for young actors, and has premiered plays and musicals by playwrights such as Horton Foote and Paul Zindel. The conservatory members are also offered roles in the main stage productions, most frequently A Christmas Carol, which is performed every winter. Sound design The first person to be given the title sound designer in regional theater was Dan Dugan at A.C.T. in the late 1960s. The term Sound Design was introduced to the film world when Francis Ford Coppola directed (and for which his father, Carmine Coppola, arranged the music and Charlie Richmond was the sound designer) a production of Private Lives at A.C.T., while the final cut of the film The Godfather was being edited in 1972. San Francisco Symphony recordings According to Pristine Audio, the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Alfred Hertz, made a series of electrical recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company on the stage of the theater in 1927. Pristine Audio has restored and reissued the 78 rpm recordings on CD.

He was born in Bulwell, Nottinghamshire. His father was a miner and Frank followed him into this industry in 1918, joining the Yorkshire Miners' Association. However after five years he became a lorry driver, originally driving coal, and then in 1931 as a long-distance lorry driver, transporting meat between Scotland and London. He became a member of the road transport section of the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), of which he became a full-time official in Doncaster in July 1938. He was appointed National Secretary of Road Transport (Commercial) Group in October 1948, contested the TGWU Assistant General Secretaryship in 1948 and 1955, securing the position on the latter attempt. He was also elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee the same year, but resigned in March 1956. Cousins was appointed acting General Secretary of the TGWU in February 1956, due to poor health on the part of Jock Tiffin. He was elected General Secretary in May 1956, following Tiffin's death, and held the position until 1969. From 1956 to 1969, he was a member of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress and was President of the International Transport Workers' Federation from 1958 to 1960 and 1962 to 1964. Cousins played a significant role in helping Harold Wilson become leader of the Labour Party and served in Wilson's cabinet as Minister of Technology from October 1964 until his resignation on 11 June 1966 to protest against a Government-backed law freezing incomes and prices. His appointment as a Minister was notable as he is only one of two recent Ministers (the other being Patrick Gordon-Walker) who was appointed to the role without being either a Member of Parliament or a member of the House of Lords. He was also made a Privy Counsellor in 1964. He was elected Member of Parliament for Nuneaton at a by-election in January 1965 and remained an MP until November 1966. During this period Harry Nicholas took over as acting general secretary of the TGWU.

He was the second child of the Nobel Prize-winning author John Ernst Steinbeck. In 1965, he was drafted into the United States Army and served in Vietnam. He worked as a journalist for Armed Forces Radio and TV, and as a war correspondent for the United States Department of Defense. Biography In March 1968 he testified before a Senate subcommittee that in his opinion \\"about 60 percent of American soldiers between the ages of 19 and 27 smoke marijuana when they think it reasonable to do just that, taking into consideration their responsibilities at the moment.\\" He also said that Military Assistance Command, Vietnam itself promoted drug abuse by providing for distribution of narcotics such as amphetamines, also known as pep pills, to soldiers in combat. In 1968, Steinbeck returned to South Vietnam as a journalist. Along with Sean Flynn (the son of actor Errol Flynn), he started Dispatch News Service, which originally published Seymour Hersh's story on the My Lai Massacre. Fluent in street Vietnamese, Flynn and Steinbeck quickly became independent of the flow of information dispensed by the United States Press Office, enabling them to discover the truth about the My Lai Massacre and the Con Son Island prison \\"tiger cages\\". Flynn disappeared after being taken as a prisoner of war during a photo shoot in Cambodia. Steinbeck's Vietnam memoir In Touch was published by Knopf in 1969. He wrote about his experiences with the Vietnamese and GIs. Steinbeck took the vows of a Buddhist monk while living on Phoenix Island in the Mekong Delta, under the tutelage of the politically powerful Coconut Monk, a silent tree-dwelling Buddhist yogi who adopted Steinbeck as a spiritual son. Amid the raging war, Steinbeck stayed in the monk's \\"peace zone\\", where the 400 monks who lived on the island hammered howitzer shell casings into bells. While in Saigon, Steinbeck participated in Michael Rubbo's 1970 documentary film Sad Song of Yellow Skin, as part of a group of young American journalists practicing a New Journalism approach to covering the war. Steinbeck traveled back and forth between Asia and the United States several more times before settling in Boulder, Colorado, where he studied Tibetan Buddhism with Ch√∂gyam Trungpa. On March 6, 1982, he married Nancy Harper,Steinbeck 2001, pg. 351 who had two children from a previous marriage; Steinbeck also had a child of his own. In 1983, the family traveled around the world for a year, living in Kathmandu to pursue their Buddhist studies. In 1984, Steinbeck was diagnosed with hemochromatosis, a genetic disease that causes iron retention. After years of heavy drinking, he quit in 1988. He became very interested in alcoholism's genetic aspects, and participated in Twelve-Step Programs. It was Steinbeck who broke the story of √ñsel Tendzin's AIDS to the Boulder press.Steinbeck 2001, pp. 311‚Äì12 A renewal of his journalistic career ensued as he wrote about the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism, and alcoholism. In 1990, he began his autobiography as follows: \\"The reasons for attempting to write this book could be summed up simply by my desire to live free from fear. However, the path leading to that sort of fruition has, along its border, a lot of fearful things that at first glance can cause panic, or resentment, or shame. There is also charity and sanity, which accompany this sort of voyage like good dolphins on a good quest. Frankly, I feel blessed that these guiding elements have never abandoned me and, as I and others continue to recover from the effects of my actions, I am encouraged that these qualities will endure, even shine.\\" In 1990, Steinbeck was diagnosed with a ruptured disc. He underwent corrective surgery on February 7, 1991, and died immediately after the operation.Steinbeck 2001, pg. xx In 2001, his posthumous memoir The Other Side of Eden: Life With John Steinbeck was published by Prometheus Books. The book jacket reads: \\"Left unfinished at his untimely death, this testament to his life is here reconstructed by Nancy Steinbeck. Interweaving her own reminiscences of her life with John Steinbeck IV, Nancy has created an engrossing account from two perspectives: John's memories of his chaotic and adventurous upbringing and her own thoughts on their journey together to make a new life apart from the long shadow of a famous father and a troubled past.\\" The book was co- distributed by the Hazelden Foundation, a treatment center for drug and alcohol addiction. Publishers Weekly said, \\"More than a memoir, this is a powerful account of healing and liberation.

A photo showing a VIE system. A vacuum insulated evaporator (VIE) is a form of pressure vessel that allows the bulk storage of cryogenic liquids including oxygen, nitrogen and argon for industrial processes and medical applications. The purpose of the vacuum insulation is to prevent heat transfer between the inner shell, which holds the liquid, and surrounding atmosphere. Without functioning insulation, the stored liquid will rapidly warm and undergo a phase transition to gas, increasing significantly in volume and potentially causing a catastrophic failure to the vessel due to an increase in pressure. To combat such an event, VIEs are installed with a pressure safety valve. To remain a liquid, the vessel contents must be kept at or below its critical temperature. The critical temperature of oxygen is ‚àí118 ¬∞C; above this temperature, applying more pressure will not result in a liquid, but rather a supercritical fluid. Mandatory safety features To avoid explosions or other dangerous events, the VIE must be kept in an open space with no overhead wires (to prevent sparks from igniting surrounding materials, which will burn more easily in the presence of high concentrations of oxygen) and ringed by a fence of non- combustible material. Parking vehicles, open flames, smoking, and other potentially hazardous activities are normally prohibited anywhere near the VIE.

She was built by the American William Cramp & Sons because Russian shipyards were already at full capacity. Named after a Swedish ship of the line that was captured during the battle of Vyborg Bay in 1790 (, meaning both fairness and justice), Retvizan was briefly assigned to the Baltic Fleet, but was transferred to the Far East in 1902. The ship was torpedoed during the Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur during the night of 8/9 February 1904 and grounded in the harbour entrance when she attempted to take refuge inside, as her draft had significantly deepened from the amount of water she had taken aboard after the torpedo hit. She was refloated and repaired in time to join the rest of the 1st Pacific Squadron when they attempted to reach Vladivostok through the Japanese blockade on 10 August. The Japanese battle fleet engaged them again in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, forcing most of the Russian ships to return to Port Arthur after their squadron commander was killed and his flagship damaged. Retvizan was sunk by Japanese howitzers in December after the Japanese gained control of the heights around the harbour. The Japanese raised and repaired Retvizan after Port Arthur surrendered in January 1905. She was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as in 1908. Based in Sasebo when Japan declared war on Germany in 1914, the ship was sent to reinforce the weak British squadron off British Columbia, but diverted to Hawaii after reports of a German gunboat there. Hizen was unsuccessfully sent to search for other German ships after the Americans interned the gunboat in November. After World War I she supported the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War and was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. The ship was sunk as a gunnery target in 1924. Background Tsar Nicholas II had desired a warm-water port on the Pacific since his accession to the throne in 1894. He achieved this ambition in March 1898 when Russia signed a 25-year lease for Port Arthur and the Liaotung Peninsula with China. Japan had previously forced China to sign over the port and its surrounding territory as part of the treaty that concluded the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì95, but the Triple Intervention of France, Russia, and Germany forced them to return the port in exchange for a sizeable increase in the indemnity paid by the Chinese. Japan invested much of the indemnity money in expanding its fleet, while Russia began a major building programme (\\"For the Needs of the Far East\\") to defend its newly acquired port.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 100‚Äì103 Russian shipyards were already at maximum capacity so the Naval Ministry decided to order ships from abroad. Charles Henry Cramp, the owner and son of the founder of William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia, had a relationship with the Imperial Russian Navy dating back to the late 1870s when his firm built the auxiliary cruisers , , and . Cramp also repaired several Russian warships visiting America in 1893, and he cultivated the contacts he made in the Russian Navy throughout the 1890s. As such, he was ideally positioned to offer to build a battleship for the Russians in his shipyard when they began to look abroad.McLaughlin 2000, pp. 48‚Äì51 Design and description alt= Preliminary design work on a battleship intended to equal the latest Japanese ships began in late 1897 and early 1898 by the Naval Technical Committee; the displacement was limited to for economic reasons. The basic design was that of the with its speed increased to using only two shafts and its steaming range increased to at . The Naval Ministry intended to conduct an international design competition with the ships being built abroad as the Baltic shipyards were at full capacity.McLaughlin 2000, p. 51 Cramp's contacts kept him informed of the Russians' intentions and he sailed to Saint Petersburg to offer his services and design expertise in March 1898. Initially Cramp offered American designs to the Russians, including an updated version of as it was a relatively close match for the Russian specification, but the Russians preferred their own designs. Both sides compromised and the final design was based on the . The new ship had four fewer guns, but twice the coal capacity for improved range and a longer, slightly narrower hull for more speed. The contract was signed on 23 April 1898 for a price of $4,360,000. The protected cruiser was ordered at the same time for $2,138,000.McLaughlin 2000, pp. 52‚Äì53 =General characteristics= Retvizan was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced at normal load. Her hull was subdivided by fourteen transverse watertight bulkheads; in addition a longitudinal centreline bulkhead divided the engine room. Retvizan had a complete double bottom that extended up the side to the lower edge of the armoured deck. She had a metacentric height of . Her crew consisted of 23 officers and 722 enlisted men.McLaughlin 2000, pp. 54‚Äì55 =Propulsion= Retvizan had a pair of three-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines with a total designed output of . The Russian Navy preferred to use Belleville boilers, but Cramp pressed for Niclausse boilers, not least because he was the American agent for them and was supported by the General Admiral Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich. Twenty-four Niclausse-type boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of . On sea trials, the engines produced and a top speed of , just under the contract speed of 18 knots. Not surprisingly, Cramp claimed that she reached 18.01 knots to avoid contractual penalties. Following Retvizans arrival in Russia, the propeller pitch was adjusted and she exceeded 18 knots. She carried a normal load of of coal that gave a range of at , and a maximum load of that gave at the same speed.McLaughlin 2000, p. 55 =Armament and fire control= Retvizans armament was built by the Obukhov Works in Saint Petersburg and shipped to America for installation. The main armament consisted of two pairs of 12-inch 40-calibre guns mounted in French- style electrically operated centre-pivot twin turrets fore and aft. These guns had a maximum elevation of +15¬∞ and could depress to ‚àí5¬∞. The ship carried 77 rounds per gun and the guns could fire one round every 80 to 90 seconds. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of .McLaughlin 2000, p. 57 Eight of the twelve 45-calibre 6-inch Canet Pattern 1892 quick-firing (QF) guns were mounted in casemates on the main deck while four were mounted on the upper deck. They fired shells that weighed with a muzzle velocity of .Friedman, p. 261 They had a maximum range of around and could fire three to five rounds per minute. The guns were provided with 200 rounds each. The ship carried many smaller guns to defend itself against attack by torpedo boats. The largest of these were twenty QF Canet Pattern 1892 guns. Fourteen of these were in embrasures on the main deck and six were mounted on the upper deck, between the six-inch casemates. Each gun was provided with 325 rounds.McLaughlin 2000, pp. 57‚Äì58 They fired an shell at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of .Friedman, p. 264 The rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute. A total of twenty-four Hotchkiss guns were carried; four in each fighting top and eight at each end of the superstructure. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .Friedman, p. 228 Six Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the bridge wings. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of .Friedman, p. 120 Retvizan carried six torpedo tubes. Four were above water, one each in the bow and stern and the aft pair of broadside tubes; the forward broadside tubes were underwater. A total of 17 torpedoes were carried. The ship was designed to carry two second-class torpedo boats each equipped with a single torpedo tube and a small quick-firing gun. The ship could also carry 45 mines.McLaughlin 2000, p. 58 The ship was fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, to estimate the range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler electro-mechanical fire- control transmission system to each gun or turret.Forczyk, pp. 27‚Äì28, 57 =Armour= The total weight of the Krupp armour was or 25.8% of the displacement. The armour was mostly made in the United States, although a contract was let for deck armour from Russia on 6 January 1899.McLaughlin 2000, p. 53 The main waterline belt had a maximum thickness of and tapered to thick at its lower edge. It was long and high, of which about was above the waterline. The 6-inch upper belt was as long as the main belt and was high. Armour plates thick protected the ends of the ship to a height equal to that of the main and upper belts combined. Bulkheads thick provided transverse protection for the ship's vitals. The lower casemate armour was thick and armour screens thick separated each gun. The upper casemate armour consisted of five inches of armour plate with semicircular 1.5-inch thick gun shields enclosing the guns. The front and sides of the turrets were thick with 2-inch roofs. Their barbettes were thick above the upper deck, but diminished to below it. The conning tower and its communication tube had walls. The armour deck inside the central citadel was level with the top of the main belt and sloped down to meet the lower edge of the main belt. It was two inches thick on the flat and on the slope. Fore and aft of the citadel the deck thickened to to the ends of the ship and reinforced the ram bow. Construction and service Retvizan under construction in Philadelphia, October 1900. Named after the Swedish ship of the line R√§ttvisan (Justice) which was captured by the Russians at the Battle of Viborg Bay in 1790, Retvizan was ordered on 2 May 1898 for delivery in thirty months. The detailed sketch design was forwarded at the end of 1898 to Saint Petersburg for approval and work commenced on the ship around that time, although she was not officially laid down until 29 July 1899 as yard number 300. Construction was delayed by a strike at the shipyard that began in August 1899 and continued until the strike collapsed in early 1900. Other delays were caused by differences between American and Russian shipbuilding techniques and the insistence of the Naval Ministry on approving any design changes even though a Russian commission had been sent to Philadelphia to supervise her construction.McLaughlin 2000, p. 54 Her armament arrived in Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before he received his last payment. More work needed to be done on the armament, but it had to wait until she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.McLaughlin 2000, pp. 54, 57, 59 Diana and Retvizan in transit at Weh Island on their way to Port Arthur in 1903 Retvizan sailed for the Baltic Sea on 13 May 1902 and stopped to re-coal in Cherbourg, France, en route. After leaving Cherbourg a boiler tube burst on 14 June, scalding six stokers, three of them fatally. After her arrival she was fitted with radio equipment and took part in a naval review in Reval staged for the state visit of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany in August. Later that month she tested an experimental system for coaling at sea; it was deemed successful, but her equipment was removed before she sailed for the Pacific. Retvizan departed on 13 November 1902 in company with the battleship and the cruisers , and ; she arrived at Port Arthur on 4 May 1903.McLaughlin 2000, p. 61 =Battle of Port Arthur= The Pacific Squadron began mooring in the outer harbour at night as tensions with Japan increased, in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea. Both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control both Manchuria and Korea which naturally caused problems between them. A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarications designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable.Westwood, pp. 15‚Äì21 Retvizan was on searchlight duty on the night of 8/9 February 1904 and attracted many torpedoes during the Japanese surprise attack that night. She was hit on the port side forward by a torpedo which blew a hole in her side. Five men in the torpedo compartment were killed and all electrical power was knocked out. The ship took on enough water to give her a list of 11¬∞; this was reduced to 5¬∞ by counter-flooding. A sail was used to cover the hole and steam was raised so she could head for the inner harbour. The of water she had taken aboard had increased her draft enough to cause her to ground in the harbour entrance. She was not refloated until 8 March, but played an important role in the meantime in defeating a Japanese attempt to seal the entrance with block ships on 23‚Äì24 February.McLaughlin 2000, pp. 61, 63 Repairs began immediately after she was towed into the harbour and were completed on 3 June although no docks were available and a cofferdam had to be built. She sailed with the rest of the Russian squadron on 23 June in an abortive attempt to reach Vladivostok. Vice Admiral Vitgeft returned to Port Arthur when he encountered the Japanese fleet, led by Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, shortly before sunset as he did not wish to engage the numerically superior Japanese in a night battle.Warner & Warner, pp. 305‚Äì306 During the summer, Retvizan landed two 6-inch, two 47 mm and six 37 mm guns to reinforce the landward defences of the port. She was hit on 9 August by seven shells fired by a battery with a narrow view of the harbour. Schensnovich was slightly wounded, a barge adjacent to the ship was sunk and she was holed below the waterline. The ship took on a 1¬∞ list from of water, which was corrected by counter-flooding. The holes were patched, although the water was not pumped out, and she sailed the next day with the fleet in another attempt to reach Vladivostok. This sortie resulted in the Battle of the Yellow Sea.McLaughlin 2000, p. 63 =Battle of the Yellow Sea= The battle began as a long-range gunnery duel, during which the Russian ships hit the Japanese ships numerous times and forced T≈çg≈ç to temporarily disengage. Over two hours after the start of the battle, the Japanese fleet closed the range and started shooting again at 17:35. Forty minutes later a shell struck Retvizans forward turret near the gun ports, killing one turret crewman and wounding six others from the blast pressure. The impact knocked one 12-inch shell off its loading tray, crushing two other sailors and also setting fire to the canvas covering the gun ports. Fearing that the fire might spread, the surviving crewmen flooded the turret, knocking out its electrical system. The crew was able to get the turret partially functional within an hour.Forczyk, pp. 51‚Äì52 alt= At approximately 18:40 hours on 10 August, during the final phase of the battle, the Russian flagship was hit by 12-inch shells which killed Admiral Vitgeft and his immediate staff. The Russian battleship was turning out of control, disrupting the Russian formation. As the Japanese pre-dreadnoughts continued to pound the Tsesarevich with their 12-inch fire, Retvizans captain boldly charged T≈çg≈ç's battleline in an attempt to divert the Japanese shellfire onto his ship.Forczyk, p. 53 The Japanese battle line immediately shifted their fire onto the oncoming Retvizan, firing so many shells that they were unable to adjust their fire due to the number of shell splashes engulfing the Russian battleship. As the Russian squadron was now disorganized, T≈çg≈ç's battleships were running low on ammunition and some ships' main guns were disabled, he turned the battle over to his cruisers and destroyers. Retvizan had effectively ended the duel between the opposing fleets, and had saved Tsesarevich from destruction. During the battle, Retvizan received 18 hits from large-calibre shells, and suffered 6 sailors killed and another 42 men wounded, including Schensnovich.Forczyk, p. 52 She was subsequently besieged in Port Arthur and sunk in shallow water by thirteen howitzer shells on 6 December 1904 after the Imperial Japanese Army gained control of the heights surrounding the harbour.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 183 Schensnovich was the senior surviving naval officer and signed the capitulation of Port Arthur for the Imperial Russian Navy on 2 January 1905.McLaughlin 2000, p. 64 =Japanese service= Japanese battleship Hizen Retvizan was raised by the Japanese on 22 September 1905 and renamed Hizen, after Hizen Province,Silverstone, p. 329 two days later. The ship departed Port Arthur on 19 November and arrived at Sasebo on 27 November where her repairs lasted until November 1908. Her fighting tops were removed, her light weapons were replaced by Japanese ones, and her boilers were replaced by Miyabara boilers. The barrels and breeches of her main guns were replaced by Japanese-built examples and all four above-water torpedo tubes were removed. In Japanese service her crew numbered 796 officers and crewmen.Lengerer, pp. 57‚Äì59 Hizen was assigned to the 1st Fleet on 1 December 1909Lengerer, p. 59 and was refitted in 1913. She was dispatched to Esquimalt, British Columbia, in October 1914 to reinforce the weak British squadron there, then diverted to Honolulu, Hawaii, before the end of the month to watch the German gunboat after that ship arrived on 15 October. Hizen watched the port in company with the armoured cruiser until Geier was interned on 8 November by the Americans. Afterwards she and Asama headed south in search of the German East Asia Squadron, but never located it; the ship was recalled home in February 1915. On 13 December 1915, Hizen was assigned to the 5th Division of the 3rd Fleet until relieved on 10 May 1917. The ship served in the Indian Ocean at some point during the war where she probably escorted troop convoys.McLaughlin 2008, p. 63 Hizen supported the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1918 and was often stationed in Vladivostok as a guardship. On 1 September 1921 she was reclassified as a 1st class coast defence ship and disarmed at Sasebo in April 1922 in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty. She was stricken from the official naval roll on 20 September 1923 and sunk as a target ship in the Bungo Channel on 25 July 1924.

As with the previous three games, the Japanese edition was released in two separate versions: and Later, Japan re- released these games in combo packs with a special colored version of the \\"Battle Chip Gate\\", or \\"Beast Link Gate\\". This special combo pack was called the Rockman EXE 6 Beast Link Gate DX Edition and contained a special Blue \\"Netto\\" version of the Beast Link Gate and one of the games' two versions. Battle Network 6 marks the end of the Game Boy Advance Battle Network series, as shown in the ending. Keiji Inafune has stated in an interview that EXE6 is indeed the final game in the series. It takes place months after Battle Network 5, and Lan's father has been moved to work in Cyber City, forcing Lan to move there as well. He learns of two ancient and dangerous Net creatures known as Cybeasts as well as the return of WWW who are trying to awaken the beasts. Lan must do whatever it takes to stop them and destroy the Cybeasts before they destroy the Net.  Story  Lan and his family have moved to Cyber City. However, WWW has returned and is causing trouble that not even the Official NetBattlers can control, so MegaMan decides to investigate. Here, MegaMan discovers that the Cybeasts Falzar and Gregar have something to do with a mysterious conspiracy. When a WWW Navi, Circusman, captures one of the Cybeasts, MegaMan captures the other Cybeast into his body. Lan and MegaMan must fight WWW and stop whatever they're up to. At first it seems that Baryl and Colonel were the culprits of the conspiracy, but later in the end he admits that he was working for Dr. Wily himself. Dr. Wily raised Baryl when his own father was off fighting in a war, and in his kindness for Baryl, he was distracted from his plans for revenge of the Net society. He also created Colonel, the \\"perfect navi\\" who had the ability to feel kindness and had powers of machine manipulation. However, once Baryl's father, his only true friend was killed in battle, Wily began to feel the past thoughts of revenge and modified Colonel to become a military grade Navi. The other programs were modified into a separate Navi named Iris. She was to be a military control Navi, until she met Lan, who showed her that humans were not bloodthirsty killers. As a precaution, Wily planted a program forbidding these Navis to merge by having them explode if they were ever to do so. To hatch his latest scheme to destroy the Net and the world, he built 2 enormous Copybots and installed the Gregar and Falzar Cybeasts in it, until Baryl decided what was truly right and began to battle one of the Cybeasts. MegaMan also began to battle the other Cybeast, until in a twist, the Cybeast took over MegaMan's body once again. Colonel and Iris began the risky merging, and with their heightened powers they destroyed the Cybeast from MegaMan's body. However, instead of separating, they planned to sacrifice themselves to destroy the Cybeasts once and for all. The future of the main characters are revealed: Chaud leads a group of worldwide officials, Mick became a teacher, Tab made his store a huge success, Dex became mayor of ACDC town, and Yai became president of her father's company. Also, Lan, now a scientist, is revealed to have married Mayl. They have a son named Patch. Finally, Megaman is revealed to be spending a lot of time in the real world via his copybot. Megaman used Iris's never-ending battery copy-bot, henceforth he was able to stay in the real world all he wanted.  Gameplay  There are many changes in gameplay in Battle Network 6. One of which is the chip-limiting system. It limits how many of the same chips the player can keep in a folder depending on its MB. Another one is a slight change in the Navi Customizer. Parts can be placed off the map, allowing the player to install more programs, but at the risk of having a bug. There are Link Navis can be controlled by the player, and have their own special chip, like MegaMan's allies in BN5. However, these Navis can go about the net freely like MegaMan, although their jack-in point is fixed. Link Navi Charged Shots and special chip damage can no longer upgrade themselves. Instead, they are buster-dependent, giving buster-improving chips some more use. Link Navis can also get rid of obstacles that obstruct MegaMan's path, allowing him to reap rewards like mystery data containing rare items, or allowing access to Net Navis with secret information. The Link Navis include HeatMan.EXE in the Gregar version, and AquaMan.EXE in the Falzar version. The main drawback to playing as another Navi however, is that they cannot use the Navi Customizer. Another new introduction is the Tag Chip System, which allows players to \\"tag\\" 2 chips together as long as the combined MB of the chips is 60 or lower. These chips will appear side by side in the Custom Screen when either one of them is drawn.Director of the Seaside Aquarium:Thank you very much for the other day. I didn't get the chance to thank you properly. So to say thanks, I wanted to send you something special! I call it the \\"TagChip system\\"! It is what it sounds like...it lets you tag up to 2 chips! For instance, you can tag Sword with AreaGrab. Then, when Sword appears on the Custom Screen during battle, so will AreaGrab! This lets you make combos even easier!.........However, the chips you can tag must add up to less than 60 MB. Remember this limit! (Mega Man Battle Network 6) Capcom Japan, 2006 This system has allowed players to access low-MB chip combos or Program Advances with ease. Chips chosen as tag chips cannot be set as regular chips. = Cross System = Succeeding the Soul Unison system, the Cross System is introduced in Battle Network 6. Although similar to the preceding system in Battle Network 4 and 5, Crosses can last for the entire duration of a battle without utilizing the three-turn limit and can be activated without a sacrificial chip. Upon finishing an ally Navi's mission and battle, MegaMan will gain the Navi Link to that particular Navi, thus enabling a Cross between MegaMan and the corresponding Navi. There are 5 Crosses per game, and each has an element with attributes to the linking Navi. However, if MegaMan is hit by an element that he is weak against, he will instantly take double damage and revert to his normal state. While in a Cross, MegaMan cannot achieve Full Synchro. = Beast Out = Beast Out is an additional gameplay element after MegaMan encounters one of two Cybeasts. This feature can be activated by pressing the \\"Beast Button\\" in the Custom Screen. The Beast Button is equivalent to selecting a chip. Like Soul Unison, Beast Out lasts three consecutive turns and \\"Emotion Points\\" can be recovered by avoiding usage of the power in later battles. Upon expiration, MegaMan will be in an exhausted state but can still activate Crosses. However, as a consequence, he cannot achieve Full Synchro. You cannot beast out or beast over when you use the cross system or use five chips in one turn. Beast Out also grants all neutral-element chips an additional 30 damage bonus. They can also be charged to launch a special attack against the nearest enemy. This attack is dependent on the form MegaMan has (i.e. the basic Gregar form is a slash where the Heat Beast is a flamethrower). Regardless of the cross, non-elemental (including sword, wind, etc.) chips are the only chips which can be charged. All chips, except those with no attack value or chips that cause the screen to dim, gain what has been called \\"Auto Target\\", where MegaMan attacks enemies at a very close range. He will move from his current location to the front of the targeted virus (the closest enemy) regardless of his location, and will initiate his attack. This effect lasts in all Beast Crosses, and will be removed when MegaMan becomes tired. Despite the similarities between the two Beast Outs, the two variations possess unique abilities and different buster attacks. In the Japanese version, Beast Out can also be activated by using a Beast Link Gate (a Japanese GBA accessory). When MegaMan's emotion points reach zero and the player Beasts Out, MegaMan will perform a desperation move called \\"Beast Over\\". He is placed into a berserked state but gains invincibility and uses chips automatically (similar to DarkInvis in the previous game). Once the Custom Gauge fills, Beast Over automatically ends. Upon expiration, MegaMan's Buster stats drop to one and his HP rapidly drains. He is also unable to utilize any remaining Crosses nor achieve Full Synchro. A new element, called \\"Cross Beast\\", occurs when MegaMan activates Beast Out while in a Cross or vice versa. In this state, the Cross will take the appearance and abilities of the corresponding Beast Out, as well as the attributes of the activated Cross. Cross Beast, much like a standard Beast Out, will deduct emotion points from MegaMan. It will also leave him exhausted, but will still allow him to activate other Crosses. =Others= Dark Chips have all but vanished, almost all of them having been destroyed in the ending of Battle Network 5. This means the previously \\"dark\\" chips returning in this game can be used with normal Megaman. However, owners of the Japanese version can still use Dark Chips via the Beast Link Gate accessory, and without the previous penalty of losing 1 Hit Point from their maximum Hit Points. In addition to this, you can link up to a player playing the opposite version of the game you have and compare megachip libraries. the opposite version navi megachips will appear as secret chips and upon obtaining all of the opposite version navi chips you will be awarded with the starred \\"s\\" icon on the title screen (note that this isn't necessary to fight your versions sp beast or affect game progress). Content removal Due to the low sales of the first two Boktai titles outside of Japan, Konami chose not to release Shin Bokura no Taiy≈ç for English localization. References to the series (including the secret \\"Immortal Area\\") were removed for the international versions of Battle Network 6. Additionally, Beast Link Gate functionality was removed. However, the GunSol chips along with the poster of Django the Solar Boy in Lan's room were left in. In the Japanese versions, players can transfer characters - that they had trained and leveled up on a separate LiNK PET_EX system - into their game to replace Rockman. This system allowed for dynamic adjustment of character statistics, as well as the ability to use characters that were normally non-playable. As with previous games, compatibility with the e+ Reader was also removed. Reception Battle Network 6 received mixed reviews with an average score of 65% for the Gregar version, and 63% for the Falzar version. Both versions of the game placed in the Media Create top ten best-selling games list in Japan during their release week. Cybeast Gregar placed at number three with 107,099 units sold, while Cybeast Falzar placed at number six with 65,560 units sold. The two versions of the game sold nearly half a million copies combined during its first month in the region and a total of 610,000 copies by the end of Capcom's 2005 fiscal year. The game achieved solid sales outside Japan. Both editions of the game were released to mixed reviews. The Falzar version currently holds averages scores of 63% on GameRankings and 63 out of 100 on Metacritic. The Gregar version holds scores of 65% and 62 out of 100 respectively. It was commented by Frank Provo of GameSpot that \\"longtime fans may be disappointed to discover that there's really nothing in Mega Man Battle Network 6 that wasn't in the previous games, but they'll likely feel compelled to finish this one anyway, since the story provides the payoff for events that have been building since the first game\\". Michael Knutson of GameZone commented that \\"the new customization aspects of the game are a nice addition to the game, but it doesn‚Äôt save the game from the overall 'been there-done that a million times' feeling\\". As with other games in the series, reviewers often criticized Battle Network 6 for recycling material from the game's predecessors with little or no improvement such as graphics and gameplay.

The owners of Lewis's have gone into administration many times over the years, including 1991. The first store, which opened in Liverpool city centre, became the flagship of the chain of stores operating under the Lewis's name. Several stores in the chain were bought in 1991 by the company Owen Owen and continued to operate under the Lewis's brand name for several years, but after the closure of the Manchester store in 2002, only the original Liverpool store continued to trade under the Lewis's name. This store was sold in 2007 to the Vergo Retail Ltd and closed in 2010. History The first Lewis's was opened in 1856 in Liverpool by entrepreneur David Lewis, as a men's and boys' clothing store, mostly manufacturing his own stock. In 1864, Lewis's branched out into women's clothing. In the 1870s, the store expanded and added departments, including shoes in 1874, and tobacco in 1879. Also in 1879, Lewis's opened one of the world's first 'Christmas grottoes' in Lewis's Bon March√©, Church Street, Liverpool. It was named 'Christmas Fairyland'. His motto was Friends of the People, and he intended the shopping experience to be inclusive. The first Lewis's outside Liverpool opened in nearby Manchester in 1877, and another, by personal suggestion from Joseph Chamberlain on his new Corporation Street in Birmingham in 1885. The Manchester store included a full scale ballroom on the fifth floor, which was also used for exhibitions. Buying offices were also located on the fifth floor until a takeover by Liverpool-based competitor Owen Owen (see below). A fourth store opened in Sheffield in 1884 but proved unprofitable and closed in 1888. Louis Cohen took over the business after Lewis's death, and oversaw a period of consolidation. After Louis Cohen's death, control passed to Harold and Rex Cohen, who took the company public in 1924. New stores were once again opened, in Glasgow (1929), Leeds (1932), Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent (1934) and Leicester (1936). Lewis's were generally among the largest department stores in their respective localities. In 1951, the Lewis's group purchased the famous London department store Selfridges and in 1965 became part of the Sears Group headed by Charles Clore. In 1966, the group launched Miss Selfridge fashions, which would later become a store chain in its own right. A branch was opened on Blackpool promenade, next to Blackpool Tower, in 1964 on the site of the Alhambra. The building had a distinctive 1960s design, with a turquoise tiled exterior. After it closed in 1993, building work was undertaken to remove some of the upper floors and the redeveloped site housed a Mecca bingo hall, with part of the ground floor space being subsequently occupied by Woolworths Group, now Poundland, Harry Ramsden's and a variety of smaller retail units. The company's Manchester store was one of several targets attacked by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on 27 January 1975. =Christmas grotto= The world's first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's in 1879, entitled 'Christmas Fairyland'. A staple of Liverpool's festive season, many generations first visited Father Christmas here, with the final displays covering over . Since Christmas 2010, the Lewis's grotto manager, display team and staff moved the Lewis's Christmas Grotto to the fourth floor of Rapid Hardware, in the former George Henry Lee (John Lewis) building. =Decline= The company went into administration in 1991 as a result of a combination of problems, including the recession and failing to compete effectively. This resulted in Liverpool competitor Owen Owen buying up several branches of Lewis's (but retaining the Lewis's brand name on those purchased stores). Sir Philip Green revived the selling of toys on a large scale, by launching the brand Kids HQ in four Lewis's Owen Owen stores, including those in Liverpool and Manchester. The Leicester branch traded independently for a short while, following a management buyout, as 'Lewis's of Leicester', before eventually closing. Other branches including the Birmingham store closed down. After the 1996 Manchester bombing by the IRA, trading space in Lewis's was rented to Marks & Spencer and other smaller retailers displaced following heavy damage to the Corn Exchange. Both Marks & Spencer and the small retailers moved into new accommodation in 1999. The store suffered from a smaller footfall thereafter, and attempted to fight back by reinventing itself as partially a 'discount retailer'. In a final attempt to arrest the decline, the remainder-clothing retailer TK Maxx was invited to trade from the basement floor. In 2002, the Manchester branch ceased trading; it is now occupied by a branch of Primark. The last store to trade as Lewis's was the Liverpool original. This followed the sale of other branches of Lewis's from Owen Owen to other operators such as Debenhams and Allders during the 1990s. On 28 February 2007, the Liverpool store went into liquidation. On 23 March 2007, it was sold as a going concern to Vergo Retail Ltd, enabling the store to continue to trade as Lewis's. In February 2010, it was announced that the store would close permanently in June 2010 as the lease could not be renewed. The final day of trading was 29 May 2010. Until closure, the building retained its original lifts which had no controls for shoppers, being controlled by a lift operator who worked from a fold-down seating platform next to a lever. Rebirth After Vergo Retail went into administration in 2010, the rights to the Lewis's name were bought by Lewis's Home Retail Ltd. They intended to open a home store in Bury later that year, and have since bought out six branches of TJ Hughes. Including the Liverpool branch, which was also the first branch of Owen Owen. They have also set up a website. However a planning application has been submitted to Bury Council confirming that the company do not wish to relaunch this classic brand and have decided to make this store a TJ Hughes instead. Lewis's Home Retail purchased seven Paul Simon Homeware stores in 2014. They have chosen to relaunch these stores under the Lewis's brand. This coincides with the launch of TJ Hughes 'Lewis's' branded homeware goods. The items are tagged 'Established 1856' referencing the historic store. Lewis's Home Retail Limited also owns Lewis's related brand names including 'Kids HQ' and 'Owen Owen'.

It continued to operate into the 1980s. =Lewis's Bank under Martins' ownership= Details of the nine year ownership 1958 - 1967 of Lewis's Bank by Martins Bank are published within Martins Bank Archive. Lewis's retained its name and operated as a separate entity to Martins throughout. In addition to a general history, the archive has separate pages which cover each of the ten branches of Lewis's in existence at that time, illustrated with stories and pictures from visits made to them by Martins Bank Magazine. Each branch page also has a gallery of some of the staff who worked there. There is also a page to which former Lewis's Bank staff from this period can see and share memories. Martins Bank Archive maintains a Lewis's Bank staff database covering the nine years, and family tree researchers can enquire about new entrants, transferred and/or promoted staff, marriages, retirements and deaths. Popular culture *The store gave rise to the well-known phrase \\"Standing there like one of Lewis's\\". As a popular meeting place for dating couples, 'standing like one of Lewis's' referred to being 'stood up'. It has also been described as being due to idle staff, the statues by Jacob Epstein (Liverpool Resurgent) at the Liverpool branch, and The Man of Fire at the Hanley branch, or the reputation of the Lewis's Arcade at the Manchester store (as popularised in the 1960 film: Hell is a City) *The 1990 claymation of Terry Pratchett's Truckers has short interior scenes shot at the Manchester branch of Lewis's, as appears in the credits. *In the 1989 episode of Red Dwarf \\"Marooned\\", Craig Charles' character Lister said that the girl he lost his virginity to (at Bootle Municipal Golf Course) was so good looking \\"If she wanted, then she could've got a job working behind the perfume counter at Lewis'. That's how gorgeous she was.\\" *The line \\"Meet under a statue exceedingly bare\\" in the chorus of the folk song \\"In my Liverpool Home\\" is a reference to the naked male statue \\"Liverpool Resurgent\\", by Jacob Epstein, on the outside of the Liverpool Lewis's building, standing over the main entrance portico. It referred to the custom of Liverpudlians who were planning to meet in town to agree to 'meet under the man'.

By definition, these chromosomes are not essential for the life of a species, and are lacking in some (usually most) of the individuals. Thus a population would consist of individuals with 0, 1, 2, 3 (etc.) B chromosomes. B chromosomes are distinct from marker chromosomes or additional copies of normal chromosomes as they occur in trisomies. Origin The evolutionary origin of supernumerary chromosomes is obscure, but presumably they must have been derived from heterochromatic segments of normal chromosomes in the remote past. In general \\"we may regard supernumeraries as a very special category of genetic polymorphism which, because of manifold types of accumulation mechanisms, does not obey the ordinary Mendelian laws of inheritance.\\" (White 1973 p173) Next generation sequencing has shown that the B chromosomes from rye are amalgamations of the rye A chromosomes. Similarly, B chromosomes of the cichlid fish Haplochromis latifasciatus also have been shown to arise from rearrangements of normal A chromosomes. Function Most B chromosomes are mainly or entirely heterochromatic (i.e. largely non-coding), but some contain sizeable euchromatic segments (E.g. such as the B chromosomes of maize). In some cases, B chromosomes act as selfish genetic elements. In other cases, B chromosomes provide some positive adaptive advantage. For instance, the British grasshopper Myrmeleotettix maculatus has two structural types of B chromosomes: metacentrics and submetacentrics. The supernumeraries, which have a satellite DNA, occur in warm, dry environments, and are scarce or absent in humid, cooler localities. There is evidence of deleterious effects of supernumeraries on pollen fertility, and favourable effects or associations with particular habitats are also known in a number of species. B chromosomes may play a positive role on normal A chromosomes in some circumstances. In wheat, an allopolyploid, the B chromosomes suppress homologous pairing which reduces multiple pairing between homologous chromosomes. Bivalent pairing is ensured by a gene on chromosome 5 of the B genome Ph locus. The B chromosomes also have the following effects on A chromosomes: *increases asymmetry chiasma distribution *increases crossing over and recombination frequencies: increases variation *cause increased unpaired chromosomes: infertility B chromosomes have tendency to accumulate in meiotic cell products resulting in an increase of B number over generations, thereby acting as selfish genetic elements. However this effect is counterbalanced for selection against infertility. In fungi Chromosome polymorphisms are very common among fungi. Different isolates of the same species often have a different chromosome number, with some of these additional chromosomes being unnecessary for normal growth in culture. The extra chromosomes are known as conditionally dispensable, or supernumerary, because they are dispensable for certain situations, but may confer a selective advantage under different environments. Supernumerary chromosomes do not carry genes that are necessary for basic fungal growth, but may have some functional significance. For example, it has been discovered that the supernumerary chromosome of the pea pathogen Haematonectria haematococca carries genes that are important to the disease-causing capacity of the fungus. This supernumerary DNA was found to code for a group of enzymes that metabolize toxins, known as phytoalexins, that are secreted by the plant's immune system. It is possible that these supernumerary elements originated in horizontal gene transfer events because sequence analysis often indicates that they have a different evolutionary history from essential chromosomal DNA. The wheat-infecting fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici contains 8 dispensable B-chromosomes - the largest number of dispensable chromosomes observed in fungi.

The first series was a 12-issue comic book limited series co-written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, often collectively referred to and interviewed as \\"DnA\\", penciled primarily by Oliver Coipel, with Pascal Alixe filling in for some issues, inked by Lanning and colored by Tom McCraw. The second series was created as part of DC's New 52 relaunch. Publication history The first \\"Legion Lost\\" series‚Äîalong with its companion series \\"Legion Worlds\\"‚Äîwas designed mainly as a \\"jump on\\" point for the Legion franchise. Per this, the series revolves around a set number of Legionnaires and each issue being told from the point of view of a particular Legionnaire. It is the third story in the Abnett and Lanning Legion series, following the events of \\"Legion of the Damned\\" and \\"Widening Rifts\\". It was followed by \\"Legion Worlds\\" and a brand new Legion series, titled \\"The Legion\\". The series ran for 12 issues in 2000 and 2001 and was collected in a hardcover collection series in 2011. In September, 2011, DC Comics launched a new monthly series (Legion Lost, vol. 2 Legion Lost in DC Comics official site). The series replaces \\"Adventure Comics\\" as the second Legion title published by DC Comics, as part of The New 52 and focuses on a small group of the original incarnation of Legion of the Super-Heroes (and Earth-247 Legionnaire Gates) as they are stranded in the present day 21st Century, having failed to stop a shape-shifting terrorist from Rimbor from infecting Earth with a deadly virus. The series follows the changing rules of time travel since the events of Flashpoint, where time travel is more difficult. The title's final issue, #16, was published in January 2013. Volume 1 =Plot= Following the destruction of the Legion Outpost base by a tear in the fabric of space, Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5.1, Chameleon, Umbra, Kid Quantum, Live Wire, Apparition, and Monstress find themselves lost on the far side of the universe.Legion of the Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #125 (March 2000) They are discovered by Shikari, a half-bug/half-humanoid alien whose people are being hunted by an alien race known as \\"The Progeny\\". Later on, the group is also joined by their teammate \\"ERG-1\\" (who soon takes the name Wildfire after Shikari mistakenly calls him that), who had been sucked into the rift prior to the other Legionnaires; with Shikari and her tracking power acting as their guide, they start looking for ways home.Legion Lost (vol. 1) #1 (May 2000)Legion Lost (vol. 1) #3 (July 2000) As they cross the galaxy, the Legion discover that the Progeny have been actively slaughtering entire species in genocide inspired by their radical belief that they are the \\"perfect\\" life form.Legion Lost (vol. 1) #2 (June 2000) They also encounter a mysterious super-hero known as Singularity and a creature known as the Omniphagos, a world destroying monster imprisoned in a \\"hard light\\" pyramid. The creature's prison possesses cosmic teleportation capabilities that the Legion attempt to use to return home.Legion Lost (vol. 1) #5 (September 2000)Legion Lost (vol. 1) #6 (October 2000) Meanwhile, tensions flare up between the various Legion members: Umbra struggles from her previous possession at the hands of \\"The Blight\\",Legion Lost (vol. 1) #4 (August 2000) Monstress struggles to abide by the Legion's \\"no killing\\" rule when faced with the Progeny's atrocities, and Ultra Boy rages over being stranded millions of light years away from his other friends and family. These problems come to a head when it is revealed that Saturn Girl has been repeatedly \\"manipulating\\" the team's minds with her psychic powers. While she claims she was trying to keep the team level headed and calm, the revelation that Apparition was merely a psychic illusion designed to pacify Ultra Boy turn the group against Saturn Girl. Saturn Girl's actions are discovered after she forces herself into Umbra's head and unknowingly creates two psychic entities: one representing the totality of Umbra's darkest fears and one that represents Saturn Girl's own psyche run amuck. Both entities are defeated and Saturn Girl is ultimately forgiven.Legion Lost (vol. 1) #8‚Äì9 (December 2000 ‚Äì January 2001) During the course of the series, two additional mysteries haunt the Legion: the fate of Element Lad (who went through the rift along with his teammates but ultimately vanished after placing them in crystals designed to protect them while traveling through the rift and the identity of \\"The Progenitor\\", the supreme leader of the murderous \\"Progeny\\".Legion Lost (vol. 1) #7 (November 2000)Legion Lost (vol. 1) #10 (February 2001) In the end, the Legion are captured and taken to the Progenitor, who is revealed to be an insane Element Lad. Element Lad explains that in trying to save the team as they came through the rift, he was cast back to the beginning of time, and that he has now lived for over a billion years. To (unsuccessfully) try and stay sane during those eons, Element Lad used his powers to create life forms, culminating in him believing himself \\"God\\" and his creation the Progeny, his most perfect creation.Legion Lost (vol. 1) #11 (March 2001) Realizing that their friend is insane, they confront him, during which he murders Monstress after she acknowledges that she is not one of his creations. A battle erupts and the Legion eventually escape by way of a dimensional gateway Element Lad possesses‚Äîthe hard light pyramid they had discovered earlier. As they escape, Element Lad merges with the Omniphagos and attack the Legion's ship. In order to stop the now-combined Element Lad/Omniphagos from killing his friends before they can escape back to their section of the universe, acting leader Live Wire abandons the ship and kills the monster by giving it a stroke. As he is consumed in the blast that kills his former friend and teammate, Live Wire watches his friends return home as the portal closes behind them.Legion Lost (vol. 1) #12 (April 2001) Each issue of Legion Lost (vol. 1) was narrated by a particular Legionnaire: #1 Shikari, #2 Monstress, #3 Kid Quantum, #4 Apparition, #5 Brainiac 5, #6 Umbra, #7 Ultra Boy, #8 Chameleon, #9 Saturn Girl, #10 Wildfire, #11 Element Lad, #12 Live Wire. This was largely done to help new fans get to know the Legionnaires better. This gimmick would be repeated with the follow-up miniseries Legion Worlds. =Aftermath= Fall-out from the events of Legion Lost would be felt in The Legion #30‚Äì33, Abnett and Lanning's final four issues on the series. Singularity would rally the entire galaxy against the remaining members of the Progeny, who would find themselves hunted by their former victims and systematically wiped out by them. The surviving members of the species would find a shocking ally though Live Wire, who ended up merging with a dying Element Lad, transforming him into a crystallized entity. Live Wire contacted the Legion, who convinced Singularity to spare the Progeny and stop the cycle of violence. Ultimately with help from the original Legion and the Earth Prime Legion, Live Wire would have his face and body restored during the events of \\"Legion of Three Worlds\\". Volume 2 / The New 52 The second series, as part of The New 52, depicts seven Legionnaires (Chameleon Girl, Dawnstar, Gates, Timber Wolf, Tellus, Tyroc and Wildfire) from the Post-Infinite Crisis \\"Retroboot\\" Legion trapped in the twenty-first century pursuing a villain who released a pathogen. The series was cancelled with issue #16. When the team arrives in the 21st century, their technology such as the Time Bubble and Flight Rings do not work as intended. They had been chasing Alastor, who has released the Hypertaxis pathogen on Earth in the present time. Timber Wolf quickly apprehends Alastor, who had just destroyed a small town; however as the team attempts to return to their own time, their Time Bubble malfunctions due to Alastor transforming from the pathogen. Gates attempts to teleport himself and Alastor away, but in the chaos, Chameleon Girl gets teleported with them. They are thought dead by the other Legionnaires.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #1 (November 2011) During a town memorial service for those killed in Alastor's attack, the Legion confront a doctor who had been exposed to the pathogen. Turned into living energy, much like Wildfire; he decides that he doesn't want to be human, and disperses himself.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #2 (December 2011) Tellus telepathically searches the world for people infected by the pathogen, when they hear a news report of an attack from a marrow-sucking creature. Timber Wolf gets a scent from a victim's body, after having broken into a forensics lab, noting Durlan DNA on the body. Timber Wolf then interrupts a fight between two creatures exposed to the pathogen. One of the creatures is revealed to be an infected Chameleon Girl.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #3 (January 2012) While attempting to contain Chameleon Girl; Wildfire, Tyroc, and Timber Wolf are ambushed by the Black Razors. Meanwhile, Tellus and Dawnstar locate Alastor and try to reason with him.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #4 (February 2012) After Tyroc incapacitates the Black Razors, they go ahead to help the others with Alastor. Tellus defeats Alastor with a telepathic assault. Gates returns, although half of his body is scarred.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #5 (March 2012) Timber Wolf and an unconscious, transformed Chameleon Girl are confronted by Martian Manhunter, who renders Timber Wolf unconscious, letting the military agents arrest them. The others attempt to break into the military installation, to save their friends. Manhunter helps the team and heals Chameleon Girl, once he realizes they are heroes from the future.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #6 (April 2012) The team relocates to New York City, where Timber Wolf steals money from a drug gang.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #7 (May 2012) Harvest tasks a team of Ravagers to subdue the members of the Legion, and bring them. The individual members of the team are attacked and defeated by:Rose Wilson, Psykill, Misbelief, Windstorm, Ridge, Hammerfist, and Crush.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #8 (June 2012) In \\"The Culling\\", they are dropped into battle with the Teen Titans; initially they believe each other to be enemies, but they end up teaming up to escape Harvest, who uses technology from the Legion's time.Teen Titans Annual #1 (July 2012) The team recognizes Bart Allen, who is apparently a criminal in the future.Superboy #9 (July 2012) Chameleon Girl is revealed to be an agent of Echo, a branch of the Science Police, with a secret mission in the present. Tellus is revealed to know the Hypertaxis pathogen would essentially become inert in the present time. Harvest also claims that he had manipulated the Legion into sending them back in time.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #9 (July 2012) After fighting with Harvest, the team finds a Time Bubble which they use to travel back to the future.Teen Titans #9 (July 2012) Back in the future, the Legion finds a world in ruins and learn that their fellow Legionnaires have given them up for dead.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #10 (August 2012), Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 7) #16 (March 2013) They are forced to return to the past; where a military task force, led by Metamerican is waiting to apprehend them in New York City.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #10 (August 2012) Wildfire's containment suit is damaged, and his life force energy is dissipating. Wildfire is ambushed by Metamerican and his forces. He is rushed to a hospital after recovering from wounds, when he tells Gates about his past dealings with Echo. Metamerican next attacks and captures Tyroc and Chameleon Girl.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #11 (September 2012) Dawnstar and Tellus continue to track down Alastor, who know has the ability to pass his consciousness into others and control them. Tellus, controlled by Alastor, attacks the squad that had captured Tyroc and Chameleon Girl, before he passes his consciousness among various soldiers and Legionnaires in the area. After Wildfire contains and releases Alastor's life force into the sun, Metamerican realizes that the Legion is not his enemy.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #12 (September 2012) In Legion Lost (vol. 2) #0 (November 2012), Timber Wolf's origin and connection to Echo is depicted. Starting with Legion Lost (vol. 2) #13 (December 2012), the true intent and reason behind the team is told. In the 31st century, Chameleon Girl is an agent of Echo, tasked with finding a traitor in the past. Captain Nathaniel Adym tells her of various prophecies and ancient findings; Tyroc dying a millennium before he was born, Wildfire's faceplate found in the Arizona desert and Gates' disregard for authority, along with his conspiracy theories. In the 21st century, The Legion relocates to New Orleans. Tellus feels \\"the death cry of billions...across the universe\\". The threat is revealed to be Lord Daggor, with his dragon Thraxx. Responding to a beacon, the Legion finds a member of the Science Police, Nathaniel Adym has come to the present to assign a new mission to the team.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #13 (December 2012) In the same moment, Wildfire crashes down from the sky and the team is attacked by Daggor, who plants a world-killer machine. Lacking firepower, Adym sends a distress signal to Echo agent Jocelyn Lure, who arrives with Superboy, Caitlin Fairchild, and Ridge. Harvest and his henchmen arrive to fight Daggor; as well as activating a hypnotic trigger on Superboy, making him go out of control.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #14 (January 2013) Psykill and Wildfire attack Daggor directly; where Wildfire's containment suit explodes, releasing his energy everywhere. Adym plans to use his Time Bubble to travel back an hour and set off a bomb, which would destroy half of the continent but stop Daggor's machine and save the future. His subordinates Lure and Chameleon Girl refuse to help him.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #15 (February 2013) Gates teleports to himself from the past, revealing how he received his scars. Together, the two Gates create a plan that would send Daggor, Thrax, and Adym's bomb into a distant sun. Harvest escapes, but not before returning Wildfire's original, undamaged suit.Legion Lost (vol. 2) #16 (March 2013) =Aftermath= The Legion Lost team remained stranded in the 21st century until they were called by Brainiac 5 to help a team of Legionnaires who had traveled back in time from the 31st century to battle Infinitus in the six issue \\"Infinitus Saga\\" in Justice League United written by Jeff Lemire.

Ten songs set for soprano or baritone and orchestra were first published by Mahler as a cycle in 1905,Kurt Blaukopf: Gustav Mahler - Page 264 - 1985 on original texts and on words from Des Knaben Wunderhorn. Pages 60-64, I05, 119 Twelve Songs from Des Knaben Wunderhorn (1892-95). Pages 105-9 Ten songs were published by Mahler in 1905 in the form of a cycle. but in total 12 orchestral songs exist,Donald Mitchell - 1980 \\"We have come to think of the Wunderhorn songs as a collection of ten rather than twelve songs ‚Äî i.e. excluding the two excerpts from the symphonies\\" and a similar number of songs for voice and piano. History of composition Mahler's self-composed text for the first of his Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen ('Songs of a Travelling Journeyman', regularly translated as 'Songs of a Wayfarer'; 1884‚Äì1885) is clearly based on the Wunderhorn poem 'Wenn mein Schatz'; his first genuine settings of Wunderhorn texts, however, are found in the Lieder und Ges√§nge ('Songs and Airs'), published in 1892 and later renamed by the publisher as Lieder und Ges√§nge aus der Jugendzeit ('Songs and Airs from Days of Youth'). The nine Wunderhorn settings therein were composed between 1887 and 1890, and occupied the second and third volumes of this three-volume collection of songs for voice and piano. The titles of these nine songs (different in many cases from the titles of the original poems) are as follows: Volume II: # \\"Um schlimme Kinder artig zu machen\\" ‚Äì To Teach Naughty Children to be Good # \\"Ich ging mit Lust durch einen gr√ºnen Wald\\" ‚Äì I Went Happily Through a Green Wood # \\"Aus! Aus!\\" ‚Äì Finished! Finished! # \\"Starke Einbildungskraft\\" ‚Äì Strong Imagination Volume III: # \\"Zu Strassburg auf der Schanz\\" ‚Äì On the Ramparts of Strassburg # \\"Abl√∂sung im Sommer\\" ‚Äì The Changing of the Guard in Summer # \\"Scheiden und Meiden\\" ‚Äì Farewell and Forgo # \\"Nicht wiedersehen!\\" ‚Äì Never to Meet Again # \\"Selbstgef√ºhl\\" ‚Äì Self-assurance Mahler began work on his next group of Wunderhorn settings in 1892. A collection of 12 of these was published in 1899, under the title Humoresken ('Humoresques'), and formed the basis of what is now known simply (and somewhat confusingly) as Mahler's 'Songs from \\"Des Knaben Wunderhorn\\"'. Whereas the songs in the Lieder und Ges√§nge collection were conceived for voice and piano, with no orchestral versions being produced by the composer, the Humoresken were conceived from the beginning as being for voice and orchestra, even though Mahler's first step was the production of playable and publishable voice-and-piano versions. The titles in this 1899 collection are: # \\"Der Schildwache Nachtlied\\" ‚Äì The Sentinel's Nightsong (January/February 1892) # \\"Verlor'ne M√ºh\\" ‚Äì Labour Lost (February 1892) # \\"Trost im Ungl√ºck\\" ‚Äì Solace in Misfortune (April 1892) # \\"Wer hat dies Liedlein erdacht?\\" ‚Äì Who Thought up this Song? (April 1892) # \\"Das irdische Leben\\" ‚Äì The Earthly Life (after April 1892) # \\"Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt\\" ‚Äì St. Anthony of Padua's Sermon to the Fish (July/August 1893) # \\"Rheinlegendchen\\" ‚Äì Little Rhine Legend (August 1893) # \\"Lied des Verfolgten im Turm\\" ‚Äì Song of the Persecuted in the Tower (July 1898), see: Die Gedanken sind frei # \\"Wo die sch√∂nen Trompeten blasen\\" ‚Äì Where the Fair Trumpets Sound (July 1898) # \\"Lob des hohen Verstandes\\" ‚Äì Praise of Lofty Intellect (June 1896) # \\"Es sungen drei Engel\\" ‚Äì Three Angels sang a sweet air (1895) # \\"Urlicht\\" ‚Äì Primeval Light (1893) 'Urlicht' (composed ?1892, orch. July 1893) was rapidly incorporated (with expanded orchestration) into the 2nd Symphony (1888-1894) as the work's fourth movement; 'Es sungen drei Engel', by contrast, was specifically composed as part of the 3rd Symphony (1893-1896): requiring a boys' chorus and a women's chorus in addition to an alto soloist, it is the only song among the twelve for which Mahler did not produce a voice- and-orchestra version and the only one which he did not first publish separately. (Other songs found themselves serving symphonic ends in other ways: a voiceless version of \\"Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt\\" forms the basis of the Scherzo in the 2nd Symphony, and \\"Abl√∂sung im Sommer\\" is adopted in the same way by the 3rd.) An additional setting from this period was \\"Das himmlische Leben\\" ('The Heavenly Life'), of February 1892 (orch. March 1892). By the year of the collection's publication (1899) this song had been re- orchestrated and earmarked as the finale of the 4th Symphony (1899-1900), and thus was not published as part of the Des Knaben Wunderhorn collection, nor was it made available in a voice-and-piano version. After 1901, 'Urlicht' and 'Es sungen drei Engel' were removed from the collection, and replaced in later editions by two other songs, thus restoring the total number of songs in the set to twelve. The two new songs were: : \\"Revelge\\" ‚Äì Reveille (July 1899) : \\"Der Tamboursg'sell\\" ‚Äì The Drummer Boy (August 1901) Shortly after Mahler's death, the publisher (Universal Edition) replaced Mahler's own piano versions of the Wunderhorn songs by piano reductions of the orchestral versions, thus obscuring the differences in Mahler's writing for the two media. In spite of this, voice-and-piano performances, especially of the 'lighter' songs, are frequent. The original piano versions were re-published in 1993 as part of the critical edition, edited by and Thomas Hampson. Arrangement for chamber ensemble In 2012, Ensemble Mini commissioned (as part of its \\"mini-Mahler series\\") composer/arranger Klaus Simon to transcribe the songs for a chamber ensemble of 16 musicians, the premiere of which was performed at Berliner Philharmonie on 20 June 2012. It is also published by Universal Edition. Other composers Poems from the same collection have also been set as Lieder by several composers, including Mendelssohn, Schumann, Loewe, Brahms, Schoenberg, Webern, and Zemlinsky.

It was announced on July 7, 2005 and the specification for which was released on March 26, 2008. Rambus has designed XDR2 as an evolution of, and the successor to, XDR DRAM. XDR2 DRAM is intended for use in high-end graphics cards and networking equipment. As a fabless semiconductor company, Rambus only produces a design; it must make deals with memory manufacturers to produce XDR2 DRAM chips, and there has been a notable lack of interest in doing so. Changes from XDR DRAM =Signaling= In addition to a higher clock rate (up to 800 MHz), the XDR2 differential data lines transfer data at 16 times the system clock rate, transferring 16 bits per pin per clock cycle. This \\"Hexadecimal Data Rate\\" is twice XDR's 8√ó multiplier. The basic burst size has also doubled. Unlike XDR, memory commands are also transmitted over differential point-to-point links at this high data rate. The command bus varies between 1 and 4 bits wide. Even though each bit requires 2 wires, this is still less than the 12-wire XDR request bus, but it must grow with the number of chips addressed. =Micro-threading= There is a basic limit to how frequently data can be fetched from the currently open row. This is typically 200 MHz for standard SDRAM and 400‚Äì600 MHz for high-performance graphics memory. Increasing interface speeds require fetching larger blocks of data in order to keep the interface busy without violating the internal DRAM frequency limit. At 16√ó800 MHz, to stay within a 400 MHz column access rate would require a 32-bit burst transfer. Multiplied by a 32-bit wide chip, this is a minimum fetch of 128 bytes, inconveniently large for many applications. Typical memory chips are internally divided into 4 quadrants, with left and right halves connected to different halves of the data bus, and top or bottom halves being selected by bank number. (Thus, in a typical 8-bank DRAM, there would be 4 half-banks per quadrant.) XDR2 permits independently addressing each quadrant, so the two halves of the data bus can fetch data from different banks. Additionally, the data fetched from each half-bank is only half of what is needed to keep the data bus full; accesses to an upper half-bank must be alternated with access to a lower half-bank. This effectively doubles the number of banks and reduces the minimum data access size by a factor of 4, albeit with the limitation that accesses must be spread uniformly across all 4 quadrants.

Native to Eurasia and the British Isles, the plant and its subspecies are common perennial weeds. It has green arrowhead-shaped leaves and red-tinted deeply ridged stems, and it sprouts from an aggressive and spreading rhizome. The flowers emerge from a tall, upright stem. Female flowers are maroon in color. Description A perennial herb that has a slender and reddish upright stem that is branched at the top, reaching a height of 18 inches (0.5 meters). The arrow-shaped leaves are small, slightly longer than 1 inch (3 cm), and smooth with a pair of horizontal lobes at the base. It blooms during March to November, when yellowish-green (male) or reddish (female) flowers develop on separate plants at the apex of the stem, which develop into the red fruits (achenes). Distribution and habitat Native to Eurasia and the British Isles, Rumex acetosella has been introduced to most of the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. It is commonly found on acidic, sandy soils in heaths and grassland. It is often one of the first species to take hold in disturbed areas, such as abandoned mining sites, especially if the soil is acidic. Livestock will graze on the plant, but it is not very nutritious and is toxic in large amounts because of oxalates. The American copper or small copper butterfly depends on it for food, although its larvae can consume some related plants. Rumex acetosella is widely considered to be a hard-to-control noxious weed due to its spreading rhizome. Blueberry farmers are familiar with the weed because it thrives in the same conditions under which blueberries are cultivated. Uses The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked. There are several uses of sheep sorrel in the preparation of food including a garnish, a tart flavoring agent, a salad green, and a curdling agent for milk in cheese-making. The leaves have a lemony, tangy or rhubarb- like tart flavor. It is also known as sheep shower in parts of the country. Ground-feeding songbirds eat the seeds, and larger animals like rabbits and deer browse the greens.

Jack Jones was converted to socialism by reading The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists by Robert Tressell, and he later explained how the book \\"was passed from hand to hand among people in the Labour movement and had a remarkable effect on our thinking\\". He became a member of the Transport and General Workers Union, and was elected shop steward, then a delegate on the National Docks Group Committee. Spanish Civil War Strongly opposed to the British Union of Fascists and their leader Oswald Mosley, Jones organised protest-meetings against the fascists in Liverpool, and was beaten up by a group of Blackshirts armed with knuckle-dusters. A member of the Territorial Army since 1934 (he was promoted to bombardier in the Royal Artillery), in 1936 at the start of the Spanish Civil War, Jones joined and served with the British Battalion of the XV International Brigade as the political commissar of the Major Attlee Company, and was seriously wounded at the Battle of the Ebro in 1938. Second World War On his return to Britain, Jones became a full-time official of the TGWU in Coventry. Jones played a key role in organising the workforce of the West Midlands motor industry in the postwar period as Regional Secretary of the TGWU. He was a strong supporter of the shop steward movement aimed at promoting trade union and industrial democracy. He was an early supporter of the Institute for Workers' Control. While Assistant General Secretary of the union and a member of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, he chaired the Labour Party policy group on Industrial Democracy. General Secretary of the Union Jones was elected General Secretary of the TGWU in 1968. Together with Hugh Scanlon, President of the Amalgamated Engineering Union he led the left-wing trade union opposition (associated with Broad LeftLegacy of Jack Jones 1913‚Äì2009 Fifth International. Retrieved 28 July 2009.) to the 1966‚Äì70 Labour Government's prices and incomes policy, and the efforts of that government to introduce legislation that would have enforced a 28-day cooling off period before strike action could be taken. In 1969 Home Secretary James Callaghan requested action that would hinder Jones' career, which was raised in cabinet, and further discussed with Secretary of State for Employment Barbara Castle. A plan for detrimental leaks to the media was placed in the Foreign Office propaganda Information Research Department, and its head prepared a briefing paper. However information about how this was effected has not been released under the thirty-year rule under a section of the Public Records Act permitting national security exemptions. While general secretary, he was chief economic spokesman for the Trades Union Congress and one of the authors of the Social Contract. Jones was also instrumental in the creation of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) in 1975, and was a member of the National Economic Development Council from 1969 to 1978. Jones campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC in the 1975 referendum.Butler, David and Kitzinger, Uwe (1976) The 1975 Referendum. London: Macmillan; p. 232. In January 1977 a Gallup opinion poll found that 54% of people believed that Jones was the most powerful person in Britain, ahead of the Prime Minister, and is held responsible by some in the Labour Party for being \\"the union leader that created the Winter of Discontent and 18 years of Tory rule\\",Patrick Wintour, 'Is this the week that Labour lost the next election?', The Guardian (31 January 2009). despite the fact that he had retired from the leadership of the TGWU in 1978, the year before the Winter of Discontent. According to KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky, Jones provided intelligence to the Soviet Union in return for money. This was denied by Jones, who described the allegations as a \\"slur and an outrage\\". It was later claimed that he had in fact been working for British intelligence, informing MI5 when Russians approached him. In the authorised history of MI5 The Defence of the Realm, the author Christopher Andrew, using Gordievsky as his source, claimed that Jones passed Labour Party documents to the Soviets for cash, with the last payments to Jones occurring in 1984.\\"Jack Jones 'worked for KGB' claim\\", BBC News, 5 October 2009. Gordievsky is also cited by Ben MacIntyre as stating that the KGB paid Jones for intelligence in his 2018 book \\"The Spy and The Traitor\\" [ Publisher: Signal (Canada) Viking (UK) Crown (US0 2108]. Jones also had a special relationship with and helped promote the interests of Gibraltarian workers, as well as the British Overseas Territory itself, through the auspices of the TGWU. Retirement Jack Jones House, Liverpool In retirement from the T&G;, Jones served as the President of the National Pensioners Convention, an umbrella organisation representing over 1,000 local, regional and national pensioners' groups, of which he was Honorary Life President. He was also President of the International Brigade Memorial Trust. Jones' last public act was to unveil a memorial at Newhaven Fort on 7 December 2008, 70 years after British Battalion members returned to the port after the International Brigades were withdrawn from Spain. Jones was nominated for the position of Chancellor of the University of London, but lost the election to Princess Anne in 1981. After writing his autobiography, Union Man (published in 1986), Jones became a campaigner on behalf of pensioners. At the Labour Party conference in Bournemouth in October 2003, aged 90, he received a special award in recognition of his service to the trade union movement. The TGWU building Transport House in Liverpool was refurbished by Unite (the trade union formed from the merger of the TGWU and Amicus) and renamed Jack Jones House in 2009.NorthWest Regional Development Agency Unite gives Transport House new lease of life , nwda.co.uk; accessed 4 October 2017.

He was survived by his two sons. His wife of more than 50 years, Evelyn (n√©e Taylor) had died three years earlier. She had first been married to the communist trade union organiser and close friend of Jones, George Brown but he had been killed in the Battle of Brunete in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War.

It is north-west of Wolverhampton city centre, within the Tettenhall Regis ward. Aldersley is a relatively modern part of Wolverhampton, with most of the housing stock ‚Äì both private and council ‚Äì dating from after World War II. The Smestow Valley Leisure Ride starts from there and the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal passes through the area. It is famous for the Aldersley Stadium ‚Äì home of the Wolverhampton & Bilston Athletics Club and Wolverhampton Wheelers Cycling Club, who use its 450-metre tarmac banked velodrome. History The name 'Aldersley' is said by toponymists to come from 'Alor' - Old English for Alder as in Alder Tree, and 'lƒìah' - a woodland clearing, the name likely meaning a clearing in the Alder wood or woodland clearing where there are Alders.William Horovitz's 'The Place Names Of Staffordshire'. On the grounds of Aldersley Leisure Village, many Alder trees grow today, though it is not known if they are descendants of those that gave their name to the place. Aldersley bridge & building remainsHistorically, Aldersley was a rural area consisting of the odd farm or house. The coming of the canals changed things somewhat, with Aldersley housing a major canal junction - that of the Birmingham Mainline Canal and the Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal. A small hamlet was built at this junction for the people who operated it - with lock keepers cottages, a tollkeepers house and so on. Today, only the cellars and some brickwork remain of these historic buildings after they were demolished during the 1960s. Nearby stood Aldersley farm, close to the current driveway into Aldersley stadium on the Aldersley Road, with Blakeley Green House just a quarter of a mile north along the Aldersley Road. The next change to the landscape of the area came with the railways, the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line passing along the northern edge of Aldersley, with the Wombourne Branch Line running off this south, through Aldersley and onto Tettenhall, and eventually Wombourne and Stourbridge. During the mid 20th Century, post World War II, extensive housing was built in Aldersley and neighbouring Claregate. Aldersley Stadium was also developed in the 1950s on land that previously belonged to Aldersley Farm. In the late 1990s, the stadium was rebuilt, and renamed 'Aldersley Leisure Village'. Today Today Aldersley is most known for its modern Leisure Village. Aldersley Leisure Village has astroturf football and hockey pitches, the National Indoor Shooting venue, a banked 458 m velodrome for cyclists as well as an athletics track, sports hall and gym. Wolverhampton Wanderers academy also have a 'dome' with an indoor pitch on the Leisure Village grounds. In 2018 the Leisure Village will play host to the 2018 Grand Slam of Darts, as well as other events whilst the Wolverhampton Civic Hall is refurbished.

It is north west of Wolverhampton city centre, within the Tettenhall Regis ward. History As a distinct residential area, Claregate has only existed since the pre and post war housing estate was built between the Codsall and Aldersley roads. It is bounded on the north east side by the rail line from Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury, on the south east side by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and on the west side by the ridge that rises up to Tettenhall village. The origins of the name are unknown, though a 13th-century source names a place called 'Clare' in the area.

The area is majority housing, with shopping areas, pubs and a school. The area also forms part of the route of the Wolverhampton Marathon. =Amenities= The focal point of the area is the traffic island between Codsall Road, Pendeford Avenue, Blackburn Avenue and Knights Avenue. Here, a cluster of businesses are located including an Esso Filling Station (formerly BP, Murco and Jet before that) - and originally named Claregate Garage, Evergreen Hairdressers, Esha's Boutique, Greedy Pig sandwich shop and Cut 'N' Dry barbers. There are also shopping parades at the junction of Green Lane and Blakeley Avenue with a Premier convenience store, the Sunrise Chinese take-away and a children's nursery amongst other businesses, and Tettenhall Hardware, a Co-operative Food store, the Roma Wines off-licence and two fish and chip take-aways are situated on Pendeford Avenue at its junction with Green Lane. =Education= Claregate has one school, Claregate Primary School, situated on Chester Avenue. =Claregate Playing Fields= Claregate has a large playing field that is used for cricket and football, as well as hosting tennis courts and a children's playground. In June 2013, the park was saved for future generations when it was unveiled as one of six Wolverhampton parks to be designated a Queen Elizabeth II Field. Adjacent to the playing fields is Claregate Pavilion. It provides changing room facilities to clubs which use the playing fields. It is also home to Sugar n Spice, an activity group for girls aged over nine years. Sugar n Spice was founded in 1975. =Public houses= Claregate has two long established pubs, the first formerly called 'The Fieldhouse', but now sharing the area's name, 'The Claregate', on Codsall Road. The other is The Pilot, situated on Green Lane. In 2012, Marston's Brewery announced plans to construct a mini Tesco supermarket on land that currently forms part of The Claregate pub's car park. The scheme faced opposition from a local campaign group called Residents Against Marston's Proposals (RAMP), but was approved in November 2012 on the condition that the store close at 10pm (although currently (2018) opens 7am to 11pm), and a pedestrian crossing be installed on Codsall Road. =Micropub= Hail to the Ale micropub, Claregate, Wolverhampton (January 2014)The first micropub in the West Midlands resides in the centre of Claregate alongside the traffic island at Pendeford Avenue.

Str√§ng grew up in a working-class family in L√∂vsta, today a part of Stockholm Municipality. After finishing school he started to work as a gardener. In 1927 he joined the local branch of the garderners' union and was soon elected to the board as secretary. A few years later, in 1932, he was elected as an official to the national union organisation for agricultural workers, with the task of recruiting new members in order to force the employers to consent to collective bargaining. In 1938, he was elected vice chairman of the trade union and the following year he succeeded the chairman. Through the Swedish Trade Union Confederation Str√§ng was appointed as a representative on various state committees, and on 6 July 1945 Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson offered him to be Minister for Agriculture. Str√§ng turned him down, but a few days later he accepted to be a member of the cabinet, although not with the title of minister. In 1947 Str√§ng was made \\"Conservation Minister\\" () and implemented harsh measures, such as petroleum rationing. The following year he accepted to be Minister for Agriculture, and in 1951 he became Minister for Social Affairs. During this period, health insurance was made mandatory through a state system. On 12 September 1955 Gunnar Str√§ng was made Minister for Finance. One of the major reforms during his time in office was the introduction of value added tax. The joint taxation of spouses was abolished, a change that made it more economically attractive for women to seek paid employment. The Social Democrats, together with the Centre Party also engineered the Swedish newspaper subsidy system, created to support the smaller newspapers in a region in order to prevent \\"newspaper death\\" and preserve multitude. When the Social Democrats did poorly in the 1956 elections, party leader Tage Erlander offered to step down and Str√§ng was offered to take over the leadership - but refused. He remained Minister for Finance until the Social Democrats lost power to the centre-right in the 1976 elections. Gunnar Str√§ng was generally regarded as economically prudent. He was known for wearing \\"both suspenders and a belt\\", also a striking symbol of his careful general attitude. He was also known to have a photographic memory and was able to quote the figures from the national budget by heart in his annual presentations on television and made this dull subject something of a popular event. For the Swedish people he was very highly respected as an trustworthy national householder (rikshush√•llare) of the Swedish economy. His powerful position both inside and outside of the Cabinet, led to his subordinate staff inside the Finance Ministry giving him the nickname \\"Gustav Vasa\\".

He was known as Jimmy to some and Swinny to others. He signed some of his early cartoons Swin, and on one ephemeral comic strip he used Guilford as his signature. Experimenting with narrative continuity, he played a key role in the development of the comic strip at the end of the 19th century.Jimmy Swinnerton at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on March 9, 2015. Cartoons Jimmy Swinnerton's birthplace is a matter of dispute, with one gallery-owner giving Eureka, California, and another writing, Jimmy Swinnerton's Little Jimmy (1912) The son of Judge J. W. Swinnerton, Jimmy was 14 when he entered the San Francisco School of Design, where the painter Emil Carlsen was one of his instructors. He was still a teenager when he became a staff cartoonist for Hearst's San Francisco Examiner in 1892. One of his first assignments was to produce for the children's section of the newspaper a weekly cartoon, successively titled California Bears, The Little Bears and Little Bears and Tykes. Some comic art historians have called the Little Bears the first comic strip, preceding The Yellow Kid by three years. This assertion is debatable, depending on the definition of comic strip, but Swinnerton was certainly drawing multi-panel stories with speech balloons by 1900. The Naughty Adventures of Vivacious Mr. Jack (1904) In 1896, he moved to New York by invitation to produce comic strips for the Journal-American, another Hearst paper. He drew a few more Little Bears for the paper, followed by some strips with a Noah's Ark setting, referred to as Mount Ararat. He hit upon a durable theme with a series of strips featuring anthropomorphic tigers, which soon took the title Mr. Jack. As the character developed, Mr. Jack was an inveterate philanderer, to his wife's distress. Some of his misdeeds were considered unsuitable for juvenile readers. The strip had its last appearance in the Sunday comics color supplement in 1904. In a later revival (1912‚Äì19), it appeared in the editorial pages. Meanwhile, Swinnerton continued to fill his Sunday space with a new character, a scatterbrained boy named Jimmy. He drew Jimmy in various formats, eventually under the title Little Jimmy, until 1958 (with a hiatus from 1941 to 1945, during which he wrote and drew the King Features Syndicate Western strip Rocky Mason, Government Marshal, which premiered on Sunday, August 24, 1941).Rocky Mason, Government Marshal at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

A peculiarity of Swinnerton's comic strips is that the dialogue appears in quotes within the speech balloons. =Arizona and the desert= About 1906, a doctor told Swinnerton that he was suffering from tuberculosis and had two weeks to live. Determined to defeat the prognosis, Swinnerton was put on a train to Colton, California, by William Randolph Hearst, who considered Swinnerton one of his favorite employees. Swinnerton recovered, and stayed there. He alternated between residences in Arizona and California for most of his life.

From 1922 to 1941, he produced a series of picture stories titled Canyon Kiddies for Hearst's Good Housekeeping. The Canyon Kiddies stories usually consisted of several lush color illustrations with captions in verse. Swinnerton joined the Bohemian Club, rose through the ranks and was elected president in 1929. He was also a member of the California Art Club and the Academy of Western Painters. In 1940, he painted 50 backgrounds for Warner Bros. and Leon Schlesinger Productions for a Chuck Jones Merrie Melodies cartoon featuring the Canyon Kiddies, titled Mighty Hunters.

Protein‚Äìprotein complexes are the most commonly attempted targets of such modelling, followed by protein‚Äìnucleic acid complexes. The ultimate goal of docking is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of the macromolecular complex of interest as it would occur in a living organism. Docking itself only produces plausible candidate structures. These candidates must be ranked using methods such as scoring functions to identify structures that are most likely to occur in nature. The term \\"docking\\" originated in the late 1970s, with a more restricted meaning; then, \\"docking\\" meant refining a model of a complex structure by optimizing the separation between the interactors but keeping their relative orientations fixed. Later, the relative orientations of the interacting partners in the modelling was allowed to vary, but the internal geometry of each of the partners was held fixed. This type of modelling is sometimes referred to as \\"rigid docking\\". With further increases in computational power, it became possible to model changes in internal geometry of the interacting partners that may occur when a complex is formed. This type of modelling is referred to as \\"flexible docking\\".  Background  The biological roles of most proteins, as characterized by which other macromolecules they interact with, are known at best incompletely. Even those proteins that participate in a well-studied biological process (e.g., the Krebs cycle) may have unexpected interaction partners or functions which are unrelated to that process. In cases of known protein‚Äìprotein interactions, other questions arise. Genetic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis) are known to be caused by misfolded or mutated proteins, and there is a desire to understand what, if any, anomalous protein‚Äìprotein interactions a given mutation can cause. In the distant future, proteins may be designed to perform biological functions, and a determination of the potential interactions of such proteins will be essential. For any given set of proteins, the following questions may be of interest, from the point of view of technology or natural history: * Do these proteins bind in vivo? If they do bind, * What is the spatial configuration which they adopt in their bound state? * How strong or weak is their interaction? If they do not bind, * Can they be made to bind by inducing a mutation? Protein‚Äìprotein docking is ultimately envisaged to address all these issues. Furthermore, since docking methods can be based on purely physical principles, even proteins of unknown function (or which have been studied relatively little) may be docked. The only prerequisite is that their molecular structure has been either determined experimentally, or can be estimated by a protein structure prediction technique. Protein‚Äìnucleic acid interactions feature prominently in the living cell. Transcription factors, which regulate gene expression, and polymerases, which catalyse replication, are composed of proteins, and the genetic material they interact with is composed of nucleic acids. Modeling protein‚Äìnucleic acid complexes presents some unique challenges, as described below.  History  In the 1970s, complex modelling revolved around manually identifying features on the surfaces of the interactors, and interpreting the consequences for binding, function and activity; any computer programmes were typically used at the end of the modelling process, to discriminate between the relatively few configurations which remained after all the heuristic constraints had been imposed. The first use of computers was in a study on hemoglobin interaction in sickle-cell fibres. This was followed in 1978 by work on the trypsin-BPTI complex. Computers discriminated between good and bad models using a scoring function which rewarded large interface area, and pairs of molecules in contact but not occupying the same space. The computer used a simplified representation of the interacting proteins, with one interaction centre for each residue. Favorable electrostatic interactions, including hydrogen bonds, were identified by hand. In the early 1990s, more structures of complexes were determined, and available computational power had increased substantially. With the emergence of bioinformatics, the focus moved towards developing generalized techniques which could be applied to an arbitrary set of complexes at acceptable computational cost. The new methods were envisaged to apply even in the absence of phylogenetic or experimental clues; any specific prior knowledge could still be introduced at the stage of choosing between the highest ranking output models, or be framed as input if the algorithm catered for it. 1992 saw the publication of the correlation method, an algorithm which used the fast Fourier transform to give a vastly improved scalability for evaluating coarse shape complementarity on rigid-body models. This was extended in 1997 to cover coarse electrostatics. In 1996 the results of the first blind trial were published, in which six research groups attempted to predict the complexed structure of TEM-1 Beta-lactamase with Beta-lactamase inhibitor protein (BLIP). The exercise brought into focus the necessity of accommodating conformational change and the difficulty of discriminating between conformers. It also served as the prototype for the CAPRI assessment series, which debuted in 2001.  Rigid-body docking vs. flexible docking  If the bond angles, bond lengths and torsion angles of the components are not modified at any stage of complex generation, it is known as rigid body docking. A subject of speculation is whether or not rigid-body docking is sufficiently good for most docking. When substantial conformational change occurs within the components at the time of complex formation, rigid-body docking is inadequate. However, scoring all possible conformational changes is prohibitively expensive in computer time. Docking procedures which permit conformational change, or flexible docking procedures, must intelligently select small subset of possible conformational changes for consideration. Methods Successful docking requires two criteria: *Generating a set of configurations which reliably includes at least one nearly correct one. *Reliably distinguishing nearly correct configurations from the others. For many interactions, the binding site is known on one or more of the proteins to be docked. This is the case for antibodies and for competitive inhibitors. In other cases, a binding site may be strongly suggested by mutagenic or phylogenetic evidence. Configurations where the proteins interpenetrate severely may also be ruled out a priori. After making exclusions based on prior knowledge or stereochemical clash, the remaining space of possible complexed structures must be sampled exhaustively, evenly and with a sufficient coverage to guarantee a near hit. Each configuration must be scored with a measure that is capable of ranking a nearly correct structure above at least 100,000 alternatives. This is a computationally intensive task, and a variety of strategies have been developed. = Reciprocal space methods = Each of the proteins may be represented as a simple cubic lattice. Then, for the class of scores which are discrete convolutions, configurations related to each other by translation of one protein by an exact lattice vector can all be scored almost simultaneously by applying the convolution theorem. It is possible to construct reasonable, if approximate, convolution-like scoring functions representing both stereochemical and electrostatic fitness. Reciprocal space methods have been used extensively for their ability to evaluate enormous numbers of configurations. They lose their speed advantage if torsional changes are introduced. Another drawback is that it is impossible to make efficient use of prior knowledge. The question also remains whether convolutions are too limited a class of scoring function to identify the best complex reliably. = Monte Carlo methods = In Monte Carlo, an initial configuration is refined by taking random steps which are accepted or rejected based on their induced improvement in score (see the Metropolis criterion), until a certain number of steps have been tried. The assumption is that convergence to the best structure should occur from a large class of initial configurations, only one of which needs to be considered. Initial configurations may be sampled coarsely, and much computation time can be saved. Because of the difficulty of finding a scoring function which is both highly discriminating for the correct configuration and also converges to the correct configuration from a distance, the use of two levels of refinement, with different scoring functions, has been proposed. Torsion can be introduced naturally to Monte Carlo as an additional property of each random move. Monte Carlo methods are not guaranteed to search exhaustively, so that the best configuration may be missed even using a scoring function which would in theory identify it. How severe a problem this is for docking has not been firmly established.  Evaluation  = Scoring functions = To find a score which forms a consistent basis for selecting the best configuration, studies are carried out on a standard benchmark (see below) of protein‚Äìprotein interaction cases. Scoring functions are assessed on the rank they assign to the best structure (ideally the best structure should be ranked 1), and on their coverage (the proportion of the benchmark cases for which they achieve an acceptable result). Types of scores studied include: *Heuristic scores based on residue contacts. *Shape complementarity of molecular surfaces (\\"stereochemistry\\"). *Free energies, estimated using parameters from molecular mechanics force fields such as CHARMM or AMBER. *Phylogenetic desirability of the interacting regions. *Clustering coefficients. *Information based cues. It is usual to create hybrid scores by combining one or more categories above in a weighted sum whose weights are optimized on cases from the benchmark. To avoid bias, the benchmark cases used to optimize the weights must not overlap with the cases used to make the final test of the score. The ultimate goal in protein‚Äìprotein docking is to select the ideal ranking solution according to a scoring scheme that would also give an insight into the affinity of the complex. Such a development would drive in silico protein engineering, computer-aided drug design and/or high-throughput annotation of which proteins bind or not (annotation of interactome). Several scoring functions have been proposed for binding affinity / free energy prediction. However the correlation between experimentally determined binding affinities and the predictions of nine commonly used scoring functions have been found to be nearly orthogonal (R2 ~ 0). It was also observed that some components of the scoring algorithms may display better correlation to the experimental binding energies than the full score, suggesting that a significantly better performance might be obtained by combining the appropriate contributions from different scoring algorithms. Experimental methods for the determination of binding affinities are: surface plasmon resonance (SPR), F√∂rster resonance energy transfer, radioligand-based techniques, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), microscale thermophoresis (MST) or spectroscopic measurements and other fluorescence techniques. Textual information from scientific articles can provide useful cues for scoring. = Benchmarks = A benchmark of 84 protein‚Äìprotein interactions with known complexed structures has been developed for testing docking methods. The set is chosen to cover a wide range of interaction types, and to avoid repeated features, such as the profile of interactors' structural families according to the SCOP database. Benchmark elements are classified into three levels of difficulty (the most difficult containing the largest change in backbone conformation). The protein‚Äìprotein docking benchmark contains examples of enzyme-inhibitor, antigen-antibody and homomultimeric complexes. The latest version of protein- protein docking benchmark consists of 230 complexes. A protein-DNA docking benchmark consists of 47 test cases. A protein-RNA docking benchmark was curated as a dataset of 45 non-redundant test cases with complexes solved by X-ray crystallography only as well as an extended dataset of 71 test cases with structures derived from homology modelling as well. The protein-RNA benchmark has been updated to include more structures solved by X-ray crystallography and now it consists of 126 test cases. The benchmarks have a combined dataset of 209 complexes. A binding affinity benchmark has been based on the protein‚Äìprotein docking benchmark. 81 protein‚Äìprotein complexes with known experimental affinities are included; these complexes span over 11 orders of magnitude in terms of affinity. Each entry of the benchmark includes several biochemical parameters associated with the experimental data, along with the method used to determine the affinity. This benchmark was used to assess the extent to which scoring functions could also predict affinities of macromolecular complexes. This Benchmark was post-peer reviewed and significantly expanded. The new set is diverse in terms of the biological functions it represents, with complexes that involve G-proteins and receptor extracellular domains, as well as antigen/antibody, enzyme/inhibitor, and enzyme/substrate complexes. It is also diverse in terms of the partners' affinity for each other, with Kd ranging between 10‚àí5 and 10‚àí14 M. Nine pairs of entries represent closely related complexes that have a similar structure, but a very different affinity, each pair comprising a cognate and a noncognate assembly. The unbound structures of the component proteins being available, conformation changes can be assessed. They are significant in most of the complexes, and large movements or disorder-to-order transitions are frequently observed. The set may be used to benchmark biophysical models aiming to relate affinity to structure in protein‚Äìprotein interactions, taking into account the reactants and the conformation changes that accompany the association reaction, instead of just the final product. = The CAPRI assessment = The Critical Assessment of PRediction of Interactions is an ongoing series of events in which researchers throughout the community try to dock the same proteins, as provided by the assessors. Rounds take place approximately every 6 months. Each round contains between one and six target protein‚Äìprotein complexes whose structures have been recently determined experimentally. The coordinates and are held privately by the assessors, with the cooperation of the structural biologists who determined them. The assessment of submissions is double blind. CAPRI attracts a high level of participation (37 groups participated worldwide in round seven) and a high level of interest from the biological community in general. Although CAPRI results are of little statistical significance owing to the small number of targets in each round, the role of CAPRI in stimulating discourse is significant. (The CASP assessment is a similar exercise in the field of protein structure prediction).

Course and features Part of the Onkaparinga River catchment that drains the western slopes of the Mount Lofty Ranges, the Field River has a total area of and drains the Happy Valley Reservoir, part of Main South Road and the Southern Expressway. Suburbs bordering the river include Hallett Cove, Reynella, Shiedow Park, Trott Park, Happy Valley and Woodcroft. The stream flow of the Field River is highly seasonal and variable with an average annual runoff of . The majority of the stream can dry out completely during summer, staying that way well into autumn. The final portion of the river is spring fed and flows into the Gulf St Vincent all year round. The Field River flows through or is bordered by the City of Marion and City of Onkaparinga. The lower reaches of the river ran through private property owned by the Sheidow family until 1993 when the land was sold for housing development and became Cove Point in the suburb of Hallett Cove The stretch of the river further inland on the south eastern side of Lonsdale Road is presently in private ownership. This parcel of land has been identified as being an important part of the proposed Great Southern Urban Forest of Adelaide. A number of primary schools including Braeview, Reynella East and Hallett Cove South have projects underway which involve revegetation and other environmental studies of the Field River.  History  Southern Expressway bridge over the Field River in Reynella In the 1840s the mouth of the Field River was used to land contraband goods for market in Adelaide. In 1850 a State Government Commission examining locations for secure anchorage suggested that the mouth of the river was a suitable site for a harbour. The discovery of copper in the 1840s at the Worthing Mine (on the south eastern side of Lonsdale Road) promoted interest in using the Field River as a means of transporting the copper ore from the mine to the sea. By 1856 mining had ceased due to the lack of further investment money. The majority of the Field River runs along steeply inclined undeveloped land which was quarried during the early 20th century. The importance of the coastline to the Kaurna people, the indigenous inhabitants of the region, is clearly demonstrated with large quantities of cultural material collected from areas adjacent to the outflow of the Field River. In 1992 the fossil remains of the world's largest marsupial, the Diprotodon, were discovered on the bank of the river by Trevor Westlake. The fossil, which is at least 70,000 years old, is now in the care of the South Australian Museum. Etymology The river was named after Lieutenant W. G. Field, RN, who served under Colonel Light on his journey to South Australia in 1836 aboard the brig Rapid. Light visited the river in 1837 while surveying the area. After initially being named the Field River the name was changed to Hallett Creek due to the Onkaparinga River also being known as Fields River. It was subsequently renamed Field River during the 20th century, however, in 1990 consideration was given to changing the name to Serpentine Creek.

His term in office was marked by further incorporation of the Cossack Hetmanate into the Tsardom of Russia and by attempts to win the Right- bank Ukraine from Poland-Lithuania. Rise to power Samoylovych's father was a priest in a village near Zhytomyr. Ivan first rose to prominence during Ivan Briukhovetsky's revolt against Tsardom of Russia. After Briukhovetsky's execution he supported Demian Mnohohrishny as a new hetman and swore allegiance to the Russian Tsar. Securing Mnohohrishny's deposition, he was elected the Hetman of the Left-Bank Ukraine in Konotop on June 17, 1672. Samoylovych's principal ambition was to control the Right-bank Ukraine, where two rival hetmans, Petro Doroshenko and Mykhailo Khanenko, were active. In 1674 he joined his Cossacks with the Russian forces under Prince Grigory Romodanovsky against Doroshenko. After the latter's deposition, Samoylovych let him live in peace on the left bank of the Dnieper. Samoylovych family coat-of-arms. Zgon In 1677, the Turkish sultan proclaimed Yuri Khmelnytsky a successor to Doroshenko, and invaded the right bank and laid siege to its capital, Chyhyryn. Although Samoylovych and Romodanovsky were generally successful in their operations against the Turks, the Russian army unexpectedly withdrew to the left bank on behest of the Tsar Alexis. By that time, the Russian government decided to de-populate the right bank altogether and to resettle its Cossacks in the areas controlled by Samoylovych. His son Semion was put in charge of these policies, known as zgon. Conflict with Golitsyn In 1679 Poland invited Vasily Golitsyn (prime-minister of Russia) to join the Holy League against the Turks. The Eternal Peace Treaty between Poland and Russia ran contrary with Samoylovych's plans to annex the right bank of the Dnieper, which still remained under Polish dominion since the Treaty of Andrusovo. Samoylovych attempted to persuade Russian boyars in the Polish treachery but, failing in his design, sent an angry letter to the king of Poland. Despite subsequent apologies, this incident would eventually contribute to his downfall. In 1687, Golitsyn and Samoylovych failed in their Crimean campaigns against the Crimean Khanate on account of steppe fires. It was rumoured that it was Samoylovych who had set the steppe on fire, because he preferred the Tatars to the Poles. Golitsyn, meanwhile, was exasperated at Samoylovych's friendship with Prince Romodanovsky, his old political rival, and finally resolved to replace him with a more tractable Cossack. In June 1687, Ivan Mazepa used the popular discontent with Samoylovych's haughty manners and high taxes to accuse him of separatism. Thereupon his youngest son, Hryhory Samoylovych, was incriminated in slandering the Tsar and executed in Sevsk. The old hetman and his family were arrested and exiled to Tobolsk in Siberia, where he died in 1690.

It is west of Wolverhampton city centre, within the Tettenhall Wightwick ward. It sits high on a relatively steep hill and it is claimed that the Malvern Hills can be seen from some of the houses located in the area. To its west lies Wightwick, to its south Compton to its east Tettenhall. Also to its north lies the boundary of the West Midlands conurbation and also that of Wolverhampton metropolitan authority with South Staffordshire. The River Penk rises in the area, at Penk Rise Park. Tettenhall Wood is a largely residential area and is relatively affluent. It has a relatively low crime rate and a growing population of younger people. The area has two churches: Christ Church and the United Reformed Church. It has a small shopping district with a small local supermarket and one public house lie in the area. A local house of note \\"The Mount\\" is situated within the area; it was rebuilt in the late 19th century in English Renaissance style as the seat of the Mander family, baronets, who founded Mander Brothers, paint and varnish manufacturers, in 1773, and were noted public servants and philanthropists in Wolverhampton. The area is served by the 1 (Dudley via Wolverhampton) and 10 (Wolverhampton to Perton via Compton) bus routes, both operated by National Express West Midlands. The 109-year-old Tettenhall Wood Working Men's Institute (known locally as 'the Institute') is situated in the heart of Tettenhall Wood.

The unit was equivalent to three French bushels (boisseaux), half a mine, and one quarter of a setier. The size of the minot is comparable to the US and Imperial bushels. The name minot derives from the larger unit, the mine, with an -ot diminutive suffixed. The term mine in this case derives from the same Greek origin as the word hemisphere, and refers to half of the larger setier. The volumetric mine should not be confused with the mass unit mina, which is also called a mine in French. As the French bushel was defined as 10/27 of a cubic French royal foot, or 640 cubic French royal inches, the minot was 1920 cubic French royal inches, corresponding to about 38.086 litres. In Toulouse the minot was used for charcoal and salt measurement. Later on, there was also a minot de Paris based on exactly one cubic French royal foot, which is equivalent to 34.277 litres.

Many higher eukaryotes were paleopolyploids at some point during their evolutionary history. Paleopolyploidy is the result of genome duplications which occurred at least several million years ago (MYA). Such an event could either double the genome of a single species (autopolyploidy) or combine those of two species (allopolyploidy). Because of functional redundancy, genes are rapidly silenced or lost from the duplicated genomes. Most paleopolyploids, through evolutionary time, have lost their polyploid status through a process called diploidization, and are currently considered diploids e.g. baker's yeast, Arabidopsis thaliana, and perhaps humans. Paleopolyploidy is extensively studied in plant lineages. It has been found that almost all flowering plants have undergone at least one round of genome duplication at some point during their evolutionary history. Ancient genome duplications are also found in the early ancestor of vertebrates (which includes the human lineage) near the origin of the bony fishes, and another in the stem lineage of teleost fishes. Evidence suggests that baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which has a compact genome, experienced polyploidization during its evolutionary history. The term mesopolyploid is sometimes used for species that have undergone whole genome multiplication events (whole genome duplication, whole genome triplification, etc.) in more recent history, such as within the last 17 million years.  Eukaryotes  A diagram that summarizes all well-known paleopolyploidization events. Ancient genome duplications are widespread throughout eukaryotic lineages, particularly in plants. Studies suggest that the common ancestor of Poaceae, the grass family which includes important crop species such as maize, rice, wheat, and sugar cane, shared a whole genome duplication about . In more ancient monocot lineages one or likely multiple rounds of additional whole genome duplications had occurred, which were however not shared with the ancestral eudicots. Further independent more recent whole genome duplications have occurred in the lineages leading to maize, sugar cane and wheat, but not rice, sorghum or foxtail millet. A polyploidy event is theorized to have created the ancestral line that led to all modern flowering plants. That paleopolyploidy event was studied by sequencing the genome of an ancient flowering plant, Amborella trichopoda. The core eudicots also shared a common whole genome triplication (paleo- hexaploidy), which was estimated to have occurred after monocot-eudicot divergence but before the divergence of rosids and asterids. Many eudicot species have experienced additional whole genome duplications or triplications. For example, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the first plant to have its entire genome sequenced, has experienced at least two additional rounds of whole genome duplication since the duplication shared by the core eudicots. The most recent event took place before the divergence of the Arabidopsis and Brassica lineages, about to . Other examples include the sequenced eudicot genomes of apple, soybean, tomato, cotton, etc. Compared with plants, paleopolyploidy is much rarer in the animal kingdom. It has been identified mainly in amphibians and bony fishes. Although some studies suggested one or more common genome duplications are shared by all vertebrates (including humans), the evidence is not as strong as in the other cases because the duplications, if they exist, happened so long ago, and the matter is still under debate. The idea that vertebrates share a common whole genome duplication is known as the 2R Hypothesis. Many researchers are interested in the reason why animal lineages, particularly mammals, have had so many fewer whole genome duplications than plant lineages. A well-supported paleopolyploidy has been found in baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), despite its small, compact genome (~13Mbp), after the divergence from the common yeast Kluyveromyces waltii. Through genome streamlining, yeast has lost 90% of the duplicated genome over evolutionary time and is now recognized as a diploid organism.  Detection method  Duplicated genes can be identified through sequence homology on the DNA or protein level. Paleopolyploidy can be identified as massive gene duplication at one time using a molecular clock. To distinguish between whole-genome duplication and a collection of (more common) single gene duplication events, the following rules are often applied: Detection of paleopolyploidy using Ks. * Duplicated genes are located in large duplicated blocks. Single gene duplication is a random process and tends to make duplicated genes scattered throughout the genome. * Duplicated blocks are non-overlapping because they were created simultaneously. Segmental duplication within the genome can fulfill the first rule; but multiple independent segmental duplications could overlap each other. In theory, the two duplicated genes should have the same \\"age\\"; that is, the divergence of the sequence should be equal between the two genes duplicated by paleopolyploidy (homeologs). Synonymous substitution rate, Ks, is often used as a molecular clock to determine the time of gene duplication. Thus, paleopolyploidy is identified as a \\"peak\\" on the duplicate number vs. Ks graph (shown on the right). Duplication events that occurred a long time ago in the history of various evolutionary lineages can be difficult to detect because of subsequent diploidization (such that a polyploid starts to behave cytogenetically as a diploid over time) as mutations and gene translations gradually make one copy of each chromosome unlike its counterpart. This usually results in a low confidence for identifying a very ancient paleopolyploidy.  Evolutionary importance  Paleopolyploidization events lead to massive cellular changes, including doubling of the genetic material, changes in gene expression and increased cell size. Gene loss during diploidization is not completely random, but heavily selected. Genes from large gene families are duplicated. On the other hand, individual genes are not duplicated. Overall, paleopolyploidy can have both short-term and long- term evolutionary effects on an organism's fitness in the natural environment. ;Enhanced phenotypic evolution: Whole genome duplication may increase the rates and efficiency by which organisms acquire new biological traits. However, one test of this hypothesis, which compared evolutionary rates in innovation in early teleost fishes (with duplicate genomes) to early holostean fishes (without duplicated genomes) found little difference between the two. ; Genome diversity: Genome doubling provided the organism with redundant alleles that can evolve freely with little selection pressure. The duplicated genes can undergo neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization which could help the organism adapt to the new environment or survive different stress conditions. ; Hybrid vigor: Polyploids often have larger cells and even larger organs. Many important crops, including wheat, maize and cotton, are paleopolyploids which were selected for domestication by ancient peoples. ; Speciation: It has been suggested that many polyploidization events created new species, via a gain of adaptive traits, or by sexual incompatibility with their diploid counterparts. An example would be the recent speciation of allopolyploid Spartina ‚Äî S. anglica; the polyploid plant is so successful that it is listed as an invasive species in many regions. Allopolyploidy and autopolyploidy There are two major divisions of polyploidy, allopolyplody and autopolyploidy. Allopolyploids arise as a result of the hybridization of two related species, while autopolyploids arise from the duplication of a species' genome as a result of hybridization of two conspecific parents, or somatic doubling in reproductive tissue of a parent. Allopolyploid species are believed to be much more prevalent in nature, possibly because allopolyploids inherit different genomes, resulting in increased heterozygosity, and therefore higher fitness. These different genomes result in an increased likelihood of large genomic reorganizations, which can be either deleterious, or advantageous. Autopolyploidy, however, is generally considered to be a neutral process, though it has been hypothesized that autopolyploidy may serve as a useful mechanism for inducing speciation, and therefore assisting in the ability of an organism to quickly colonize in new habitats without undergoing the time- intensive and costly period of genomic reorganization experienced by allopolyploid species. One common source of autopolyploidy in plants stems from \\"perfect flowers\\", which are capable of self-pollination, or \\"selfing\\". This, along with errors in meiosis that lead to aneuploidy, can create an environment where autopolyploidy is very likely. This fact can be exploited in a laboratory setting by using colchicine to inhibit chromosome segregation during meiosis, creating synthetic autopolyploid plants. Following polyploidy events, there are several possible fates for duplicated genes; both copies may be retained as functional genes, change in gene function may occur in one or both copies, gene silencing may mask one or both copies, or complete gene loss may occur. Polyploidy events will result in higher levels of heterozygosity, and, over time, can lead to an increase in the total number of functional genes in the genome. As time passes after a genome duplication event, many genes will change function as a result of either change in duplicate gene function for both allo- and autopolyploid species, or there will be changes in gene expression caused by genomic rearrangements induced by genome duplication in allopolyploids. When both copies of a gene are retained, and thus the number of copies doubled, there is a chance that there will be a proportional increase in expression of that gene, resulting in twice as much mRNA transcript being produced. There is also the possibility that transcription of a duplicated gene will be down-regulated, resulting in less than two-fold increase in transcription of that gene, or that the duplication event will yield more than a two-fold increase in transcription. In one species, Glycine dolichocarpa (a close relative of the soybean, Glycine max), it has been observed that following a genome duplication roughly 500,000 years ago, there has been a 1.4 fold increase in transcription, indicating that there has been a proportional decrease in transcription relative to gene copy number following the duplication event. Vertebrates as paleopolyploid The hypothesis of vertebrate paleopolyploidy originated as early as the 1970s, proposed by the biologist Susumu Ohno. He reasoned that the vertebrate genome could not achieve its complexity without large scale whole-genome duplications. The \\"two rounds of genome duplication\\" hypothesis (2R hypothesis) came about, and gained in popularity, especially among developmental biologists. Some researchers have questioned the 2R hypothesis because it predicts that vertebrate genomes should have a 4:1 gene ratio compared with invertebrate genomes, and this is not supported by findings from the 48 vertebrate genome projects available in mid-2011. For example, the human genome consists of ~21,000 protein coding genes according to June, 2011 counts at UCSC and Ensembl genome analysis centers while an average invertebrate genome size is about 15,000 genes. The amphioxus genome sequence provided support for the hypothesis of two rounds of whole genome duplication, followed by loss of duplicate copies of most genes. Additional arguments against 2R were based on the lack of the (AB)(CD) tree topology amongst four members of a gene family in vertebrates. However, if the two genome duplications occurred close together, we would not expect to find this topology. A recent study generated the sea lamprey genetic map, which yielded strong support for the hypothesis that a single whole-genome duplication occurred in the basal vertebrate lineage, preceded and followed by several evolutionarily independent segmental duplications that occurred over chordate evolution.

Today many of its 87 roofs leak and it has also become expensive to heat. DMV office in interior atrium. So great are these problems, that when Diana considered demolishing it to build a new one in early 2004 the objections raised were purely financial. However, the costs of doing so are prohibitive enough that the idea has been dropped. At the same time it is uncertain whether it would be feasible to repair the building, and demolition is still the strongest possibility. There have been some architects who have urged the building's preservation, however, pointing to its historic value, Rudolph's stature as an architect, and the imaginative use of space within the building. The Paul Rudolph Foundation has been working to preserve both it and Chorley School in nearby Middletown, which has been slated for demolition. Some even consider it beautiful. New York's State Historic Preservation Office has found it eligible for listing on the state and National Registers of Historic Places,LaFrank, Kathleen; ; August 23, 2011; retrieved September 16, 2011 and an online campaign has begun to save it for both historic and economic reasons. In 2011, flood damage from Hurricane Irene closed the building for over a week. Mold had been growing in spaces in some rooms, including the grand jury room, and there were concerns it might become unsafe for use by those with respiratory problems. The day after it reopened, the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee deluged the area, and on September 8, it was closed again until further notice. The following week, Diana pressed county legislators to make a decision soon on whether to renovate the building or restore it. On October 13, 2011, it was reported that the World Monuments Fund, citing its architecture, had added the Government Center to its biennial list of worldwide cultural heritage sites at risk. As of year-end, the county‚Äîunder pressure from the state's Office of Court Administration (OCA)‚Äîannounced an emergency plan to open temporary courtroom space nearby in January, while development of a two-year restoration project proceeds. Near the end of the year the OCA sent Diana a strongly worded letter complaining that his office had not yet informed them as to the county's plans to replace closed courtrooms. \\"Our judges and staff are doing the best that they can, sharing courtrooms and chambers in other facilities, staggering appointment calendars and delaying trials,\\" said Ronald Younkins, chief of operations for the OCA. \\"The situation is unacceptable and unfair to the judges, court staff, litigants, the bar, jurors and the public at large.\\" Younkins said that two OCA employees and an architect with the state's Dormitory Authority who had toured the building had written reports saying the damage to the courts could be repaired for as little as $381,000 rather than replacing the entire building. Diana, he said, had also missed a deadline the previous week to submit long-term plans to the OCA. The agency threatened to withhold state aid to the county. Diana responded that the reports the OCA cited did not go into sufficient detail as to how the work could be done cheaply, and he had believed those issues had been previously resolved. Zaha Hadid said that the integrity and the interconnectivity of the building served as the expression of democracy, since elected representatives are not separated from the constituents.

Doncaster railway works is a plant located in the town of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. Always referred to as \\"the Plant\\", it was established by the Great Northern Railway in 1853, replacing the previous works in Boston and Peterborough. Until 1867 it undertook only repairs and maintenance. History In 1866, Patrick Stirling was appointed as Locomotive Superintendent, and the first of the 875 class was built in 1886. At this time the works also began building new coaches: in 1873 the first sleeping cars; in 1879 the first dining cars in the United Kingdom; and in 1882 the first corridor coaches. In 1891, 99 locomotives, 181 carriages and 1,493 wagons were built. Among the locomotives the works produced were the Stirling Singles, the Ivatt Atlantics and the Gresley Pacifics, including the world-famous Flying Scotsman, the first locomotive to achieve 100 mph and also run from London King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverley non-stop; and Mallard which achieved the top speed of 126 mph on 3 July 1938 to become the world's fastest steam locomotive, a record that she still holds to the present day. These have hauled such trains as the Flying Scotsman, Silver Jubilee, Coronation and the Elizabethan. Doncaster also constructed the carriages for the last of these. The works continued building all kinds of rolling stock. During the Second World War, like other workshops it joined in the war effort, producing, among other things, Horsa gliders for the D-Day airborne assault. The carriage building shop was destroyed by fire in 1940. New buildings in 1949 were designed with the British Railways standard all-steel carriages in mind. In 1957, BR Standard Class 4 76114, the last of over 2,000 steam locomotives, was completed.Last Steam Locomotive Built at Doncaster Railway Gazette 25 October 1957 page 490 Carriage building finished in 1962, but the works was modernised with the addition of a diesel locomotive repair shop. Under British Rail Engineering Limited, new diesel shunters and 25 kV electric locomotives have been built, plus Class 56 and Class 58 diesel-electric locomotives. In 2007, Bombardier Transportation closed its part of the works.Closure at Plant Works means end of the line for 150 years of history Doncaster Free Press 20 December 2007Remains of Plants Works set to close Sheffield Star 20 December 2007 In early 2008 the main locomotive repair shop which was built on the Crimpsall was demolished to make way for housing.

The term indicates that a certain portion of the document is general character data, rather than non- character data or character data with a more specific, limited structure. CDATA sections in XML In an XML document or external entity, a CDATA section is a piece of element content that is marked up to be interpreted literally, as textual data, not as marked up content. A CDATA section is merely an alternative syntax for expressing character data; there is no semantic difference between character data in a CDATA section and character data in standard syntax where, for example, \\"\`<\`\\" and \\"\`&\`\\" are represented by \\"\`&lt;\`\\" and \\"\`&amp;\`\\", respectively. =Syntax and interpretation= A CDATA section starts with the following sequence: All characters enclosed between these two sequences are interpreted as characters, not markup or entity references. Every character is taken literally, the only exception being the \` >\` sequence of characters. In: John Smith the start and end \\"sender\\" tags are interpreted as markup. However, the code: is equivalent to: <sender>John Smith</sender> Thus, the \\"tags\\" will have exactly the same status as the \\"John Smith\\"; they will be treated as text. Similarly, if the numeric character reference \`&#240;\` appears in element content, it will be interpreted as the single Unicode character 00F0 (small letter eth). But if the same appears in a CDATA section, it will be parsed as six characters: ampersand, hash mark, digit 2, digit 4, digit 0, semicolon. =Uses of CDATA sections= New authors of XML documents often misunderstand the purpose of a CDATA section, mistakenly believing that its purpose is to \\"protect\\" data from being treated as ordinary character data during processing. Some APIs for working with XML documents do offer options for independent access to CDATA sections, but such options exist above and beyond the normal requirements of XML processing systems, and still do not change the implicit meaning of the data. Character data is character data, regardless of whether it is expressed via a CDATA section or ordinary markup. CDATA sections are useful for writing XML code as text data within an XML document. For example, if one wishes to typeset a book with XSL explaining the use of an XML application, the XML markup to appear in the book itself will be written in the source file in a CDATA section. Nesting A CDATA section cannot contain the string \\"\` >\`\\" and therefore it is not possible for a CDATA section to contain nested CDATA sections. The preferred approach to using CDATA sections for encoding text that contains the triad \\"\` >\`\\" is to use multiple CDATA sections by splitting each occurrence of the triad just before the \\"\`>\`\\". For example, to encode \\"\` >\`\\" one would write: This means that to encode \\"\` >\`\\" in the middle of a CDATA section, replace all occurrences of \\"\` >\`\\" with the following: > /*<![CDATA[*/ body { background-image: url(\\"marble.png?width=300&height=300\\") } /* >*/ ","title":"CDATA"},{"id":"2606585","text":"Abstract may refer to: * Abstract (album), 1962 album by Joe Harriott * Abstract (law), a summary of a legal document * Abstract (summary), in academic publishing * Abstract art, artistic works that do not attempt to represent reality or concrete subjects * Abstract: The Art of Design, 2017 Netflix documentary series * Abstract music, music that is non- representational * Abstract object in philosophy * Abstract structure in mathematics * Abstract type in computer science * The property of an abstraction * Q-Tip (musician), also known as \\"The Abstract\\" See also * Abstraction (disambiguation) ","title":"Abstract"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your wikitable ü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(P,[["render",H]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/38.md","filePath":"glossary/38.md"}'),L={name:"glossary/38.md"},F=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{x as __pageData,F as default};
