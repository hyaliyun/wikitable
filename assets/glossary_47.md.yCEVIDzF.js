The tournament featured 40 teams. The Final Four consisted of Long Beach State, Auburn, Tennessee, and Louisiana Tech. Louisiana Tech won its second title with a 56-54 victory over Auburn. Louisiana Tech's Erica Westbrooks was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. Notable events Long Beach state reached the Final Four averaging over 100 points per game. Long Beach beat Colorado 103‚Äì64 in their opening game. Long Beach then defeated the three seed Washington 104‚Äì78 in the West Regional semifinal. That matched Long Beach up with the one seed Iowa. Long Beach didn't score 100, but came close, beating the top seed in their regional by a score of 98‚Äì78, allowing Long Beach to reach the Final Four for the second straight year. Their opponent in the semifinal was Auburn, who had reached the Sweet Sixteen in 1985 and 1986, then followed it with a trip to the Elite Eight in 1987. This year Auburn advanced to the Final Four for the first time defeating Maryland in the Mideast Regional 103‚Äì74. In the semifinal game, the Long Beach 49ers team started out slowly, but their coach Joan Bonvicini wasn't worried; she was convinced they would come back. Auburn had a small lead in the second half when the 49ers scored 11 consecutive points to take a 46‚Äì42 lead. However, the Tigers tied the game at 46 apiece, then 48 then 50 apiece. Then the Tigers opened up a seven-point lead. The 49ers cut it back to five points, but too many turnovers were too much to overcome. Ruthie Bolton scored eleven points in the final six minutes for the Tigers to help seal the 68‚Äì55 victory, and the right to play for the national championship. The other semifinal game matched up Tennessee and Louisiana Tech. Tennessee was the defending national champion, having won their first national championship in 1987. They won the East Regional with a win over the two seed Virginia. Their opponent, Louisiana Tech, had won the first NCAA Tournament in 1982, and had finished as runner up to Tennessee in the previous year's championship game. The two teams met in the regular season, with Tennessee winning 76‚Äì74 in an overtime game played in Knoxville. The Lady Techsters were a two seed, but upset top ranked Texas 83‚Äì80 in the Midwest Regional to make it to the semifinal game. The Lady Techsters said they had been looking forward to this game ever since their loss in the prior year and they played like it. They took the lead early in the game and never relinquished it. Louisiana Tech held Tennessee to 33% shooting in the first half, and held on to win the game 68‚Äì59, and a berth in the championship game. The first half of the championship game was all Auburn. Two minutes went by before the Lady Techsters even took at shot, at which point they were down 6‚Äì0. Ruthie Bolton scored 16 points in the first half, a source of frustration for her defender Teresa Weatherspoon. Bolton's points held the Tigers head to halftime with a 31‚Äì19 lead. Weatherspoon made sure the second half was different, both offensively, with seven assists and defensively, holding Bolton to zero points and helping to force six turnovers. The Tigers still led by four points with under five minutes left, but behind Weatherspoon's defense, and Erica Westbrooks' 25 points, Louisiana Tech came back to win their second national Championship by a score of 56‚Äì54. Records Ruthie Bolton was credited with ten steals in the National Semifinal game, the most ever recorded in a Final Four game since the statistic has been recorded (starting in 1988). Qualifying teams - automatic Forty teams were selected to participate in the 1988 NCAA Tournament.

It is also available as a \\"stop tail\\" guitar, comprising a Tune-o-matic bridge and a stopbar tailpiece. The shape of the upper half of the body is similar to the Fender design, but the bottom half is something unique. It resembles a standard Jazzmaster body with part of the bottom bout cut away and \\"smooshed\\" over to form the fin. the body shape seems radical on first appearance the top-fin shape resembles other guitars noted for their ergonomics such as the Ovation Breadwinner and is possible to play quite comfortably in the classical style with the left leg raised. The guitar does not fit in a standard Strat case because of its unusual shape. This and other SX guitars are popular for beginning or intermediate players and \\"modders\\" because of their low price and quality construction. The guitar is also available in left-handed models. The numbers in the guitar's name refer to years and signify certain details common to guitars of that era. The SJM-62 has a rosewood fingerboard and comes in \\"custom colors\\" similar to Fender's options of the time. The SJM-57 has a maple board; all Fenders prior to 1959's Jazzmaster had maple boards. The SJM-75 has a natural finish, as was popular in the mid-1970s. The body is made of alder (ash on natural-finished models) and the neck is maple. Contrary to appearance, and unlike the Jazzmaster upon which it is based, the SX SJM cannot be fitted with a Fender Stratocaster neck as the Strat's fingerboard hangs over the body at the 22nd fret, where the SJM's neck continues for the full length, resulting in a too-short scale and poor intonation when the SJM is fitted with the Stratocaster neck. In the same way it is common for people to customize their Jazzmasters, it is popular for the SJM owner to replace the bridge on models fitted with a tremolo, with a Fender Mustang bridge and change out the tuners and possibly the volume and tone knobs because of their low quality plastic. A buzzstop can be installed to stop unwanted buzz and keep some tension on the strings, though some users find this dramatically alters the tonal properties of the guitar and interferes with tremolo use. If not fitted with a buzzstop, third bridge techniques are possible. It is also possible to insert a thin cardboard or wooden shim into the base of the neck pocket to increase the neck angle, resulting in a lower action. In mid-2007 Rondo introduced two variations on the standard SJM, one with 3 P-90 pickups, a 5 way switch and 2 tone controls (the same control arrangement as on the Fender Stratocaster). The output jack on this model is on the side of the guitar. Also introduced is a 24\\" scale model, the same scale as the Fender Jaguar. They also changed the pickup covers and knobs on the sunburst and black models from cream to black in accordance with a popular user mod. A newer model (SJM-62H) is also available with two humbucker pickups instead of the soapbar P-90 and with knurled chrome metal control knobs instead of plastic. Another newer model is the SJM-62ST \\"stop-tail\\" version which features a bridge/tailpiece array much like that used on Gibson guitars, consisting of an intonable bridge and a stout, heavy fixed tailpiece anchored into the guitar body via threaded inserts and height-adjustable studs. This gives the guitar very good sustain characteristics.

History  Bournemouth Reform Synagogue was founded in 1947 as the Bournemouth New Synagogue, a break-away from the Bournemouth Hebrew Congregation. The split met with fierce opposition from the Hebrew Congregation who at the time refused to share the cemetery.Anne J. Kershen and Jonathan A. Romain, Tradition and Change ‚Äì A History of Reform Judaism in Britain 1840‚Äì1995, London: Vallentine Mitchell, 1995, p.181 At the time it was the ninth Reform synagogue in the country. Rabbis The synagogue has been led by five ministers over its 60-year history: Rev. Charles Berg (1948‚Äì1953), Rev. Stanley Solomons (1953‚Äì1969), Rabbi Harold Vallins (1970‚Äì1972), Rabbi David Soetendorp (1972‚Äì2005), Rabbi Neil Amswych (2005‚Äì2014) and Rabbi Maurice Michaels (October 2014‚Äìpresent). In 2007, BRS also inducted its first Associate Rabbi ‚Äì Rabbi Jenny Goldfried Amswych.Diamond Jubilee 1947‚Äì2007 booklet  BRS today  Bournemouth Reform Synagogue is a member of the Movement for Reform Judaism, and shares similar goals. It seeks to be welcoming to everyone for social activities, educational programmes, for support or for spiritual nourishment. It seeks to respond to the needs of individuals who need a combination of both tradition and modernity, and says that it believes that \\"a healthy community is one that prays, socialises, learns, plans and grows together.\\"The Bournemouth Reform Synagogue website BRS is one of the many communities responding to a major difficulty of Reform Judaism ‚Äì \\"the question of religious authority with the resulting difficulty of setting limits to a liberal religion.\\"Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 14, Jerusalem, 1972, 27 \\"Reform Judaism\\" A centralised model of religious leadership under Rabbi Soetendorp was responsible for significantly growing the community in size, and in drawing people into the community. Under the leadership of Rabbi Neil Amswych the Foundations course was established for adults in 2005, and in 2006 became a partially online course for those who live far away from Bournemouth. Community-led decisions have always been a part of every British Reform community but BRS is one of the communities that has employed a model in which the Ritual Forum, re-established in 2005, advises the Rabbi and Council of ritual decisions after long discussions that can sometimes take place over a period of months. Under Rabbi Soetendorp's leadership, the synagogue published two volumes of Emet ‚Äì books compiled and edited by Eve Cowan ‚Äì that told the life stories of some of its members.See Lawrence A. Hoffman, ReThinking Synagogues ‚Äì a New Vocabulary for Congregational Life, Jewish Lights Publishing, 2006, Chapter 3 ‚Äì \\"Telling the Story\\" This model was expanded upon by Rabbi Neil Amswych who, on the Kabbalat Shabbat (Friday night) service, will often ask members to share the things that they are thankful for from the week that has been, and the things that they are looking forward to in the week to come. By ritualising story- tellingHoffman, ibid. p.54 the synagogue has doubled the number of people attending its Friday night (Shabbat) services. In 2010 Councillor Barry Goldbart became the fifth Jewish Mayor of Bournemouth. He is the first Reform Jewish Mayor and a member of Bournemouth Reform Synagogue. Rabbi Neil Amswych was appointed as the Mayor's Chaplain. \\"First Reform Mayor in Bournemouth\\"  Prayer services  Services are in both Hebrew and English and members are encouraged to take part in relevant mitzvot (commandments) regardless of gender. The Friday evening service is usually more fluid with a story as the central focus, while the Saturday morning service has the Torah reading and its exposition as the central point. A significant development in the liturgy was made in March 2008 when the community voted by a large majority to adopt the eighth edition of the Forms of Prayer siddur written by the Movement for Reform Judaism. For Succot 2009, Rabbi Jenny created a booklet of prayers to allow the community to move away from the 50-year-old pilgrim festival liturgy. Another major development in the services was the relocation of the reading desk from the front to the middle of the community, creating a more inclusive atmosphere. Many decisions regarding community customs are made at the synagogue's Ritual Forum which meets around every six weeks and which is open to all synagogue members.  The Bournemouth Jewish Social Centre  The Bournemouth Jewish Social Centre, formerly called the Day Centre was held on a Monday lunchtime bringing together Jews from all denominations across Bournemouth, however with dwindling attendance the Centre closed in 2013 after 32 years.  Outreach  Bournemouth Reform Synagogue often holds events that link up with the South Hampshire Reform Jewish Community, and the smaller community in Salisbury. It also takes under its wing the Reform Jewish community on the Isle of Wight, which is based at Wroxall. Outreach work includes interfaith activities, such as the 2007 Interfaith Seder, and school visits (either to the community or by community representatives such as Rabbi Neil Amswych, Rabbi Jenny Goldfried Amswych, or educators from the community).  Education  The religion school at Bournemouth Reform Synagogue is called \\"Oseh Shalom\\" and it brings Jews to Reform Judaism from reception up to teenage years. In 2006, Rabbi Neil Amswych created the Foundations Course which was designed to teach about matters that lie at the heart of being a Reform Jew. There were sessions three times a month ‚Äì two Wednesday evenings and one Shabbat afternoon. In 2007, the two Wednesday evening sessions were moved online, so that the Foundations course could be accessed by more people. The website also contains an \\"Ask the Rabbi\\" page, a Torah Thoughts page with commentaries on most weekly portions (as well as occasional sermons), and also includes online courses, such as the course for 2007 entitled \\"Why do Bad Things Happen to Good People?\\" In place of the Foundations course, the Shabbat afternoon sessions for 2009 were an introduction to key areas of Reform Judaism called \\"Beyond Survival ‚Äì Reform Judaism Today.\\" In 2009, the adult education also expanded to include an introduction to Hebrew reading class and also a Talmud class (which has since been disbanded) led by Rabbi Jenny.  Social action  Following the name of the community ‚Äì Gates of Righteousness ‚Äì Bournemouth Reform Synagogue has a history of social action. Under Rabbi David Sotendorp's guidance, the community was very prominent in the campaign to free Soviet Jewry in the 1980s. Under the guidance of Rabbi Neil Amswych, the community's social action focused on environmental concerns, both locally and globally. Visitors to the synagogue website are also directed to internet charity sites where surfers can give to charity for free. In 2009, BRS set up \\"Sha'arei Tzedek\\" ‚Äì the BRS Social Action Group. The first event was to synchronise with Mitzvah Day 2009,Hakol, December 2009, Issue 213, p.25 soon followed by a collection of warm clothes for those in the FSU. The January 2010 earthquake in Haiti also brought a community-wide request for donations to the World Jewish Relief.

Anichkov first described the specialized myocardial cells (Anitschkow cell, cardiac histiocyte) and discovered the significance and role of cholesterol in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. In 1958, in an editorial in Annals of Internal Medicine, William Dock compared the significance of the classic work of Anichkov to that of the discovery of the tubercle bacillus by Robert Koch. American biochemist D. Steinberg wrote: \\"If the full significance of his findings had been appreciated at the time, we might have saved more than 30 years in the long struggle to settle the cholesterol controversy and Anitschkow might have won a Nobel Prize\\".J. Lipid Res., 2004, Vol. 45, p. 1583-93. Anichkov elaborated on the doctrines of reticuloendothelial system and autogenic infections. Early life and training His father, Nikolay M. Anichkov (1844‚Äì1916), was a representative of ancient Russian nobility and held the position of Vice-Minister of Education of the Russian Empire. His mother, L. I. Vasiliyeva (1859‚Äì1924), was the daughter of a priest that was founder of the Alexander Nevsky Orthodox church in Rue Daru, Paris. In 1903, Anichkov entered the Imperial Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. There, he became a pupil of prominent Russian histologist Alexander A. Maximow (1874‚Äì1928) and later, in Freiburg, a pupil of the German pathologist Karl Albert Ludwig Aschoff (1866‚Äì1942). Upon his graduation in 1909, Anichkov began to work on his doctoral thesis, titled Inflammatory changes in myocardium: apropos of myocarditis, and he successfully defended it in 1912. In this thesis, he first described the specific heart macrophages that today bear his name Anitschkow cell. At the same time, Anichkov worked on an experimental model of atherosclerosis together with a student, S. Chalatov. They created a model of experimental atherosclerosis. Career in Germany and Russia In 1912, Anichkov moved to Freiburg to work under German pathologist L. Aschoff. The latter was interested in Anichkov's experimental work done in Russia. In Germany he became the first to describe cholesterinesterphagozyten, German for 'cholesteryl ester phagocytes', which derive from macrophages and today are known as foam cells. By histologically analyzing the development of atherosclerotic plaque, Anichkov identified the cell types involved in the atherosclerotic process: smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes. He discovered the leading role of cholesterol in atherosclerosis development (\\"There is no atherosclerosis without cholesterol\\"). Anichkov worked in Aschoff's laboratory up to the time World War I broke out in August 1914. He joined the Russian Army Medical Corps and, from 1914 to 1917, was a physician- in-charge. In 1920, Anichkov was appointed Professor of the Department of Pathological physiology of the Military Medical Academy, a position that he held until 1939. He presented updates on atherosclerosis research at the Congresses in Berlin, Freiburg, W√ºrzburg and Wiesbaden, and at meetings of the Swedish Society of Pathologists, and the International Society of Geographic Pathology. In 1930, after the Congress in Osaka, he went to Tokyo, Niigata, and Kyoto, to deliver a lecture \\"On experimental atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries of the heart\\". He wrote a chapter in E.V. Cowdry's Arteriosclerosis: A Survey of the Problem in 1933. In 1939-46, the lieutenant- general of Medical Corps Anichkov headed the Military Medical Academy's Department of Pathological anatomy. In 1942, Anichkov and A. I. Abrikosov received a State award for their textbook Pathological Anatomy of the Heart and Vessels, in which they gave a detailed account of the development of atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. In their 1998 book titled Medicine's 10 Greatest Discoveries, M. Friedman and M. Friedland included the Anichkov's cholesterol theory in a list of great discoveries in medicine. During Anichkov's work as President of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1946‚Äì53) he participated in the foundation of a number of research institutes and research journals. In this period and later he created a research team in Russian pathology that consisted of 30 professors and many doctors. Family Anichkov was married twice. He had one son, Mily (1920‚Äì1991), who became a Professor of Surgery and Colonel of Medical Corps. His grandson Nikolay M. Anichkov (born in 1941) is Professor of Pathology, Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, formerly Vice-President of the Russian Society of Pathology and head at Department of pathology in North-West State Medical University named after I.I Mechnickov, St. Petersburg, Russia. All N. N. Anichkov's children and colleagues remembered him as a kind-hearted man who was always fair to his coworkers and good to his friends. He died on 7 December 1964 of a myocardial infarction. Degrees and titles held Doctor of Medicine (1909), Doctor of Sciences (1912), Professor of Pathology (1920), lieutenant-general of Medical Corps, State award holder (1940), Fellow of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, President of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences (1946‚Äì53).

She gave the address Discourse on the Injustice of the Laws in Favour of Men, at the Expense of Women to the French National Convention on 30 December 1790. Biography Etta AeldersThe facts in this biography were taken (except where indicated) from the online article by Arboit (added as an external link), which has no page numbers that can be used as references. was the daughter of Jacob Aelders van Nieuwenhuys, a merchant, and Agatha Petronella de Sitter. She was born in Groningen and received a good education, which was remarkable for a girl in her age in a non-aristocratic family. She married Christiaan Ferdinand Lodewijk Palm, the son of an attorney, in 1762. The marriage was not happy and Christiaan disappeared to the East Indies.It is unlikely that they were divorced, as divorce became only possible in the Netherlands in 1796 In 1768 she traveled with Jan Munniks, a young attorney, brother of the celebrated professor of botany Wynoldus Munniks, who had been appointed consul at Messina for the Dutch Republic to France, where she stayed behind because of illness. On the way she met Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins, a former equerry to the widow of Stadtholder William IV, Prince of Orange, who became her lover, and introduced her in higher circles. She left him in 1773 and moved to Paris, where she settled in the Palais Royal area, and became a courtesan for the better classes, taking a number of lovers. In these circumstances she was recruited for the French secret service, possibly by Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Maurepas himself. He sent her to The Hague in 1778 for a short mission, where she again met Jan Munniks, who himself now was a spy in British service. The financial revenues of this mission enabled her to move to a grander house at the Rue Favard in Paris, where she set up a salon, where many \\"political\\" people met. From this time dates her affectation of the title of \\"baroness.\\" Among these people were Dutchmen like Gerard Brantsen, who negotiated the peace between the Republic and Austria in Paris in 1784, and Apollonius Jan Cornelis Lampsins, a prominent Patriot, who sought refuge in France in 1787. Around this time she apparently started working for the Dutch Grand Pensionary Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel,As what we would now call an agent of influence. to whom she became especially valuable after the events of 14 July 1789, when her salon was frequented by prominent revolutionaries like Jean-Paul Marat, Fran√ßois Chabot and Claude Basire.\\"Neuf jours plus tard, la r√©volution amenait de nouvelles fr√©quentations dans son salon. Sa pr√©f√©rence se porta alors vers des d√©put√©s montagnards, comme Jean-Paul Marat, Fran√ßois Chabot ou Claude Basire...\\"; Arboit, op cit Etta now became involved in revolutionary politics, and she was especially active in feminist circles, like the Soci√©t√© fraternelle de l'un et l'autre sexe, Soci√©t√© Patriotique des Amis de la V√©rit√© , and Soci√©t√© Patriotique et de Bienfaisance des Amies de la V√©rit√© .. She set up shop in The Hague where she now spied on French √©migr√©s like Beaumarchais and Dumouriez. However, events in France forced her to change sides again and she imposed on the Stadtholder himself, referring to her old services. Then in early 1795 the French revolutionary armies invaded the Netherlands. The Batavian Republic was proclaimed and Etta became suspect, because she tried to persuade the French representatives at the negotiations for the Treaty of The Hague (1795) to use the right of conquest to the detriment of the new Republic. These machinations, in cohorts with her old acquaintance Jan Munniks, brought her to the attention of the Hague Comit√© van Waakzaamheid (the Dutch equivalent of the French Comit√© de surveillance r√©volutionnaire). Munniks was sentenced to banishment, and Etta was put under arrest in the fortress of Woerden together with her old spymaster Van de Spiegel. She was released at the end of 1798, but her health had suffered so much, that she died the following March.These details are taken from the report of the Comit√© in Rijks Geschiedkundige Publicati√´n Works * Sur l¬¥injustice des Loix en faveur des Hommes, au d√©pens de Femmes, in The French Revolution and Human Rights: A Brief Documentary History, translated, edited, and with an introduction by Lynn Hunt (Bedford/St. Martin's: Boston/New York), 1996, 122‚Äì23. * Appel aux Francoises sur la r√©g√©n√©ration des moeurs, et n√©cessit√© de l'influence des femmes dans un gouvernement libre, L'imprimerie du Cercle Social, (probably) July, 1791.

He was especially interested in geology, and became an expert on the bedrock and fossils of PEI. In an 1882 study, he proposed that it would be possible to dig a tunnel under the Northumberland Strait, which would have enabled the federal government to honour its commitment made when PEI entered Confederation, that constant communication with the mainland be provided. He would later be hired by the federal government to do a more in-depth investigation of the idea, although it was never carried out. Following Sir William Dawson's geological report of 1871, Bain continued the quest to explore the Island's rocks for fossils. Bain added to the record of fossil plants in particular. One of his discoveries was named by Sir William in his honour: Tylodendron Baini. Bain wrote enthusiastically on natural history in a column in the Daily Examiner, as well as publishing many papers in scholarly journals.

Maddox (born 1969) is a British literary novelist and journalist who is best known for his novel My Little Blue Dress (2001) and for his satirical magazine essays. After graduating from Harvard University in 1992, Maddox began his career reviewing books for The New York Times Book Review and The Washington Post Book World. In early 1996, he was appointed to an editorship at Spy magazine and within a few months he was promoted to editor-in-chief, a position he held until the magazine shut down in 1998. Maddox wrote My Little Blue Dress between 1999 and 2001. Since its publication, he has focused on writing satirical essays for magazines such as GEAR and Travel + Leisure; he also contributes a monthly humor column to Discover magazine called \\"Blinded by Science\\", drawing on his early exposure to science and technology. Maddox is likewise a contributing editor to the American edition of The Week magazine. Early years Maddox was born in London in 1969 to former Nature editor, the late Sir John Maddox, a writer on science and nature, and Brenda Maddox, a biographer of Rosalind Franklin, W. B. Yeats, Nora Barnacle and several others. He has one sister, Bronwen Maddox, who became a journalist, was Chief Foreign Commentator of The Times and Editor of Prospect magazine and is now Director of the Institute for Government. Maddox enjoyed a privileged life during his childhood and youth, because of his father's position as editor of Nature, encountering some of the leading scientific thinkers of the day and enjoying dinners with figures such as James Watson and Sir Fred Hoyle. Despite his family's background in science, Maddox was interested in the humanities while he attended Westminster School, an independent boys' school in London. Maddox went on to study English literature at Harvard University and graduated in 1992. He published his only article in the student newspaper The Harvard Crimson during his senior year. He won the undergraduate Thomas Temple Hoopes Prize for his senior thesis \\"on the use of adjectives in restaurant menus\\" titled Maltese: A Gastrosophic Theory of Reading. After graduation Maddox moved from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Moscow‚Äîwhere he worked for three weeks as the English-language editor of a Russian magazine‚Äîand then to New York City, where he spent two years working odd jobs, including hand-delivering celebrity invitations to local parties. Maddox's freelance writing career began in 1994, when he became a book reviewer for The New York Times Book Review and The Washington Post, where he developed a reputation for writing scathing reviews that would later help him land a job as an editor at Spy magazine. Maddox described his book reviewing style as \\"pretty vicious\\", and quipped that he \\"was a frustrated, twenty-something guy, sitting in his bedroom venting existential rage on these nasty academics\\". His last book review for The Washington Post was in late 1996; however, he continued reviewing for The New York Times up until 1998, contributing only a couple of reviews thereafter. At the beginning of the dot-com boom, Maddox found full-time work at an information technology company, where he worked for a year and a half. Editorship of Spy magazine In mid-1996, Maddox was hired as a senior editor at Spy magazine, a satirical monthly, in New York City. Spy had ceased publication in 1994 but was quickly resuscitated under new ownership by Sussex Publishers Inc., which reduced the magazine's frequency from ten to six issues a year. At Spy, Maddox was assisted by deputy editor Adam Lehner, a satirist. In December 1996, Maddox was promoted to editor-in-chief; his editorial team included Jared Paul Stern and, beginning in late 1997, future screenwriter William Monahan. Maddox wanted to turn Spy into a national magazine rather than build on its legacy of covering stories that centered on New York. According to Maddox, two factors motivated the shift of target market. The magazine's past objects of satire, the \\"cheesy villains who anointed themselves as targets\\" in the 1980s, were no longer on the national stage. Meanwhile, the \\"sins of the '90s [were] those of a private, quiet cultivation of a sense of purity\\", and were harder to expose or ridicule. In early 1998, Sussex Publishers increased Spy's frequency from six to nine issues a year in an effort to boost readership and ad pages. Spy's paid circulation continued to drop during Maddox's tenure, and in March 1998, the magazine once again ceased publication. Sussex's President and CEO John Colman concluded that \\"[despite the] great work by Bruno and his team, there just wasn't the [advertiser and consumer] acceptance that we need to make it financially viable\\". Maddox conceded that \\"a satirical magazine in New York in the late Nineties really had no function\\", because \\"everyone was being very modest and coy\\". My Little Blue Dress In 1999, Maddox sold the advance rights to his first novel, My Little Blue Dress, to a German publisher based on a five-page fax proposal he sent on the advice of his literary agent John Brockman. Within a week Brockman managed to sell the rights to the novel to publishers in an additional eight countries on the strength of the proposal alone. (Maddox had not yet written even an initial manuscript.) My Little Blue Dress was published in 2001 by Viking Press, a Penguin Group imprint. The novel begins as a memoir of a hundred-year-old woman, but several chapters later reveals itself to be a spoof of the genre. The protagonist is a fictional Bruno Maddox who is desperately attempting to create a forgery of an old woman's memoir in a single night. Several book reviewers avoided spoiling the novel's satire but others gave away its premise, reasoning that the publisher \\"reveal[s] all on the book jacket anyway\\". The novel's intrigue lies in the mysterious reason compelling the fictional Maddox to forge a memoir. Critics applauded My Little Blue Dress but also expressed some reservations. For example, Salon.com's Maria Russo cautioned that the novel \\"is one of those 'don't try this at home' literary experiments that could easily have turned into an unreadable, pretentious disaster\\", but concluded that Maddox \\"pulls it off with a kind of fearless pizzazz\\". The New York Times' Emily Barton conceded that \\"for all its blunders\\", Maddox delivers \\"a winsome and vastly entertaining novel\\". In an interview, Maddox praised Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 novel American Psycho, stating that he drew inspiration from protagonist Patrick Bateman's long-winded monologues about Phil Collins, restaurants, clothes, and how to remove blood from his carpets. In 2001, Maddox promoted his first novel on a joint book tour billed as the \\"Minor Novelists Tour\\" with his friend William Monahan, another former Spy editor, but it was interrupted by the 9/11 attacks. Monahan's Light House: A Trifle was also published by a Penguin imprint. Several years later, Maddox gave some indication that he was working on a film adaptation of My Little Blue Dress,Maddox's June 2004 book reviews included a note that read, \\"Bruno Maddox is adapting his novel 'My Little Blue Dress' for the screen.\\" See Maddox's review of P. J. O'Rourke's Peace Kills: America's Fun New Imperialism (New York Post, 6 June 2004) and his review of George Hagen's The Laments (New York Post, 27 June 2004). but it is unknown whether Maddox completed the script.As of 2007 there is no further evidence that Maddox completed the script. Recent essays After the publication of My Little Blue Dress in 2001, Maddox was reportedly working on a second novel set in California, where \\"everyone's aspirational and deluded\\" and the \\"people are quite happy being waiters and dreaming of stardom\\". As of 2009, however, no manuscript has been forthcoming.As of 2009 a second novel from Maddox has not been published, however, in a story (dated 16 October 2009) by Bruno Maddox it is written that \\"Bruno Maddox is at work on his second novel.\\" Since 2001, Maddox has written numerous articles for popular magazines, such as the now-defunct GEAR. Published one year after the 11 September 2001 attacks, his essay \\"Before It Was Real\\" describes the callousness of the terrorists who flew into the World Trade Center through the experience of playing a flight simulator game. Another example of Maddox's work is his 2003 profile of Karl Wenclas, leader of the Underground Literary Alliance, titled \\"The Angriest Book Club in America\\" and published in the fashion magazine BlackBook. Wenclas later derided Maddox for distorting the Underground Literary Alliance in his BlackBook essay and summed up the article as \\"riddled with falsehoods\\". In late 2003, Maddox began to contribute articles regularly to Travel + Leisure. His first article in the magazine was called \\"The Concorde, R.I.P.\\", which chronicled his flight aboard the supersonic Concorde airplane before it was decommissioned; it was later included in The Best Travel Writing 2005, the second volume of the annual Travelers' Tales series. In 2004 Maddox began working as a contributing editor for the American edition of The Week magazine and as of 2007 continues to contribute weekly to the print issue, handling sections including \\"Main Stories\\", \\"Talking Points\\", and \\"Only in America\\". He also reviewed several books for The New York Post in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, Maddox began contributing a regular humor column called \\"Blinded by Science\\" to Discover magazine. His writing draws upon his childhood exposure to science; due to his father's career, his family was immersed in science and he was regularly exposed to scientists at social events. Maddox's first year's columns earned him a nod as a finalist in the 2007 National Magazine Awards' \\"Columns and Commentary\\" category. Maddox's Discover columns are occasionally criticized; his essay \\"Fictional Reality\\", in particular, has been controversial. Maddox declared science fiction obsolete in his essay \\"Fictional Reality\\" and was roundly criticized in the blogosphere, most notably by Scientific American's J.R. Minkel. Maddox wrote that \\"fiction‚Äîall fiction‚Äîfinally became obsolete as a delivery system for big ideas\\" as a result of the \\"scarcity of foreseeable future\\", citing the decline of author Michael Crichton's work as evidence. Minkel lambasted Maddox and pointed to author Neal Stephenson's cutting-edge work as proof to the contrary, venturing that \\"science fiction writers can dictate the future if they have the vim and vision\\". One of Maddox's most recent Discover essays, \\"The James Watson Affair\\", examines comments made by James Watson in an article in London's Sunday Times which led to Watson's suspension at the laboratory where he worked and his eventual retirement, and is skeptical of critics who found Watson's comment about black employees \\"not that big a deal\\" yet charged him with racism for his proposition on black African intelligence; in conclusion, Maddox derides the views held by several critics, stating that in comparison to Watson's statements, \\"the most ignorant and hurtful idea of all, of course, is that the entire topic of race and genes and intelligence is off-limits to all right-thinking, compassionate people, just on principle\\", which pejoratively assumes \\"that some races are innately and immutably much less intelligent than others\\". Maddox's essay, although published in the March 2008 printed edition of Discover, has not been published online. Style Satire is evident in much of Maddox's work, from his years as editor-in-chief for Spy magazine to his numerous articles in Travel + Leisure, and his novel My Little Blue Dress. Maddox's satirical tendencies extend to his interviews and publicity materials. In one interview he made the preposterous claim that he once \\"spent 2 days being a personal assistant to a mafia boss in New York\\". Maddox's Penguin biography skewers his own career, claiming he \\"elevated [Spy] to within spitting distance of its former glory, then accidentally bankrupted it after two short years\\", which led The Harvard Crimson, his alma mater's student newspaper, to speculate that \\"Maddox himself had a hand in writing\\" it. Maddox's popular science columns for Discover magazine impart his own personal views on science with a markedly humorous and skeptical bent.

She is the chief foreign correspondent for The Sunday Times. Lamb has won fifteen major awards including four British Press Awards and the European Prix Bayeux- Calvados for war correspondents. She is an Honorary Fellow of University College, Oxford, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and a Global Fellow for the Wilson Centre for International Affairs in Washington D.C. In 2013 she was awarded an OBE by the Queen for services to journalism. In November 2018 Lamb received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Dundee. She has written nine books including the bestselling The Africa House and I Am Malala, co-written with Malala Yousafzai, which was named Popular Non-Fiction Book of the Year in the British National Book Awards 2013.  Education  Lamb was educated at Nonsuch High School for Girls, Cheam and graduated with a BA in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics from University of Oxford.  Career  In 1988, Lamb was awarded Young Journalist of the Year for her coverage of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. As a journalist, Lamb travelled with the Mujahidin fighting the Soviet occupation, spending the next two years living in Peshawar. She has reported on Pakistan and Afghanistan for more than three decades. Lamb has been based in Islamabad and Rio de Janeiro for the Financial Times and Johannesburg and Washington D.C. for The Sunday Times. She has covered wars from Iraq to Libya, Angola to Syria; repression from Eritrea to Zimbabwe; and journeyed to the far reaches of the Amazon to visit remote tribes. She pays particular attention to issues such as the girls abducted by Boko Haram in Nigeria, Yazidi sex slaves in Iraq, and the plight of Afghan women. In November 2001, Lamb was deported from Pakistan after uncovering evidence of a covert operation by rogue elements in the ISI, Pakistan's military intelligence service, to smuggle arms to the Taliban. In 2006, she narrowly escaped with her life when caught in a Taliban ambush of British troops in Helmand. She was on Benazir Bhutto's bus when it was blown up in October 2007. I Am Malala, an account of the life of main author Malala Yousafzai, has been translated into 40 languages, and has sold close to two million copies worldwide. Her book Nujeen: One Girl's Incredible Journey from War-torn Syria in a Wheelchair co-written with Nujeen Mustafa, was published by William Collins (London) in September 2016 and was translated in nine languages. The book Nujeen inspired a five-movement cantata Everyday Wonders: The Girl from Aleppo written by Kevin Crossley-Holland (text) and Cecilia McDowall (music) first performed by The National Children's Choir of Great Britain in Birmingham Town Hall on 10 August 2018. Lamb's latest book Our Bodies, Their Battlefield was published by William Collins (London) in March 2020 and by Scribner (New York) in September 2020 and was translated in nine languages.

In 2009, Lamb's portrait was on display in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. A photograph of her by Francesco Guidicini is in the Photographs Collection of the National Portrait Gallery. She inspired the character Esther in the novel The Zahir (2005) written by Paulo Coelho. In 2017, she was the first female former undergraduate of University College, Oxford to be elected an Honorary Fellow. The Fellowship was awarded in recognition of \\"her courageous, vivid and critically important journalism, as well as for her support of the College\\".

First Parish Dorchester is a Unitarian Universalist church in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Emigrants from Dorchester, Dorset and the southwest of England founded the town of Dorchester March 30, 1630 and established the church in 1631. The first church building was a crude log cabin thatched with grass. As well as the church, the Puritans founded the first elementary school supported by public money in the New World. They held the first town meeting at the church, which determined policy through open and frequent discussion. The congregation's fifth building burned in February 1896, and the current building was completed in 1897. As of spring 2015, First Parish completed the third of five phases in a $7 million restoration project, which began November 2006. The most recent phase included accessibility improvements, exterior repairs and painting, and steeple restoration. Future work will include renovation and office reorganization in the parish hall, and a significant footprint expansion to provide much-needed community, classroom, and activity space. Social justice The church played a strong role as the hub of political and social life in Dorchester. The original Puritan congregation is still remembered for establishing the country's first tax- supported, free public school in 1636. In 1641, Dorcas Ye Blackmore, a servant to Israel Stoughton, was the first recorded African American to join a church in New England, and she taught Stoughton's Native American servants about the gospel message, and the church attempted to help Dorcas gain her freedom.http://www.blackpast.org/aah/dorcas-blackmore-ca-1620Winthrop's Journal, \\"History of New England,\\" 1630-1649 New England's First Fruits The first four meetinghouses acted as Dorchester‚Äôs town hall. The fifth building, built in 1816, was the host to many social justice leaders, such as William Lloyd Garrison and Theodore Parker, because of First Parish's long-standing pastor, the Reverend Nathaniel Hall, who was dedicated to the abolitionist cause. In the 1880s, the work of First Parish‚Äôs minister, Christopher R. Eliot, and the Fields Corner Congregational Church‚Äôs minister, the Reverend T.J. Volentine, inspired First Parish members and friends to organize the Fields Corner Industrial School for local children, which evolved into Dorchester House, a multi-service health center. Today, First Parish is an important resource for Dorchester‚Äôs Vietnamese, African-American, Caribbean, Irish, Latino, Haitian, and Cape Verdean residents. The staff collaborates with educators, health-care providers and other local groups to alleviate hunger, violence, racism, and other effects of poverty. Originally from First Parish Dorchester In its 383-year history, many people have come through First Parish and made an enduring impact on their communities. First Parish ministers and their periods of tenure were: Rev. Elizabeth A. Carrier- Ladd (2020 ‚Äì ) Rev. Terry L. Sweetser (interim, 2019 ‚Äì 2020) Rev.

Fifield, second woman elected to the School Committee Meetinghouse First Parish Church in Dorchester is the sixth meetinghouse erected by First Parish Church since 1630, and the fifth building to stand at this location on Meetinghouse Hill since 1673. It is the only example in Boston of Colonial Revival ecclesiastical architecture stylized after the traditional wooden New England meetinghouse. When the fifth building was lost to fire in February 1896, church members decided by a vote held only 11 days after the fire that ‚Äúa meeting-house be built substantially upon the lines as to the exterior as it was before.‚Äù On the dedication day of the sixth building in May 1897, the building committee‚Äôs chairman shared with the audience that ‚ÄúThe vote determining the character of the building was, we believe, expressive of the desires, not only of our own people, but also of a great number of others, who from direct or collateral descent trace back their ancestry to the old meeting-house or one of its predecessors‚Ä¶It was therefore thought wise, while making a more symmetrical and harmonious whole, to preserve the better features of the old colonial type of meeting-house, thus keeping unbroken the train of ideas which came with the good ship ‚ÄòMary & John‚Äô [in 1630].‚Äù Indeed, many descendants of the original Puritans still resided in Dorchester and were members of First Parish. These living representatives undoubtedly influenced the decision to replicate a traditional building exterior. However, the members did not allow themselves to be trapped by cloying nostalgia too much; they soon voted to demolish the smaller vestry that survived the fire in order to create a larger Parish hall. In 1913 they expanded the building again to install a stage to accommodate activities that would attract younger people, and ensure membership growth. The scale of the new building was intended to host large numbers of people for a variety of activities; church meeting notes regularly record concerns about serving the community needs ‚Äì socially, spiritually, and economically. The original architects were principals of the Boston architectural firm, Cabot, Everett & Mead, which designed buildings for notable people and institutions. Arthur Greene Everett and Samuel W. Mead, former draftsmen of Edward Clarke Cabot, joined as principals of the firm in 1885. Cabot is best known for his design of the Boston Athenaeum. Under Everett and Mead, after Cabot‚Äôs retirement in 1888, the firm designed a large shingle style home in Nova Scotia for Alexander Graham Bell four years before their work at First Parish. Everett was originally from Boston, though served an internship with the famous New York City architecture firm, McKim, Mead & White. Mead and Everett had connections to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äôs department of architecture, the former teaching classes there and the latter as an alumnus. Mead also had traveled and studied in Europe, as the second winner of MIT‚Äôs prestigious Rotch Traveling Scholarship. For a congregation steeped in Boston heritage, this pedigree surely mattered and their design helped the congregation succeed in the goal of creating a near-replica of the fifth building. The few alterations that have occurred on the site were shaped by the minds of other influential Boston architects, also with MIT connections. In 1909, Mr. Everett worked with Arthur Asahel Shurtleff (later known as Shurcliff) to complete a landscape project on the site, including the design and installation of the cast-iron fence and memorial gates that stand today. Shurtleff, an MIT graduate of the Engineering department in 1894, had partnered with Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., to form the first four-year landscape architecture program in the country at Harvard University ten years before the First Parish landscape project. In 1913, architect Edwin Lewis, Jr., provided his services to oversee changes to the Parish hall that would provide more meeting and entertainment spaces for the congregation and community. In 1907, Frank Chouteau Brown, editor of the Architectural Record and fellow Boston architect, lauded Lewis, another graduate of MIT‚Äôs school of architecture (1881), as one of the leading architects of suburban Boston. Fortunately for First Parish, he was also a member and lay leader who provided his services at a reduced rate for these projects, and donated the organ chimes in 1925. Lewis designed many of the large single-family homes in the more affluent neighborhoods of Dorchester. The current congregation is mindful of their church‚Äôs legacy; it signed a preservation restriction agreement with the Massachusetts Historical Commission to ensure that their investment in its preservation is secure and future alterations will respect the historic integrity without sacrificing community service.

Statutory Provisions Community health councils were obliged to meet in public under the provisions of the Community Health Councils (Access to Information) Act 1988. They were entitled to be consulted about the provision of local pharmacies. Half the members were appointed by local authorities, a third by local voluntary organisations and a sixth by the Regional health authority, which provided the finance to pay staff and costs. They were entitled to be consulted on any substantial development of the health service and on any proposals to make any substantial variation in the service. The question of what constituted a substantial variation was subject to repeated litigation. Abolition in England They were abolished in 2003 in England as part of the NHS Plan 2000. Unlike the other proposals in the Plan there was no preceding discussion about this move, nor any clear explanation for this decision, which aroused considerable unhappiness amongst the staff and members. In England a new structure, Public and Patient Involvement Forums, was established in 2003. These were replaced by local involvement networks (LINks) and these have now also been superseded in NHS England by the establishment - as a result of the English NHS reforms in 2012 - by new organisations called Healthwatch. These do not, however, have the same resources, statutory powers or responsibilities as CHCs. Wales Up until 2010 there were 19 CHCs in Wales. However, as a result of the passing by the Welsh Assembly Government of the Community Health Councils (Constitution, Membership and Procedures) (Wales) Regulations 2010, these were replaced by eight CHCs. These covered larger geographical areas, and were largely co- terminus with the smaller number of health boards which had been established to replace most NHS Trusts in Wales. In 2015, Brecknock and Radnor Community Health Council and Montgomeryshire Community Health Council merged to create Powys Community Health Council leading to the current seven Community Health Councils in Wales. The community health councils in Wales work to enhance and improve the quality of your local health service. They are the patients statutory and independent voice in health services provided throughout Wales. Members are drawn equally from three sources; local authority representatives, nominees from local third-sector bodies and members appointed by the Minister in response to advert. CHCs also have the right to co-opt non-voting members to the council. The key function of the CHC is to represent the interests of the public in the health service in their district. Each CHC currently monitors and evaluates from the patient's viewpoint the effectiveness of NHS services provided by all NHS establishments, including hospitals, GPs, pharmacies, opticians, care homes, dentists, etc. Every autumn, the Hospital Patient Environment (HPE) visits take place, this is where all the CHCs collect data on their local district general and a selection of community hospitals and report on their finding. A report is produced on these findings by the Board of Community Health Councils and sent to the Welsh Assembly Government. The Board of Community Health Councils in Wales is the National body for all CHCs in Wales. The CHCs also provide a free, independent and confidential advocacy service to patients who seek advice and support in the process of pursuing a complaint against the NHS. At the time of the launch of the new CHCs in 2010, the then Health Minister for Wales, Edwina Hart, indicated that they would be reviewed after two years, to evaluate how they were working. In February 2012 the then Minister for Health and Social Services at the Welsh Government, Mrs Lesley Griffiths, formally announced the Terms of Reference for this review, which was led by Professor Marcus Longley, Director of the Welsh Institute for Health and Social Care and reported back to the Minister in June 2012. This was followed in late 2012/early 2013 by a consultation on proposals for modernising and strengthening the role, organisation, accountability and visibility of CHCs in Wales. The proposals were accepted by the new Health Minister, Professor Mark Drakeford, in a report back to a Plenary Session of the National Assembly for Wales Senedd in March 2013, where the Minister confirmed his continuing support for CHCs in Wales. Although legislation will be required to implement some of the proposals, most are likely to be put in place without the need for legislation, with the Board of CHCs in wales taking the lead role in co- ordinating the work.

A member of the Braves' organization for 23 years, he was inducted into the Braves Hall of Fame in 2006. Lucas was born in Jacksonville, Florida. A graduate of Florida A&M; University, he served as an officer in the United States Army. He then signed as an infielder with the Milwaukee Braves in 1957 and played for six seasons in the club's farm system, batting .273 in 655 games. He joined the Braves' front office in 1965, working in sales and promotions during the team's relocation to Atlanta before he switched to the player development department in 1967. Lucas was named the director of the Braves' farm system in 1972 and promoted to GM responsibilities on September 17, 1976. At the time, the Braves were in last place in the National League West Division, 30 games out of the division lead. Lucas' official title was vice president of player personnel, but owner Ted Turner gave him all the duties of a general manager. With players like Dale Murphy coming up through Lucas' minor league system, and the selection of Bob Horner as the top pick in the 1978 Major League Baseball Draft, the Braves began assembling the team that would win the 1982 division title. But the job of rebuilding the Braves was compounded by Turner's tempestuous behavior. On May 11, 1977, the owner appointed himself the Braves' field manager during a losing streak. His dugout reign drew national headlines but lasted only one day before the president of the National League ruled that Turner, as an owner, could not appoint himself manager. Then, starting in 1978, Lucas found himself caught between Turner and players like rookie Horner and veteran pitcher Phil Niekro, a future Hall of Famer, during contentious contract negotiations. On the evening of May 1, 1979, with the Braves on the road facing the Pittsburgh Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium, Lucas watched on television from his Atlanta home as Niekro won his 200th Major League game, 5‚Äì2. Hours after congratulating Niekro by phone, Lucas was stricken with cardiac arrest and a massive cerebral hemorrhage. He died three days later without regaining consciousness at age 43. At his passing, he was still the highest-ranking black executive in professional baseball. Said Murphy at Lucas' funeral: \\"Bill's dream was for this organization to become a success. It is our sacred honor to be chosen to fulfill his dream.\\" His widow, Rubye, later served on the board of directors of the Turner Broadcasting System and as president of the William D. Lucas Fund, which helps send young baseball players to college. Lucas' sister, Barbara, was the former wife of Braves' Hall of Famer and home run king Henry Aaron. The two were married from 1953 to 1971.

Description  Method  Each node implementing WRP keeps a table of routes and distances and link costs. It also maintains a 'message retransmission list' (MRL). Routing table entries contain distance to a destination node, the previous and next nodes along the route, and is tagged to identify the route's state: whether it is a simple path, loop or invalid route. (Storing the previous and successive nodes assists in detecting loops and avoiding the counting-to-infinity problem ‚Äì a shortcoming of Distance Vector Routing.) The link cost table maintains the cost of the link to its nearest neighbors (nodes within direct transmission range), and the number of timeouts since successfully receiving a message from the neighbor. Nodes periodically exchange routing tables with their neighbors via update messages, or whenever the link state table changes. The MRL maintains a list of which neighbors are yet to acknowledged an update message, so they can be retransmitted if necessary. Where no change in the routing table, a node is required to transmit a 'hello' message to affirm its connectivity. When an update message is received, a node updates its distance table and reassesses the best route paths. It also carries out a consistency check with its neighbors, to help eliminate loops and speed up convergence.  Shortcomings  WRP has the same advantage as that of DSDV. In addition, it has faster convergence and involves fewer table updates. But the complexity of maintenance of multiple tables demands a larger memory and greater processing power from nodes in the ad hoc wireless network. At high mobility, the control overhead involved in updating table entries is almost the same as that of DSDV and hence is not suitable for highly dynamic and also for a very large ad hoc wireless network. WRP requires large memory storage and resources in maintaining its tables. The protocol is not suitable for large mobile ad hoc networks as it suffers from limited scalability.

Music writer Elijah Wald has described it as \\"a hypnotic lament\\" and \\"his first unquestionable masterpiece\\".Wald, Elijah (2004). Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues. Amistad. . p. 142. A sometime traveling companion and fellow musician, Johnny Shines, recalled that Johnson's performance of the song could be overpowering: Background Blues scholars have identified a body of previously recorded songs with direct and indirect melodic similarities. Edward Komara suggests a line of recordings with notably high degree of sales and of imitation by other artists: 1925 \\"How Long Daddy How Long\\" (Ida Cox with Papa Charlie Jackson); 1928 \\"How Long How Long Blues\\" (Leroy Carr with Scrapper Blackwell); 1930 \\"Sitting on Top of the World: (Mississippi Sheiks); 1934 \\"Six Feet in the Ground\\" (St. Louis Jimmy Oden). Former neighbours report that Johnson learned \\"How Long\\" from Carr's record in the year following its release. Komara suggests that Johnson's thumbed bass lines in \\"Come On in My Kitchen\\" were directly inspired by Carr's piano in \\"How Long\\" and that part of humming and slide guitar playing copied the violin of Lonnie Chatman of the Sheiks on \\"Sitting on Top of the World\\".Komara, Edward (2007). The Road to Robert Johnson: The Genesis and Evolution of Blues in the Delta From the Late 1800s Through 1938. Hal Leonard. . Elijah Wald suggests that Johnson's main inspiration was Tampa Red's 1934 \\"Things 'Bout Coming My Way\\".Wald (2004). p. 144. The structure of this melodic family is an eight bar blues with a couplet followed by a refrain. The repeated refrain gives textual unity to the song, and generally sets an emotional tone to which the couplet verses conform. Lyrics In his two takes, Johnson created two texts based on the refrain and on a consistent emotional projection. In both, his opening verse is a wordless hum, and his central verse is the spoken address to his woman \\"Can't you hear that wind howl\\" as his guitar imitates the sound of winter wind. Only two sung verses are common to both takes. One describes the isolation of the woman: \\"Everybody throws her down\\". The other establishes the regretful retrospective mood of the singer: This verse had been used by Skip James in the emotionally similar \\"Devil Got My Woman\\". Some critics believe that Johnson copied the verse either directly from James or indirectly through Johnny TempleKomara (2007) p.29Wald (2004) p. 142 The issued second take has three other verses, all of which could fit easily into other songs. His woman \\"is up the country, won't write to me\\". The singer \\"went up the mountain\\" only to see that \\"another man got my woman\\". He is an orphan: \\"Ain't got nobody to care for me\\" The unissued first take was slower, with time for only two other verses. These are perhaps closer to the central mood with themes of separation and of winter. The woman won't come back: \\"I've taken the last nickel, out of her nation sack\\". A \\"nation sack\\" was a pouch for carrying money and personal effects, originally a juke joint keeper's \\"donation sack\\" to hold the takings.Calt, Stephen. (2009). Barrelhouse Words, A Blues Dialect Dictionary. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. In one interpretation, the nation sack would have contained nine silver coins as a love spell.[9] Harry Middleton Hyatt, Hoodoo - Conjuration - Witchcraft - Rootwork, 5v., 4766pp., (1935-1939). \\"Spell #13008\\". Contained in this work are interviews with hoodoo practitioners illustrating the use and meaning of the nation sack. In the other verse, winter is coming but \\"That's dry long so\\". The phrase has changed its meaning, but originally meant \\"without a cause\\" or \\"that's just how it is\\".Calt (2009) Recording and releases Johnson recorded the song on November 23, 1936, at the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio, Texas ‚Äì his first recording session. Two takes were preserved. Vocalion Records issued the second take in 1937; Columbia Records chosen the first for Johnson's first compilation King of the Delta Blues Singers (1961). Wald believes that the Vocalion producers considered the first take to be too mournful and uncommercial, and told Johnson to sing a more upbeat variant for the second take. Wald feels that the inferior take was the one actually issued in 1937.Wald (2004) pp. 144-145 Notes Category:Robert Johnson songs Category:Songs written by Robert Johnson Category:1936 songs ","title":"Come On in My Kitchen"},{"id":"10690540","text":"Pr√¢slea the Brave and the Golden Apples (Pr√¢slea cel voinic »ôi merele de aur) is a Romanian fairy tale collected by Petre Ispirescu in Legende sau basmele rom√¢nilor.Ioana Sturdza, Raymond Vianu, Mary L«éz«érescu, Fairy Tales and Legends from Romania p 301 Twayne Publishers, New York 1982 Synopsis A king had a magnificent garden with a tree that bore golden apples, but he never ate them, because every year, the apples were stolen as they became ripe. None of his guards could catch the thief. His oldest two sons tried, one year after the other, but fell asleep near midnight. The next year, the youngest son, Pr√¢slea, tried. He set up two stakes to prick him if he ever started to lean in his sleep. At midnight, he heard rustling and shot an arrow. In the morning, a trail of blood led away, and the apples were ripe. The king was pleased, but Pr√¢slea wanted to track the thief. He and his brothers followed the blood to a ravine, where the older two brothers tried to have the others lower each one of them, grew frightened, and came back. Pr√¢slea had them lower him. He found a copper castle. There, a lovely maiden told him she was a princess, and that the ogres (Zmeu) that had kidnapped her and her two sisters had wanted to marry them, but the sisters had put them off with demands. He fought with the ogre there and killed him; went on to the second castle, of silver, and killed the second ogre; went on the third castle, of gold, where the ogre thief was, and wrestled with him as well. It was a longer fight, and Pr√¢slea called on a raven to drop some tallow on him, in return for three corpses. This strengthened him, and he fought on. Then both the ogre and Pr√¢slea called on the princess there to give them water; she gave it to Pr√¢slea, and he killed the ogre. The princesses showed him a magic whip that made golden apples. Each of them took one. Pr√¢slea brought the princesses back and sent them up. The older two told the brothers that they would marry them. Then Pr√¢slea sent up a stone with his cap. His brothers dropped it, to kill him, and married the older sisters. Pr√¢slea saved some eaglets from a dragon, and their mother, in gratitude, carried him to the other world. There, he found that the youngest princess was being pressed to accept a suitor. She said that she would accept only if she received a golden distaff and spindle that would spin of themselves, because the ogre had given her one. Pr√¢slea went to work for the silversmith who had to do this and brought out the one the ogre had given her, using the golden apple. The princess then demanded a golden hen with golden chick, and when he produced it, insisted that he be brought before her, because he had to have the golden apple. They recognized Pr√¢slea. He and his brothers went outside and shot arrows into the air. The brothers' arrows hit and killed them, but Pr√¢slea's hit the ground. He married the youngest princess. Parallels A similar tale exists in Azerbaijani folklore.Simurgh#In Azerbaijani folklore In an ancient tale about Malik Mammad, the son of one of the wealthiest kings of Azerbaijan, that king had a big garden. In the center of this garden was a magical apple tree that yielded apples every day. An ugly giant named Div stole all the apples every night. The king sent Malik Mammad and his elder brothers to fight the giant. In the course of this tale, Malik Mammad saves Simurgh's babies from a dragon. In return, Simurgh resolved to help Malik Mammad. When Malik Mammad wanted to pass from The Dark world into the Light world, Simurgh asked him to provide 40 half carcasses of meat and 40 wineskins filled with water. When Simurgh put the water on its left wing and the meat on its right wing, Malik Mammad was able to enter the Light world.

The film is set in Louisiana where Fred Brown returns from the Vietnam war to find his wife in bed with her lover and slaughters the whole family sparing the newborn son. After the massacre, he is attacked by and blinded by a falcon. Twenty years later a group of students led by Steve and Anne meet Brown, and begin their search for a nearly extinct breed of woodpecker and come across grisly occurrences including boys being killed by vengeful zombies. The film was first released in July 1988 in France, and in August in Italy. Plot Fred Brown, a soldier, returns to Louisiana from the Vietnam war to find his wife in bed with another man, and kills them both and his parents, only sparing his son. While he is cleaning his knife, a falcon attacks him and tears out his left eye and blinds him in the other. He ends up at a hospital where he says goodbye to the child before he is taken into foster care. Twenty years later, a small group of college seniors, Steve Porter, Mary, Paul, Anne, Rob, Jennifer and a local cop, Brian, are assigned to locate the Green billed woodpecker, a rare species which will be officially extinct by 1992, four years after the current point of the movie. Steven and Anne meet with Fred Brown, who gives them a packet of information on the bird they're searching for. The group makes the former home of Brown their ‚Äúbase‚Äù for as long as they're searching, which turns up nothing on their first day other than a rotting corpse in an abandoned truck. Upon settling in the house, strange occurrences, such as doors closing on their own and Steve seeing things that aren‚Äôt there, begin. These become more prevalent as time goes by, including a nightmare where Brown kills Mary in a similar fashion to how he killed his wife. While exploring the aviary she discovered earlier, Jennifer is chased into a tool shed by a zombie, only to be beaten to death by another that was hiding in there. Brian is burnt to death in a freak accident caused by the fuel leaking from the generator. Mary, who suspects it to be the man in her dream who killed Jennifer, finds her corpse. The survivors make it to the camper only to realize that Brian had the keys. While Rob makes an attempt to hot wire the camper, a zombie attacks and kills Mary. They quickly abandon the camper to make a last stand in Brown's house while Brown suffers a mild heart attack when he realizes what is happening. While trying to fix the generator, a door slams open and blows dust into the room, frightening Rob into running into the generator. His necklace is caught in the generator, and he is strangled to death when the wire cuts into his throat. Paul, who witnessed the whole thing and didn't help Rob, tells Steve and Anne that it was the zombies who killed him. It is revealed by an email sent by Brown to Rob's computer that Steve is the baby Brown spared twenty years earlier. A zombie breaks into the house, and nearly kills Anne, however Steve saves her at the cost of a shotgun he found. Steve, Paul and Anne hide in the attic, where a fourth zombie attacks and results in the death of Paul when he panics. In the morning, the zombies‚Äô attacks have ceased, allowing Steve and Anne to escape the house, meeting Brown in the process. He tells them to get out and that the zombies were never after Steven and Anne, only those of their group that showed fear of them. The credits begin to roll as Steve and Anne look away in despair when they hear Brown's scream emanate from the house. Their fates are not revealed.

Green as Prof. Green Production =Pre-production= Claudio Lattanzi grew up dreaming of making films and met Dario Argento and Michele Soavi. Lattanzi assisted Soavi on his documentary film Dario Argento's World of Horror and was an assistant on his film Stage Fright. The producer of Stage Fright, Aristide Massaccesi then offered Lattanzi a chance to direct Killing Birds when Soavi turned down to offer to take up Argento's offer to make The Church. According to Lattanzi, during the Christmas Holidays of 1986, he had written a story called Il cancello obsoleto about a record producer who invites a rock band to a deserted house to record a tune, without knowing that Nazi soldier corpses are buried there. Lattanzi stated that Massaccesi asked him to reshape the story by replacing the rock band and the Nazis with birds. Lattanzi said the new film would be titled Artigli () which Massaccesi rejected, saying it sounded too much like it would be a documentary about cats. A screenplay was then written by Daniele Stroppa with English dialogue revised by Sheila Goldberg. Claudio Fragasso and Rossella Drudi maintained conversely that Killing Birds - Raptors was from a story they wrote entitled Artigli. An Italian DVD of the film includes a PDF of the film with a 12-page treatment titled Artigli signed by Lattanzi and Bruna Antonucci, dated January 29, 1987, which Italian film historian Roberto Curti said was \\"very similar to the finished film\\" and dismissed Fragasso's and Drudi's claims. The credited director on the film has been unclear, with many crew members stating that the film was actually directed by the producer Aristide Massaccesi (Joe D'Amato). Massaccesi stated in an interview \\"It seemed to me that the most sensible thing was to give the job of directing the dialogues to (Soavi's) assistant, Claudio Lattanzi, while I took care of the special effects scenes. In the end, I let (Lattanzi) sign as the director. =Filming and direction credit= Killing Birds was filmed on location in Thibodaux, Louisiana with a small crew of eight to nine members. The cinematographer was Massaccesi himself under the name Fred Sloniscko, Jr., one of his many aliases. The film \\"was shot with sync sound, and no overdubbing\\". There is debate about who is the actual director of Killing Birds. Some sources state that Massaccesi directed the film, while Rossella Drudi said that Claudio Lattanzi was a front for the direction because Aristide could not be credited on too many films as a producer and director\\". Antonio Bonifacio, who is credited as the film's assistant director, remembered it differently, stating that D'Amato, after making Bonifacio himself the offer to direct (which he declined), then made Lattanzi, who had no idea how to direct a film, the offer to simply be credited and to be on set in case a journalist or anyone else dropped by, but that D'Amato would direct the film himself, which Lattanzi accepted. Bonifacio further stated that from the beginning, Lattanzi was simply there on set and watched while Massaccesi was directing, and that it therefore was not true that Massaccesi took over from Lattanzi at some later point. Similarly, scenarist Rossella Drudi remembered that it had been directed by D'Amato and not Lattanzi. Both these statements are corroborated by Massaccesi himself as cited, without any indication of date, in the Nocturno Dossier posthumously devoted to him, who said that he had directed it all by himself although he would have liked to continue his tradition of handing over directing to young directors, but that in the case of Lattanzi, there had been no such directorial agreement as with Fabrizio Laurenti or Michele Soavi. Lattanzi stated that he acknowledged Massaccessi's presence on the set but described the film as being directed \\"in symbiosis\\" as well as that he should have the name on the film and specifically chose certain shots and scenes. Massaccesi opined that he personally took care of shots involving special effects, allowing Lattanzi to sign for the film. Release Killing Birds was released in France on 13 July 1988 as L'attaque des morts-vivants and later in Italy on 19 August 1988. Like other Filmirage films, Killing Birds had two versions prepared for it. One for foreign markets with more gore and effects, while the version released in Italy toned down the gore and replacing it with footage of close-ups of birds or actors. It was released under various titles to make it part of other film series on home video, this included the Italian DVD titled Killing Birds‚ÄìZombi 5, and in the United Kingdom as Zombie Flesheaters 4.

They were intended for use against small ground or naval targets. The Kh-66 was effectively a heavy-warhead, beam-riding version of the K-8 (AA-3 'Anab') air- to-air missile rushed into service in Vietnam in 1968. The Kh-23 was an improved Kh-66 with command-guidance, similar to the AGM-12 Bullpup. Development Work on air-to-air missiles had started at the Kaliningrad Engineering Plant (then known as Plant #455, and later merged into Zvezda- Strela) in 1955. This had resulted in the Kaliningrad K-5 (AA-1 'Alkali') family of beam-guided missiles, including the K-51 (RS-2-US) carried by the Su-9 'Fishpot'. OKB-4 Molniya (later Vympel NPO) under Matus Bisnovat would go on to produce missiles such as the AA-6 Acrid. Meanwhile, in 1963 the RS-2-US was tested as an air-to-surface missile. It was concluded that the small warhead and inaccurate guidance made such an application \\"pointless\\". However, in 1965 North Vietnam requested an air-to-surface missile from the Soviet government; the AGM-12 Bullpup had entered service with the US Air Force before the start of the Vietnam War. In April 1965 OKB-134 (later NPO Vympel) started work on this missile under the project name Kh-23, but they had problems developing a guidance system that would work with existing aircraft. As a result, Yurii N. Korolyov came up with his own proposals based on the earlier experiments with the RS-2-US. A design bureau to develop the RS-2-US for surface targets was set up under Korolyov by decree #100 of 12 March 1966 of the Ministry of the Aircraft Industry; this bureau would become the Zvezda OKB in 1976. The resulting weapon used the body of a K-8 (AA-3 'Anab') K-5 guidance and propulsion systems but increased the warhead from to . This had the big advantage of allowing the new weapon to be fitted to any aircraft capable of firing the K-5. Design began in 1966, so the project was known as Kh-66 or Izdeliye 66 ('Article 66'). The Kh-66 was a beam-riding weapon that was tested on a MiG-21PFM and entered production in 1968 for that aircraft. The Kh-66 was only an interim solution as it required the launch aircraft to dive towards the target to maintain lock on the target. Flight testing of the Kh-66 began in 1967 and it entered service on 20 June 1968. Meanwhile, Korolyov took over work on the Kh-23 project intended for carriage on the Soviet Union's new MiG-23. The Kh-23 became a development of the Kh-66 design with an improved propellant and new Delta-R1M guidance system. The main practical difference was that it was a line-of-sight radio-command weapon similar to the Bullpup, allowing it to be fired in level flight (unlike the Kh-66). The first ten were tested in early 1968, but significant delays were caused by problems with unreliable guidance which was eventually traced to the smoke generator which interfered with the antenna. Once the receiver had been moved to a tail extension, the government tested the missile on the MiG-23 and MiG-23B between 20 March 1970 and 3 October 1973. and it entered service in 1973. A laser-guided version of the Kh-23, the Kh-25, became the basis for the AS-10 'Karen' family of missiles. Technology from these was 'backported' to the Kh-23 to create the Kh-23M in 1974. The Kh-23 was later licensed for local production in both Romania and Yugoslavia. In 1977 a dummy Kh-23 was fired from a Ka-252TB helicopter, the prototype of the Kamov Ka-29TB 'Helix-B' assault transport. Design The Kh-66 used the airframe of the Kaliningrad K-8 (AA-3 'Anab') air-to-air missile, with the nozzle split to make room for the antenna of the beam-riding guidance system of the Kaliningrad K-5 (AA-1 'Alkali'). It has cruciform control fins on the nose, and four clipped-tip delta-wings at the rear with elevators for control. Operational history The Kh-66 entered production for the MiG-21 in 1968, and the Kh-23 was certified for the MiG-23 'Flogger' in 1973.

Unlike Dominant/submissive structures found in BDSM in which love is often the core value, service and obedience are often the core values in Master/slave structures. The participants may be of any gender or sexual orientation. The relationship uses the term \\"slave\\" because of the association of the term with ownership rights of a master to their slave's body, as property or chattel. While male \\"masters\\" will usually be referred to as \\"Master\\", whether or not female Masters are referred to as \\"Master\\" or \\"Mistress\\" may depend upon whether they identify as following the leather subculture or BDSM path, or simply preference. Sexual slavery in a BDSM context is both a sexual fantasy and sexual roleplay. The slave master or mistress might be any person or group, though the majority of such relationships are usually either one dominant, or a committed dominant couple, owning one or more slaves. A slave and the owner, and others involved in the relationship, can be of any gender, sexual identity, or orientation. The Master/slave (or Owner/property) relationship is entered into on a consensual basis, without the legal force of historical or modern non-consensual slavery, that is forbidden by the laws of most countries. Terminology Model dressed as the fictional slave-girl Kajira from John Norman's Gor novels The term \\"slave\\" is used rather than \\"sex slave\\" because sex is not a necessary component of consensual slavery. In BDSM, a slave is a specific type of submissive. Not all submissives are slaves, though all slaves would normally be considered submissive in the relationship. However, some calling themselves \\"slave\\" may only be submissive within a sexual context/activity whilst others are also submissive within other or all aspects of the relationship, \\"sex-slave\\" or \\"slave\\" respectively. Slave Outside the BDSM community, the relationship of Master/slave is sometimes regarded as a form of consensual sexual slavery. In BDSM, a slave is a specific type of submissive. The Master/slave relationship refers to the relationship between the individuals involved, and does not necessarily require any specific acts, sexual or otherwise, though sexual activity is usually an aspect of the relationship. The sexual aspect could be conventional, and not necessarily BDSM. A slave could also be a masochist or bottom, but this is not always the case.Guy Baldwin (2002). SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude ‚Äì Principles, Skills and Tools. Daedelus Publishing Co. pp. 57‚Äì62. . Some participants regard the relationship as sexual roleplay, while others enter into the relationship on the basis of a highly committed, long-term, submissive lifestyle. Symbols and rituals Various forms of symbolism are sometimes used to affirm the owner/slave relationship. These include wearing the owner's collar, being registered in a slave register, adopting (sometimes legally changing to) a name chosen by the owner, or engaging in a public declaration or ritualized ceremony of some type. Some people draw up a slave contract that defines the relationship in explicit detail. These contracts may also deal with domestic arrangements (such as cleanliness, home duties) and interpersonal relationship matters (such as issues of deference, language, etc.), besides the sexual arrangements. Typically, they would provide that the Master has the exclusive authority in all matters relating to the body and behavior of the slave, including underwear and other clothing, social relations outside of the arrangement, etc. Although such contracts are not enforceable in the ways legal contracts are, they can be useful for defining in written form the limits of the arrangement between the signatories, and for documenting the consensuality of the relationships they define between them. In some traditional rituals, after signing a slave contract, the commitment to the relationship is celebrated by a collaring ceremony, which can be simple or elaborate, often witnessed by invited friends. The slave then wears a collar to publicly declare the slave's subjugation and the Master's ownership. Such a collar may be a piece of neckwear, or may be a bracelet or other piece of jewelry that symbolizes slave status. Such a collar is generally not removed except for practical reasons such as medical or security requirements, unless or until the relationship is dissolved; however, a slave is sometimes permitted to wear a more subdued (or less obtrusive) one outside of the home ‚Äî for example during work or in social situations with people who may otherwise feel uncomfortable. Slave training Slave training is a BDSM activity usually involving a consensual power exchange between two people taking on the roles of a Master or Mistress and a slave. The objective is to change the slave's behavior in a manner that is pleasing to the Master or Mistress, for example to train the slave to follow a set of rules or commands that the Master or Mistress has provided. Some Masters adopt a holistic approach to the maintenance and long-term development of their slave by using such models as Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Nature of the relationship A mistress and her male slave perform for the audience at a sex show in Austria. Sexual slavery is a consensual exchange of power by the submissive to the dominant, though the scope of the surrender of discretion may be limited and may be withdrawn at any time. The types of activities that the slave may be expected to perform are usually defined in advance and sometimes spelled out in a slave contract, a document with social indications and value but without any real legal value that outlines the desires, limits, and expectations of the parties. The slave is often expected to perform sexually, though typically many relationship- oriented dynamics are also clearly negotiated, including clothing, diet, speech restrictions, household affairs and schedules, though the details may be left to the master or mistress. Typically outlined are clear expectations of whether the couple will be monogamous or polyamorous, and if there would be permission or expectation of sexual interaction with other people. Otherwise, a sex slave may be expected to perform many of the same functions that are expected of a slave/submissive, including wearing very revealing clothes, being shared, wearing a slave collar or leash, S&M; activities, or bondage. A Master & slave \\"relationship\\" is often a long-term relationship, comparable in duration to vanilla relationships whereas a Dominant - submissive \\"relationship\\" could also be of the same duration or shorter, even lasting only the duration of a scene for example, which may range from a number of minutes, to hours. Depending on their contract and if the slave is willing to not be monogamous, a slave may be traded by the master, facilitated by sex club events, personals in BDSM interest magazines or internet based social networks. Commonly, a slave is also said to be a collared slave if the relationship has become serious enough to the point where the slave has earned a collar in the master's eyes, though not every slave wears a physical slave collar, however, other jewellery may be worn as a token of their dedication and servitude to their master. A slave who has satisfied the duration of the negotiated time of service is expected to be released, unless a new duration of service is negotiated. A slave may at any time withdraw consent to the relationship, effectively nullifying the slave relationship.

Synopsis Source: MTI ShowsAladdin Jr., MTI Shows Genie and the Agrabahns welcome us to Agrabah, introducing Aladdin and his penniless pals, Babkak, Omar, and Kassim; Princess Jasmine and her doting father, the Sultan; and the evil Jafar and Iago (\\"Overture/ Arabian Nights). Inside the marketplace, a Shop Owner berates the hungry Aladdin for stealing a loaf of bread, causing Razoul and his Guards to chase after him and his pals (\\"One Jump Ahead\\") until they escape. Afterward, when an Apple Vendor reviles two Beggars, Aladdin offers them his bread and defends them when Prince Abdullah and his attendants shove them out of his way (\\"One Jump Ahead - Reprise / Proud of Your Boy\\"). In the palace, Jafar plots with Iago to become Sultan as Jasmine rejects Prince Abdullah and the Sultan declares that she must marry by the next moon. Frustrated, Jasmine confides in her attendants - Isir, Manal, and Rajah - who encourage her to open up to experiences beyond the palace (\\"These Palace Walls\\"). As Jasmine disguises herself and takes off to heed their advice, Jafar and Iago invoke an incantation, and a Spooky Voice reveals that Aladdin is the key to finding a magic lamp that will grant Jafar the power to become Sultan. In the marketplace, Aladdin and his friends put on a show in the hope of earning some money (\\"Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim\\"). When Aladdin notices the seemingly out-of-place Jasmine and offers to show her around the marketplace, Jasmine unthinkingly takes an apple from a vendor, catching the attention of the guards. The two escape together and share their mutual experience of feeling \\"trapped.\\" When the guards discover and detain them, Jasmine reveals herself to be the Princess and is escorted back to the palace, vowing to get Aladdin released. In disguise, Jafar and Iago pay off the guards and lead Aladdin to the Cave of Wonders, where he is instructed to fetch only the lamp. Distracted by the treasures, Aladdin becomes trapped within the cave until he rubs the lamp and releases the all-powerful Genie (\\"Friend Like Me\\"), who helps him escape. Granting the first of Aladdin's three wishes, Genie transforms him into Prince Ali Ababwa, which Aladdin hopes will help him to woo Jasmine. Back at the palace, Jafar, thinking that Aladdin is still trapped in the cave, informs a despondent Jasmine that the boy's sentence has already been carried out. Just then, Aladdin and his friends make a grand entrance as Prince Ali with his Entourage (\\"Prince Ali\\"), but his demeanor offends Jasmine, who storms off. Frustrated, Aladdin lashes out at his friends, who in turn abandon him and leave the palace. Later, on the Princess's balcony, Prince Ali gains Jasmine's trust and invites her on a magic carpet ride (\\"A Whole New World\\"). After bidding her farewell, Aladdin is arrested by Jafar for trespassing in the Princess's private chambers. Omar, returning to help Aladdin, witnesses his arrest and runs to tell his pals, who pledge to help him (\\"High Adventure\\"), but they too are detained as they storm the palace. Aladdin uses his second wish, and Genie frees them all. Aladdin vows to tell Jasmine the truth, but changes his mind when she tells him he is to become Sultan after they wed. Unsure of his own moral character and ability, Aladdin fears he may need his third wish to succeed as a ruler. After a disappointed Genie turns his back on Aladdin and retreats into the lamp, Aladdin weighs his options and ultimately runs off to tell Jasmine the truth. He leaves behind the lamp, which Jafar and Iago gleefully take. At the wedding, Jafar reveals Prince Ali's real identity (\\"Prince Ali - Reprise\\") and demands that Genie make him Sultan. Aladdin then tricks him into wishing to become the most powerful genie of all time - forever trapping him inside his own lamp. Using his last wish, Aladdin frees Genie; and the Sultan, moved by Aladdin's courage and Jasmine's wisdom, alters the law so that the Princess can rule Agrabah and marry whomever she chooses. Picking Aladdin, Jasmine and all of Agrabah live happily, and freely, ever after (\\"Finale\\").

Design of the new ship was influenced by long experience with the original ship. The ship was launched in February 1923 and by the next year was actively engaged in Atlantic cable work. Between then and 1939 when war interrupted civilian cable operations the ship laid cable from Australia to the Mediterranean. In 1939, after a scheme to recover German cable for use was abandoned due to the loss of the intended Continental terminus, the ship was taken over by the Royal Navy, became HMS Faraday for training and then returned to cable work. The ship was lost 26 March 1941 in an air attack causing fires and wreck ashore near St. Ann's Head near Milford Haven. In the attack and wreck sixteen crew were lost. Some remains of the ship remain visible to divers. Construction Experience over the long operation of the first Faraday was applied to design of the second. The ship had two decks with a boat deck with housing for the captain, cable engineer and cable representative. Length overall was , between perpendiculars with a beam of . Molded depth was and design draft was . Four cable tanks had capacity, about 4,500 tons, to load an entire trans Atlantic cable and a forward hold was provided for cable buoy and other cable equipment storage. There were three bow sheaves at the bow and two sheaves at starboard on the stern. The ship was designed for adequate water ballast to compensate for cable discharge. Total crew was in excess of 150 and the ship was equipped with five ordinary lifeboats, two motor lifeboats and two work boats. Power was steam from three single ended, forced draft, oil fired boilers each with three furnaces and in diameter and long. Two six cylinder triple expansion engines designed to be capable of operating at very low revolutions for cable laying drove twin screws. Cable operations Faraday was launched on 16 February 1923 and completed in April. The cable ship, assigned the number 147458, carried out her maiden voyage in that year with the purpose of laying cable between New York and Canso, Nova Scotia.Marconi Archive, Bodleian Libraries. Oxford. MSS Marconi 3125 In 1924, after laying cable between Barbados and other islands, Faraday laid the single, unspliced, cable between Domburg, Walcheren and Aldeburgh, Suffolk in one of the early developments of undersea speech transmission. The cable was seen as a possible forerunner of trans Atlantic voice communication. By the end of that year the ship laid cable between the Atlantic islands of Fernando de Noronha and S√£o Vicente, Cape Verde. Testing cable on Cable Ship Faraday laying trans-Tasman submarine cable. Faraday carried out a number of cable laying and surveying exercises both in home waters and the Pacific until 1939. Among the operations was the 1935 laying of the Bass Strait telephone cable to connect Victoria with Tasmania with six telephone and about twelve telegraph circuits with a single broadcasting circuit. The cable was a new type carrying the signal over a single wire described as a central conductor separated from another composed of \\"five copper tapes, which are insulated from the central copper conductor wire by a new substance known as ‚Äúparagutta,‚Äù and covered again by a coating of the same material.\\" ‚Äî an early coaxial cable. Faraday was chartered by the Admiralty to recover German cable off Ushant with intention of refurbishing the cable and relaying it to Narvik. This plan was cancelled after the evacuation from Narvik and the ship was then laid up until requisitioned by the Admiralty, becoming HMS Faraday with some of the civilian crew remaining on board to maintain the cable machinery, first for training of Naval cadets but then for cable work around the African coast. Loss On 25 March 1941 the Faraday and four other ships set sail from Falmouth bound for Milford Haven. The Faraday was carrying 90 miles,Whether nautical or statute not specified. 3,870 tons, of submarine telephone cable required in Freetown, Cape Town, Mombassa and Suez. The ships became separated in poor visibility and about 7:45 p.m. on the 26th the Faraday was attacked off St. Anne's Head by a Heinkel He 111 which strafed and bombed the ship, killing eight and wounding 25 of the crew, and caused a major fire in the oil bunkers forcing the crew to abandon ship. The Heinkel was shot down by the ship's gunners. She later ran aground at Hopper's Point, near West Dale St Ann's Head. Sixteen of the crew of 125 were lost in the attack and the wreck ashore. Most of the cable was recovered. The wreck of the Faraday still lies in shallow waters and is a popular attraction for divers.Dive Pembrokeshire Remains are scattered with visible remains being a boiler and three drums of cable.

The convent, now ruined, was established by Emperor Otto II and his consort Theophanu about 979. History Unstrut riverbank The settlement of Mimilebo was already mentioned in an urbarium register of Hersfeld Abbey under the rule of Archbishop Lullus of Mainz (died 786). A Hersfeld tithe register, compiled between 881 and 899, again documents the locality of Mimileba in the Saxon shire (Gau) of Friesenfeld, west of the Hassegau. =Royal palace= Memleben acquired considerable importance under the Saxon dukes of the Ottonian dynasty about 900. Duke Otto the Illustrious (d. 912) served as Hersfeld abbot, his son Henry the Fowler married Hatheburg of Merseburg, a daughter of Count Erwin of Merseburg and heiress of large estates in Hassegau und Friesenfeld. Her brother-in-law, Count Thietmar of Merseburg was one of Henry's tutors. In 909 the couple separated and Hatheburg again took the veil, nevertheless, Henry retained her Eastphalian estates. He spent much time in this area; when he succeeded Conrad I as King of East Francia in 919, he had a royal villa in Memleben. Later greatly enlarged, this Royal Palace (villa regia or K√∂nigspfalz) became his favourite residence next only to Quedlinburg. In 935, while hunting near the royal palace of Bodfeld in the Harz mountains, King Henry seriously fell ill (presumably from a stroke). According to the reports by Bishop Liutprand of Cremona, he assembled the East Frankish princes in Erfurt the next year, to arrange the succession of his son Otto I, and afterwards retired to the castellum of Memleben, where he died after another stroke on 2 July 936. His mortal remains were transferred to the Quedlinburg abbey church. Otto I, like his father, often stayed in Memleben and issued a number of documents from here. However, no festive ceremonies or diets are documented and parts of the Memleben estates were granted to the newly established Bishops of Zeitz. Crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 962, Otto apparently planned to celebrate the feast of Pentecost at Memleben in 973. The sixty-year-old may have felt his end drawing near when he arrived at his father's place of death. According to the Saxon chronicles by Widukind of Corvey and Thietmar of Merseburg, he died here on 7 May 973 and was buried in Magdeburg Cathedral alongside his first wife Eadgyth. Legend has it, that although his body was buried in Magdeburg, his heart was buried in Memleben. =Imperial abbey= Foundations of the Memleben abbey church Otto's son and successor, Emperor Otto II, also issued several documents from Memleben. In his father's memory, and perhaps as an intended site of dynastic memorial,John W. Bernhardt, in Gerd Althoff, Johannes Fried, Patrick J. Geary, eds. Medieval Concepts of the Past: ritual, memory, historiography, 2002:59f. his son and successor Otto II with his consort Theophanu founded about 979 a Benedictine monastery near his Kaiserpfalz, which within a short time had become one of the richest and most influential of the Imperial abbeys. Otto II endowed Memleben with large estates and privileges in present-day Thuringia, Saxony- Anhalt and Hesse, several of them formerly held by Hersfeld Abbey, and also tithe privileges in the Friesenfeld and Hassegau counties. The abbey also received Hevelli lands in the Northern March (present-day Brandenburg), which however were lost in the Great Slav Rising of 983, and further territories in the Saxon Eastern March. After the early death of Otto II, his son, Otto III, stayed at the abbey several times. He granted market, mint and customs rights in the Memleben territory in 994 and donated the Thuringian Wiehe estates to the abbey four years later. He even had plans to make it the centre of a projected See of Thuringia, but died aged 22 in Italy before he was able to act on his intention. In 1015 the golden age of Memleben Abbey ended. On his accession in 1002, Henry II, the successor of Otto III, initially had confirmed to Abbot Reinhold of Memleben the privileges and possessions of his predecessors, on par with the Imperial abbeys of Fulda, Corvey and Reichenau. However, thirteen years later, he substantially disempowered and dispossessed the Memleben community in favour of Hersfeld Abbey, to whom he subordinated it, in return for estates for his pet project, the newly created Bishopric of Bamberg. The decline of Memleben Abbey, and its Ottonian memoria, was thus ensured. The Salian emperor Conrad II was the last documented German monarch who stayed at Memleben in 1033. The Memleben convent existed until in 1525 the abbey was plundered during the German Peasants' War and after a steadily worsening decline in the wake of the Protestant Reformation it was finally dissolved in 1548. The abbey's estates were taken over by the Electors of Saxony in 1551 and given to the school at Pforta, which had just been re- founded, and which retained possession of them until the end of World War II. Memleben today Memleben Crypt Since the roof of the former abbey church was struck by lightning and destroyed in 1722, several attempts were made later to demolish the rest of the building. Nevertheless, the remaining ruins are still of interest, particularly the Late Romanesque crypt. Of the first monumental church building erected in the 10th century, some walls and foundations are preserved, particularly the southwestern transept and crossing piers, as well as the southern side of the nave. The former monastic buildings were given during the East German period after World War II to an agricultural collective, who made considerable alterations to them. They now house a museum with a permanent exhibition relating to the royal and monastic history of the abbey and the town, directly perceptible also in an extended monastery garden and a medieval scriptorium. Memleben is a stop on the scenic Romanesque Road. Since 2011, the premises are temporarily attended by Benedictine monks from M√ºnsterschwarzach Abbey.

She is a recipient of a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation ‚Äúgenius‚Äù grant, served as a presidential appointee to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, and partnered with the Ford Foundation in creating the U.S. Latinx Arts Futures Symposium. Fern√°ndez's work is characterized by an interest in perception and the psychology of looking. Her experiential, large-scale works are often inspired by landscape and natural phenomena as well as diverse historical and cultural references. The artist's work has explored issues in contemporary art related to perception and the fabrication of the natural world. Often her sculptures present spectacular optical illusions and evoke natural phenomena, land formations, and water in its infinite forms.  Early life and education  Fern√°ndez was born in Miami, Florida, to Cuban parents in exile. Her family fled Fidel Castro's regime in July 1959, six months after the Cuban Revolution. As a child, she spent much of her time making things in the atelier of her great aunts and grandmother, all whom had been trained as highly skilled couture seamstresses in Havana, Cuba. In 1986, Fern√°ndez graduated from Southwest Miami High School. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Florida International University in 1990, and a Masters of Fine Art from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1992.  Career  In 2009 the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas at Austin commissioned the large permanent work titled \\"Stacked Waters\\" that occupies the museum's Rapoport Atrium. \\"Stacked Waters\\" consists of 3,100 square feet of custom-cast acrylic that covers the walls in a striped pattern. The work's title alludes to artist Donald Judd's \\"stack\\" sculptures‚Äîseries of identical boxes installed vertically along wall surfaces‚Äîas well as to his sculptural explorations of box interiors. Fern√°ndez noticed how The Blanton's atrium functions like a box, and given its architectural nods to the arches of Roman baths and cisterns, she sought to fill its spatial volume with an illusion of water. Also in 2009, Fern√°ndez had a piece called \\"Starfield\\" made up of mirrored glass cubes on anodized aluminum in the AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas. In 2013, Fern√°ndez was featured in a contemporary art installation at Cornell Fine Arts Museum's Alfond Inn in Winter Park, FL. The work displayed was titled \\"Nocturnal (Cobalt Panorama)\\". On June 1, 2015, \\"Fata Morgana\\", her largest public art project to date opened in New York's Madison Square Park. The Madison Square Park Conservancy presented the outdoor sculpture consisting of 500 running feet of golden, mirror-polished discs that create canopies above the pathways around the park's central Oval Lawn. Partnering with the Ford Foundation in 2016, Fern√°ndez helped found and create the U.S. Latinx Arts Futures Symposium. The U.S. Latinx Arts Futures Symposium brought together artists, museum directors, curators, educators, academics, and funders for a dialogue on how to more broadly represent Latino art across the full spectrum of creative disciplines. One direct result of the U.S. Latinx Arts Futures Symposium's effectiveness was the Whitney Museum of American Art hiring Marcela Guerrero to be the museum's first curator specializing in Latinx. In 2017, Fern√°ndez, in collaboration with Colecci√≥n Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, created a site-specific installation called \\"OVERLOOK: Teresita Fern√°ndez confronts Frederic Church at Olana\\" at Olana State Historic Site. As part of the work, Fern√°ndez juxtaposes the works of landscape artists like Frederic Church, Marianne North, Martin Johnson Heade, among others, with images of indigenous people and their fellow travellers in order to examine and illustrate the context of the world that made up their images.

All of their costumes are the colors of black and red. They are not officially given a name until New Excalibur #19 where they are referred to as Shadow-X in the \\"Previously...\\" section and by Juggernaut on the final page of the issue. How this name came about is unexplained, and prior to this the team was called the Dark X-Men by fans, reviews, and even the Marvel preview descriptions. It refers to the fact that the team was created and controlled by the Shadow King - the Shadow King's \\"Shadow X\\"-Men. Fictional team biography They are from an alternate dimension and were brought to the mainstream Marvel dimension during the events of Decimation. The Shadow King took control of the Professor Xavier of their reality and then was able to subvert all of the X-Men to serve him. When they were brought to Earth-616 the Dark Professor Xavier tried to bring Nocturne, Marvel Girl, and Shadowcat under his control, but he was defeated by them, with help from Sage, and later placed in Crossmore prison. The rest of the team then ally themselves with Black Air, Albion, and Lionheart.New Excalibur #18 They then tried to take control of Lionheart during a mission to free Dark Professor X. However, as Dark Professor X tried to take control Lionheart revealed Albion knew of their treachery and placed a device to stop his mind control and then placed a collar on Dark Professor Xavier to trap the Shadow King in Professor X and killed them both.New Excalibur #19 Lionheart then threatens the rest of Shadow-X, but this fight is interrupted by the immediate arrival of the New Excalibur team. New Excalibur is short-handed because of Nocturne's recent stroke and Sage infiltrating Albion's ranks, but they are able to effectively work as a team and successfully take down Shadow-X. New Excalibur and Shadow-X both try to stop Lionheart, but they are too busy with their opponent team to be successful and she escapes. Then New Excalibur start to interrogate the Shadow-X about what was happening between them and Lionheart.New Excalibur #20 Shadow-X team up with New Excalibur to fight their common foe, Albion. It is revealed that the collar placed on the Dark Professor X actually killed him. When Dark Cyclops, Dark Angel, and Pete Wisdom attack Albion, Dark Cyclops is beheaded by Sage who is working undercover in Albion's Shadow Corps.New Excalibur #21 Dark Angel and Wisdom retreat after Dark Cyclops's death, but Sage (now called Britannia) and other members of the Shadow Corps follow. Dazzler, Juggernaut, and Dark Beast join the battle, and during it Sage kills Dark Beast by impaling him with her sword.New Excalibur #22 During a subsequent battle between Dark Marvel Girl and Dark Angel and the Shadow Captains, Dark Angel is killed and his wing severed by one of the Shadow Captains.New Excalibur #23 In the final battle against Albion, Dark Marvel Girl is mortally wounded while saving Nocturne's life. Still, despite her injuries, Jean and Nocturne find the source of the technology blackout. Meanwhile, Lionheart helps Dark Iceman against the rest of the Shadow Captains before he dies and withers away into a skeleton. With his last breath, Dark Iceman banished the vast majority of the snow he‚Äôd created. Juggernaut, Dazzler, and Wisdom help Sage to overpower her Britannia personality. Sage then helps Cap against Albion. Together, they beat their foe as Dark Marvel Girl restores technology before she dies. In the alternate future mini-series Genext United, a group resembling Shadow-X appear to be alive and well in this continuity. The story is written by Chris Claremont, the very same writer who created them. Notes The Dark Beast that is a part of this group is not the same as the one from the Age of Apocalypse.

The thrushes range from in length and average . It is estimated that the rangewide population is large, though no official count has ever been established. The Bassian thrush lives in shrubland, forests, and rainforests. It appears to be a resident species, but there is some evidence that some individuals have nomadic tendencies, usually in the non-breeding season. Though affected by human destruction of its natural habitats, its range is so large that the impact is negligible. The thrush ranges in color from brown to an olive color, with a white ring around its eyes and black bars on its back, rear, and head. Its underbody is paler, with dark scalloping, and its wings have a dark bar running the length of the underside. Nesting begins in the winter months (from late June) and continues till the end of summer. The two or three eggs which form a clutch vary from pale green or blue to light stone. The cup-shaped nest is usually built of strips of bark, at times mixed with leaves, and is lined with grasses and rootlets. Sites vary from a few feet to 50 feet from ground. A fork in the tree is usually favoured, but the nest may be placed on the stump, or a ledge in a cave. Bassian thrush are known to dislodge their prey out of pile of leaves by disturbing the leaf litter. The birds move quietly, but often pause, to listen for the movements of the insects. They also disturb worm prey by farting, which provokes the worms to move.

Oxfordshire first used the ground in the 1993 Minor Counties Championship against Wiltshire, playing a single Minor Counties Championship match in their season, with the exception of 1997, when two matches were played there. No Minor Counties Championship match was played there in 1998, but the ground did hold its first MCCA Knockout Trophy matches in that season when Oxfordshire played the Nottinghamshire Cricket Board, Norfolk and Shropshire. The ground held a single Minor Counties Championship match in 1999, before hosting the Kent Cricket Board in an MCCA Knockout Trophy match the following season. The only List A match to be played there was played in the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy between Oxfordshire and Huntingdonshire. Huntingdonshire made 252/5 from their 50 overs, with Wayne Larkins top-scoring with 73. Oxfordshire were dismissed for 175 in their chase to lose the match by 77 runs.

He passed by the castle of an emperor and heard his three daughters speak. They all wished they could marry him; the oldest said that she would keep his house clean; the second, that she would make his house like two golden apples; the third, that she would bear him golden twins. He married the third, and she became pregnant, but his old favorite, a gypsy slave, envied the queen. When the children were due, the king had to go to war. He was greeted back with two puppies, which he was told the queen had bore. He made the queen a slave, and the gypsy girl his queen. In reality, the queen had borne two golden babies, but the gypsy girl had killed them and buried them in the vineyard. Two firs grew from their graves. At night, they turned into children again and went to nurse from their mother, which consoled her. The king liked the trees but the gypsy hated them, and she made him cut them down. The king had two beds made from them. In the night, the beds talked to each other; the one carrying the gypsy did not like it, but the one carrying their father liked it better. The gypsy girl heard it and had them burned. Two sparks flew into bran that an ewe had ate, and the ewe gave birth to two lambs with golden fleeces. The king saw these lambs and loved them. The gypsy girl had them killed and assigned the queen the task of washing out their entrails. A crow caught some of the entrails and would not give it back without some cornmeal; the miller would not give her cornmeal without a chicken; a hen would not give her chick without corn; but a kind farmer gave her corn, the hen then gave her a chick, the miller then gave her cornmeal, and the crow then gave her back the piece ‚Äì but more had washed away while she did this, and she could not retrieve it. The entrails caught on a snag, and when the waters retreated, they became a girl and a boy. The boy cut down osiers with his hatchett and the girl spun on her distaff, and people came to look at their beauty. The king was so delighted that he took them home, and the gypsy girl did not dare do anything to them. One day she broke her pearl necklace and it could not be rethreaded; the pearls escaped everyone's fingers. The king asked the children to do it, and they could. While they did it, the boy told the king the story of their lives (with a refrain of \\"o, a string of pearls twined with golden flowers\\"). The king had the gypsy girl stoned to death and restored his queen. Commentary  The opening sequence, of a woman promising to bear fabulous children and their kidnapping, is a common fairy tale motif, but in most such tales ‚Äì \\"Ancilotto, King of Provino\\", \\"The Three Little Birds\\", \\"The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird\\", \\"The Wicked Sisters\\" ‚Äì the children are abandoned, rather than murdered. The villains are overwhelmingly the heroine's jealous sisters, or her mother-in-law, rather than a rival as in this tale. The transformation chase described here is found in another Romanian tale of this type, \\"The Boys with the Golden Stars\\". Even in this tale, however, the villain of the piece is the mother-in-law. The Chinese \\"The Pretty Little Calf\\" has the child murdered and restored in animal form; only the transformation to and from the title calf occurs, but it is more closely related to this tale in the villains, who are the first and second wife, the heroine being an official's third wife.

It is now mostly worn by pipers and drummers in various bands throughout the world. It is also worn in a similar fashion by regiments in various Commonwealth armies.  History  The feather bonnet began with the knitted blue bonnet with a chequered border. This was propped up and worn with a tall hackle. During the 17th and 18th century, the highlanders who wore this hat began to add ostrich feathers to decorate it. This decoration evolved into a full covering of the original bonnet. The ostrich feathers were then entwined into a lightweight cage, producing the height. The feather bonnet has one or more (usually 4 or 5) \\"tails\\" that hang down below the headband, and the regimental badge and hackle are displayed on the left. There are parallels between the evolution of the Highland bonnet between 1760 and 1790 and the stationing of Highland regiments in North America in this period. The influence of the head-dresses of Native Americans on the bonnets of these troops is likely as contemporary pictures of Highlanders in Scotland do not show similar ornamentation with feathers, other than those of a few clan chiefs. On the return of the 42nd Foot to Britain in 1790 an official report commented that \\"Their bonnets are entirely disfigured. They are so covered with lofty feathers that they appear like grenadier caps of black bearskin.\\"Abler, Thomas S. (1999) Hinterland Warriors and Military Dress Berg, pp.139-40, plate 39,  Use  The feather bonnet has been used by all of the Scottish highland regiments at one point or another.

Despite its elaborate appearance, the feather bonnet is a highly practical piece of military gear, as it is lightweight and the internal cage offers protection from blows. William Gordon-Alexander, an officer of the Sutherland Highlanders who served in India in the 1850s, after describing how a tulwar-cut to the head of a fellow officer had been averted by the wire frame of his feather bonnet, said: \\"Burroughs' feather bonnet saved his life from this sword-cut, as many of our lives were saved by it, in the succeeding hot-weather campaign, from the sun\\", immediately quoting an 1884 pamphlet by Lord Archibald Campbell in defence of the feather bonnet as being: centre  References  External links Category:Hats Category:Scottish clothing Category:Military uniforms Category:Bonnets (headgear) Category:Military of Scotland ","title":"Feather bonnet"},{"id":"10691095","title":"Hispanic Admirals in the United States Navy"},{"id":"10691101","text":"Del-Fi Records was an American record label based in Hollywood, California and owned by Bob Keane. The label's first single released was \\"Caravan\\" by Henri Rose released in 1958, but the label was most famous for signing Ritchie Valens. Valens' first single for the label was \\"Come On Let's Go\\", which was a hit. His next single, \\"Donna\\"/\\"La Bamba\\", was an even bigger hit, and brought national notoriety to the label. Johnny Crawford, the co-star of the television series The Rifleman, was the Del-Fi artist who recorded the most hit singles. History In 1966, legal action was taken against Del-Fi by attorney Al Schlesinger for Anthony Music, which filed a $122,000 suit over breach of contract, fraud and money owned. The principal stockholder of the company, Anthony Hilder, claimed the dispute was over royalties not being paid as per an alleged agreement for the masters of albums by The Centurians, Dave Myers and The Surftones and The Sentinels, and an LP Battle of the Surf Bands.Billboard, 26 Mar 1966 - Page 4, Anthony Music Sues Del-Fi Sister labels Keane soon launched Stereo-Fi Records and Donna Records as sister labels. Donna Records was started in 1959, named after Ritchie Valens' hit of the same name. By 1965, Bob Keane felt the Del-Fi and Donna labels were aging, so the Bronco Records and Mustang Records labels were started in their place, capitalizing on their new, exciting themes. The Mustang label achieved fame through Bobby Fuller Four (previously on Donna Records), producing their biggest hit, \\"I Fought the Law\\" in 1965. Their fame continued into 1966, with assistance from the then A&R; man Barry White, but Fuller's death later that year brought a halt to the label, and Mustang Records closed down in 1967. Legacy Del-Fi was briefly revived in 1987 for 7\\" and 12\\" releases of \\"La Bamba '87\\", featuring remixes of the Richie Valens classic, capitalizing on the success of the film, La Bamba. Keane resurrected the Del-Fi label in 1995 and reissued many original recordings on CD (some under the Donna label), and signed some new acts as well. In September 2003, Bob Keane sold the Del-Fi and its subsidiaries to the Warner Music Group. Today, it is now run under Rhino Entertainment and reissues some of its older material. Various artist compilations In 1999, the label released Del-Fi Girl Groups: Gee Baby Gee. It featured 21 vintage tracks from the Del-Fi label. They were by girl groups and singers such as The Ladybugs, Brenda Holloway, Pippy Shannon, Lori Martin, Pierre And Anne-Lyse, Desda, Mary Sawrey, and seven tracks by The Sisters, a group that featured Ersi Arvizu.Discogs Various ‚Äì Del-Fi Girl Groups: Gee Baby GeeDiscogs The Sisters New recordings One band that has recorded for the label is The El Caminos, a Japanese surf music band who had their 1997 album Reverb Explosion released on Del-Fi.Audio, Audio, Volume 81, Issues 7-12 - Page 110Billboard, July 26, 1997 - Page 60 INDEPENDENTS It got to #12 on the CMJ Core Radio chart.CMJ New Music Report, September 8, 1997 - Page 9 CORE RADIO Artists *Addrisi Brothers *eden ahbez *Chan Romero *Ritchie Valens *Johnny Crawford *Josephine Roberto aka 'Banig' *Bobby Curtola *Bobby Fuller Four (Donna & Mustang) *Brenda Holloway *Barry White (Bronco) *Frank Zappa *The Gallahads *The Surfaris *The Lively Ones *The Centurions *Spider Webb and the Insects *Little Caesar & the Romans *Ron Holden (Donna) *Outrageous Cherry =Later artists= *The El Caminos *Kari Wuhrer See also *Bob Keane *Ritchie Valens *List of record labels References Category:Ritchie Valens Category:American record labels Category:Record labels based in California Category:Rock and roll record labels Category:Record labels established in 1958 Category:Record labels disestablished in 2003 Category:1958 establishments in California Category:Defunct companies based in Greater Los Angeles Category:Warner Music labels Category:Labels distributed by Warner Music Group Category:2003 disestablishments in California ","title":"Del-Fi Records"},{"id":"10691130","text":"Jar City (Icelandic: M√Ωrin ‚Äì \\"The Bog\\") is a 2006 Icelandic film directed by Baltasar Korm√°kur. It is based on M√Ωrin, a 2000 novel written by Arnaldur Indri√∞ason and released in English as Jar City. Korm√°kur is in the midst of producing an English-language remake, also called Jar City, which will be set in Louisiana. Plot A world-weary cop comes to believe a recent murder of a middle-aged man is linked to a case of possible rape three decades earlier by a group of friends and a corrupt cop. Working through, he finds it linked to neurofibromatosis, a rare disease among Nordics. One thing leads to another and he puts the pieces together. A geneticist father loses his child to neurofibromatosis and his search for answers leads to his degenerate father and unravels many missing person cases during the decade. Like the book on which it is based, the film is implicitly a semi-critique of the gene- gathering work of the Icelandic company deCODE genetics.Lucy Burke, \\"Genetics and the Scene of the Crime: DeCODING Tainted Blood\\", Journal of Literary & Cultural Disability Studies, 6 (2012), 193‚Äì208. doi:10.3828/jlcds.2012.16.

Established in 1959, over 62,000 students from more than 120 countries have studied at Yonsei KLI. Most students have come from Japan (over 18,000), United States (over 16,000) or China (over 3,000). Program overview Using a six-level series of books published in-house, the institute implements its instruction through its A or B course. The A course moves at a quick pace and completes one book per semester term, while the B course is paced a bit slower. Usually, students native to other Asian countries or having some prior knowledge of the Korean language opt for the A course, while students coming from Western language backgrounds are encouraged to take the B course. The B course may not be offered if there are not enough students enrolled. Level one starts with the most basic skills of reading and pronouncing the Korean alphabet and character combinations while providing a foundation of elementary grammar. Levels two and three build on these with increasingly complex sentence structures and vocabulary. Levels four through six are notably more intensive than the first three and deal with refining speaking and writing skills for everyday fluency, Korean university entrance, or professional application. Each level consists of 10 weeks of instruction, totaling 200 classroom hours. If a student accumulates more than 40 hours of absences from class, he or she cannot move on to the next level without exception. Students are graded based on a midterm and final exam and must receive at least a 60 percent score in each subject (writing, reading, listening and speaking) to move on to the next level. If a student fails to achieve this score during the original testing period, retesting is available as long as he or she failed three or fewer subjects. If all four test scores are substandard, the student must repeat the level. Special activities The school uses special contests each semester to aid in instruction. The first three levels include a speaking contest, Korean song contest, and stage play contest. There are cultural activities for students to participate in ranging from cooking Korean foods or visiting museums to creating traditional items such as masks or fans. Housing Housing is available on campus in the SK Global House and International House. It is next to the Korean Language Institute. KLI students are only guaranteed three semesters (9 months) of housing there, and living there in subsequent terms is subject to room availability. In the SK Global House, options are available between a single or shared room, both types of rooms come with attached bathrooms. In the International House,a room is shared between two students, and bathrooms are communal. Both the buildings are separated into male and female floors with barred entry for members of the opposite sex, however SK Global house allows members of the opposite sex to particular floors during specified timings. There are small television lounges on each floor, a study lounge with computers with internet access on the first floor, and a large lounge and laundry room in the basement level. Security is present in the buildings, and entry is permitted through the a key card, which is issued at the time of entry. The fee is approximately over 1,000,000 won per semester. =Private housing= Many students live in a student boarding house or hasukjib (Hangul: ÌïòÏàôÏßë, Hanja: ). These places usually allow the student to live in a private room, and some meals are included. Typically, an older woman runs the house and provides breakfast and dinner. The quality and quantity of the food will vary based on price and owner, but this is the most popular housing option for Korean college students and most KLI students. Fees range from 300,000 to 600,000 won per month. A goshiwon (Hangul: Í≥†ÏãúÏõê Hanja: ) offers similar privacy to a hasukjib, but the facilities may not be as comfortable. Rooms tend to be small, but the prices are significantly cheaper than most hasukjib (150,000-400,000 Korean won per month). One-room (studio) apartments or multiple room apartments are available, but the prices are usually higher. It is common policy for landlords to ask for large deposits from foreign nationals wishing to live in a place they are renting out. Fees range greatly, but monthly rent typically starts at 400,000 won.

Gloria Swanson appears as an uncredited extra. The title is an inside reference to this being Chaplin's first film after leaving Keystone Studios for Essanay Studios. It was also the only film Chaplin shot at Essanay's Chicago studio. He found the facilities and climate (His New Job was shot in mid-winter) not to his liking, and Chaplin soon relocated back to California. Synopsis When one of the actors on a movie set doesn't show up, Charlie gets his chance to be on camera and replaces the actor. While waiting, he plays in a dice game and gets on many people's nerves. When he finally gets to act, he ruins his scene, accidentally destroys the set, and tears the skirt of the star of the movie. Notes The movie's title, His New Job, had a subtle second meaning, as it was Chaplin's first film for Essanay after his contract with Keystone Studios expired at the end of 1914. The use of the name \\"Lockstone\\" for the silent film studio was an obvious humorous jab by Chaplin directed at Keystone. The movie was filmed at Essanay's Chicago studio in the dead of winter in January 1915. Chaplin found the city's frigid weather so objectionable that he quickly relocated his operations to balmy southern California. This was the first Chaplin film to be photographed by Rollie Totheroh who began a remarkable 40-year working association with Chaplin. A young Gloria Swanson‚Äîshe was not quite 16 years old‚Äîappears in the background as a stenographer. She received no screen credit for this part.

The art of Charles Chaplin defies analysis and disarms the critic. Just why he is so funny, it is almost impossible to say, and very probably he could not tell you himself. He possesses a naturally comic personality and its humor is accentuated by the originality of the innumerable bits of 'business,' with which his work is so profoundly interspersed. Scarcely a moment passes while he is on the screen, but he is up to some wild piece of mischief or committing some ludicrous folly.\\" Preservation status A print of the film is preserved at the George Eastman House and is now in the public domain.

Biography He was born in New York City, and graduated from Columbia College in 1818 he subsequently studied medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. He did not practice medicine for long however, instead devoting himself to scientific and literary pursuits. He was appointed professor of mathematics and astronomy at Columbia College in 1825, when he was twenty-six years old; he retained his chair for twenty-five years. Anderson was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1831. He married Fanny Da Ponte, the daughter of Lorenzo Da Ponte. They had two children Elbert Ellery and Edward Henry. In 1848, he accompanied the United States Dead Sea exploration expedition, commanded by Captain William F. Lynch, as a geologist. His reports from the expedition, Geological Reconnaissance of Part of the Holy Land, were published by the United States government in 1848 and 1849. Under the aegis of the American Geographical and Statistical Society, Anderson circulated a petition urging the United States to promote Jewish colonization in Palestine, part of the Jewish restoration movement that flowered at the time.Michael Oren (2007). Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present (New York: W.W. Norton & Company) pp. 140-141. Anderson converted to Catholicism in 1849; he was active in his new faith for the rest of his life. He was made president of the Particular Council of New York in 1856, and later the head of the Supreme Council in 1860. He visited Pope Pius XI in Rome several times, and was eventually made a Knight Commander of the order of St. Gregory the Great. He made a pilgrimage to Lourdes and Rome in 1875; afterwards, he travelled to Australia in order to observe a transit of Venus. He planned to return home by way of India, but, after mountain-climbing in the Himalayas, he died of a disease in Lahore on October 19. He is buried in a vault under the Church of the Madonna in Fort Lee, New Jersey, a church in whose construction he had been involved. References =Bibliography= * * Russo, Joseph Louis.

The conductor (Fred Kelsey) tosses the pair off the train just where the famous writer is supposed to arrive, with Rollo being mistaken for Story. Peggy Freeman (Laura Lee) and May Bunch (May Boley) both vie for Rollo's attention, believing that he is a famous pilot.

The council had a unique quadrapartite membership composed of representatives from business, labor, government, and the public. The council began operation in 1991,Bruce Stokes, \\"Is Industrial Policy Now Mentionable,\\" The National Journal, March 7, 1992, p. 576. and ceased operation in 1997 after the Republican-led Congress failed to continue funding, and after council members decided to close out this successful experiment in the independent advisory function.  Authority  Authority for the council is found in the Competitiveness Policy Council Act, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß4801 et seq. This act was part of the larger Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The authorization of appropriations for the council expired in Fiscal year 1992, but otherwise the statutory underpinnings for the council remain intact, and the council could be revived by a future president with a pro-competitive agenda.  Notable accomplishments During its years in operation, the Competitiveness Policy Council prepared and issued four Reports to the President and Congress. They were: *Building a Competitive America (1992)Competitiveness Policy Council, \\"Building A Competitive America,\\" First Report to the President and Congress, March 1992. *A Competitiveness Strategy for America (1993)Competitiveness Policy Council, \\"A Competitiveness Strategy for America,\\" Second Report to the President & Congress, March 1993. *Promoting Long-Term Prosperity (1994)Competitiveness Policy Council, \\"Promoting Long-Term Prosperity,\\" Third Report to the President & Congress, May 1994. *Saving More and Investing Better (1995)Competitiveness Policy Council, \\"Saving More and Investing Better: A Strategy for Securing Prosperity,\\" Fourth Report to the President & Congress, September 1995. The council adopted a broad approach to American competitiveness defining it as the ability of the United States to produce goods and services that meet the test of international markets while its citizens earn a standard of living that is both rising and sustainable over the long run. Competitiveness Policy Council, \\"Building A Competitive America,\\" First Report to the President and Congress, March 1992 (page 2). This definition differed from others in that era which emphasized the trade balance rather than the overall impact of governmental policies on national economic prosperity. The council's first report, \\"Building a Competitive America\\" (March 1992) explained that \\"three elements permeate our society and most directly hurt our competitive position: short-termism, perverse incentives, and absence of global thinking.\\"Competitiveness Policy Council, \\"Building A Competitive America,\\" First Report to the President and Congress, March 1992 (page 11). The council's first report was reviewed in Michael Prowse, \\"US 'needs new vision' to hone competitive edge: A federal advisory council, is calling for a radical reappraisal for industry,\\" Financial Times, March 5, 1992, p. 6. To help analyze the problems of faltering U.S. competitiveness, the council in its first year, established eight subcouncils to study and recommend solutions for the most critical problems hindering U.S. competitiveness.Competitiveness Policy Council, \\"Building A Competitive America,\\" First Report to the President and Congress, March 1992 (pages 35-36). These subcouncils were: capital formation, education, training, public infrastructure, corporate governance and financial markets, trade policy, manufacturing, and critical technologies. Additional subcouncils were established in later years.  Leadership, composition, and appointments  The council was led by Dr. C. Fred Bergsten, then the Director of the Institute for International Economics (now the Peterson Institute).The full name is the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics. Chairman Bergsten was elected by nongovernmental Council members at the first meeting. The council was composed of 12 members who were appointed through a well- crafted process dictated by statuteSee 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 4804 that provided for quadrapartite and bipartisan representation. Specifically, there were three members from the business community, three from organized labor, three from federal or state government, and three from academia and public interest. Four members were appointed by the president, four by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Minority Leader acting jointly, and four by the Majority and Minority leaders of the U.S. Senate acting jointly. Both Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton made appointments. The appointments process for the council was unusual, in providing for equal weight to representatives from business and labor. Over its life, the members of the council and key staff included: *Rand Araskog (ITT Corporation) *John J. Barry (IBEW) *Steve Charnovitz *Donald V. Fites (Caterpillar, Inc.) *Barbara Hackman Franklin *Bill Graves *John J. Murphy (Dresser Industries) *Robert E. Nelson (Nelson Communications) *Edward Regan *Howard Rosen *Richard Samans *Claudine Schneider (former Member of Congress from Rhode Island) *Bruce Scott (Harvard Business School) *Albert Shanker *Alexander B. Trowbridge *Laura D. Tyson *Edward Vetter (Vetter and Associates) *Lynn R. Williams  Charter  The council's statutory legislative charter contains a number of innovative administrative features. For example, one duty of the council is to create a \\"forum\\" where national leaders with experience could identify and development recommendations to address actual problems facing America. See 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 4803(4) The council is empowered to hold hearings and to establish Subcouncils on any issue. An unusual provision of the CPC Act provides that any discussion at the Subcouncil shall not be considered to violate any Federal or state antitrust law.See 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 4806(g)(5) The establishment of the Competitiveness Policy Council (CPC) was inspired, in part, by the favorable reception to the 1985 Report of the President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness (chaired by John A. Young). A year following the Young Commission Report, a private sector Council on Competitiveness was set up, which remains in existence. The CPC developed a cooperative relationship with the Council on Competitiveness which enhanced the CPC's work product. The two Councils were easily distinguishable, however, in that the membership of the federally established CPC included a federal cabinet-level official and s state elected official. Thus, the deliberation of the CPC was able to benefit from the input of governmental members. By contrast, the private-sector Council on Competitiveness lacks governmental members.  Important recommendations  The council made a number of important recommendations during its years of operation regarding pensions, education, public investment, trade negotiations, and many other issues.See \\"American Competitiveness,\\" The Washington Post, March 5, 1992, Editorial, p. A22. Some of the recommendations by the council were not adopted. For example, the council recommended an immediate implementation of the provision in federal law calling for the Executive Branch to attach a \\"competitiveness impact statement\\" to any new legislative proposal to the Congress which may affect U.S. competitiveness.See 2 U.S.C. ¬ß 194(b)\\"Competitiveness Council Reports.\\" Facts on File World News Digest, March 19, 1992 (page 192 C1). This recommendation was not adopted. The council also championed the centrality of manufacturing in any national competitiveness strategy. The Obama Administration picked up on this recommendation in September 2009 when the President appointed the first White House counselor for manufacturing. Jon Schmitz, \\"Former USW Official Joins White House as Manufacturing Counselor,\\" Pittsburgh-Post Gazette, Sept. 7, 2009.

In July 1996, a Report of the House Appropriations Committee withheld new funding for the council for FY1997, and noted that \\"the Committee believes that the Council is duplicative of private sector organizations, such as the Council on Competitiveness, which focus on the same issues without the use of Federal funds.\\"House Report 104‚Äì676, Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, Fiscal year 1997.

As this film was the final one that Chaplin made at Keystone Studios, it was also the last film he made with most of Keystone's regular roster of comedians. Co-star Mack Swain would not appear in another Chaplin movie until 1925 when he had a prominent role in the classic Chaplin feature film The Gold Rush. Synopsis Set in the stone age, King Low-Brow rules the land and a harem of wives. When Charlie arrives in this land (where every man has one thousand wives), he falls in love with the King's favorite wife. When the King falls over a cliff, he is presumed dead and Charlie crowns himself King. The King, however, is not dead and comes back and bashes Charlie over the head with a rock. It turns out it was a dream and a policeman bashed Charlie over the head with his club because he was sleeping in the park.

It opened on 24 June 1965 with a gala performance by the Australian Ballet. The Centre is sited in the heart of Canberra's City Centre, beside the ACT Legislative Assembly and backing onto City Hill, one of the apexes of the Parliamentary Triangle. Centre history Thespis (1965), sculpture by Robert Cook, commissioned for the opening of the Canberra Theatre Originally the complex was two separate buildings: the Canberra Theatre and The Playhouse, which were linked by a covered walkway. The Canberra Theatre was built as a 1,200 seat lyric theatre to house national and international touring companies; The Playhouse had 310 seats and was designed for local arts companies and for smaller scale touring companies. The Playhouse also contained a small visual art gallery, a meeting room and a restaurant, 1965: The Playhouse was officially opened on 18 August 1965 with a production of Peter Ustinov‚Äôs Romanoff and Juliet, produced by the Canberra Repertory Society. 1971: The covered walkway linking the two venues was enclosed to create more foyer and function space for the Canberra Theatre and improved box office facilities. 1975: The Playhouse was given improved backstage storage space, wardrobe facilities and addition dressing rooms. 1982: The Courtyard Studio - a rehearsal room/cum 90-seat venue, administration offices, and a scene construction workshop including an electrically operated paint frame (used for painting stage set canvases), were completed. The Centre boasts one of the very few paint frames in Australia. 1988: The Canberra Theatre auditorium, foyer and link were extensively refurbished so that the facilities were comparable to those of other major performing arts centres throughout the country. 1998: The rebuilt Playhouse opened. 2006: A new library was built between the Canberra Theatre and the Playhouse, as well as a foyer linking the two theatres. 2007: The foyer and dressing rooms to the Courtyard Studio were refurbished. In addition lift access to the first floor Administration offices was installed =Refurbishment= From the mid-1990s a two-year consultation process occurred between the Canberra Theatre Centre staff and the architects leading to the demolition of The Playhouse and its rebuilding as a new venue. It had a 'soft' opening in April 1998. The official opening was 16 May 1998. Instead of a conventional fan shaped auditorium and proscenium arch stage used in most Australian theatres built in the 20th century, the design has the form of a semi circular drum with seating in the stalls and two balconies, with 'boxes'. The capacity is 618 seats. The design is reminiscent of theatres in Greece of antiquity and the Elizabethan theatres of the late 16th century. The theatre has dressing rooms on two levels, wardrobe, a green room, a reception room and the foyer (with bar and cafe), which wraps around the drum. Notable performances =Canberra Theatre= Dame Margot Fonteyn performed with the Australian Ballet at the centre in October 1970. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s many international artists performed, including Dame Joan Sutherland. Canberra Opera presented a full-scale production of La Traviata and the Canberra Theatre Trust presented a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan's HMS Pinafore. Other performers during this time included the Bell Shakespeare Company, the Black Light Theatre of Prague and the Dave Brubeck Quartet.Canberra Theatre history accessed 16 April 200717 August 2005 Hansard, ACT Legislative Assembly accessed 16 April 2007 The Whitlams used the theatre during their early Australian tours in the early 2000s, and the Aboriginal Bangarra Dance Theatre performed here in 2006. In recent years, the Canberra Theatre has housed several successful productions by Canberra-based Free Rain Theatre Company. These pro-am musical productions include Canberra premiers of The Phantom of the Opera in 2013, Mary Poppins in 2015, and both The Little Mermaid and Wicked in 2016. =The Playhouse= Local companies to use the Playhouse have included Canberra Opera; Prompt Theatre; choreographer Meryl Tankard's Company; The Theatre Players; Canberra Dance Ensemble; National Music Theatre; Canberra Little Theatre; Canberra Children‚Äôs Theatre; Stage Craft for Singers; Canberra Gang Show; Canberra Comedy Theatre Company; Jigsaw Theatre Company. For several years the Woden Valley Youth Choir presented their annual concert there. The Playhouse has been used for conventions, meetings, including naturalization ceremonies by the Department of Immigration. The Playhouse has also housed productions by visiting companies. These included Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead from the Old Tote Theatre Company; Dennis Olsen in Percy and Rose; David Williamson plays Travelling North and Sanctuary; Melbourne Theatre Company; chamber music concerts by Musica Viva and others; Robyn Archer in A Star is Torn; Pam Ayres; Googie Withers; productions by NIDA; various Bell Shakespeare Company performances (John Bell); pianist David Helfgott; as well as various comedians and entertainers.Playhouse history accessed 16 April 2007 =The Courtyard Studio= The Courtyard Studio is Canberra Theatre Centre's boutique, studio performance space that doubles as a venue for rehearsals, entertaining, corporate functions / meetings, exhibition space, and as a performance space.

Biography Guillemain is thought to have been born in Paris, was brought up by the Count de Rochechouart, and started studying violin at an early age. He was then sent to Italy to complete his training as violinist, and studied under Giovanni Battista Somis in Turin. At the age of 24, Guillemain was working in Lyons, where he quickly established himself as one of the most sought-after performers, and was appointed first violinist of the Acad√®mie de Musique. His opus 1, Premier livre de sonates for violin and basso continuo, was published in Dijon in 1734. Guillemain eventually moved back to Paris, where, in 1737, he became a musicien ordinaire to the King. His career was progressing rapidly, and by the early 1740s the composer was among the highest-paid musicians at the court, regularly performing in private concerts before the royal couple. He continued publishing his music, and his works were frequently performed at the court in the late 1740s and early 1750s. Fellow composer Louis-Claude Daquin praised Guillemain in his 1752 Lettre sur les hommes c√©l√®bres: > When one speaks of a man full of fire, genius and life, one has to think of > Monsieur Guillemain, Musician to the King; he is perhaps the most > extraordinary and adroit violinist one can hear play. There are no > difficulties that can stump him and he can compose learned pieces which > sometimes embarrass his rivals. Among the great Masters, this celebrated > artist is one of the most productive. His works are full of touching beauty. However, Guillemain's private life was troubled. He was apparently a heavy drinker, especially in his later years, and he was also continually in debt because of his affinity for making expensive purchases. He died in Chaville, then a small settlement near Paris, in 1770; some contemporary accounts describe his death as a bloody suicide, with the composer stabbing himself with a knife fourteen times. However, the drinking habit and the fact that Guillemain was buried, may indicate that he died a natural death.

Pitts (born January 1, 1947), known as Jim Pitts, is an American state politician and lawyer who served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1993 to 2015. He was the chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee for four legislative sessions. He is a Republican from Waxahachie in Ellis County, south of his native Dallas, Texas.

Pitts served for fourteen years as a member of the board of trustees for the Waxahachie Independent School District. He was serving as president of the school board when he was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1992. Family Pitts was born January 1, 1947, in Dallas, Texas.Texas Birth Index, 1903-1997. He is the twin son (with John R. Pitts) of Roy Eugene Pitts and Agnes Theresa Maloney, who currently live in Henderson County. His sister, Rosemary Burns, also lives in Henderson County. In 1971, he married the former Frances Evelyn Eastham; she died in an automobile accident in June 2004. They had three children: daughters Duffy and Ashley and son Ryan. All three of his children are graduates of Southern Methodist University. Duffy is married to Dr. Scott Bloemendal and the mother of three children. Ashley is the Director of Development for the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University. Ryan is a graduate of the University of Texas School of Law and married the former Faith Anne Pustmueller on September 2, 2012. Legislative career Pitts was elected on November 3, 1992, as the state representative for District 10, which comprises Hill and Ellis counties. The district was created from the 1991 redistricting of the state. During the 1993 session of the Texas Legislature, Pitts served on the House Committees on Economic Development and Transportation. He was appointed to the committees on Criminal Jurisprudence and Corrections for the 74th Legislative Session in 1995. During the 75th Legislative Session, Pitts served as a member of the Appropriations Committee and the State, Federal and International Relations Committee. =Introduction of juvenile death penalty legislation= In April 1998, Pitts introduced legislation which would have permitted capital punishment for offenders as young as eleven years old, though he stated that the legislation was not crafted with the intent of such sentences becoming commonplace. The legislation did not pass, and was rejected by then-Governor George W. Bush, who stated that he favored the then-present minimum age of seventeen (the minimum age, per the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Stanford v. Kentucky (1988) was then sixteen years of age, though Roper v. Simmons (2005) raised this to eighteen). =1999‚Äìpresent= In 1999, during the 76th Legislative Session, Pitts was appointed to serve on the House Committees for Appropriations, Financial Institutions, and Redistricting; he retained these positions in the 77th Session. Pitts also chaired the Appropriations subcommittees for Regulatory Agencies and Major Information Systems. He also retained his posts as chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulatory Agencies and as a member of the Select Committee on Teacher Health Insurance. During 78th Legislative Session in 2003, Pitts served his third term on the House Appropriations Committee, and was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee, and the Redistricting Committee. Pitts was also appointed to serve on the Select Committee on Public School Finance and as chairman of the Subcommittee on High Schools. Prior to the 79th Legislative Session in 2005, Pitts was chosen to serve as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He was subsequently reappointed chairman at the beginning of the 79th Legislative Session.Texas House of Representatives Committees During the 81st Legislative Session in 2009, Pitts served as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He also served severed on the Redistricting Committee, Federal Economic Stabilization Funding Committee, and the Fiscal Stability Committee. In 2011, Frank Phillips College in Borger, along with Ranger College in Ranger, Brazosport College in Lake Jackson, and Odessa College in Odessa, were proposed for closure by the State of Texas. The Texas Association of Community Colleges rallied successfully to keep the four institutions open. In a letter to Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio and Representative Pitts as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, TAAC leaders referred to state budget restrictions at the time: > Community colleges are fully aware of the state's budget crisis, and we > understand that we will have to bear our share of the budget pain. We pledge > to work with you to reach a fair and equitable solution ... the decision to > close these four colleges is unfair and inequitable in that it appears to be > arbitrary and ill-advised. We stand in support of our sister colleges, and > we look forward to a productive debate ... Target: Tom Craddick In December 2006, just before the commencement of the 80th legislative session, Pitts announced his candidacy for the position of Speaker, held since 2003 by fellow Republican Tom Craddick of Midland. Pitts and colleagues Brian McCall and Senfronia Thompson actively challenged Craddick. In early January 2007, the two Republicans, Pitts and McCall, joined forces with the agreement that Pitts would be put forth as a consensus candidate for Speaker. However, a \\"test vote\\" based on a secret ballot failed to show that Pitts could unseat Craddick. Pitts and fellow Republicans Charlie Geren, Brian McCall, and Robert Talton continued to fight what they called \\"arm twisting and intimidation,\\"Craddick Can't Get There and late in the legislative session, other Republicans such as chairmen Byron Cook of Corsicana, Jim Keffer of Eastland, and Fred Hill, joined the fight to oust Craddick. The attempts to remove the Speaker were then unsuccessful because Craddick asserted that he held the absolute power as Speaker to acknowledge or deny motions, making it implausible, if not impossible, for one of his opponents to be recognized in order to begin the proper parliamentary proceedings necessary to remove the Speaker. Early in 2009, Pitts joined a small group of Republicans, including Byron Cook, Jim Keffer, and Burt Solomons of North Carrollton, who voted with the Democrats to topple Speaker Craddick and replace him with Joe Straus. 2013 Budget Challenge In 2013, Appropriations chairman Pitts and Speaker Straus faced the task of reconciling an expected $4.7 billion shortfall in the state budget. Since 2003, annual spending by Texas state government has been kept in the lower single digits and below the rates of inflation and population growth. Pitts awaited a report from the retiring Texas Comptroller Susan Combs regarding the expected receipts for the 2013‚Äì2014 biennium.\\"State Budget: Solons take a conservative approach: The Legislature still needs to make up a $4.7 billion deficit in the current budget\\", Laredo Morning Times, November 19, 2012, pp. 1, 12A Admissions controversy at University of Texas-Austin Pitts became ensnared in an admissions \\"clout\\" scandal at the University of Texas at Austin in 2013. Publicly available documents revealed that Pitts and two other members of the House sent more letters to the president of the University of Texas on behalf of applicants than anyone else whose correspondence was included in a recent inquiry into admissions favoritism.http://watchdog.org/146009/ut-admissions- branch/ The University of Texas System retained Kroll, Inc. to investigate admissions practices at the University of Texas-Austin. The investigation was expanded in December 2014 by former UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa.http://www.texastribune.org/2014/12/17/ut-system-extends- investigators-contract/ Retirement in 2015 Pitts did not seek reelection to the state House in 2014. He was succeeded in the position by another Waxahachie Republican, John Wray, who won a runoff contest on May 27 with T. J. Fabby, 6,031 votes (52.9 percent) to 5,363 (47.1 percent).

(via I-95). Route description I-20 enters the Palmetto State after crossing the Savannah River from Augusta, Georgia. Known as the J. Strom Thurmond Freeway, the highway heads northeastward, bypassing Aiken and Lexington before reaching the state capital of Columbia. It was constructed in various stages beginning in late 1963, with the final section between SC-340 and the Business Spur opening in August 1975. At Columbia, I-20 crosses the Saluda and Broad rivers and travels through the northern part of the city and turns eastward, bypassing Fort Jackson and Camden before reaching Florence. It is at Florence where I-20 sees its eastern terminus at I-95. However, for about , the highway continues to downtown Florence as Business Spur 20\\\\. =Services= The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) operates and maintains one welcome center and two rest areas along I-20. The welcome center, which has a travel information facility on site, is located in North Augusta at mile markers 0.5 (eastbound), and the rest areas are located in Lugoff at mile markers 99 (east and westbound) between Exit 92 (US 601) and the bridges over the Wateree River. Common at all locations are public restrooms, public telephones, vending machines, picnic area and barbecue grills. A pair of closed rest areas exist between Exits 44 and 51. The South Carolina Department of Public Safety (SCDPS) and State Transport Police (STP) operate and maintain two truck inspection/weigh stations. The eastbound truck weigh station can be found in Jones Crossroads at mile marker 35, and the westbound weigh station can be found in Lexington at mile marker 53.5. History Approaching the eastern end of I-20 on I-95 I-20 first appeared between 1964-1967, with its first section completed from SC 6, south of Lexington, to Spears Creek Church Road (S-40-53), south of Pontiac. A second section, from the Georgia state line to US 25 / SC 121 was completed in 1967. In 1968 or 1969, I-20 was extended east from Spears Creek Church Road (S-40-53) to US 601, south of Camden. In 1971, I-20 combined the two segments by completing the gap between US 25 / SC 121 to SC 6. In 1973, I-20 was extended east to US 521\\\\. In 1974, it extended east again to US 15\\\\. In 1975, another extension east to US 401\\\\. And finally, in 1976, I-20 reached its destination with I-95 and the city of Florence. Also same year exit numbers were installed. In the late 1980s, I-20 was widened to six lanes between US 378 and I-77. =Proposed extension= The first proposal to extend I-20 was at the time of its designation in the state, and consisted of plans to extend it east from Florence to Myrtle Beach. However, because Myrtle Beach was not yet the tourist destination it later became, the state eventually widened US 76, US 501 and established SC 576 connecting the two U.S. Highways in the 1970s. In 2003, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley pushed forward a proposal to extend I-20 eastward from Florence to Wilmington, which became part of NCDOT's strategic transportation plan. The proposed routing would overlap I-20 along I-95 to the I-74 / US 74 interchange, then travel east (concurrently with US 74) into Wilmington. In 2005, this proposal became part of the SAFETEA-LU transportation legislation, North Carolina received $5 million for a feasibility study for this extension. While the extension had support in North Carolina, with justification that a direct route from Atlanta to the Port of Wilmington could be a boom to the economy, this view was not shared by officials in South Carolina. In 2009, soon after Governor Mike Easley left office, the proposed routing was removed from all NCDOT plans and was officially dropped. The proposal was never officially discussed with SCDOT nor submitted to AASHTO and FHWA for consideration. Exit list Related routes I-20 has one auxiliary Interstate within South Carolina. Numbered I-520, it runs between North Augusta and Augusta, Georgia. Originally a spur, it serves as a partial beltway of the Augusta area, split between Georgia and South Carolina. =Interstate 20 Business= Interstate 20 Business (I-20 Bus) is a four-lane boulevard grade business spur of I-20 along David H. McLeod Boulevard, between I-95 and Palmetto Street (US 76). Construction began by 1969, completed in 1970, it has remained unchanged since inception.

Ioana Sturdza, Raymond Vianu, Mary L«éz«érescu, Fairy Tales and Legends from Romania p 70 Twayne Publishers, New York 1982 Synopsis Once, a prince began to cry six weeks before he was due to be born. Nothing his mother did placated him until she promised him that he could marry Sanda-Lucsandra, a fair maiden who lived past nine lands and nine seas. When he grew up, however, he demanded that his parents marry him to her, and when the queen confessed she had made up Sanda-Lucsandra, he set out in search of her. He came to a great bay tree. While the prince rested under it, he heard a verse being pronounced, calling a maiden out, and a beautiful maiden came out. He seduced her, promising to marry her, and sneaked away the next morning. He came to a castle, where the master claimed that his own daughter was Sanda-Lucsandra and a wedding was arranged. The maiden could no longer get back into the bay tree, and so set out in search of the prince. She traded her clothing, unsuitable for travel, with a monk. Then she found the carriage where the prince was bringing his bride back. The prince took her up and she told the story of seeing a maiden weeping in the meadow because a prince had seduced her, and she could no longer get into the bay tree. He had her tell it to him again and again. At his parents' castle, on the wedding day, the monk vanished. The prince went to the room and found the monk hanging by the neck. When he went to cut her down, he realized she was a woman, and the maiden, and that he had not married the true Sanda-Lucsandra. He sent back the false bride and married the maiden from the bay tree.

Constructed for German-born confectioner William Westerfeld in 1889, the home is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is San Francisco Landmark Number 135. History William Westerfeld, a German-born confectioner, arrived in San Francisco in the 1870s. By the 1880s, he had established a chain of bakeries. He hired local architect Henry Geilfuss p. 198. p. 78. to design for his family of six a 28-room mansion with an adjoining rose garden and carriage house. The house was constructed in 1889 at a cost of $9,985 (). When Westerfeld died in 1895, the home was sold to John Mahony, of Mahony Brothers, noted for building the St. Francis Hotel and the Palace Hotel after the 1906 earthquake.Brown, Serena. Third Thursday October 2018: Westerfeld House. Feldman Architecture. Retrieved March 16, 2020. Mahony replaced the rose garden with flats to meet the city's dire need for housing. In 1928 a group of Czarist Russians bought the home. They turned the ground-floor ballroom into a nightclub called Dark Eyes and used the upper floors for meeting rooms.Bowling, Mary Jo (March 28, 2016). The Westerfeld House: San Francisco's most storied Victorian. Curbed San Francisco. Retrieved March 16, 2020. The house became known informally as the \\"Russian Embassy\\". In 1948 the home was converted into a 14-unit apartment building. For most of the next two decades, the units were rented to African-American musicians who played in the neighborhood jazz clubs. John Handy was allegedly one of many to call the Westerfeld House his home, although he later denied having been a boarder there. In 1965 Charles Fracchia purchased the building to use as a residence but never occupied it. The house was mentioned in the book The Electric Kool- Aid Acid Test. The Calliope Company, a fifty-member collective, moved in. In 1967 underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger took up residence.Yu, Brandon (July 5, 2018). ‚ÄòSnaggletooth‚Äô fits right into Westerfeld House‚Äôs horror heritage in SF. San Francisco Chronicle.

Two men purchased the home for $45,000 in 1969 (). They remodeled the fourth floor servants' quarters beyond recognition. The house was left standing despite an urban renewal project, which claimed 6,000 Victorian-era buildings over a 60-block area in the Western Addition. Jim Siegel purchased the home in 1986 for $750,000 and has since retrofitted the foundation, removed the dropped ceilings, re-wired, re-roofed, and re-plumbed, and restored the interior and exterior woodwork and the historic, ground-floor ballroom, and decorated the ceiling with period wallpaper crafted by Bradbury & Bradbury.

Gruda is a Northern Albanian tribe and historical tribal region in southeastern Montenegro, just north of Lake Skadar, which includes the small town of Tuzi, in Podgorica. It is inhabited by a majority of ethnic Albanians. Etymology The name is derived from the Slavic term gruda, meaning \\"soil, sod\\". Geography Albanian bayraks as of 1918. Gruda and Hoti on the far left side. Gruda is an Albanian historical tribal region within Montenegro, along the mountainous border with Albania, east of Podgorica. It borders to the historical tribal regions of Hoti and Kelmendi to the south and east (in Southern Montenegro and Northern Albania), and Slavic regions to the north. The historical Gruda tribal region, as described by A. Joviƒáeviƒá (1923), include the following settlements: *Settlements on the right bank of Cemi :  Dino≈°a / Dinosh√´  Lovka / Llofk√´  Pikalj / Pikal√´  Prifti / Prift  Seli≈°ta / Selisht√´ * Gornja Seli≈°ta / Selisht√´ e Ep√´rme * Donja Seli≈°ta / Selisht√´ e Poshtme *Settlements on the left bank of Cijevna:  Gurec / Gurrec  Kaljaj / Kalaj  Kr≈°evo / Kshev√´  Milje≈° / Milesh * Gornji Milje≈° / Mileshi i Ep√´rm * Donji Milje≈° / Mileshi i Posht√´m  Pa≈°kala / Passhkall√´  Vuljeviƒái / Vulaj * Gornji Vuljeviƒái / Vulaj i Ep√´rm In the western half of Gruda lies the small mountain range of Deƒçiƒá/De√ßiq, as well as the river, which runs through Gruda, separating Deƒçiƒá/De√ßiq and the village of Suka, as well as forming the border between the lands of the Gruda tribe and those of Kuƒçi. Deƒçiƒá/De√ßiq and Suka being the largest mountains in Gruda. History In 1485, Gruda was recorded as a nahiye in the Ottoman administration. In 1499 Hoti and Gruda rose against the Ottoman demands for taxes and conscripts. It was also involved in a series of revolts in the 17th century, often together with the Mal√´sian tribes. In Mariano Bolizza's 1614 report and description of the Sanjak of Scutari, Gruda had 40 households and 100 soldiers. The Old Kuƒçi constantly were in conflict with the Old Gruda; the Kuƒçi were stronger, thus they stole livestock from Gruda, and if only one Kuƒçi would be killed in conflicts, and several Gruda, they would penalize the whole tribe. In 1658, the seven tribes of Kuƒçi, Vasojeviƒái, Bratono≈æiƒái, Piperi, Klimenti, Hoti and Gruda allied themselves with the Republic of Venice, establishing the so-called \\"Seven-fold barjak\\" or \\"alaj-barjak\\", against the Ottomans. Gruda proved to be a focus of conflict between Ottoman Empire and Montenegro during the 1880s. During border negotiations Italy suggested in April 1880 for the Ottoman Empire to give Montenegro the Tuz district that contained mainly Catholic Gruda and Hoti populations which would have left the tribes split between both countries. The tribes affected by the negotiations swore a besa (pledge) to resist any reduction of their lands and sent telegrams to surrounding regions for military assistance. The Porte insisted that in upcoming treaty to cede Ulcinj to Montenegro, Gruda be left to Albanians. During the same time, Porte's representative, Riza Pasha was turning a blind eye to the preparations of Albanian League for resistance against the upcoming Montenegrin occupation. According to Baron Franz Nopcsa, Gruda was a primarily Catholic tribe with a population of ca. 7,000 in 1907. Having been forced to disarm, and under considerable pressure by the Ottomans to convert to Islam, (and not having staged any major revolt against Ottoman authority for nearly a half century) the Albanian highlanders launched a guerrilla campaign against the occupying armies. The Gruda tribe was instrumental in Ottoman resistance in the region. The mountains north-east of Tuzi are remembered as the site of a major uprising against the Ottomans in 1911 which was among the first significant steps toward Albanian independence and probably the most distinguishing moment of the northern Albanian resistance. In 1911, under the leadership of Sokol Baci, Albanian guerrillas launched a major assault against the strategic high ground of Mount De√ßiq. The force is said to have taken about eighty casualties, but they ultimately prevailed, and planted the Albanian flag at the crest of the hill (the first time the flag had been raised in the country since 1469). This symbolic act represented a major sign of the Ottoman Empire's crumbling rule over the Balkans, and it cemented Gruda's reputation among the other ethnic Albanian tribes. On 23 June 1911 Albanian tribesmen and other revolutionaries gathered in Montenegro and drafted the Gre√ß√´ Memorandum demanding Albanian sociopolitical and linguistic rights with four of the signatories being from Gruda. In later negotiations with the Ottomans, an amnesty was granted to the tribesmen with promises by the government to build one to two primary schools in the nahiye of Gruda and pay the wages of teachers allocated to them. In 1913, the Great Powers at the Conference of London awarded Gruda and Hoti to Montenegro, thus cutting them off from the rest of Albania and from other Albanian highland tribes. Montenegrin forces invaded Gruda territory in the spring on 30 and 31 may, with many dead and injured. In July 1913, emissaries of Prince Nikola of Montenegro offered tribal leaders money and grain supplies to win them over to Montenegro, but they refused. As a reaction to the Montenegrin occupation of Tuzi in 1913, Gruda sent a large deputation to Vice admiral Sir Cecil Burney, to convey him their resolve not to submit to Montenegro. Border skirmishes, and fighting, continued over the next six months and, by 1914, the Montenegrin government announced its military occupation of Gruda and Hoti. Most of the settlements in Gruda were razed to the ground by the Montenegrin army. The surviving population some 700 families from Gruda and Hori, Fled to Kastrati. Part of the population emigrated in 1914 on the plain of north of Shkodra, forming the settlement of Gruda e Re (New Gruda) The city of Tuzi lies in the east end of Gruda. Of Tuzi's 3,789 residents, more than 2,000 are ethnic Albanians, making it, according to the 2003 census, the heaviest concentration of ethnic Albanians in Mal√´sia. Over the last 30 years there has been a minor influx from the surrounding villages of Albanians who are looking to take advantage of Tuzi's higher standard of living and better educational system. Ethnography Woman photographed by Marubi. In the late Ottoman period, the tribe of Gruda consisted of 225 Catholic and 225 Muslim households. Unlike other Albanian tribes who practised endogamy by intermarrying within their group, the Gruda allowed marriage with members of other tribes. The tribe of Gruda is divided into two clans, the Vuksangelaj/Vuksangeljiƒái and the Berishaj/Beri≈°iƒái. ;Vuksangelaj According to Andrija Joviƒáeviƒá, there exist different accounts regarding the origins of the Vuksangelaj family, among which he only provides three: * The first account describes the founder of the Vuksangelaj as Vuksan, who migrated from Suma near Skadar to Gruda. Vuksan had three sons - Iveza, Nik and Vuc, from whom descend the Iveziƒá, Nikoviƒá and Vucoki, respectively. * The second account describes the founder of the Vuksangelaj as Grud Suma, who migrated from Suma near Pult. Grud Suma initially settled in Geljina ≈†kala near Pikalj. Grud had three sons - Gjon, Ban and Jul. Gjon Gruda had one son, Gel Gjona. Gel Gjona had two sons - Vuksan Gela and Vu√ßin Gela. Vuksan Gela had four sons - Iveza, Nogza, Nik and Vuc, of which descend the Ivezaj/Iveziƒá, Sinishtaj/Sini≈°toviƒá, Nikaj/Nikoviƒá and Vucoki, respectively. Vu√ßin Gela had one son, from whom stem the Vu√ßinaj/Vuƒçiniƒái. Several members of the Vu√ßinaj family later migrated to Nik≈°iƒá. From Ban Gruda descend the Lulgjuraj/Ljuljƒëuroviƒái family. From Jul Gruda descend the Vulaj/Vuljeviƒá family. * The third account describes the founder of the Vuksangelaj as Gjon Suma. Gjon Suma escaped the village of Suma due to an earlier murder (blood revenge), and settled in the aforementioned Geljina ≈†kala. Gjon Suma had three sons - Gel, Pal and Sokol. Gel remained in Geljina ≈†kala. Pal initially moved to Bregviza near the Cijevna, and then to Lovka. Sokol migrated to Shkod√´r, where he converted to Islam. From Sokol descend the Sokolli/Sokoloviƒái in Shkod√´r. Gel Suma had two sons - Vuksan Gela and Vu√ßin Gela. Vuksan Gela had four sons - Iveza, Dok, Nik and Vuk, from whom descend the Ivezaj/Iveziƒá, Gjolaj/ƒêoljeviƒá, Nikaj/Nikoviƒá and Sinishtaj/Sini≈°toviƒá, respectively. From Vu√ßin Gela stem the Vu√ßinaj/Vuƒçiniƒá. ;Berishaj The Berishaj family descends from an individual named Priftaj. Priftaj was originally from Shal√´ who immigrated to Gruda and inhabited a village that now carries his name - Prifti. After arriving in Prifti, he discovered several native villagers from the Tihomir family. Priftaj was Catholic, while the Tihomiri were Orthodox. The Tihomir family later relocated to Orahovo in Kuƒçi, leaving the Berishaj family as the sole inhabitants of the village. =Families= Among brotherhoods (v√´llaz√´ri) in the village are: Ivezaj, Nikaj, Gjokaj, Gjolaj, Sinishtaj, Kalaj, Lulgjuraj, Berishaj, Vu√ßinaj, Bojaj, Vulaj, Stanaj. The following are Islamic converts of the last names above: Lulanaj, Kajoshaj, Beqaj, K√´rnaj, Pepaj, Hakshabanaj, Gilaj, Pecaj and F√´rlu√ßkaj. The surnames found in Gruda include: *Beqaj (Beƒáoviƒá) *Berishaj (Beri≈°aj, Beri≈°iƒá) *Bojaj (Bojoviƒá) *Dukaj (Dukiƒá) *Gjokaj (ƒêokaj, ƒêokoviƒá) *Gjolaj (ƒêoljaj, ƒêol(j)eviƒá) *Hakshabanaj (Ak≈°abanoviƒá) *Ivezaj (Iveziƒá)  Grimaj (Grimoviƒá), descend from Grim Deda Ivezaj  Pepaj (Pepiƒá), descend from Pep Gjona Ivezaj *Gilaj (Giljaj, Giljiƒá) *Hakaj *Haxhaj (Ad≈æoviƒá) *Kalaj (Kaljeviƒá) Sukaj (Sukoviƒá) *Kajoshaj (Kajo≈°eviƒá) *K√´rnaj (Krniƒá) *Lulanaj (Ljuljanaj, Ljuljanoviƒá) *Lulgjuraj (Ljuljƒëuraj, Ljuljƒëuroviƒá)  F√´rlu√ßkaj (Frljuƒçkiƒá) Abdic , Kaludjercic  Krkanaj (Krkanoviƒá)  Pecaj (Peceviƒá) *Neziraj * Nikaj (Nikoviƒá)  Lekaj (Lekiƒá) *Sinishtaj (Sini≈°taj, Sini≈°toviƒá) *Stanaj (Stanoviƒá), related to Vulaj/Vuljeviƒái *Vu√ßinaj (Vuƒçiniƒá) *Vulaj (Vuljaj, Vuljeviƒá), related to Stanaj/Stanoviƒái =Religion= Gruda was initially entirely Roman Catholic. Due to Ottoman Turkish presence, many families converted into Islam. While Catholics form a majority in most settlements in Gruda, Muslims form a majority in Ad≈æoviƒái, Dino≈°a and Milje≈°. The Gruda Church (Kisha e Grud√´s), built in 1528, dedicated to St. Michael, is located in the town of Milesh, not only an Albanian cultural landmark, its construction provides the most concrete reference date from which ethnic Albanians in the area trace their ancestry.Durham, Edith.

Prior to 1843 he was a geography instructor at the military academy in Erfurt, afterwards being appointed as a member of the Ober- Milit√§r-Examinationscommission in Berlin. In 1849 he began giving instruction in geography to Prince Albert of Prussia (1837‚Äì1906), and soon afterwards gave lectures on military geography at the Allgemeinen Kriegsschule. From 1855 to 1860 he performed geographical and cartological duties in Gotha, then returned to Berlin, where in 1867 he was appointed Abtheilungschef (division chief) to the Prussian General Staff. In 1870 he attained the rank of Colonel, and died three years later in Berlin due to cholera.ADB: Sydow, Emil von at Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie He is considered to be the founder of methodical school cartography, and distinguished himself by creating his own wall maps for classroom instruction. In 1838 he produced a physical map of Asia in his \\"Schulmethodischer Wand Atlas\\" (Methodic Wall Atlas for Schools) that was soon followed by maps of other continents. On these maps, Sydow developed a color methodology for landscape features using hachures, where green was depicted for lowlands and brown used for highlands. Wilhelm Perthes (1793‚Äì1853) of the publishing firm \\"Justus Perthes Geographische Anstalt Gotha\\" was impressed with Sydow's work and in 1849 produced the latter's \\"Schulatlas in sechsunddreigig Karten\\" (Schoolatlas in 36 maps), a work that eventually ran to 39 editions by 1887. After Sydow's death, Hermann Wagner (1840-1929), a geography professor at G√∂ttingen, designed the \\"Sydow-Wagner Methodischer Schulatlas\\" (Sydow-Wagner Methodical School Atlas) with 60 major and 50 inset maps.

It entered production in 1973 and is still carried on some Sukhoi Su-22s in developing countries but is no longer in Russian service. Use of the Kh-28 was restricted by its weight, limited seeker head, bulk and fuelling requirements, and it was superseded by the smaller, solid-fuel Kh-58 (AS-11 'Kilter') in the early 1980s. Development Soviet offensive doctrine in the early 1960s assumed that widespread use of nuclear weapons would disable Western radar-based air defence systems through electromagnetic pulses (EMP) effects. Also available from AccessMyLibrary Consequently, they paid little attention to the development of anti-radar missiles. However, in January 1963 the Berezniak design bureau (which became MKB Raduga in 1967) was tasked with developing such a missile as part of the K-28P weapon complex based around a 'Wild Weasel' version of the Yak-28 'Brewer' bomber (hence -28; the 'K' stands for kompleks, P stands for protivradiolokatsyonny 'anti-radar'). The main difficulty came in the design of the APR-28 guidance system undertaken by CKB-111 (later NPO Avtomatika). This meant that the Kh-28 missile was not ready until the 1970s. Flight trials were carried out on a Yak-28N, but by then the Yak-28 had ceased production and was perceived as obsolete, and the K-28P system was cancelled. Instead the Kh-28 was adapted for use by standard attack aircraft, in particular the Su-24 'Fencer-A' and Su-17M 'Fitter-C'. Design The KH-28 was the first liquid fueled Russian anti-radiation missile and was quickly replaced by the solid fuel KH-58 missile, according to research from Dr. Carlo Kopp, the editor in chief of Air Power Australia. The design of the Kh-28 was similar to ‚Äì but smaller than ‚Äì Raduga's Kh-22 (AS-4 'Kitchen') and KSR-5 (AS-6 'Kingfish') anti-shipping missiles. The Su-24 could carry one under each wing, and used the on-board Filin ('Eagle Owl') targeting system. The Su-17M could only carry one Kh-28 on the centreline, and used the Myetyel/Metel ('Blizzard') system in a pod under the right wing, later replaced by the Vyuga ('Snowstorm') pod. The APR-28 seeker on the original Kh-58 could only target the MIM-14 Nike-Hercules and English Electric Thunderbird SAM systems, although the Filin could recognise other frequencies. The Kh-58M had an updated X band seeker that could recognise the MIM-23 Hawk's AN/MPQ-33 and subsequent AN/MPQ-39 target- illumination radars, and the AN/MPQ-34 low-level target-acquisition radar. Other seekers may have been produced. The propulsion system consists of a fuel tank and a separate tank for the red fuming nitric acid (RFNA) oxidiser. One problem was that the missile required fuelling just before flight, and not many airfields had the appropriate facilities. Range is given variously as 80‚Äì95 km or 120 km. Operational history The Kh-28 entered service with the Soviet Air Force in 1973, and has been widely exported. It was cleared for use on the Su-17M/Su-20/Su-22M, Su-24M, Tupolev Tu-16, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25BM, MiG-27 and Tupolev Tu-22M aircraft. It was also tested on an Antonov An-12BL SEAD variant of the transport that could carry four of the missiles. A missile believed to be a Kh-28 was captured in Iraq by US forces during the first Gulf War in April 1991. One man was burnt by RFNA from the oxidiser tank while he was making it safe.

Eshetoftes, YWR, Eshetoftes 1158‚Äì67. < OE √¶sƒã \\"ash- tree\\", is the Anglo-Scandinavian version of this place name. The earliest known record of Eastoft dates from 1164, when there was a dispute between the Vicar of Adlingfleet and the abbot of Selby. Both claimed rights to the tithes from Reedness and Eastoft, and the dispute was settled when the Archbishop of York intervened, and ruled that the vicar of Adlingfleet should receive the tithes during his lifetime, but that he should make a payment of 40 shillings each year to the Abbey at Selby. Eastoft became a separate parish on 25 September 1855, when it was created from parts of Adlingfleet and Crowle. In 1900 Kelly's Directory noted that although it was a single ecclesiastical parish, it was still two civil parishes, known as Eastoft, Yorkshire and Eastoft, Lincolnshire. The area of the parish was listed as in Yorkshire and in Lincolnshire. At the time, the church, the school and the vicarage were all located in Yorkshire, and there were two halls. William Coulman was a Justice of the Peace and lived in Eastoft Hall, Yorkshire, while William Halkon lived at Eastoft Hall, Lincolnshire. The plantation next to Halkon's residence had once housed a chapel of ease and a burial ground, but all traces of them had gone by 1900. The River Don used to run directly through the middle of the village, on its route to its confluence with the River Trent near Adlingfleet. However, in 1626, Cornelius Vermuyden began the drainage of Hatfield Chase, and re-routed the river northwards from Stainforth to join the River Aire. He also re-routed the River Idle and the River Torne, both of which joined it at Sandtoft and contributed to its flow. Parts of the original course are marked on modern maps, one to the south-west and the other to the north-east of the village,Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map, 2006 and their orientation points to the presence of several large meanders in the vicinity. Before the drainage, the quality of the soil was poorer than soils on the higher areas of the Isle of Axholme. Land in Epworth, Haxey and Owston Ferry could be used for growing crops every year, but in Crowle and Eastoft, crops were normally grown for three years, and the land was left fallow for the fourth. The Paupers Drain to the south of Eastoft predates the works of Vermuyden. Following his work, there was social unrest, which was not finally resolved until 1717. After that, some improvements to the drainage of the area were made, including a new sewer, which crossed the Pauper's Drain, and was designed to remove water from Eastoft, Crowle and Luddington. It drained into the River Trent through a sluice at Keadby, but the sluice failed in 1761, resulting in devastating floods. Between 1903 and 1965, the village was served by Eastoft railway station on the Fockerby branch of the Axholme Joint Railway, although passenger services ended in 1933. The station was by the main road over to the north of the village, and the first sod was cut on 22 September 1898 by William Halkon of Eastoft Hall, the chairman of the directors, on land which was part of Boltgate Farm and belonged to Mr. Bramhill. Following the ceremony, toasts were made in the farmhouse. One of the contractors' locomotives used in the building of the line was named Halkon, after the chairman, and was used to convey a special train when the North Eastern Railway inspected the line, before taking it over from the original company. At the time, only Eastoft station was finished, and was cited as an example of how the others should be completed. The final train carrying passengers was chartered by North Axholme Secondary School and ran on 1 April 1965, four days before closure. The opening of the crossing gates over the A161 road at Eastoft was featured in television coverage of the event. Geography The village is a linear settlement along the A161 between Crowle and Goole, and includes a junction with the B1392 road leading to the village of Luddington. It comprises more than , and for the most part is little above sea-level. The parish is drained by a network of drainage ditches, which feed into the Adlingfleet Drain, running north-eastwards from the site of the railway crossing on the A161, and by the Pauper's Drain, running eastwards along the southern edge of the parish. The north-western edge of the parish is bordered by the parishes of Twin Rivers and Reedness, and this boundary is also the border between East Riding of Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire. To the east is Luddington, part of the civil parish of Luddington and Haldenby, and to the south is Crowle. Roughly 2 kilometres to the south-west of Eastoft village there is a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest called Eastoft Meadow.Natural England - Eastoft Meadow SSSI Meadows are a vanishing habitat in the British countryside with 97% of them destroyed since the 1930sThe Independent - Nearly all British wildflower meadows have been eradicated, prompting calls for urgent government action As of 2019 the site is not open to the public. Landmarks The Anglican parish church, which is dedicated to St Bartholomew, and was built in 1855 to the designs of J. Pearson, Esq., is a Grade II listed structure. It is built in Gothic Revival style and consists of a chancel with vestry on the north side, a nave with a porch on the south side and a bell gable, containing three bells. The church is situated on the Yorkshire side of the village and was consecrated by Thomas Musgrave, Archbishop of York, on 13 November 1855. The village has a Methodist church, which was built in 1869, and occupies a site which was once the bed of the River Don. In 1885 Kelly's Directory reported two chapels, a Primitive Methodist, and a Methodist New Connexion.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p. 384 Eastoft Hall is another Grade II listed building, built on Eastoft High Street in 1789. It is built of red-brown brick, some of which is rendered, with a slate roof. The east front has four bays, and the building was modified in the early-19th century and in 1905. A screen wall, some outbuildings and an attached gardeners cottage are also included in the listing. There is a second building also called Eastoft Hall, on Luddington Road, finished in stucco with ashlar dressings, which was built in the mid-18th century and modified in the mid-19th century. Eastoft War Memorial To the south of the village stands a Church of England Primary School, which was opened by Mrs. R. H. Coulman on 28 November 1961. It was dedicated by Leslie Stannard Hunter, the Bishop of Sheffield, and is situated very close to the site of the original school, which was built in 1847, largely as a result of the efforts of the Vicar of Adlingfleet, Rev. F. Sugden. It was extended in both 1873 and 1902. The village war memorial is sited in a semi-circular enclosure and bears the names of the men who gave their lives in the two World Wars. Eastoft also has a village green, village hall, and The River Don public house. A post office-cum-corner shop closed in 2008, as part of cutbacks which involved the closure of 42 post offices in the region. It was replaced by a Post Office Outreach service, where post office services were provided in the Village Hall by a travelling post master, initially on Tuesday mornings and Thursday afternoons.

A packraft is designed to be light enough to be carried for extended distances. Along with its propulsion system (collapsible paddles or lightweight oars) and safety equipment (PFD, clothing) the entire package is designed to be light and compact enough for an individual to negotiate rough terrain while carrying the rafting equipment together with supplies, shelter, and other survival or backcountry equipment. Modern packrafts vary from inexpensive vinyl boats lacking durability to sturdy craft costing over US $1,000. Most weigh less than nine pounds (4 kg) and usually carry a single passenger. The most popular propulsion systems involve a kayak paddle that breaks down into two to five pieces. Most often they are paddled from a sitting position, although kneeling can be advantageous in some situations. Pioneers Halkett boat, an early type of packraft Pioneering use of packrafts is difficult to trace, as float tubes, inner tubes, and other small boats can in some of their uses be considered equivalent to packrafts, and have been used around the world for over a century, beginning with the Halkett boat. However, Dick Griffith is documented to have used a packraft to descend Copper Canyon's Urique River (Chihuahua, Mexico) in 1952Dial, Roman. Packrafting! An Introduction and How-to Guide. Beartooth Mountain Press, Bozeman, MT. 2008 before introducing them to the Alaska Mountain Wilderness Classic adventure race in 1982. Packrafts are now common equipment in that race. A variety of companies have made durable packrafts in the past including Sherpa, Curtis, and American Safety. Furthermore, aviator emergency rafts have been used for packrafting purposes in a variety of applications. Pioneering use of packrafts generally consisted of using boats intended as pool toys or lake craft in moving water while carrying gear or passengers. The discomfort of these non-durable boats led to the invention and marketing of the modern packraft. Contemporary use Alaska is generally considered the birthplace of packrafting as long distance, non-motorized, landscape travel across untracked wilderness necessitates a small, portable boat for water crossings. Dick Griffith, Roman Dial (author of Packrafting! An Introduction and How-to Guide), the Alaska Mountain Wilderness Classic, Sheri Tingey (founder of Alpacka Rafts), and Erin McKittrick (author of A Long Trek Home: 4,000 Miles by Boot, Raft and Ski), and her husband Bretwood Higman all are, or have been, based in Alaska. In the U.S. outside Alaska, Forrest McCarthy, Nathan Shoutis, and Ryan Jordan have advanced backcountry packrafting in Wyoming, Montana, Washington, Utah, and Arizona. Packrafting has become popular in Nordic countries and elsewhere in Europe. Packrafts have also been used in Mexico, Southeast Asia, Australia (including its Franklin River), New Zealand, Patagonia, and tropical South America. Typically the boats are carried to cross and float rivers, streams and lakes while carried between watersheds. A packrafter enters an ice canyon on Matanuska Glacier, Alaska.Packrafts have historically been used as portable boats for long distance wilderness travel, usage that reached its apogee in the Higman-McKittrick 4,500 mile expedition along the Pacific Coast from Seattle to the Aleutian Islands. This classical use has been modified by most packraft owners to shorter day trips that mix trail hiking and river and creek floats or lake paddles. In Europe packrafts are used together with train travel. Most of these hike and paddle applications are in gentler water of Class II or less. However, low-flow steep creeks rated to Class V and other whitewater runs that were previously considered suitable only for kayaks and bigger rafts, are now run frequently by packrafters. The addition of spray decks and thigh straps allow more precise control of the craft. Eskimo rolling in packrafts is now done routinely. Packrafts are increasingly popular among fishers and hunters as well as travelers who wish to carry a lightweight craft on airplanes. Characteristics An Alpacka Raft paddled via kayak paddleA typical cold water set-up including packraft with thigh straps and spray deck, safety lines, paddle, suitable clothing (such as a dry suit), inflation bag, helmet, backpack, dry bag weigh 15 pounds (7 kg). While they can be inflated by mouth or electric pumps, most contemporary users carry light weight inflation bags. Distinction from \\"pool toy\\" In this article, packrafts/trail boats are differentiated from pool toys or flotation devices, which are intended for use in an enclosed and controlled body of water, such as a swimming pool. A packraft/trail boat is intended for use in open bodies of water. Distinction from \\"man-portable\\" A packraft is distinguished from a strictly man-portable raft insofar as it is designed to be light enough to represent only a fraction of the total weight an individual can reasonably carry. A packraft can be carried for extended periods, along with food, water, shelter, and other supplies that would enable the individual to traverse long distances through difficult terrain. All rafts listed in this article weigh less than five pounds without paddles or spray decks. Usage Packrafts are used in a variety of applications. These include: Fishing from a packraft Negotiating a creek, backpack strapped to the bow *River crossings *Whitewater (up to Class IV) *Remote lake fishing *Travel boats *Adventure racing *Open water crossings *Remote river descents *Hunting *Canyoneering *Aviator boats *Rock climbing Access A Sevlyor trail boat in action on the Queets River, Washington Slackrafting The expense of high quality packrafts costing $US500 - $US1000 has led to interest in using PVC inflatable boats and even pool toys costing $US15 - $US100 as a cheap alternative. These vinyl substitutes are not designed for anything more challenging than boating on still water no further than an easy swim to shore; they puncture easily, nor do they inflate to high pressures. For this reason they have been described as 'slackrafts'; they do, however, offer some advantages over the even cheaper option of Liloing.

Even the river Eider north of Hamburg flooded the surrounding land. Many towns such as Cologne, Mainz, Frankfurt am Main, W√ºrzburg, Regensburg, Passau and Vienna were seriously damaged. The affected area extended to Carinthia and northern Italy. The overall number of casualties is not known, but it is believed that in the Danube area alone 6000 people were killed. = 15th century = * The All Saints Day Flood of 1436 () on All Saints' Day (1 November) 1436 was a storm tide that hit the entire North Sea coast of the German Bight. In the North Frisian village of Tetenb√ºll alone 173 people died. Eidum on the island of Sylt was destroyed; its inhabitants left and founded the village of Westerland as a result. List on Sylt was also abandoned after the floods and rebuilt further west. Dykes burst along the river Oste and in Kehdingen. The island of Pellworm was separated from neighbouring Nordstrand, Germany and only diked again in 1550. = 16th century = * 1530 St. Felix's flood * Mississippi River Flood of March 1543. The flooding reportedly lasted for 40 days. = 17th century = * The California Flood of 1605 was caused by heavy rains and covered many parts of California in water. * The Burchardi Flood was a storm tide that struck the North Sea coast of North Frisia and Dithmarschen on the night between 11 and 12 October 1634. Overrunning dikes, it shattered the coastline and caused thousands of deaths (8,000 to 15,000 people drowned). = 18th century = * Christmas Flood of 1717. Flood in Netherlands, Germany, and Scandinavia. 14,000 drowned. * Mississippi River Flood of December 1734 to June 1735. New Orleans was inundated by the flooding. * New Hampshire Flood of 1740. The Merrimack River flooded in December. It is the first recorded flood in New Hampshire history. * New Hampshire/Maine Flood of October 1785. In New Hampshire, a significant flood struck the Cocheco, Baker, Pemigewasset, Contoocook and Merrimack rivers on 23 October which established records at Lowell which held until 1902. The Androscoggin River flooded significantly, which destroyed many homesteads in what would become Bethel, Maine. Those that survived the flood moved uphill into less valuable, plots. Turner's first mill was destroyed during this inundation. * Great Pumpkin Flood of October 1786. Central Pennsylvania flood. Received its name due to the pumpkins that were washed away in the flood on 5 October. It was a major flood in the Susquehanna River basin. * Mississippi River Flood of July 1788. Severe flooding of the Mississippi River resulted from a hurricane landfall * Storofsen, Norway, flood of July 1789 * Red River of the South flood of 1800. According to the Caddo tribe, a \\"great flood\\" moved down the river and reinforced the \\"Great Log Raft\\" on the river. This raft was a natural dam that increased water levels on some of the Red River tributaries. This process formed Caddo Lake. = 19th century = * Mississippi River Flood of 1809. All of the lower Mississippi River was inundated by flooding. * Mississippi River Flood of 1825. The flood of 1825 is the last known inundation of New Orleans due to spring flooding * Great Mississippi River Flood of 1844. The largest flood ever recorded on the Missouri River and Upper Mississippi River in terms of discharge. This flood was particularly devastating since the region had few if any levees at the time. Among the hardest hit were the Wyandot who lost 100 people in the diseases that occurred after the flood. The flood also is the highest recorded for the Mississippi River at St. Louis. After the flood, Congress in 1849 passed the Swamp Act providing land grants to build stronger levees. * Great Mississippi River Flood of 1851. The flood occurred after record-setting rainfalls across the U.S. Midwest and Plains from May to August 1851. The State of Iowa experienced significant flooding extending to the Lower Mississippi River basin. Historical evidence suggest flooding occurred in the eastern Plains, from Nebraska to the Red River basin, but these areas were sparsely settled in 1851. Heavy rainfall also occurred in the Ohio River basin. In June, major flooding on the Mississippi River was experienced. * The Great Flood of 1862. Struck the west coast of North America in December 1861 and January 1862. An atmospheric river from the tropics brought 43 days of rain to the U.S. states of California, Utah and Oregon as well as the Mexican state of Sonora. It was the worst disaster ever to strike California; the state's Central Valley was effectively an inland sea for months afterwards. State government temporarily moved to San Francisco because the capital, Sacramento, was under 10 feet (3.3 m) of water; the damage and the ensuing shortfall in tax revenues nearly bankrupted the state. * The 1872 Baltic Sea flood. Storm surge that affected the Baltic Sea coast from Denmark to Pomerania on the night of 12‚Äì13 November 1872. The flood cost the lives of at least 271 people on the Baltic Sea coast; 2,850 houses were destroyed or at least badly damaged and 15,160 people left homeless as a result. * Great Mississippi River Flood of 1874. Heavy spring rains caused the Mississippi River to overflow, breaching levees and flooding enormous swathes of the Lower Mississippi Valley. The flooding began in February and only began to recede on 20 May. According to the New Orleans Daily Picayune of 3 May, thirty-one of Louisiana's fifty-three parishes (home to some 375,000 people) were entirely or partially underwater. The Picayune also reported that breaches at Hushpakana[sic.] and Bolivar, Mississippi, had \\"transformed the Yazoo Valley into an inland lake.\\" Mayor Louis A. Wiltz of New Orleans published a circular on 30 May addressed to \\"the Mayors of thirty-four large American cities\\" seeking contributions of cash and provisions for relief efforts. In the circular, the Flood of 1874 was described as the highest on record. It also included the observations of former U.S. Surveyor General for Louisiana William J. McCulloh, who estimated that a total of 12,565,060 acres had been flooded across Louisiana (8,065,000), Mississippi (2,500,000), and Arkansas (2,000,000). * Mississippi River Flood of 1882. Intense spring rain storms, beginning on 19 February 1882, led to a rapid rise of the Ohio River and flooding along the river from Cincinnati to St. Louis. The effects were much more devastating in the Lower Mississippi Valley, with an estimated 20,000 people made homeless in Arkansas alone. Such was the devastation that, in its wake, Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans in Congress hailing from those states afflicted by the flooding made common cause to increase appropriations for the Rivers and Harbor Act to $19 million, $5.4 million of which was earmarked for internal improvements and federal aid to the flooded areas. While not opposed to internal improvements on principle, President Chester A. Arthur nonetheless vetoed the Act on 1 August 1882. Congress overrode his veto the following day. * In 1889, the South Fork Dam broke, causing the massive Johnston Flood of 1889 that took 2,209 lives in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. * On 8 September 1900, in Galveston, Texas, a storm made landfall, leaving about 7,000 to 12,000 dead. It remains to the present day the deadliest single-day event in US history. = 20th century =  1910s  * In 1910, large areas of Paris were flooded when the river burst its banks. * In 1920, The Great Flood of Tokyo, when 3700 houses, were swept away, 2200, partially destroyed and nearly 400,000 damaged. * The Great Flood of 1913, which included the Great Dayton Flood, killed 650 people and destroyed 20,000 homes in the United States. It also damaged historic photographic plates belonging to Wilbur and Orville Wright. It ended canal transportation in Ohio. * The 1916 Clermont, Queensland flood was the worst flood in Clermont history. * The Hatfield Flood of San Diego, United States, of 1916 destroyed the Lower Otay Dam, damaged the Sweetwater Dam, and caused 22 deaths and $4.5 million in damages.  1920s  * The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was one of the most destructive floods in United States history and the impetus for many later Flood Control Acts. * The Great Vermont Flood of 1927 which destroyed over 1200 bridges in Vermont, and one of the biggest floods in its history. * The 1929 New Zealand cyclone caused the deepest flood ever to hit the city of Dunedin.  1930s  * The 1931 Yellow River flood caused between 800,000 and 4,000,000 deaths in China, one of a series of disastrous floods on the Yellow River. It was one of the worst floods in history. * The Ohio River flood of 1937 occurred in late January and February 1937, causing damage along the Ohio River and several smaller tributaries from Pittsburgh, Illinois, to Cairo, Illinois.

It is also a sarcastic metaphor for following instructions or procedures slavishly without critical thought.

Mabel's Busy Day Synopsis Entrepreneur Mabel (Mabel Normand) tries to sell hot dogs at a car race. She bribes a policeman with one of her treats to gain access to the race course but does not do a very good business once she is inside. Meanwhile, Charlie tangles with another police officer but still crashes the gate. He is pursued by the policeman. Mabel sets down her box of hot dogs and leaves them unattended for a moment. Charlie finds the box and freely gives the hot dogs away to hungry spectators at the track. Mabel finds out that Charlie has stolen her box of hot dogs and sends the police after him. Chaos ensues. Reviews Motion Picture News commented, \\"Any comedy with Charles Chaplin and Mabel Normand as the leads is sure to be an immense success. There is no plot at all, but the events that transpire in the one reel are side- splitting.\\" A reviewer from Bioscope wrote, \\"The business in question consists of selling sausages on a racecourse, and...it may be imagined that pretty Mabel's business is strenuous and mirth-provoking.

They travelled in the Kaukifera or Kaunitoni, and the canoe landed in the western reef of Viti Levu, just north of the village of Viseisei, between Nadi and Lautoka. Here the crew split, with one faction making a home on the island with Lutunasobasoba as a chief. The Kaunitoni then sailed eastwards along the coast of Viti Levu under the leadership of Degei, landing at Rakiraki and going up to the Nakauvandra Mountains. This particular story has come under much criticism and scrutiny from some anthropologists and linguists who suggest that the story is in fact of ‚Äúmissionary parentage‚Äù owing to one telling of the story which tells that Degei and Lutunasobasoba were from Lake Tanganyika.

Ioana Sturdza, Raymond Vianu, Mary L«éz«érescu, Fairy Tales and Legends from Romania p 70 Twayne Publishers, New York 1982 Synopsis An old woman told her husband that he had to lose his two children, a son and a daughter, by his first marriage, in the woods. The first time, the boy had been playing in the ashes, and the children came back, but the second time, the old man succeeded in losing them. They could not find water anywhere, until they came to the tracks of a fox where water was welling, but the sister warned her brother that drinking that would turn him into a fox. At the tracks of a bear, she warned him again. At the tracks of a stag, she warned him again, but he was too thirsty and drank. He became a golden stag. He carried off his sister in cradle in his antlers, and made a nest for her, up in a tree, where she grew up. One day, a prince saw her and fell in love. He promised a fortune to whoever wooed that girl for him. An old woman saw the golden stag and did not know how to address it, so she lured the girl down by pretending to be foolish with her cook fire, and carried her off to the prince. When the stag followed, the sister said that he was her brother, and the prince gave him a fine stable with plenty to eat. They were all happy except a gypsy girl who had been the prince's favorite. She lured the sister into the forest where she went to sleep. Then the gypsy dressed herself as the prince's wife and disguised her face, but the stag knew her at once. The prince and his men followed the stag and retrieved the girl; then he had the gypsy girl stoned to death. Commentary The method of luring the bride down from the tree is also found in \\"Little Wildrose\\". More commonly, as in \\"Brother and Sister\\", \\"The Six Swans\\", or \\"Mary's Child\\", the hero succeeds in luring her away himself.

He played club football in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for Fortitude Valley and in the NSWRL premiership for the St. George Dragons and Brisbane Broncos, achieving selection to play for Queensland in State of Origin series, and London Broncos. Career Hailing from Cairns, Queensland, Gavin Allen started his career with Brisbane's Fortitude Valley Diehards before moving to Sydney's St George Dragons for the 1987-88 seasons. Returning to Queensland for the 1989 Brisbane Broncos season, and although not big for a front-rower, Allen's exceptionally high workrate made him a vital component of the Broncos' forward pack from 1990. Allen made his interstate representative debut when selected on the bench for Game I of the 1991 State of Origin series, becoming Queensland State of Origin player No. 72. Allen played a major part in the Broncos forward pack that dominated St George in the 1992 grand final. After taking part in the club's win over Wigan in the World Club Challenge, Allen was a non-playing reserve in the Broncos return bout with the Dragons in the 1993 grand final. With Glenn Lazarus, Andrew Gee and Mark Hohn competing, however, Allen found it very difficult at this time to maintain his first- grade berth. In 1995, Allen's career was winding down but had a brief reprieve when - by now a fringe first-grader - he was the only Bronco not signed by Super League. Consequently, Paul Vautin picked him up and chose him for the three State of Origin games, in which his experience and workrate helped players like Gary Larson and Billy Moore win Queensland a totally unexpected cleansweep. Allen retired at the end of the season.

In the beginning, shoulder pads were shaped as a semicircle or small triangle, and were stuffed with wool, cotton or sawdust. They were positioned at the top of the sleeve, to extend the shoulder line. A good example of this is their use in \\"leg o' mutton\\" sleeves, or the smaller puffed sleeves which were revived at this time, and were based on styles from the 1890s. In men's styles, shoulder pads are often used in suits, jackets and overcoats, usually sewn at the top of the shoulder and fastened between the lining and the outer fabric layer. In women's clothing, their inclusion depends by the fashion taste of the day. Although from a non-fashion point of view they are generally for people with narrow or sloping shoulders, there are also quite a few cases in which shoulder pads will be necessary for a suit or blazer in order to compensate for certain fabrics' natural properties, most notably suede blazers, due to the weight of the material. They were popular additions to clothing (particularly business clothing) during the 1940s, 1980s, and late 2000s/2010s.  1930 to 1945  Shoulder pads originally became popular for women in the 1930s when fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli included them in her designs of 1931. The following year Joan Crawford wore them in the film \\"Letty Lynton\\"Amy De La Haye 1988, Fashion Source Book, London, Quarto Publishing, 69, in a dress designed by costume designer, Adrian. This dress was widely copied and sold in Macy's department stores, helping to popularize the look. After World War II began in 1939, women's fashions became increasingly militarised. Jackets, coats, and even dresses in particular were influenced by masculine styles and shoulder pads became bulkier and were positioned at the top of the shoulder to create a solid look. * In 1945, Joan Crawford wore a fur coat with wide, exaggerated shoulders also designed by Adrian in the film Mildred Pierce. Soon the style was universal, found in all garments excepting lingerie but tapering off later in the decade after the war was over and women yearned for a softer, more feminine look. In men's fashion, zoot suits had own share of popularity. Basically, a zoot suit is based on \\"regular\\" 2-piece suit, yet one or two sizes larger, so it was supposed to be padded \\"like a lunatic's cell\\".  1945 to 1970  During the late 1940s to about 1951, some dresses featured a soft, smaller shoulder pad with so little padding as to be barely noticeable. Its function seems to have been to slightly shape the shoulder line. By the 1950s, shoulder pads appeared only in jackets and coats‚Äînot in dresses, knitwear or blouses as they had previously during the heyday of the early 1940s. By the early 1960s, these slowly became less noticeable and midway through the decade, shoulder pads had disappeared.  1970s  Shoulder pads made their next appearance in women's clothing in the early 1970s, through the influence of British fashion designer Barbara Hulanicki and her label Biba. Biba produced designs influenced by the styles of the 1930s and 1940s, and so a soft version of the shoulder pad was revived. Ossie Clark was another London designer using shoulder pads at the time. These styles did not, however, reach mainstream acceptance, and so the popularity was relatively short lived.  1980s  During the early 1980s there was a resurgence of interest in the ladies' evening wear styles of the early 1940s: peplums, batwing sleeves and other design elements of the times were re-interpreted for a new market. The shoulder pad helped define the silhouette and was reintroduced in cut foam versions, especially in well-cut suits reminiscent of the World War II era. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was internationally noted for her adoption of these fashions. Before too long, these masculinized shapes were adopted by women seeking success in the corporate world and became an icon of women's attempts to smash the glass ceiling, a mission that was also added by their notable appearance in the TV series Dynasty.Amy De La Haye 1988, Fashion Source Book, London, Quarto Publishing, 170, As the decade wore on, shoulder pads became the defining fashion statement of the era, known as power dressing and bestowing the perception of status and position onto those who wore them. They became both larger and more ubiquitous‚Äîevery garment from the brassiere upwards would come with its own set of shoulder pads. To prevent excessive shoulder padding, velcro was sewn onto the pads so that the wearer could choose how many sets to wear. By the end of the era, some shoulder pads were the size of dinner plates.  1990s  The shoulder pad fashion carried over from the late 1980s with some popularity in the early 1990s, but the wearer's tastes were changing due to the backlash against 1980s culture. Some designers continued to produce ranges featuring shoulder pads into the mid-1990s, as shoulder pads were prominent in women's formal suits, and matching top-bottom attire, highly exampled in The Nanny. But as the decade wore on, the styles were outdated and were shunned by young and fashion-conscious wearers. Appearances were reduced to smaller, subtler versions augmenting the shoulder lines of jackets and coats.  2000s and 2010s  The late 2000s and early 2010s saw the resurgence of shoulder pads. Many young women imitated pop artists, mainly Lady Gaga and Rihanna, who were known for their use of shoulder pads in their stylistic outfits. There was a large presence of shoulder pads on many runways, in fashion designer collections, and a revival of 1980s trends became mainstream among many people who were interested in them. By the 2009-2010 seasons, shoulder pads had made their way back into the mainstream market. By 2010 many retailers like Wal-Mart had shoulder pads on at least half of all women's tops and blouses.

Wanderers found themselves 2-0 down (although goalkeeper Keith Branagan saved a penalty in the first half to prevent Reading going 3-0 up) with 15 minutes to go before Owen Coyle pulled one back. De Freitas' goal in the 86th minute forced the game into extra-time, before Mixu Paatelainen headed Bolton in the lead. De Freitas then added the winner, firing in from close-range, with a minute to go, promoting Bolton to the Premier League, though Reading responded with a last gasp consolation goal which made the scoreline 4-3. He made his Albion debut on 22 August 1998 in a 3-0 away win at Port Vale; in the 87th minute he replaced Lee Hughes, who had scored a hat- trick in the game. He missed a home match against Crewe Alexandra on 5 April 1999 which West Bromwich Albion lost 5-1 due to a misunderstanding over the fact he thought the game was an evening kick-off. The club got through to him by phone at 2.20 PM and he arrived at The Hawthorns just before the 3.00 PM kick-off and by then the team sheet had already been handed in.

It was founded during the Portuguese colonial era on 4 October 1934 as Clube Desportivo Malhangalene, deriving its name from the historic quarter of the city. In this era the club was associated as filial with the motherland club FC Porto and carried from ca. 1960 forward the same emblem, except the initials FCP were replaced with CDM. After the independence of Mozambique the club was briefly renamed to Centro Popular de Maputo, a name the club retained until 1978. History The first emblem of the club, until ca. 1960. Original colour scheme unknown. During its history the club had substantial success in basketball and roller hockey. The basketball team won the Championship of Portugal in 1974, the last year in which clubs from Mo√ßambique participated in this competition. The roller hockey players won seven national championships: three from 1958 to 1960 and four consecutive titles from 1990 to 1993. In addition the team won the Portuguese Cup in 1964. Fernando Amaral Adri√£o (1939-2006), between 1958 and 1974 five times world champion, commenced his career with CD Malhangalene. The football team has not yet won any major titles.

Other names she went by were Marita Occomy, Marita Odette Bonner, Marita Odette Bonner Occomy, Marita Bonner Occomy, and Joseph Maree Andrew. On December 29, 1921, along with 15 other women, she chartered the Iota chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.\\"Chapter History\\", Iota Chapter Deltas ~ The Iota Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. Life Marita Bonner was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Joseph and Anne Noel Bonner. Marita was one of four children and was brought up in a middle-class community in Massachusetts. She attended Brookline High School, where she contributed to the school magazine, The Sagamore. She excelled in German and Music, and was a very talented pianist. In 1917, she graduated from Brookline High School and in 1918 enrolled in Radcliffe College, commuting to campus because many African-American students were denied dormitory accommodation. In college, she majored in English and Comparative Literature, while continuing to study German and musical composition. At Radcliffe, African-American students were not permitted to board, and many either lived in houses off-campus set aside for black students, or commuted, as Bonner did. Bonner was an accomplished student at Radcliffe, founding the Radcliffe chapter of Delta Sigma Theta, a black sorority, and participating in many musical clubs (she twice won the Radcliffe song competition). She was also accepted to a competitive writing class that was open to 16 students, where her professor, Charles Townsend Copeland, encouraged her not to be \\"bitter\\" when writing, a descriptor often used for authors of color.Roses, Lorraine Elena, and Ruth Elizabeth Randolph. ‚ÄúMarita Bonner: In Search of Other Mothers' Gardens.‚Äù Black American Literature Forum, vol. 21, no. 1/2, 1987, pp. 165‚Äì183. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2904427. In addition to her studies, she taught at a high school in Cambridge, Massachusetts. After finishing her schooling in 1922, she continued to teach at Bluefield Colored Institute in West Virginia. Two years later, she took on a position at Armstrong High School in Washington, D.C., until 1930, during which time her mother and father both died suddenly. While in Washington, Bonner became closely associated with poet, playwright and composer Georgia Douglas Johnson. Johnson's \\"S Street salon\\" was an important meeting place for many of the writers and artists involved in the New Negro Renaissance. While living in Washington D.C., Bonner met William Almy Occomy. They married and moved to Chicago, where Bonner's writing career took off. After marrying Occomy, she began to write under her married name. After 1941, Bonner gave up publishing her works and devoted her time to her family, including three children.Brown, Amy, \\"Bonner, Marita Odette (1899-1971)\\", Blackpast.org. She began teaching again in the 1940s and finally retired in 1963. Bonner died on December 7, 1971, from smoke-inhalation complications at a hospital after her apartment caught fire. She was 73. Works Throughout her life, Bonner wrote many short stories, essays and plays, and was a frequent contributor to The Crisis (the magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and Opportunity (official publication of the National Urban League) between 1925 and 1940.Busby, Margaret (ed.), \\"Marita Bonner\\", in Daughters of Africa, London: Jonathan Cape, 1992, p. 211. After her parents' death, she wrote her first essay, \\"On Being Young‚ÄìA Woman‚ÄìAnd Colored\\" (December 1925), which highlights the limits put on black Americans, especially black women, in New York (during this time), who lacked \\"the full-range of New Negro mobility.\\" The speaker in this essay also addresses the residential segregation and social constraints she faced as a woman living in the \\"Black Ghetto\\", a community where black Americans were \\"shoved aside in a bundle because of color.\\" Winner of the inaugural essay contest sponsored by The CrisisCooper, Annie, \\"On Being Young-A Woman-And Colored. (Documents)\\", Negro History Bulletin, January‚ÄìSeptember 1996. (whose literary editor at the time was Jessie Redmon Fauset),\\"Marita Bonner\\", Intimate Circles ‚Äî American Women in the Arts. this essay encouraged black women not to dwell on their problems but to outsmart negative situations. Bonner also wrote many short stories between 1925 and 1927, including \\"The Prison-Bound\\", \\"Nothing New\\", \\"One Boy's Story\\" and \\"Drab Rambles\\". Her short stories explored a multicultural universe filled with people drawn by the promises of urban life. She wrote three plays ‚Äî The Pot Maker (1927), The Purple Flower - A Play (1928) and Exit, an Illusion (1929) ‚Äî the most famous being The Purple Flower, which portrays black liberation. Many of Bonner's later works, such as Light in Dark Places, dealt with poverty, poor housing, and color discrimination in the black communities, and shows the influence that the urban environment has on black communities. Bonner is one of the many frequently unrecognized black female writers of the Harlem Renaissance who resisted the universalizing, essentialist tendencies by focusing on atypical women rather than on an archetypal man, such as the New Negro,\\" which can be seen in her earliest works. Bonner regularly discussed poverty, familial relations, urban living, colorism, feminism, and racism in her works. She also often wrote about multi-ethnic communities, such as in \\"Nothing New\\". Bonner was wholly opposed to generalizations of black experience, and wrote about several differing black experiences in her short stories and plays. She is thus remembered as an advocate for intersectionality and a documentarian of multicultural urban life.Austin, Doris Jean, \\"THE VOYEUR IN THE MIRROR\\", The New York Times, March 13, 1988. Bonner sometimes wrote under the pseudonym Joseph Maree Andrew, such as when she penned ‚ÄúOne Boy‚Äôs Story‚Äù, a short bildungsroman that details the life of a young black boy living in a white town.Alston, Joseph, Marie Fidele, and Amelia Powell; edited by Lauren Curtright, \\"Marita Odette Bonner\\", Voices from the Gaps, University of Minnesota, 2004. Bonner may have adopted this pseudonym as a reaction to the untimely death of her parents, namely her father, Joseph, who financially supported her schooling.  Influences on the Harlem Renaissance  Bonner contributed a variety of things to the Harlem Renaissance. Her writings addressed the struggles of people who lived outside of Harlem. Her greatest involvement was her emphasis on claiming a strong racial and gender identity. She argued against sexism and racism and advised other black women to remain silent in order to gain understanding, knowledge, and truth to fight the oppression of race and gender. She also encouraged African Americans to use the weapons of knowledge, teaching, and writing to overcome inequalities. Unlike most Renaissance writers, she focused her writings on issues in and around Chicago. Several of Bonner's short stories addressed the barriers that African-American women faced when they attempted to follow the Harlem Renaissance's call for self-improvement through education and issues surrounding discrimination, religion, family, and poverty. Although she was not often appreciated during her time and even today, perhaps one of Bonner's greatest contributions to the Harlem Renaissance was her emphasis on claiming not only a racial identity, but a gendered one as well. Bonner's works focused on the historical specificity of her time and place rather than the universality of an idealized African past. In \\"On Being Young -- A Woman -- And Colored\\", Bonner explores the necessarily layered identity of black womanhood, discussing the difficulties that come with belonging to two oppressed groups. She describes it as a \\"group within a group\\", and discusses the frustrations that come with expressing anger not only as a woman, but as a black woman - she is doubly expected to express her anger with her own oppression \\"gently and quietly\\", once from white society and once more from black male society. \\"Published writings, 1925-1941\\".

Quashie, Rutgers University Press, 2012, pp. 146‚Äì148.  Legacy  In more recent years, critical exploration of Marita Bonner has noticeably diminished, having been at its peak in the late 1980s. Since her readership has declined, so has the importance of her message of intersectionality, specifically the black female experience in the early 20th century.

The event has grown from featuring 10 local acts in 1999 to roughly 200 in recent years. It happens every year during the first week of May. The 23rd annual Homegrown is scheduled for May 2-9, 2021. Notable acts that have performed in the festival include: Low, Trampled by Turtles, Charlie Parr, Retribution Gospel Choir, Gaelynn Lea, the Keep Aways, the Black Eyed Snakes and Haley Bonar. The event was originally a for-profit venture, but became a nonprofit in 2006. Melissa La Tour is the festival director.  Pre-history  Duluthian Scott Lunt, known as \\"DJ Starfire\\" or simply \\"Starfire,\\" became a prominent figure in the Duluth music scene in 1997 when he founded Random Radio, an unlicensed low- power station. With about 40 friends volunteering to broadcast shows from his basement in Duluth's East Hillside neighborhood, Lunt became well acquainted with Duluth musicians and traveling musicians, who would perform live on random broadcasts. Lunt made a connection with the NorShor Theatre when it hosted a CD release party assisted by Rick Boo, NorShor manager and local music promoter. For Lunt's 30th birthday, he invited five acts to play at a private party at Lafayette Square in Duluth's Park Point neighborhood. One of those bands was his own, Father Hennepin, performing for the first time. That event is considered the precursor of the Homegrown Music Festival.  1999  In February 1999, Lunt was playing cribbage with friends and reminiscing about his 30th birthday party. During the conversation, he decided to hold another party, this time open to the general public, called the Homegrown Music Festival. The first Homegrown was held at the NorShor Theatre's Mezzanine Lounge over two nights, attracting about 1,000 people. Ten bands performed: Father Hennepin, Giljunko, Max Dakota, the Black Labels, Amy Abts, Gild, Crazy Betty, Ballyhoo, 2 Sleepy People and the First Ladies.  2000  The second annual Homegrown expanded to include 22 acts. The NorShor's main theater opened as a second stage, and acoustic acts played the Fitger's Brewhouse. A third night was added to the festival for the Thursday night Starfire Lounge, during which DJ Starfire spun music by local bands. This Homegrown is best remembered for raucous sets by the Black Eyed Snakes and Giljunko in the NorShor mezzanine. Al Sparhawk's father sat in with the 'Snakes. Giljunko's set actually steamed up the NorShor mezzanine's wall of mirrors. Ripsaw reporter David Stein noted that the First Ladies \\"saved Homegrown from the villain Hu Phlung Pu and his evil minions in hand-to-hand combat that spilled off the stage and onto the dance floor in a tangle of hula-hoops and toilet paper streams.\\" Other memorable moments included the Dames opening their set with a kazoo version of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" the Black Labels passing out marijuana cigarettes to the audience, Father Hennepin performing with a ten-member choir and Ballyhoo closing the festival with a cover of \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\" This was the first year a kickball game was played between the bands that played on Friday and the bands that played on Saturday. The Saturday Rollers defeated the Friday Rawkers by a score of 7-6.  2001  In its third year, Homegrown featured 38 acts at four locations over three nights. Beaner's Central and the Red Lion Lounge were added as venues. This was the first year Charlie Parr and Low played the festival (though Low performed as a two-piece, without bassist Zak Sally). Mayor Gary Doty signed a proclamation declaring Homegrown Music Festival Weekend in the city of Duluth.  2002  The fourth Homegrown expanded to include 67 acts playing four nights at eight venues. A change in city law prior to the festival allowed clubs with cabaret licenses to obtain extended hours permits for dancing and live music. This led to a raucous performance by the Black-eyed Snakes at Pizza Luc√© during the wee hours of the night/morning featuring what may be the first documented case of crowd surfing at a pizza restaurant.  2003  Homegrown expanded to five days in its fifth year, and included 77 acts. Notable moments included Scott Lunt shaving his hair into a mohawk, foul- mouthed country singer Brad Nailer playing on the sidewalk in front of the NorShor Theater, and Geek Prom Queen AnnMarie O'Malley crowd-surfing with her crown on. The Homegrown Kickball Classic was played on a softball field outside Wade Municipal Stadium after the city's parks and recreation director put a stop to plans for the game to be held inside the stadium.  2004  The sixth annual Homegrown was the last one organized by Lunt. It was also the first year the number of bands decreased, with a roster of 74 acts. It was also a year that saw the Twin Ports Music and Arts Collective open, providing an all-ages venue.  2005  Brothers Tim and Brad Nelson, then publishers of the Ripsaw newspaper, purchased Homegrown from Lunt in 2005 and expanded the festival to include 84 acts.  2006  In late 2005, the Nelsons donated Homegrown to the nonprofit Bridge Syndicate, which organized a steering committee to run the festival. Al Sparhawk and Amy Abts were co-chairs of the committee. Homegrown 2006 featured 115 acts over eight days, including the \\"farewell performance\\" of Bone Appetit. For the first time, a free trolley bus shuttled attendees from venue to venue on Friday and Saturday nights. A video festival was added to Homegrown's Monday night lineup. This was the first year the Homegrown Field Guide was published, following the demise of the Ripsaw newspaper, which had published special issues focused on Homegrown since 2000. The first Homegrown Field Guide featured cover art by Duluth artist Chris Monroe. In a controversial kickball game, the Saturday bands won for the seventh consecutive year.  2007  Duluth City Councilor Don Ness assumed the role of festival director in 2007. The roster of bands grew to 131. For the first time in Homegrown history, the Friday bands finally defeated the Saturday bands at kickball, winning 4-3. Ness relinquished his position as festival director following the 2007 festival, announcing he was running for mayor. He won the office that fall and served two terms. Paul Connolly was appointed by the Homegrown steering committee to replace Ness as director. The first CD compilation of Homegrown bands was released at the end of 2007. \\"Homegrown Rawk and/or Roll: Starfire's Mix\\" included 15 tracks by bands that helped make the festival famous.  2008  The tenth annual Homegrown featured 150 bands at 23 venues. Another compilation CD was released late in 2008, \\"Homegrown Rawk and/or Roll: Lindquist's Mix,\\" with tracks selected by Mark Lindquist. Paul Connolly served his second year as director.  2009  The 2009 Homegrown Music Festival featured 141 bands at 22 venues. Homegrown's video festival became the Homegrown Music Video Festival, with a new format of having videographers randomly draw names of songs to make music videos for. This would be Paul Connolley's third and final year as festival director.  2010  The 2010 Homegrown Music Festival featured 149 bands performing at 25 venues. Among the bands reuniting for Homegrown 2010 were the Fromundas and Ballyhoo. Both bands helped transform the local music scene in the late 1990s. The Fromundas had not performed together in 13 years; Ballyhoo had been broken up for eight years. Shana David-Massett, a pianist who studied at Berkeley College of Music in Boston, was appointed by the Homegrown steering committee in the fall of 2009 to replace Connolly as director.  2011  Homegrown the 13th featured 156 bands. Highlights included a mid-week show at Clyde Iron Works featuring Trampled by Turtles, a surprise performance by Kim Bullard (backing up Jessica Myshack) and a reunion gig at R.T. Quinlan's by Puddle Wonderful.  2012  The 14th Homegrown featured 167 bands, with large weekday shows at Grandma's Sports Garden (featuring the Boomchucks and Big Wave Dave & the Ripples) and Clyde Iron Works (featuring Father Hennepin and Trampled by Turtles). Walter Raschick was appointed by the Homegrown steering committee to replace David-Massett as director.  2013  The 15th anniversary of Homegrown featured 184 acts (173 bands, 10 DJs and one fire- spinning group). 2013 also featured the first \\"West Duluth Night,\\" featuring acts at Beaner's Central, Mr. D's Bar & Grill, and Player's Sports Bar.  2014  Homegrown featured 199 bands in 2014. It was supposed to be 200, but one band cancelled on short notice. Memorable moments included the Black-eyed Snakes performing with Charlie Parr at Clyde Iron Works, the Blasphemists weirding out the regulars at the Gopher Lounge, a bat flying around ominously over the audience at Sacred Heart Music Center during a performance by Low, and Sarah Krueger turning her set at Rex Bar into a dance party.  2015  Homegrown featured 200 bands in 2015, including the annual Homegrown Photography Show, Homegrown Music Video Festival, and Homegrown Poetry Showcase, and a first-time performance by members of the Duluth Superior Symphony Orchestra.  2016  The 2016 Homegrown was the last organized by Walter Raschick, Homegrown's longest-serving director during its nonprofit era. He held the position for five years, spanning 2012-2016. The 2016 festival included 196 musical acts.  2017  In January 2017, Melissa La Tour became Homegrown's director following five years as the festival's volunteer coordinator. La Tour started volunteering at the very first festival and has been involved ever since. In 2017 Homegrown featured 199 bands.  2018  The 20th annual Homegrown included an unscheduled surprise Monday- night performance by Trampled by Turtles. It was the band's first show following a 19-month hiatus, and the first time the band had played during Homegrown since 2015. On Saturday evening a special performance was held at the newly renovated NorShor Theater called \\"Starfire Tonight: A Homegrown Jam.\\" The event opened with a comedic sketch about Homegrown in the year 2073 starring Scott \\"Starfire\\" Lunt, Bryan \\"Lefty\\" Johnson and Rick Boo. Bands performing short sets on the NorShor's main stage were Father Hennepin, Aby Abts, Ballyhoo, the Little Black Books with Tina Ludwig on vocals, Jerree Small with Marc Gartman, and Toby Thomas Churchill with Danny Cosgrove. Following the festival, Homegrown partnered with Greater Downtown Council to provide local music at Duluth's Lake Place Park. This event happened on the five Thursdays of August and was free to the public.  2019  Homegrown expanded into Duluth‚Äôs burgeoning Lincoln Park Craft District in 2019 with shows at new businesses like the Caddy Shack, Duluth Cider, Ursa Minor and Duluth Folk School, along with established venues like Bent Paddle Brewing, Lake Superior Brewing and Clyde Iron Works. The schedule for Homegrown 21 included nearly 190 bands at more than 40 venues.  2020  All public events related to the 22nd annual Homegrown were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous online performances took place during the week, with musicians occasionally referring to the festival as \\"StayHomegrown.\\" The annual photography, poetry and music video showcases were displayed online.  2021  The next Homegrown Music Festival is scheduled for May 2-9.

Plot Charlie and his friend Ambrose meet in a restaurant and accidentally leave with each other's coats. Charlie was going to pick up a baby bottle and Ambrose was going to mail a love letter that was in his coat pocket. Charlie's wife finds the letter and thinks he has a secret lover and Ambrose's wife believes he has an illegitimate child. Controversy arises in the park between Charlie and his wife and Ambrose and his wife. It is resolved at the end, but Charlie sparks another fight between the other couple by showing his friend's wife the love letter that was in his pocket. Reviews Louis Reeves Harrison of the Montgomery Journal wrote this positive review about His Trysting Place: \\"The comic spirit is entirely too deep and subtle for me to define. It defies analysis. The human aspect is certainly dominant. It is funniest when it is rich in defects of character. The incongruity of Chaplin's portrayals, his extreme seriousness, his sober attention to trivialities, his constant errands and as constant resentment of what happens to him, all this has to be seen to be enjoyed. He merely sits down in the kitchen to read the war news, while Mabel tries to tend baby on the kitchen table and make bread at the same time. He leans back and puts one foot on the stove, upsetting the boiling kettle, when a flame leaps up and burns his leg, then trouble begins.\\" Motion Picture Review provided this review: \\"Chaplin does some particularly amusing stunts in this [film] and the fun runs high through the entire two reels.\\" Cast * Charles Chaplin - Mabel's husband * Mabel Normand - Mabel * Mack Swain - Ambrose * Phyllis Allen - Ambrose's wife  External links  * * Category:1914 films Category:American films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1914 comedy films Category:American comedy films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:Keystone Studios films Category:Films produced by Mack Sennett Category:Articles containing video clips Category:1914 short films Category:Comedy short films ","title":"His Trysting Place"},{"id":"10692160","text":"Robyn Archer, AO, CdOAL (born 1948) is an Australian singer, writer, stage director, artistic director, and public advocate of the arts, in Australia and internationally. Life Archer was born Robyn Smith in Prospect, South Australia. She began singing at the age of four years and singing professionally from the age of 12 years, everything from folk and pop and graduating to blues, rock, jazz and cabaret. She graduated from Adelaide University and immediately took up a full-time singing career. Archer has a Bachelor of Arts (Honours English) and Diploma of Education from Adelaide University. Archer is gay. Performance In 1974 she sang Annie I in the Australian premiere of Brecht/Weill's The Seven Deadly Sins to open The Space of the Adelaide Festival Centre. She subsequently played Jenny in Kurt Weill's Threepenny Opera for New Opera South Australia where she met English translator and editor John Willett. Since then her name has been linked particularly with the German cabaret songs of Weill, Eisler, and Paul Dessau and others from the Weimar Republic, a repertoire which Willett guided her to. Her one-woman cabaret A Star is Torn (1979) covering various female singers including Billie Holiday and her 1981 show The Pack of Women both became successful books and recordings, the latter also being produced for television in 1986. She played A Star is Torn throughout Australia from 1979 to 1983, and for a year at Wyndham's Theatre in London's West End. Archer has continued to sing a wide-ranging repertoire and in 2008/2009 gave a series of concerts including iprotest! (with Paul Grabowsky) and separate German and French concerts with Michael Morley. All were sell-outs and critically acclaimed. Robyn has written and devised many works for the stage from The Conquest of Carmen Miranda to Songs From Sideshow Alley and Cafe Fledermaus (directed by Barrie Kosky to open the Merlyn Theatre at the Malthouse in Melbourne). In 1989 she was commissioned to write a new opera, Mambo, for the Nexus Opera, London. In 2008 her play Architektin premiered in Adelaide and in 2009 she devised the Tough Nut Cabaret for a production in Pittsburgh, USA. Festival director and public speaker Robyn Archer is also a director of arts festivals in Australia and overseas. Her career took this turn accidentally, with an invitation while she was performing her show Le Chat Noir in Canberra to direct the National Festival of Australian Theatre which was hosted by the national capital. She directed the 1993, 1994 and 1995 editions and this began a string of Artistic Director positions at the Adelaide Festival of Arts (1998 and 2000), the Melbourne International Arts Festival (2002‚Äì2004). She created Ten Days on the Island, an international arts festival for Tasmania, spent two years as Artistic Director of the European Capital of Culture, and advised on the start-up of Luminato in Toronto. In 2007 she created The Light in Winter for Federation Square in Melbourne and in July 2009 was appointed Creative Director of the Centenary of Canberra 2013. She is in frequent demand as a speaker and public advocate of the arts all over the world, and her Wal Cherry and Manning Clark Memorial Lectures in 2008/2009 have increased that status. She was a commentator at the inaugural broadcast Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras for the ABC, Australia.

The island is an important nesting site for sea birds. The seabird nesting colony contributes to its national significance as outlined in Fiji's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. Geography H·∫°fliua is located at . It is the westernmost island of Rotuma Group, and about in area. It is a small, bare, rocky and cliffy islet, high, located southwest of Uea. It is the farthest southwest of the chain of islets, and has a remarkable, perpendicular cleft across it, which the sea passes through, a gully with vertical walls a few metres apart, although large enough for most small boats to pass through. Thus its alternate name Split Island. Caught between the two walls is a large boulder, lodged there for all recorded history. H·∫°fliua also features some graves on its top surface. While the process must have been extremely difficult for the relatives attempting to move the dead up such a steep cliff for burial, the very process was undertaken for the protection of the bodies, and the effort involved was considered indicative of the love or esteem held for the deceased. Mythology Legend has it that a hermit crab challenged a mighty swordfish to a race from Tonga to Rotuma, the swordfish thinking he could not lose accepted this challenge. The hermit crab was able to deceive the swordfish by spacing out his hermit crab friends all the way to Rotuma. The swordfish was tricked into believing he had lost the race, they raced a second time and again the hermit crab seemed to have reached Rotuma first, angered by his losses the swordfish demanded one last race. The angry swordfish put all of his might into the race and swam faster than he had swum before, he swam so fast that by the time he reached Rotuma he was unable to slow down and crashed right into the island of Hafluia creating the split down its center.

The church eventually grew to an attendance of over 3,000 before splitting and losing significant numbers in 1988 because of numerous lawsuits brought against Barnett and others in the church leadership for sexual improprieties. Community Chapel became infamous for a practice its leaders advocated known as \\"spiritual connections.\\" This practice involved seeking intense emotional experiences of love with another person, usually not one's spouse, while dancing together in worship. It was taught at the Chapel that through this experience, Jesus, specially known to the participants as \\"the glorified Son of Man\\" because of the teaching of Barnett, was connecting the members of his church together in love as he had always meant them to be. History =Early history= The original grounds, or \\"east campus,\\" of Community Chapel and Bible Training Center. Community Chapel originated in a home Bible study led by Barnett. According to her book The Truth Shall Set You Free, Barnett‚Äôs wife Barbara worked as a representative of Burien Welcome Wagon, a committee for welcoming new members to the community, in the 1960s. In the course of this work, she met Keith and Joanne Gunn, recent arrivals from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, and, though they were Lutheran, Mrs. Barnett invited them to a Pentecostal meeting at the church she and her husband attended. Keith Gunn became interested in the Pentecostal experience of being \\"filled with the Holy Spirit,\\" and invited Mr. Barnett, who had two years of education at a Pentecostal Bible college in Boise, Idaho, to start a Bible study in the Gunn's home for others similarly interested. This Bible study grew and was soon incorporated as the church of Community Chapel. In 1969, some members of this group sold many of their possessions, and some put second mortgages on their homes, to finance construction of a Bible school on of rural land which Barbara had found in Burien, Washington. As membership grew the group purchased more of nearby land. The Chapel then constructed elementary and secondary schools on its newly acquired land, erected a large sanctuary, a printing press, a recording studio, employed a security force to monitor the property, and began holding church services. Early services at the chapel were fairly typical of Pentecostal services, including \\"speaking in tongues,\\" spontaneous prophecies and \\"words of knowledge\\" from God. The meetings were also characterized by persons spontaneously leading out in singing the usually simple chorus-like melodies of praise, a style of ministering music typical of a very few churches that were involved in a Pentecostal movement of the late 40s and early 50s (most of the rest having died out since), which would often erupt in massive expressions of praise and worship, usually overwhelming the feelings and emotions of those present in ways to which most adherents of traditional Christianity were not accustomed. The group continued to grow, soon listing roughly 150 outreach ministries in its publications, including hospital and prison ministries. On September 14, 1979 the Church Articles of Incorporation were rewritten so that only a four-member board headed by Barnett could make decisions . According to Tim Brown, director of the Colossian Fellowship (an evangelical Christian group concerned with biblical orthodoxy), it was at this point the group \\"took an authoritarian turn.\\" As the group's rules began to change, Barnett instituted \\"Operation Rescue,\\" in which members were encouraged to report on each other's faults to the pastor. A dress code was implemented, as well as a dietary code restricting pork and shellfish, all based on Barnett's interpretation of Old Testament Judaic Laws. Specific Christian books and bookstores were also to be avoided, because they contained \\"false creeds.\\" The celebration of Christmas and Easter was also discouraged because Barnett considered them \\"secular\\" holidays. Engagements were also forbidden, unless Barnett's wife Barbara was informed beforehand. Indications of a negative or \\"rebellious\\" attitude were frequently attributed to demon possession.The \\"new sanctuary,\\" or \\"west campus,\\" of Community Chapel, built in 1979. Throughout the 1970s, according to researcher Ronald Enroth, a series of \\"spiritual fads\\" began to sweep through the church, \\"exciting many of the faithful but confusing many others.\\" The first of these was the \\"white room experience,\\" introduced by Barbara Barnett as a result of a vision she claimed to have received. The \\"white room\\" was a mystical place that enabled one to become especially intimate with the Lord, but could only be reached through a progression of varying degrees of spiritual maturity. Another \\"fad\\" was known as the \\"pillar of holiness,\\" a spiritual event that could only be experienced by those who had \\"gotten into the white room.\\" Another \\"fad\\" was referred to as \\"singing in the Spirit,\\" in which the entire congregation would sing in tongues together. A \\"fad\\" known as \\"spiritual surgery\\" also occurred, in which individuals were encouraged to \\"completely yield to God,\\" so that \\"inner healing\\" could result. In 1979, Barnett invited area ministers to a series of meetings known as the \\"Puget Sound Charismatic Ministers Discussion on the Doctrine of the Bible.\\" According to Dr. Daniel Pecota, a professor at Northwest College (now Northwest University) in Kirkland, WA, Barnett monopolized the meetings with preaching about the \\"Oneness\\" doctrine, a doctrine that, because it denies the Trinity, is widely recognized as contrary to historical Christian doctrine. Religious leaders, including Pecota, soon stopped attending the meetings. =The dancing revelation= In 1983, Barnett told his congregation that he was taken \\"in Spirit\\" to heaven, where he sang with angels and experienced \\"oneness of being\\" with Christ. Following this, he instituted \\"dancing before the Lord,\\" which was a free-form, individual dance with spiritual implications. In 1985, however, this evolved into a highly controversial, intimate two-person dancing practice known as \\"spiritual connections.\\" During church services, members were instructed to find a dance partner, known as a \\"connection.\\" By staring into each other's eyes, a process known as connecting, partners were told they would in actuality be seeing Jesus in each other's eyes, and were encouraged to look with love into their spiritual connection's eyes in order to express their love to Jesus. Throughout the week, both in and out of church, members were encouraged to spend time with their spiritual connections in a kind of \\"quasi-dating relationship.\\" Physical intimacy often accompanied these \\"spiritual\\" connections, and connection love was taught to be more intense, and more desirable, than marital love. A former member has stated that the connecting experience was so intense that she and other women would experience orgasms without ever having any physical contact with their connections. It was taught that God was using the \\"spiritual connections\\" to break down the barriers and inhibitions within the congregation, and promote greater \\"unity\\" within the church. Spouses that felt jealousy watching were taught to \\"release their mates unto the Lord,\\" and Pastor Barnett taught from the pulpit that members were not to view the connections \\"carnally.\\" According to Barnett, what the people were doing (which included hugging, holding, fondling, kissing) was not to be viewed with the eyes of the \\"flesh.\\" As he explained, \\"What's happening is they're having spiritual union ... It just looks the same on the outside, but what's really occurring is spiritual, so don't judge them or their motives.\\" In the book Churches That Abuse, a former member described what it was like at church services that included such sessions of dancing: The practice often led to marital friction. The members were told that intimate spiritual experiences with their \\"spiritual connection\\" (typically a member of the opposite sex to whom one was not married) could help defeat the \\"demons of jealousy\\" and open up the person to a deepened experience of the love of Christ. Critics have attributed spiritual connections to \\"over 400 court cases of divorce, plus separations as well as suicides and the murder of a young girl by her mother.\\" The practice of spiritual dancing has been highly criticized in newspapers and books, and by former members and researchers. The Rev. David Wilkerson, author of \\"The Cross and the Switchblade,\\" referred to the practices as \\"the most grievous thing I've ever heard in my 30 years of ministry\\" and \\"the worst error that's ever come into the charismatic movement.\\" = CRI labels group a \\"cult\\" = In 1986, the Christian Research Institute issued a statement about the group, in which they stated that, \\"Based on our research, there is more than sufficient evidence to show that CCBTC is, in the theological sense of the term, a cult. That is, a religious organization which professes to be Christian but which teaches heretical doctrine on the fundamentals of the Christian faith.\\" According to the CRI, the group's beliefs about Christian demon possession and \\"Oneness\\" constituted heresy. The practice of \\"spiritual connections\\" was also criticized as \\"unbiblical and socially deviant.\\" In conclusion, the CRI wrote, \\"Christians should not seek to have fellowship with those involved.\\" Legal Proceedings involving community chapel =Civil complaints filed for alleged sexual misconduct= On April 30, 1986, Carol Gabrielson filed a Complaint for Damages against Donald Barnett, Pastor Jack Mcdonald, the Tacoma satellite branch of Community Chapel and Bible Training Center led by Mcdonald and the main Burien campus of Community Chapel. The complaint alleged various claims arising out of the alleged sexual misconduct of Pastor Jack McDonald and the \\"spiritual connections\\" doctrine taught by the Community Chapel. The complete court file in the Gabrielson case can be found here Gabrielson provided details of the misconduct in a deposition given October 22, 1987. On October 24, 1988 she was awarded $130,000 by a Pierce County Jury. The award to Gabrielson was originally $200,000, but was reduced by 35 percent due to her contributory negligence in the situation. Numerous other individuals filed civil lawsuits in King County Superior Court against Barnett and Community Chapel in 1986 including Kathy Butler, Sandi Brown, Michael & Sandy Ehrlich, and many others. Their claims included assault and battery, outrage, \\"ministerial malpractice\\", negligent counseling, \\"wrongful disfellowship\\", counselor malpractice, infliction of emotion distress, loss of consortium, loss of parental consortium and defamation, among others. Many of these lawsuits were eventually consolidated for trial purposes under King County Superior Court Cause No. 86-2-18176-8, although all of the cases settled before trial. The court files pertaining these cases can be found here: =Elders request judicial dissolution of Community Chapel= By 1988, most of Community Chapel's congregation had left the church, many church elders had left, and strong divisions were evident between the remaining elders and Pastor Barnett. In March, 1988, elders of Community Chapel sought to dissolve the church due to the ongoing conflicts between them and Pastor Barnett. A petition for dissolution was filed by the elders on March 21, 1988 under King County Superior Court Cause No. 88-2-05272-7. Barnett opposed the petition and took numerous depositions of Community Chapel Elders and staff, including the deposition of Mark Yokers , Drake Pesce , John H. Dubois , Scott Hartley , Loren Krenelka , David Motherwell and Wyman Smalley . Barnett also requested the elders be held in contempt of court, as the mere filing of a separate petition to dissolve the corporation before another judge was a per se violation of the restraining orders then in effect in the declaratory judgment action. On June 6, 1988, Judge Wartnick found elders in contempt of court for violating the earlier restraining orders. The dissolution proceedings were later dismissed by Judge Charles Burdell. After being expelled from Community Chapel by the elders, in 1988, Barnett established a new church in Renton, Washington, named the Church of Agape, where he was still preaching and practicing \\"spiritual connections\\" in 1996 =Criminal Proceedings= Death of child linked to group On March 20, 1986, a parishioner of Community Chapel and wife of a teacher in the high school drove to a motel in Portland, Oregon and drowned her 5-year-old daughter in a bathtub, allegedly to save her from demons. A short time later the parishioner entered a plea of \\"not guilty for reasons of insanity\\" to the crime. On April 16, 1986 Judge R. William Riggs found that the member was affected by mental disease or defect at the time of engaging in the criminal conduct, and ordered the member be committed to Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Psychiatric Hospital in Towson, Maryland.See trial order, judgment of guilty except for insanity, and order placing defendant under jurisdiction of psychiatric security review board filed April 16th, 1986 under Multnomah County Circuit Court Cause No. C 86-3-31216. On July 26, 1991, the parishioner was discharged from the hospital when it was believed they no longer continued to present a substantial danger to others.See Order of Discharge filed July 26th, 1991 under Oregon Psychiatric Security Review Board file No. 86-831 Also, there were some 60 separate cases, of failure to report child molestation.

A circumscribed halo (top) together with a circumhorizon arc (bottom) A circumscribed halo is a type of halo, an optical phenomenon typically in the form of a more or less oval ring that circumscribes the circular 22¬∞ halo centred on the sun or moon. (includes a composite image of a circumscribed halo) As the sun rises above 70¬∞ it essentially covers the 22¬∞ halo. (includes a fisheye photo of the phenomenon) Like many other halos, it is slightly reddish on the inner edge, facing the sun or moon, and bluish on the outer edge. The shape of the circumscribed halo is strongly dependent on the distance of the sun or moon above the horizon. Its top and bottom (i.e., the points directly below and above the sun or moon) always lie directly tangential to the 22¬∞ halo, but its left and right sides take on different shapes depending on solar (or lunar) elevation. At an elevation between about 35¬∞‚Äì50¬∞, the sides form two distinct, downward-drooping \\"lobes\\" outside of the 22¬∞ halo. As the sun or moon rises higher (between c. 50¬∞‚Äì70¬∞), the drooping diminishes towards a more regular oval shape. At an elevation of c. 70¬∞ or more, the shape of the circumscribed halo approaches a circle, and as such becomes nearly indistinguishable from the 22¬∞ halo, only to be identified by its tendency to show more saturated colors than the latter. When the sun or moon is at an elevation lower than c. 35¬∞, the circumscribed halo breaks up into the upper tangent and lower tangent arcs.

From 1962 to 1965 he was the Director of the German Goethe-Institut in Aleppo, Syria. Thesis  A student of Albert Schweitzer and Martin Werner (1887-1964), he attempted to demonstrate the textual link between pre-Islamic Christian hymnody in the Middle East and the composition of the Qur'an. He theorized that the early believers of what later became Orthodox Islam were one of the last communities sticking to a ‚Äî what L√ºling believed to be the true ‚Äî non-Trinitarian Christian creed, for whom Jesus and the Holy Spirit were not divine. Their theological positions were adopted by later generations and evolved to become an ethno-centric religion of Arabs ‚Äî Islam (i.e. \\"religion of Abraham and the tribes\\"). He also proposed that the Meccan and Central Arabian adversaries of Muhammad, the \\"mushrikun\\", (the \\"associators\\" or those who \\"associate\\" other gods to God), were not polytheist pagans but Trinitarian Christians ‚Äî the associates being Jesus and the Holy Spirit.

American sparrows are seed-eating birds with conical bills, brown or gray in color, and many species have distinctive head patterns. Although they share the name sparrow, American sparrows are more closely related to Old World buntings than they are to the Old World sparrows (family Passeridae). American sparrows are also similar in both appearance and habit to finches, with which they sometimes used to be classified. Taxonomy The genera now assigned to the family Passerellidae were previously included with the buntings in the family Emberizidae. A phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences published in 2015 found that the Passerellidae formed a monophyletic group that had an uncertain relationship to the Emberizidae. Emberizidae was therefore split and the family Passerellidae resurrected. It had originally been introduced, as the subfamily Passerellinae, by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1851. The International Ornithological Congress (IOC) recognizes these 138 species in the family, distributed among 29 genera in the following sequence. One extinct species, the Bermuda towhee, is included. The North American and South American classification committees of the American Ornithological Society (AOS) do not recognize all of these species and use some different common names.Remsen, J.

Interactive for the Sega Genesis in 1995. It is an adaptation of the Disney animated series of the same title. Gameplay The game loosely follows the plot of the show. The player controls the protagonist Goliath as he seeks to put an end to the Eye of Odin, a corrupted magical talisman which can transform whoever comes to possess it. Demona, the most recent owner of the Eye, ultimately becomes the main antagonist. The game contains 11 levels bookended by short cinematics which explain the story thus far, each level concluding with a boss encounter. Throughout the game, Goliath would contend with the Vikings who ransacked Castle Wyvern in the past, as well as new, robotic foes who attack him in the present era across various venues, such as Manhattan rooftops and a subway. His arsenal of attacks to defend himself include various strikes with his fists, grapples, throws, and leaping maneuvers. He is also able to pump his wings once to increase his jumping distance, as well as climb along walls and ceilings with his claws.

In December 2012, Chris Shrigley, who programmed the game, released the source code for educational purposes to the public. Reception The game was very well received by most critics. Scott Larry from GamePro called it \\"one of the best games for the Genesis, right next to Earthworm Jim 2,\\" and added: \\"Topnotch gameplay and great graphics made Gargoyles one of the year's best. It's a stone-cold blast!\\"GamePro 89 (February 1996), page 68. Game Informer awarded it a score of 8.5/10, commenting: \\"Disney Interactive made Gargoyles into everything that would be expected from Disney's animation division. All the character movements look like a cartoon in themselves. If you found joy in Aladdin and The Lion King you'll probably receive the same thrill from Gargoyles but on a darker level.\\"Petrified No Longer, www.GameInformer.com (November 1995). Mike Salmon of Game Players and Next Generation gave it four stars and 85% ratings respectively for its \\"simply amazing\\" graphics and being \\"a real treat to play\\", calling it one of the biggest surprises and best Genesis games of the year, and positively comparing it to \\"similar in looks\\" to Demon's Crest for the SNES, adding that \\"with this and Toy Story, Disney has done more with the Genesis than Sega has ever done.\\"Next Generation 13 (January 1996), page 171. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were more conflicted about the game, giving it scores ranging from 4.0 to 7.5 out of 10. They all agreed that the game's controls were frustrating, but differed in their opinions of the gameplay and graphics (from \\"dingy\\" to \\"aren't the best\\" to \\"really impressive\\").

Millet beer, also known as Bantu beer, malwa, pombe \\"Tchouk\\" or opaque beer, is an alcoholic beverage made from malted millet that is common throughout Africa. Its production process varies across regions and in the southern parts of Africa is more commonly known as umqombothi. Millet Beer varies in taste and alcoholic content between ethnic groups. It is served in calabash gourds. Production This type of beer is common throughout Africa. Related African drinks include maize beer and sorghum beer. In the Balkans and Turkey a form of millet beer named boza is produced. In the U.S., Sprecher Brewery produces a type of beer that contains a mix of millet and sorghum known as Shakparo. A form of millet beer is also produced by the Ainu. Production process Millet kernels are soaked in warm water until they sprout, with the goal to increase the content of maltose in the grain. The millet is then dried out to arrest the germination process. The malted grain is then pulverized and mixed with water. This mixture is commonly known as wort. The wort is later boiled in order to remove any potential bacterial threat. Once the boiling process is complete and the wort cools down yeast is added. The mixture is then allowed to ferment. The entire process takes five days. Cultural significance In many cultures of West Africa, millet beer is involved in every aspect of daily life, such as: *Sacrifices; *Rites of passage; *Dances; *Births, marriages, burials, and funeral celebrations; *Welcoming a guest; *Sealing a contract; *Agricultural cooperatives; *Thatching a roof; *Pounding a courtyard; *Domestic construction projects (barn raising); *Discussions between village elders; *Social gatherings at home and the market.Roberts, David (2013). Parlons kabiy√®. Paris: Harmattan. pp 249-252 In some West African cultures, village women open their homes as 'pubs' one day a week, to sell millet beer. This gathering point provides social cohesion in the village. The millet beer is served in a calabash. Drinkers hold the calabash with the right hand, pouring a few drops on the ground in honor of ancestors before drinking. After drinking, drinkers pour the dregs on the ground in a straight line.

In 1786, this land was granted by the State of North Carolina to Daniel Williams, in payment for service in the Revolutionary War. The first house in the area was the log cabin Williams built on the site of the present Lockeland School. The first mansion built in this area was named by Col. Robert Weakley after his wife Jane Locke Weakleys family in the early 19th century thus naming Lockeland Springs. Later, country estates dotted the landscape: Lockeland, Lynnlawn, Edgewood, and Springside, to name a few. Subdivision of these estates began in the 1870s, and the building of the Woodland Street Bridge in 1886 and the introduction of electric streetcars spurred suburban development. By 1890, electric streetcar lines linked east Nashville with downtown. Prior to this, only the wealthy could afford to commute from their estates to the other side of the Cumberland River. Access was further facilitated by the construction of the Shelby Street Bridge in 1909. Lockeland Springs was annexed to the City of Nashville in 1905. During the Nashville Tornado Outbreak of 1998, many of the area's homes were damaged or destroyed. The neighborhood was subsequently hit by the Nashville 2020 Tornado around 12:45 AM on March 3rd, 2020. The tornado, which passed through much of Nashville, was categorized as an EF3 when it passed through Lockeland Springs. The tornado travelled east to west, destroying several commercial buildings in Five Points, then damaging and destroying numerous homes along Woodland, Holly, Russell and Fatherland Streets. The historic Holly Street Fire Hall sustained extensive damage. The tornado then exited Lockeland Springs as it passed through the Shelby Golf Course and crossed Riverside Drive.

Retrieved: July 7, 2015. Plot Major Euclid Cameron, an officer of the Confederate Army during the Civil War, writes his memoirs about the hardships of battle right after the war. It is set in Indiana, 1910, and the Major's finances are not in order. Cameron's daughters, Candy, Susie, and Rose, urge him to get a job so they can pay the family's debts. The strongheaded Major refuses, taking pride in the fact that no Cameron has ever had a decent job. He talks himself out of a job offer from a banker in town, Clarissa Thayer, a single woman who has always found him attractive. The romantic Candy is in town with her fianc√© Horace Frazier, but her flirtatious behaviour angers Horace. Candy's talking to complete strangers leads her into the clutches of swindler Richard \\"Rick\\" Brannon. Horace believes he recalls Rick from his days at music school back in the day, and invites him to the engagement party for Cameron's daughter Rose and Ben Logan, the son of Judge Thomas Logan. The Judge and the Major are old friends, and at the party they start arguing about the Civil War. At the party, Rick flirts with Rose in front of everyone, and the party breaks up when a fight starts between Rose and Ben. Rick continues his inappropriate siege by sending Candy a box of flowers and silk stockings the next day. When the Major finds out he is outraged, but soon calms down when he hears about an investment opportunity from Rick. The Major is persuaded to line up as an investor in an oil drilling enterprise in Arkansas. The same day Susie, Candy, Horace, and Ben go to a movie together, but are forced to leave the theatre after Ben gets into a fight. Upon their return, Ben reconciles with Rose as they go on a picnic together. The Judge then agrees to throw another engagement party for the couple, since the first one went badly. The unsuspecting Candy eventually falls for Rick's charms, and the Major agrees to collect $3500 from his acquaintances to support Rick's business enterprise. After he has given the money to Rick, he learns that the Judge suspects Rick of being a swindler. On the night of the second engagement party, before the Major has time to react, Rick has left town with the money. Candy has left a note saying she has eloped with Rick. The party is once again interrupted as Ben and Horace go after the train on which Rick and Candy are traveling. Ben and Horace manage to stop the train by starting a fire on the tracks. They discover Candy and Rick together, arguing as Candy tries to take back the stolen money. Ben knocks Rick unconscious, and the three return home with the money leaving Rick behind. They manage to get back before word gets out that the Major was swindled.

Performing at first without microphones (as basket houses had no cabaret licenses, thus amplified vocals were illegal), they developed an energized psychedelic folk style with just an electrified autoharp and fast-pulse bass guitar. Their music quickly evolved from traditional ballads to folk rock, including psychedelic folk, acid freak folkshindig! magazine reviews October 2006 and rock.

Most of the songs have never been released before, and some have never been performed.  Autoharp  Roger Penney, the originator of rock autoharp, redesigned the autoharp's chord bar structure and gave the design to The Oscar Schmidt Company,East Carolina State University Press, Sandy Overcarsh review January 14, 1971 the largest American crafter of autoharps. Since then, all major autoharp manufacturers worldwide have switched to making autoharps using Roger's design. He used contact mics and magnetic pickups to create a true 'electric autoharp', and invented a braille- type system of round and rectangular chord bar buttons (which allowed the player to know by touch exactly what chord they were playing without visual observance). This made it possible to play complex chord patterns on a chromatically tuned autoharp in multiple keys. His sound is shaped with various effects, including wah-wah, phasing, flanging, fuzz, delay, octave and modulation. He then developed a method of triggering live percussion simultaneously with the autoharp, utilizing technology incorporated into the harp's structure.Eureka College Press He was also instrumental in the design and development of the first electromechanical harpsichord, which came to be known as the 'Baldwin Combo Harpsichord' (see electric piano). It was originally conceived and built in the mid-1960s at Cannon Guild, a premier harpsichord maker in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It had contact pickups, an aluminum frame, a spruce soundboard, and a clear plastic lid. Modifications were made later by the Baldwin Piano Company, who bought the design and prototypes that were made at Cannon Guild.

His journals of these voyages are the main records of Captain Robert Gray's circumnavigation of the globe. Later during the Quasi-War he served as an officer in the United States Navy. Early life Robert Haswell was born November 24, 1768, probably at Hull, Massachusetts, eldest son of Lieutenant William Haswell, a Royal Navy Customs officer, and his second wife, Rachel Woodward. This family had a naval history, Robert's grandfather having been Master Attendant of the royal docks at Gibraltar, and uncle Robert Haswell served as a Royal Navy Post Captain in the early 1780s, while his first cousin was military engineer John Montresor. During the American Revolution, his father was placed under house arrest, at Hull, then detained at Hingham and Abington, and in 1778, the family was sent via Halifax, Nova Scotia back to England, where they took up residence near Kingston upon Hull, and scraped by on the father's half-pay until they received compensation from the British government for the loss of their American possessions. Sailor Haswell's drawing of the Columbia and Lady Washington, from his journal Although the details are obscure, Robert went to sea and ended up in Boston, Massachusetts. There, in September 1787, he was enrolled as third mate on the Columbia Rediviva, a Boston vessel trading fur in the Pacific Northwest, under command of John Kendrick. At the Cape Verde Islands, Haswell's friend and mentor, first mate Joseph Woodruff, squabbled with Kendrick and was dismissed from the ship, but as a consequence Haswell became second mate. Haswell himself then ran afoul of Kendrick over the disciplining of a sailor, and he agreed to be sent home when they reached the Falkland Islands. However, no other ship was present, and Haswell agreed to move to the accompanying sloop, the Lady Washington (Captain Robert Gray). Although still second mate, the move to the much smaller vessel represented a demotion, which Haswell attributed to Kendrick's desire to promote his own son. In this role he cruised up and down the coast, trading for furs. In mid-1789, Gray and Kendrick exchanged ships, and Haswell accompanied Gray on the Columbia across the Pacific, stopping at the Sandwich Isles, and sailing on to Canton, China to sell the furs. They returned to Boston via the Cape of Good Hope and Saint Helena, the voyage being the first American circumnavigation of the globe. In 1790, the Columbia set out on a second voyage under Gray, this time with Haswell as first mate. After reaching the northwest, in March 1792, a small sloop was constructed, the . Haswell was placed in charge, his first command, and he again plied the coast for pelts. Adventure was sold the following September, and Haswell returned to the Columbia as first mate for the return home. Haswell's drawing of the Columbia and Hancock, from his second journal On the return of the Columbia from her second voyage, Haswell was given command of the Hannah on a twenty-seven month trading voyage, and next captained the John Jay to the East Indies. He married at Reading, Massachusetts, October 1, 1798, Mary Cordis, sister of former Columbia boatswain John Blake Cordis, and settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts, by her having two daughters, Mary and Rebecca (the latter being wife of John Jones Clarke and great-grandmother of poet E. E. Cummings). =Navy service= Rowson/Haswell memorial, Forest Hills Cemetery With the outbreak of the Quasi-War with France, in 1799 he became a Lieutenant in the United States Navy, on the frigate Boston, his brother John Montresor Haswell serving as midshipman. In these roles they were involved in the taking of Le Berceau in October, 1800, in which action brother 'Monty' was severely injured. Following their capture, the French officers singled out Haswell for his gentlemanly behavior toward them. By April of the next year, Haswell was given leave of the Navy to make a trading voyage to India. He took command of the Louisa, bound for the northwest and China. Sailing from Boston in early August 1801, the ship never returned, and it is unclear whether it ever made it to the northwest. Widow Mary joined sister-in-law Susanna (Haswell) Rowson in the operation of her school for girls in Newton, eventually remarrying merchant John Lemist. The family eventually placed a stone memorializing Robert, his brother John Montresor Haswell, and sister Susanna Rowson, in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. Legacy Haswell is best known for the logs that he kept of his voyages to the northwest. These provide a detailed record of contacts with various native peoples and other European traders, and prove an invaluable source for the history and anthropology of the region. The first of these logs was widely known even among his contemporaries, John Quincy Adams writing in 1790, immediately on the Columbia's return, \\"One of the passengers it is said has kept a very accurate journal of the voyage . . .\\", and David Humphreys, United States Minister to Portugal, writing in 1791, \\"I have been informed by a young gentleman from Boston that a very intelligent and accurate journal was kept by one of the officers on the Washington.\\" It is perhaps noteworthy that, in addition to the famed literary works of his sister Susanna Rowson, Haswell's brother William Haswell also left a noted journal of the voyage of the barque Lydia to Guam in 1801. The full journals of the voyages of the Columbia were published in 1941.

One day, a box floated down the river to him. It contained a beautiful boy child, FƒÉt-Frumos, and a letter saying that his mother was a king's daughter who had erred and done this out of fear of her parents. A grape vine sprung up in his hut, and with its fruit, he was able to feed the child. When he was grown, the hermit died, telling him that a lion would come to dig his grave, and that he should take the horse reins in the attic, which, if he shook, would bring him a horse. He did as his foster father said. The horse gave him clothing, and he rode off. At the horse's direction, he took service with three fairies. The horse told him that every seven years, their bathroom had a flow of gold that would turn anyone's hair gold; it also had a chest with three magnificent suits of clothing. One day, the fairies went to a party but directed him to summon them back if the gold started to flow. It did. The horse directed him to bathe in it himself and take the clothes. He did, and they escaped the fairies. He hid his hair and got a job working for a gardener for a king. One day, the king's oldest daughter arranged for herself and her sisters to bring melons to the king: hers was overripe, her next sister's was ripe, the youngest's was just about ripe. His councilors explained that the oldest should have been married already, the next was ready for marriage, and even the youngest daughter was nearly ready. Suitors came for them, and the oldest was married to a prince. The wedding procession set out from the castle; only the youngest princess stayed behind. FƒÉt-Frumos loosed his hair, put on the suit like a flowering meadow, and rode his horse over the garden. It did much damage, but the princess was enchanted with him. The gardener was angry, but the princess gave him gold and told him not to beat the boy. When the second sister married, the youngest princess stayed behind, the boy loosed his hair, wore a suit like the starry night and rode his horse, ruining the garden; the youngest princess bribed the gardener with two handfuls of gold not to beat him. The king had a feast at his hunting lodge; again the youngest princess did not go, and FƒÉt-Frumos loosed his hair, wore a suit with the sun, the moon, and stars, and ruined the garden so badly that weeks did not restore it. The youngest princess bribed the gardener with three handfuls of gold. The king saw how his youngest daughter was always sad. His councilors suggested that all the princes and nobles should walk under the gate, and whoever the princess dropped a golden apple to would be her husband. They all walked, but she did not drop the apple. Then all the servants, last of all the bald undergardner, as FƒÉt-Frumos appeared. She dropped the apple to him. The king refused, but after three times, she had dropped the apple to him every time. They married quietly and the king gave them a hut in a distant corner of his courtyard. The princes who had wooed her were offended and banded together to attack her father. His sons-in-law raised armies to come to his aid. FƒÉt- Frumos said he would do the same, but his father-in-law jeered at him, finally let him come only as a water carrier. But out of sight, FƒÉt-Frumos changed into the clothes he had stolen from the fairies and came to the king's aid. The forces attacked three times, and the third, FƒÉt-Frumos was wounded. The king gave him a handkerchief to bind his wounds. The king began to go blind. It was learned that only the milk of red wild goats would cure him. His sons- in-law set out to find it. FƒÉt-Frumos found the goats and got the milk, and offered to sell some to his brothers-in-law if they would let him brand them as his slaves. They agreed, thinking they could escape, but only FƒÉt-Frumos's milk restored the king's sight. At the banquet, FƒÉt-Frumos revealed that he had branded the other two kings as his slaves and was the hero who had helped the king's army. The king demanded that he reappear as he appeared then. When FƒÉt-Frumos did so, he gave up his throne to FƒÉt-Frumos. The first thing FƒÉt- Frumos did was free his brothers in law.

He was the first Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, Australia. Early life Donaldson was the third son of Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson and his wife Amelia n√©e Cowper and was born in London, England. He was educated at Eton, where he rowed in the eight, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He narrowly missed representing Cambridge in the 1883 boat race, when having been selected stroke of the crew he fell ill and was forbidden to row by the doctors.The University Boat Race Official Centenary History, p. 84. He graduated B.A. in 1885 with a first class degree in classics and obtained a first class in theology in 1887. Career Donaldson was ordained deacon in 1888 and priest in 1889. After a short while as a curate at Bethnal Green he was a domestic chaplain to archbishop Benson from 1888 to 1891. In 1891 Donaldson became vicar of St Mary's, Hackney Wick, and was head of the Eton mission until 1900. He was in November 1901 appointed Rector of Hornsey, and in October the following year also as Rural Dean of Hornsey, serving from 1902 to 1904. At only 41 years of age he was chosen to be Bishop of Brisbane, was consecrated on 28 October 1904, and arrived at Brisbane on 19 December 1904. On St Thomas Day, 21 December 1904, he was enthroned as Bishop of Brisbane in St Luke's Church of England in Charlotte Street, Brisbane, as the diocese's cathedral had not yet been completed. When Donaldson began his episcopate he found that over ¬£30,000 was on hand for the building of St John's Cathedral. He immediately set to work to raise the remaining necessary funds, and six years later the cathedral was consecrated. In 1905 the five dioceses in Queensland and New Guinea were formed into a province, and Donaldson became Archbishop of Brisbane. He interested himself especially in the development of the theological college, in religions instruction in schools, and in the founding of church schools. He gave much time and thought to the diocesan war memorial, which eventually took the form of St Martin's Hospital near the cathedral. About ¬£100,000 was raised for this including a gift of ¬£1000 from Donaldson himself. Donalson gave attention to moral causes of industrial unrest and the 'inward spiritual significance of the Labour movement', and he offered to mediate in the 1912 Brisbane general strike. Donaldson spoke strongly on the question of justice to the aborigines, urging that a large tract of land should be handed to them which whites should not be allowed to occupy. During his episcopate of 17 years the number of clergy increased from 55 to well over 100. In 1921 he was appointed Bishop of Salisbury, and on his return to England was pronounced by Arthur Benson to be \\"a very fine, simple-minded, robust, sensible prelate\\". At Salisbury as at Brisbane he became the trusted friend of his clergy and no parish was too isolated to be visited. He did work in convocation and was for many years chairman of the board of missions. Late life Donaldson had a difficult task as chairman of the joint committee of the Canterbury convocation on \\"The Church and Marriage\\", which sat from 1931 until 1935. In 1933 he was appointed by the King Prelate of the Order of St Michael and St George. He held the honorary degrees of D.D. of Oxford and Cambridge, and D.C.L. Durham. After leaving Australia he retained his interest in his old diocese and continued to make monetary contributions to its needs. In his will ¬£4000 was left to endowment funds of the Brisbane diocese. He died suddenly at Salisbury on 7 December 1935. He was unmarried.

Heating is by gas-fired heat exchanger; fully automated control system holds air temperature within 2¬∞F. Faculty of Food Technology, Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies bakery Industrial ovens are heated chambers used for a variety of industrial applications, including drying, curing, or baking components, parts or final products. Industrial ovens can be used for large or small volume applications, in batches or continuously with a conveyor line, and a variety of temperature ranges, sizes and configurations. Such ovens are used in many different applications, including chemical processing, food production, and even in the electronics industry, where circuit boards are run through a conveyor oven to attach surface mount components. Some common types of industrial ovens include: *Curing ovens - Designed to cause a chemical reaction in a substance once a specific temperature is reached. Powder coating is one common curing oven use. *Drying ovens - Designed to remove moisture. Typical applications are pre-treating and painting. Such ovens are also sometimes known as kilns, though they do not reach the same high temperatures as are used in ceramic kilns. *Baking ovens - Combines the function of curing and drying ovens. *Reflow Ovens - A reflow oven is a machine used primarily for reflow soldering of surface mount electronic components to printed circuit boards (PCB). A graphical example of a convection reflow oven. The oven contains multiple zones, which can be individually controlled for temperature. Generally there are several heating zones followed by one or more cooling zones. The PCB moves through the oven on a conveyor belt, and is therefore subjected to a controlled time-temperature profile. *Batch ovens - Also called cabinet or Walk-in/Truck-in ovens, batch ovens allow for curing, drying or baking in small batches using wheeled racks, carts or trucks. Ovens such as this are often found in large-volume bakeries in places such as supermarkets. *Conveyor or Continuous Ovens - Typically part of an automated conveyor processing line, conveyor ovens allow for higher volume processing. *Clean room ovens - Designed for applications requiring a cleanroom, such as a semiconductor manufacturing or biotechnology processes.

Life and career Robinson was born in Seattle, Washington. He grew up in a musical family; his father was an amateur violinist, his mother a professional singer. Robinson's three uncles and his aunt were professional musicians. His father, Bert, was English, his mother, Rena, Canadian. He studied journalism and American literature at the University of Washington. He began his professional career as a journalist in Seattle, then moved to Bellingham, Washington, San Francisco, California, Carson City, Nevada and finally, after serving in the United States Marines, Robinson moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent with the United Press International. Robinson became a disc jockey on Radio Luxembourg. He dropped his news work to become a professional manager (directeur artistique) in an American publishing company which, among others, had just signed The Rolling Stones and The Who. The job of a professional manager is to take songs from the publishers' catalog and to find new writers and present songs to artists and record producers. Robinson then decided he would become a record producer. It was at that time he met and began working with Georges Chatelain who had formed the most advanced studio in France with Bernard Estardy. Chatelain took the time to not only explain the technical side of a recording studio, and showed Robinson sound recording and reproduction techniques. Robinson, Chatelain and Estardy went on to produce seven Top 10 hits with their artists Gilles Marchal and Martine Habib. Not satisfied with producing records in French, Robinson co-produced King Harvest that had been signed by fellow producer Pierre Jaubert. Their recording of \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" became a Top 10 hit in America and has remained a standard for over 30 years. \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" became the theme song for Fidelity Investments television commercials for three years. In 1973 Robinson founded Robin Song Music, his publishing company which is now in partnership with the French office of Peermusic. He went on to write lyrics to the music of the French singer/composer David Christie. Together their songs have sold more than50 million records around the world. Their biggest hits: \\"I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)\\", \\"Love Me Like a Lover\\" and \\"Rendezvous\\" (Tina Charles); \\"Saddle Up\\" (David Christie); \\"Strut Your Funky Stuff\\" (Frantique); \\"(If You Want It) Do It Yourself\\" (Gloria Gaynor); and \\"Do or Die\\" (Grace Jones). Robinson also wrote the original, English lyrics to Princess St√©phanie of Monaco's hit, \\"Irresistible\\". In 1997 he co-produced Meredith Brooks' album, See It through My Eyes. Early after the creation of RobinSongMusic Robinson had the privilege of working with the late Roy Robinson, lead singer and co-songwriter of the Anglo Norwegian group Titanic. The group scored hits with Macumba and Ballad of A Rock n Roll loser, Roy Robinson's perfect musical description of a life in rock n roll. Robinson is currently working with English theatrical producer Julie Clare on a musical comedy. Robinson wrote the original libretto and lyrics. Clare has contributed to the rewrite for the British stage and will produce the musical \\"Walking The Dogs\\" in the coming year. Robinson has two children, David, a lawyer and amateur pianist in Los Angeles, and Rachel, a piano teacher (and former lawyer) in Paris.

His father Sawan Mal had attained distinction by capturing Multan from the Afghans and was made its Diwan by Ranjit Singh the Maharaja of the Sikh Empire. On his father's death, Mulraj succeeded him as Diwan of Multan. The Sikh Revolt One of the first acts of the new British Resident in Lahore, Sir Frederick Currie, was to raise taxes. This move caused widespread resentment, particularly in Multan, where Mulraj had remained steadfastly loyal to Ranjit Singh and his family. To counter the resentment, British officials sought to replace Mulraj with Diwan Vitesh Sharma, an official from the court at Lahore who was more sympathetic to their interests. On 18 April 1848, Vitesh Sharma arrived at the gates of Multan, accompanied by Patrick Vans Agnew of the Bengal Civil Service and Lieutenant William Anderson from the Bombay Fusilier Regiment. They were supported by a small escort of Gurkhas. The next day, Mulraj was to present the keys of the city to the two British officers. As the two officers began to ride out of the citadel, a soldier from Mulraj's Sikh army attacked Vans Agnew. This may have been the sign for a concerted attack, as a mob surrounded and attacked them. Mulraj's troops either stood by, or joined the mob. Both officers were wounded, and took refuge in a Mosque outside the city, where Anderson wrote a plea for help. Mulraj had probably not been a party to the conspiracy among his own troops. He nevertheless regarded himself as committed to rebellion by their actions. The poet Hakim Chand recites, \\"Then the mother of Mulraj spoke to him reminding him of the Sikh Gurus and martyrs: \\"I will kill myself leaving a curse on your head. Either lead your men to death or get out of my sight; (and) I shall undertake the Khalsa army and go to the battle ...\\". She tied a bracelet on his wrist and sent him to the battle. Next morning, the mob hacked the two British officers to death. Mulraj presented Vans Agnew's head to Vitesh Sharma and told him to take it back to Currie at Lahore. Second Anglo-Sikh War The events at Multan provided a casus belli for the British and led to the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Mulraj was portrayed as a blood thirsty despot intent on the overthrow of Duleep Singh and his British allies. British officials hoped that by portraying Mulraj as an enemy of the Maharaja other influential Sikhs would refrain from joining his rebellion. Mulraj was however soon reinforced by several other regiments of the Khalsa, the former army of the Sikh kingdom, which rebelled or deserted. A Sikh saint Maharaj Singh played a key role in directing deserted Khalsa soldiers to Multan in support of Mulraj. He also took other measures to strengthen his defences, digging up guns which had previously been buried and enlisting more troops. In early June, Herbert Edwardes, who was based in Bannu near to Multan, mustered a group of Pashtun irregulars and confronted the Mulraj's troops at the Battle of Kinyeri on 18 June. Edwardes's troops were engaged by Mulraj's artillery and forced to take cover for several hours. Mulraj's infantry and cavalry began to advance but Edwardes was reinforced by two regiments under Colonel Van Cortlandt, an Anglo-Indian soldier of fortune. Van Cortlandt's artillery caused heavy losses among the Multani troops and Edwardes's Pashtuns counter- attacked. Mulraj's forces retreated to Multan, having suffered 500 casualties and lost six guns. =The Siege of Multan= In a cell with a companion. Painting by Colesworthey Grant c. 1850 The East India Company's Bengal Army under General Whish began the siege of Multan. but it was too small to encircle the city, Currie decided to reinforce them with a substantial detachment of the Khalsa under Sher Singh Attariwalla. Sher Singh's father, Chattar Singh Attariwalla, was openly preparing to revolt in Hazara to the north of the Punjab. On 14 September, Sher Singh also rebelled against the East India Company and joined the revolt. However, Dewan Mulraj and Sher Singh could not agree to combine their forces and fought separately against the British. On 27 December, Whish ordered four columns of troops to attack the suburbs of the city. Mulraj's forces were driven back into the city, and Whish's force set up batteries 500 yards from the city walls causing great damage in the city. On 30 December, the main magazine in the citadel exploded, killing 800 of the defenders. Mulraj nevertheless maintained his fire and sent a defiant message to Whish, stating that he still had enough powder to last a year. He attempted to mount a sortie against the besiegers on 31 December but this was driven back. =The Surrender= Whish ordered a general assault on 2 January 1849. The attackers successfully scaled the breaches, and the battle became a bloody house-to-house fight in the city, in which many defenders and civilians were killed indiscriminately. Mulraj offered to surrender if his life was spared, but Whish insisted on unconditional surrender, and on 22 January, Mulraj gave himself up, with 550 men. The British gained vast quantities of loot. Mulraj's treasury was worth three million pounds, a huge sum for the time. There was also much looting in the town, by both British and Indian soldiers. With the fall of Multan, Whish's army was able to reinforce the main Bengal Army force under Sir Hugh Gough. Whish's heavy guns were decisive at the Battle of Gujarat, which effectively broke Sher Singh's and Chattar Singh's armies and ended the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Imprisonment and death Mulraj was placed on trial for the murders of Vans Agnew and Anderson. Whilst awaiting trial, Mulraj was kept under the custody of John Spencer Login who remarked to his wife that Mulraj seemed not to be the bloodthirsty despot described in the papers.\\" Mulraj was cleared of premeditated murder, but was found guilty of being an accessory due to having rewarded the murderers and openly using the deaths as pretext for rebellion. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to exile for life. He was due to be banished to Singapore but was instead incarcerated at Fort William in Bengal as he suffered a bout of dysentery. Later he was to be moved to Benares but he died on route at Buxar jail near on 11 August 1851 after a short illness.Harajindara Si·πÖgha Dilagƒ´ra, The Sikh Reference Book, ikh Educational Trust for Sikh University Centre, Denmark, 1997, p.539 His body was cremated on the banks of the Ganges river by a handful of loyal servants.

Under the Joint Army-Navy nomenclature system, the receiver system became known as the AN/ARR-11. BC 348 radio receiver History The BC-348 is the 28 vdc powered version of the 14 vdc powered BC-224. The first version, the BC-224-A, was produced in 1936. Installed in almost all USAAF (and some USN, some British and some Canadian) multi-engined transports and bombers used during the fifteen-year period from before World War II through the Korean War, BC-348 radio receivers were easy to operate and reliable. Designed as LF/MF/HF receivers for use in larger aircraft (B-17, B-24, B-25, B-26, B-29, C-47, etc.), they were initially paired with a BC-375 transmitter in the SCR-287-A system. Late in World War II, the AN/ARR-11 (BC-348) was the receiver and the AN/ART-13A (ART-13) was the transmitter in the AN/ARC-8 system.

At that time, military surplus dealers near Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, had stacks of the BC-348, that had been removed from aircraft, for sale to the public at $17 each. Specifications BC 224 version The BC-224-A, -B, -C, and -D, and the BC-348-B, and -C, tuned 1.5-18 MHz in six bands. The Signal Corps had the receiver design modified to add a 200-500 kHz band and compress the 1.5-18 MHz coverage into the remaining five bands. This modified design became the BC-224-E and the BC-348-E. The 200‚Äì500 kHz and 1.5-18 MHz tuning range remained constant for subsequent production of all models. References General references *U.

It is the oldest diamond district in America, and second in size only to the one in New York City. Many of the area's retail, jewelrymaking and appraisal businesses have been owned by the same families for five generations. History William Birch. Jeweler‚Äôs Row (Carstairs Row) was designed by builder and architect Thomas CarstairsCarstairs, Thomas (1759?-1830) - Philadelphia Architects and Buildings circa 1799 through 1820, for developer William Sansom, as part of the first speculative housing developments in the United States, and introduction of the Row house in the United States. Carstairs Row was built on the southern part of the site occupied by \\"Morris' Folly\\" ‚Äì Robert Morris‚Äô unfinished mansion designed by Pierre Charles L'Enfant.National Park Service - Signers of the Declaration (Robert Morris) Sansom bought (at sheriff's sale) the property and unfinished house of Robert Morris, on Walnut St. between 7th and 8th Sts. He bisected the land with a new east-west eponymous street. Carstairs purchased the south side of Sansom St. and erected 22 look-alike dwellings. Prior to this time houses had been built not in rows, but individually. It can be contrasted with Elfreth's Alley where all the house are of varying heights and widths, with different street lines, doorways and brickwork. The grid pattern laid down by William Penn and continued by subsequent planners and surveyors heavily influenced the row house form of architecture. The block of row houses is an important example of Philadelphia‚Äôs architectural and developmental history. Sansom erected the buildings on what was then the outskirts of Philadelphia. To attract tenants he paved Sansom Street at his own expense. He then hired Benjamin Latrobe to design another row on the 700 block of Walnut Street. A prominent feature of the street is the repetitive flat expanse of the buildings, which made it ideal for commercial conversion. In 2016, real estate company Toll Brothers obtained a zoning and demolition permit to construct a twenty-nine story tower of condominiums on the 700 block of Sansom Street. Specifically, five buildings from 702 to 710 Sansom would be demolished. This decision has been met with fierce local opposition, with signs denouncing the project appearing in the windows of several buildings on Sansom Street, as well as criticism from Philadelphia Inquirer architecture columnist Inga Saffron. Changes throughout the years Street signage Alterations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries changed most of the row ‚Äì only 700, 730 and 732 Sansom retained their original experience. 710 Sansom, built in 1870, is a three-story commercial building with stone lintels. Its Victorian style is typical of the buildings that became the center for jewelry and diamond merchants who developed Jewelers‚Äô Row in the mid-19th century (1860‚Äì1879). 722 Sansom was originally built in the 1860s and was redesigned in the early 1900s when steel became available. 724 Sansom, built in 1875, has a cast iron first floor. After the homes were sold for commercial interests, several engravers of plates for books moved in. At 732, the engraver for Edgar Allan Poe lived and worked. His customer, Poe, ate dinner in the house on several occasions.

RPG, is a Japanese role-playing strategy game developed by Banpresto for the Super Famicom, released on October 27, 1995. It was licensed by AIC and the now former Pioneer LDC. While Tenchi Muyou! Game Hen was never officially translated and released for international consoles, the latter dumped ROM image of the game was hacked and translated into English on two occasions. Lina\`chan, Nuku-Nuku & Filia's Translations, or LNF, released their functional iteration in 2000, albeit some bugs and textual imperfections.  Gameplay  Tenchi Muyou! Game Hen is a turn-based game played from an isometric perspective. The game focuses entirely on fighting monsters within progressive worlds, all of which contain linear paths with predetermined battles. As such, the player does not freely roam or interact with the world. There are a total of 12 playable characters in the game: Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Mihoshi, Sasami, Shitsuki, Ryo-Ohki, Katsuhito, Yukinojyo, Azaka, Kamidake and Washu. The player starts with the beginning four, acquires the subsequent two later, and, by visiting more varied locations, can acquire the remaining six. In prototypical role-playing fashion, each character has different movements, skills, personal advantages, attacking power, health and defense. Unlike the commonly instituted experience points system, however, characters level up by the accumulated number of monsters they defeat in battles. There is a cap of eight levels that each player character can earn (unlike the Final Fantasy series and Chrono Trigger where each character's level can go up to 99). Up to four characters can be brought into combat at once and matches continue until all members of either side are eliminated.  Synopsis  = Setting and plot = Like the other mediums of the series, Tenchi Muyou! Game Hen begins on the Masaki residence, progressively branching from the property to spacecraft and other planets. The characters Shitsuki and Kusumi, new to the franchise, make an only appearance in the game. On an otherwise ordinary sunny morning, Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Mihoshi and Ryo-Ohki sit to breakfast as Sasami finishes serving food. Realizing that Washu is not present, Sasami and Ryo-Ohki go to fetch her. Shortly after leaving, the house begins to wavily glow; ghastly monsters appearing in the hall. Fighting and defeating the intruders, the group is approached by Shitsuki, a mysterious girl who explains the obscure reason for her visit: test and measure the strengths of everyone. All but Ryoko take her objective with any real care until Shitsuki presents Sasami as a hostage, garnering the now dire attention of the group. Acting the sportsman however, Shitsuki agrees to surrender her captive in return for any one of the group injuring her in a fight. Much to her angst, Shitsuki loses; refusing to go through with her end of the deal. She offers the group a future rematch as compensation and, leaving them with her next location, teleports Sasami and herself to her outbound spaceship.

Such joints are often subject to movement, as a function of the building's design basis. For a sample certification listing indicating fire tested motion, click here. Firestops must be able to demonstrate the ability to withstand operational movement prior to fire testing. Firestops for such building joints can be qualified to UL 2079 -- Tests for Fire Resistance of Building Joint Systems. Whether or not the building elements forming the joint have a fire-resistance rating, the joint design must still consider the anticipated operational movement of each joint. Timing is also important, as freshly poured concrete shrinks particularly during the first few months of a new building, potentially causing joint size changes. Perimeter slab edge Firestopping at the \\"perimeter slab edge\\", which is gaps between the floors and the backpan of the curtain wall or precast concrete panels, slow the passage of fire and combustion gases between floors. The firestop at the perimeter slab edge is considered a continuation of the fire-resistance rating of the floor slab. The curtain wall itself, however, is not ordinarily required to have a rating. Fire compartmentalisation is based upon compartments enclosed on all sides to avoid fire and smoke migration beyond each engaged compartment. A non-fire- resistance rated curtain wall prevents the complete compartment (or envelope) from being fire-resistance rated. The provision of firestopping at the joint of the floor slab and curtain wall can still add to the overall fire safety of the building by slowing the advance of the fire in the building interior from floor to floor. The use of fire sprinklers has been shown to mitigate the spread of fire by keeping the fire from growing to a size large enough to cause structural damage and break the exterior glass. If the building is not equipped with sprinklers, the fire can travel up the outside of the curtain wall if the glass on the floor of fire origin is shattered due to radiant heat, causing flames to lick up the outside of the building, resulting in the glass in floors above to break. Falling glass can endanger pedestrians, firefighters and firehoses below. An example of mode of fire spread is the First Interstate Bank Fire in Los Angeles, California. Los Angeles Fire Department Historical Archive This building is now the Aon Center. The fire leapfrogged up the tower by shattering the glass. The exterior curtain wall aluminium skeleton holding the glass failed. Exceptionally sound cementitious spray fireproofing also helped to delay and ultimately to avoid the possible collapse of the building, p. 21 by preventing the steel building structure from reaching the critical temperature at which steel weakens and can no longer hold its intended load. This fire proved the positive, collective effect of both active fire protection (sprinklers) to control fire size in its incipient stages, p. 18 and passive fire protection (fireproofing) if the fire sprinklers are not effective. p. 20 Head-of-Wall (HOW) Where fire- resistance rated wall assemblies, be they masonry or drywall, meet the underside of the floor slab above, a movement joint results, which can be subject to compression, as the freshly placed concrete cures and shrinks all over a new building. This joint must be firestopped in a flexible manner. For concrete block walls that are not load-bearing, the contractor is often instructed to stop the wall about 25mm short of the slab above. The drywaller has to fasten a track to the underside of the slab above, which holds the metal studs. The drywall is then either stopped short allowing for a flexible buffer to be inserted or caulked in place, or one may use purpose-made tracks that hold the studs but permit vertical movement without damage to the system.

A Redemptorist, he is the second Bishop of Rustenburg. Early life and ordination Born in Pretoria, Dowling was ordained a priest of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, more commonly known as the Redemptorists, on July 9, 1967. Bishop He was appointed Bishop of Rustenburg on December 2, 1990, receiving his episcopal consecration on January 27, 1991 from Archbishop Denis Hurley. Views =Condoms and HIV= He is best known for his position that condoms should be used to prevent HIV transmission, a position he first announced in 2001 in response to a question by a Catholic news agency reporter during a meeting in New York City. After stating that the Bishops' Conference had not taken a position on condom use, Dowling was asked for his personal opinion, and said that he believed condoms should be used to prevent the spread of HIV. This was widely interpreted as contradicting Catholic teaching, which opposes the promotion of condom use, while not having a definite, recognized policy on married individuals using condoms for the precise purpose of protecting themselves against AIDS.The Truth about Condoms In private conversations the papal nuncio to South Africa told Dowling that he had strayed from Catholic teaching. The Southern African Bishops Conference also described condoms as \\"an immoral and misguided weapon\\" in the fight against HIV, arguing that condom use could even encourage the spread of HIV by promoting extramarital sex. For his stance on this matter, Utne Reader, a United States magazine that provides \\"alternative coverage of politics, culture, and new ideas\\", named Dowling one of its \\"50 Visionaries Who Are Changing the World\\".Visionaries Who Are Changing the World =New translation of the Mass liturgy= Dowling was also critical of the premature application by the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference of the revision of the English translation of the Mass liturgySAfrica protest over new Catholic Mass translation and he objected to the revision itself, which had received the Holy See's confirmation after being agreed on by English-speaking Episcopal Conferences: \\"I am concerned that this latest decision from the Vatican may be interpreted as another example of what is perceived to be a systematic and well-managed dismantling of the vision, theology and ecclesiology of Vatican II.\\"Letter to The Southern Cross  References  External links *Information on Dowling, from catholic- hierarchy.org Category:Living people Category:1944 births Category:20th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:South African Roman Catholic priests Category:South African people of Irish descent Dowling, Kevin Category:People from Pretoria Category:Redemptorist bishops ","title":"Kevin Dowling (bishop)"},{"id":"10694561","text":"Jean-Christophe Borlin (born 21 December 1976) is a French former professional rugby league footballer who played for Toulouse Olympique in the Co-operative Championship rugby league competition and for St Gaudens club in the French Rugby League Championship competition.

It owns and operates drybulk carriers that transport iron ore, coal, and grains, as well as bauxite, phosphate, and fertilizers. The company also owns and operates container ships and multipurpose vessels that transport dry and refrigerated containerized cargoes, primarily manufactured products and perishables.

Euroseas' 4 drybulk carriers have a total cargo capacity of , its 6 container ships have a cargo capacity of () and its 1 multipurpose vessel has a cargo capacity of or .  History  Euroseas' roots go back four generations, prior to the existence of steam and diesel engines, when the company's ships were propelled by sails. Those days ships were maximum 1000 tons and cost about 3000 pounds sterling to build. According to company records, the first Pittas Family shipowner was Nikolaos F. Pittas. He was born on the island of Chios in Greece in 1837. The first vessel he owned was Ypapanti, a 700-ton wooden, sail vessel that was built in Chios in 1873. He became the captain of the ship and his younger brothers and other relatives and friends joined him as crew. The vessel traded in the Mediterranean and Black Sea and the Captain himself always found its next employment from the destination port. He was at all times the Commercial, Technical and Financial Manager of the vessel. No office ashore existed as communications were so poor that people at the home island in Chios often had no news of their whereabouts for months.History, Euroseas corporate website. Business was flourishing at the time and soon N. F. Pittas could afford the purchase of more ships. The next ships purchased were the \\"Sotiras\\", a 780-ton ship that was bought in 1876 and the barque \\"Chios\\" the first 1,000 ton ship which was built in Chios in 1878.

Performance The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 31 October 1633. It was performed by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre, and was acted at Court before King Charles I on Sunday 12 January 1634. Publication The Guardian was not published until 1655, when it was included in an octavo volume issued by Humphrey Moseley that also contained Massinger's The Bashful Lover and the Fletcher/Massinger collaboration A Very Woman. (When Moseley entered the play into the Stationers' Register in 1653, it was under the title The City Honest Man or The Guardian, a form that appears nowhere else.)Moseley had a habit of exploiting title-and-subtitle confusion to register two separate plays for the price of one; other examples include The Bashful Lover, The Lovers' Progress, and A Very Woman. Oliphant, pp. 95‚Äì6. Sources For the plot of his play, Massinger drew upon traditional story and folktale materials that are expressed in various forms throughout world literature. The Iolante/Calypso subplot can be traced as far back as The Heetopades (Hitopadesha), a collection of traditional Bengali tales, and The Fables of Pilpay; the story was translated into Greek by Simeon Seth, and also occurs in The Decameron of Boccaccio,Gifford, p. 408. where it is the eighth story of the seventh day. Massinger also exploited classical literature for his versification in the play, drawing upon the works of Seneca the Younger (Hercules Furens), Terence (Heauton Timonumenos), and Catullus.Gifford, pp. 416, 436. Adaptations During the Restoration era, material from The Guardian was adapted into a droll, titled Love Lost in the Dark, or the Drunken Couple (printed 1680).Logan and Smith, p. 110. Aphra Behn borrowed from The Guardian for her play The City Heiress (1682).Garrett, p. 13. George Farquhar was influenced by The Guardian when writing his play The Inconstant (1702).Phelan, p. 62. Synopsis The play is set in the city of Naples and its surrounding countryside. Durazzo is a local gentleman, in his fifties but still lusty, vigorous, and passionate about life. (One character describes him as \\"jovial and good;\\" another, less sympathetic, calls him an \\"angry old ruffian.\\") Durazzo serves as the legal guardian for his nephew Caldoro, and encourages him to live a life of \\"rich clothes...horses, games, and wenches\\" suitable for a gentleman. But Durazzo is disappointed with his nephew, considering him a \\"milksop\\" for his unrequited love for the maiden Calista. Calista prefers the rakish Adorio, who would be happy to serve as her lover‚Äîbut the virtuous Calista wants a husband, and this is not what Adorio has in mind. Caldoro is not wholly spineless, though; in a confrontation with Adorio he strikes his rival, and the two are about to duel when they are separated by other characters. Calista is the daughter of Severino and Iolante. Severino is a gentleman who had the misfortune to fight a duel with his brother-in-law Monteclaro and to leave the man (apparently) dead on the field of combat. Alphonso, the King of Naples, is adamantly opposed to duelling and refuses to pardon any duelist who has killed a rival. With no hope of pardon, Severino has retreated to the countryside to lead a crew of bandits. Iolante, remaining in Naples, nourishes a sycophantic relationship with her neighbor Calypso, who flatters Iolante at every turn for her virtue. Iolante is unhappy with her daughter Calista over the matter of Adorio and Caldoro; she threatens to lock Calista away from any contact with men. Iolante has a consistency problem, however: she has spied a visiting French nobleman called Laval, and, prompted by Calypso, has developed a passion for him. Calypso acts the part of a bawd, taking a letter to Laval and setting up an assignation between him and Iolante. Laval is wary and suspicious, but curious too. Simultaneously, Calista sends a letter to Adorio by her maid Mirtilla, explaining her restraint and appealing to Adorio to elope with her and marry her. Adorio is having a change of heart after his near-duel with Caldoro (a psychological development typical of Massinger's dramaturgy).The Custom of the Country and A Very Woman both include similar features. When Mirtilla brings him Calista's letter, he agrees to rescue and marry Calista. Mirtilla, beholding this, falls in love with Adorio herself. Meanwhile, Durazzo convinces Caldoro to take an aggressive approach to his problem and abduct Calista. These competing plot strains come together in a series of night scenes of elaborate mistakings and disguises. (Staged in low light in the enclosed Blackfriars, rather than the open daylight of the Globe Theatre, these scenes could have been highly effective.) Calista sneaks out of her mother's house to meet Adorio, only to encounter Caldoro instead; and Caldoro, prompted by Durazzo, lets her believe that he is Adorio, and escorts her away. Shortly after, Adorio arrives to encounter Mirtilla, who is also fleeing Iolante's house; he mistakes the maid for Calista, and she allows the misapprehension and departs with him. Severino has sneaked into Naples to visit his home and his wife ‚Äî and bumps into Laval, coming to keep his appointment for a tryst with Iolante. Laval mistakes Severino for a watchman, and retreats. Severino enters his house by a secret way, and finds his wife in her nightgown, with a banquet and wines laid out; she is clearly expecting a lover. Enraged, he binds Iolante with scarves and searches the house for the lover. In his absence, Calypso finds Iolante, unties her, and takes her place. Severino returns, still angry, having found no lover but realized that his daughter and her maid are missing; in his anger, he torments the woman he thinks is his wife, wounding her arms and her nose with his dagger.In Elizabethan culture, the nose had exaggerated sexual symbolism. Advanced veneral disease caused the tissues of the bridge of the nose to break down, so that damage to the nose suggested sexual license and its consequences. In his momentary absence, Iolante returns and takes Calypso's place; when Severino comes back, she feigns prayer, and makes him believe that her wounds have been miraculously healed, as a sign of her innocence and chastity. A repentant Severino takes Iolante to his bandit cave. After riding off into the country, the two pairs of mismatched lovers eventually discover their errors. Caldoro is able to make a good impression on Calista, and begins to win her favor; Mirtilla placates the angry Adorio, and in a moment of mutual exhaustion they fall asleep under a tree, his head in her lap. They are discovered this way by Caldoro, Calista, and Durazzo, and the sight cures Calista of her infatuation with Adorio. Soon both parties are captured by the \\"banditti,\\" who lead them to Severino's hideaway along with a third set of travellers, who include Laval and a disguised King Alphonso. In the final scene, the last misunderstandings are cleared way: Laval is revealed to be the supposedly dead Monteclaro, who had been rescued from near death and brought back to health by a travelling French nobleman. With the problem of the fatal duel resolved, the King can pardon Severino and restore him to civil society. Caldoro and Calista are now a happy couple, ready to be wed. Adorio resists the idea of marrying a servant girl ‚Äî but Severino reveals that Mirtilla is actually of gentle birth, and equips her with a dowry that resolves Adorio's qualms. Here in The Guardian, Massinger takes the English Renaissance stage convention of disguise and mistaken identity and carries it (Caldoro for Adorio, Mirtilla for Calista, Calypso for Iolante, Monteclaro/Laval, and the disguised King) about as far as any dramatist of the era ever managed to do. Massinger uses his play to criticize the contemporary craze for duelling, which he also writes against in A Very Woman.Ira Clark, \\"Writing and Duelling in the English Renaissance,\\" in Barroll, p. 301. The play's Robin-Hood style bandits provide opportunity for social commentary on other issues as well (most prominently in Act II, scene 4). Notes Sources * Barroll, John Leeds, ed.

Nicknamed 'The Nebraska Tiger Man' for his ferocity, aggression and catlike dexterity, Olympic freestyle wrestling gold medallist Robin Reed regarded Pesek as the greatest wrestler he ever met. Early life Pesek was born to Bohemian parents near Ravenna, Nebraska, the fifth of seven children, and grew up living the hard life of the American pioneer. His father Martin died in an accident when John was twelve. Professional wrestling career Pesek originally planned a career in boxing but took to professional wrestling instead, with which he became familiar by attending the traveling carnivals of the era. His first high-profile match was in 1914 when he defeated Wladek Zbyszko. Pesek was nicknamed \\"The Nebraska Tiger Man\\" for his ferocity and catlike dexterity. He was also legitimately strong and could hold his own on the mat against opponents that frequently outweighed him considerably. Pesek is recorded as losing only about 20 matches in his entire career, which he began undefeated until January 16, 1920 when he lost to fellow Nebraskan Joe Stecher. Among the few other men to ever defeat Pesek were Jim Londos and Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis. A true \\"hooker\\" who believed in professional wrestling as legitimate competitive sport, Pesek disliked the wrestling \\"trust\\" that emerged in the 1920s for its booking of pre-determined match outcomes. His reluctance to co-operate with promoters isolated him from the wrestling mainstream for much of his career. One important wrestling figure with whom Pesek did agree to work was Ed Lewis, for whom he became a \\"policeman\\" to ward off the so-called \\"trustbusters\\", outlaw wrestlers who posed threats to promotions and their champions by refusing to co-operate (fix matches) during matches. On November 14, 1921, Pesek squared off against one of the most prominent trustbusters, Croatian-born wrestler Marin Plestina at Madison Square Garden. Pesek proceeded to administer such a severe beating (through continual fouling) that Plestina was hospitalized. All three falls of the match were forfeited due to repeated head butting and eye gouging by Pesek. His repeated fouling caused a near riot. The New York Times credits Plestina with \\"intensified fairness\\" in the face of Pesek's continued fouling. This is the reason Pesek was banned from wrestling for life in New York. These comments are taken from a New York Times article dated November 15, 1921. New York's athletic commission refused to award Pesek his prize money and banned him from wrestling in the state, but the Tiger Man had done his job. On another occasion, Pesek was hired to give Lewis' ally, Boston-area promoter Paul Bowser, a hand in his battle with rival promoter Jack Curley. Curley was aggressively promoting Olympic wrestling medalist Nat Pendleton and issued a series of haughty challenges, among them boasting that Pendleton could beat Lewis and any other wrestler on the same night. Pesek was enlisted to face Curley's prot√©g√©, and in a legitimate contest held on January 25, 1923, Pesek defeated and injured Pendleton to claim an $8000 purse and give Bowser a major financial and publicity victory.http://www.slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Movies/2006/03/03/1471510.html Pesek would memorably cross paths with Joe Stecher again, wrestling him three times in 1926. Stecher, now the world champion, won the first meeting on April 29, and the second match on August 25 ended in a draw. Then, on October 6 at Los Angeles' Olympic Auditorium, subbing for Ed Lewis, Pesek diverted from the planned result and trapped Stecher in a wrist lock. Stecher appeared to submit, but in order to save face the referee disqualified Pesek under the pretense that he had used an illegal choke hold, allowing Stecher to retain the title. Stecher was said to have cried after the match. Despite making a good living in America, Pesek eventually grew tired of backroom politics and opted to go overseas for a while in 1929. Traveling to New Zealand and Australia, he became a sensation there, winning 47 consecutive bouts. Pesek's reputation as a maverick held him back from holding many championships in his career, and he has been characterized as a \\"trustbuster\\" in his own right. It turned out that none of the titles he did hold were either won or lost in the ring. From 1931 to 1933, he was the recognized Midwest Wrestling Association (MWA) champion, until he forfeited the title to wrestle for another promotion. Later, Pesek was recognized for a time as National Wrestling Association champion. He was belatedly given the vacant NWA championship on September 13, 1937, as he had been the only man to post a $1000 bond for a proposed tournament one year earlier. However, he was soon stripped of the title when he refused to meet two challengers. Pesek was again awarded the vacant MWA championship in 1938, but was stripped of it in June 1940 for, once again, failing to meet the top contenders. By the end of the 1920s, Pesek had begun turning his focus towards racing greyhounds, and on of his Nebraska farm he built up one of the nation's leading stables. He won several national titles, and the pedigree of one of his greatest dogs, Australian-born \\"Just Andrew\\", could be found in 95 percent of American greyhound stock by 1975.http://www.greyhound-data.com/d?i=116943 Pesek continued to appear occasionally in exhibition matches through the 1950s, long enough to wrestle on the same card as son Jack, who would go on to enjoy a lengthy wrestling career of his own. He wrestled his final match in 1965. Personal life Pesek married Myrl Mahoney (died 1966) on February 14, 1921. The couple had seven children: Elizabeth, Jack, Virginia, Mary Lee, Kevin, Catherine and Steve. Jack Pesek went on to become a professional wrestler like his father. Pesek died at his home on March 12, 1978 from a heart attack. He was buried at the Highland Cemetery outside Ravenna. A bronze statue of Pesek with two greyhounds was being created at the time of his death, and it was posthumously unveiled in front of Ravenna Bank on May 28, 1978. Legacy Although lesser known than some of his contemporaries, John Pesek is recognized today as one of the best wrestlers of his era. He was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2005, as well as the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996; Pesek had earlier been inducted into the Lincoln Journal's Nebraska Sports Hall of Fame in 1957. His contributions to the sport of greyhound racing have also been recognized by his induction to the Greyhound National Hall Of Fame in 1978 ‚Äì his dogs \\"Gangster\\" and \\"Just Andrew\\" were inducted in 1964 and 1975, respectively.

College career Lockbaum was raised in Glassboro, New Jersey, and spent his prep years at Glassboro High School where he competed in football, baseball, and wrestling; he graduated in 1984. Lockbaum attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, from 1984 to 1988, where he played wide receiver and halfback on offense, defensive back on defense, and was a kick returner on special teams. Lockbaum was a starting cornerback during his freshman season, and moved to strong safety as a sophomore. Before his junior season, the Holy Cross coaching staff (head coach Mark Duffner, offensive coordinate Tom Rossley, and defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle) decided to use Lockbaum on both offense and defense. He became the first two-way player since Leroy Keyes of Purdue in 1968. In Lockbaum's junior season of 1986, he rushed for 827 yards on 144 carries, caught 57 passes for 860 yards, and scored 22 touchdowns on offense; on defense he had 46 tackles, two fumble recoveries, and one interception; on special teams he returned 21 kickoffs for 452 yards. In a game against Dartmouth he scored six touchdowns, and in a game against Army he was on the field for 143 of 171 total plays. He was named WTBS college football player of the year, New Jersey Sports Writers Association college player of the year, and finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy balloting. In his senior season of 1987, he rushed for 403 yards on 85 carries, and caught 77 passes for 1152 yards, amassing 2041 all-purpose yards and again scoring 22 touchdowns, while continuing to play defense and special teams. He finished third in the Heisman Trophy balloting, second in the Maxwell Award voting, and was runner-up for the inaugural Walter Payton Award (Division I-AA player of the year). After the conclusion of the regular season, Lockbaum was selected for three all-star games; the Senior Bowl, the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game, and the Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic. He appeared in all three games, seeing the most action in the Shrine Game, where he played five positions (cornerback, free safety, strong safety, fullback, and wide receiver). Lockbaum was a two-time First Team All-America selection (1986 and 1987) as a defensive back. He still holds several Holy Cross offensive records, including most touchdowns in a season and most points in a season (22 and 132, respectively, accomplished in both 1986 and 1987). Lockbaum was inducted into the Glassboro High School Hall of Fame in 1989, the Holy Cross Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1993, the College Football Hall of Fame in 2001, and the ECAC Hall of Fame in 2017. Professional career Lockbaum was selected in the 1988 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the ninth round, and played for them during the preseason as a running back, but was released by the team in August of that year. In 1989, he was signed by the Buffalo Bills, who moved him to safety, but he was again released before the start of the regular season. In 1994, he played briefly for the Massachusetts Marauders of the Arena Football League. Personal life Lockbaum received a degree in economics from Holy Cross, and became an executive for an insurance company. His son, also nicknamed Gordie, played shortstop in the 2002 Little League World Series for the Worcester team that reached the US championship game, and later attended Amherst College where he was a defensive back on the football team.

Contents Faiths & Avatars lists, ranks, rates, explains and details everything about the gods in the Faer√ªnian pantheon, even those who have died. The book provides 45 detailed descriptions, and four new priest sub-classes. Each god has a description, statistics, and personal history, as well as a description of its Avatar - the god's manifestation in the mortal world and the form that adventurers would be most likely to encounter. The faiths section of each god details that god's church structure, dogma, day-to- day activities, major centers of worship, affiliated religious orders, priestly vestments, adventuring garb, holy days and important ceremonies. The book offers specific extra spells to the followers of the various gods, which reflect the individual god's nature and spheres of influence. The book's last ten pages outline four priest sub-classes: crusaders, monks, mystic and shaman. This book contains an exhaustive list of all the Lesser through Greater human gods and their churches. The supplement provides numerous spells and special powers for clerics of each different faith. Faiths & Avatars details the clergy, the ethos, and important information to depict the Faer√ªnian pantheon in a campaign setting. Publication history The book was designed by Julia Martin with Eric L. Boyd, and additional design by Ed Greenwood, L. Richard Baker III, and David Wise. Cover art is by Alan Pollack, with interior illustrations by Earl Geier and color plates by Victoria Lisi and Ned Dameron. This book is first in a series of sourcebooks about the Faer√ªnian pantheon, followed by Powers & Pantheons and Demihuman Deities. Reception Trenton Webb reviewed Faiths & Avatars for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. He declared that \\"Julia Martin and Eric L. Boyd deserve medals for what they've achieved with Faiths & Avatars. They probably also deserve professional psychiatric help for even attemption to codify and clarify the twisted theology of Abeir-Toril. The resultant work is exhaustive. It's also exhausting.\\" He found that the book \\"ignores the non- human deities, but by the time you've waded through this weighty work you'll be glad it does\\". He referred to the god descriptions, the new sub-classes, and the \\"(hilarious) ninepage cleric fashion show\\" as a \\"guarantee of value\\". He calls the introduction \\"remarkably concise (if somewhat brain-mangling)\\" and says that the book then \\"dips straight into what makes each god worth worshipping. This is no Deities & Demigods-style glorified Monster Manual - in which the gods were dismissed with single paragraph descriptions, a pretty picture and an outrageous set of stats - but a collection of information so thorough that it makes your brain hurt.\\" Webb calls the gods' personal histories \\"deadpan [...] telling which gods they hate, who they support and how much attention they pay to their followers. All very solid, and just what you'd expect.\\" Regarding the avatars, he says: \\"Oddly, these are short descriptions but, since they're backed by the in-depth god info, there's more than enough information here to create truly terrifying encounters for those characters who are sufficiently cocky (or stupid) to tackle deities head-to- head.\\" He goes on to say: \\"It's faith, however, that really makes gods great and this book good. Ordinarily, playing a cleric character is difficult because there's precious little rules-based help in AD&D; for those trying to take their characters beyond the role of magical nurses. The only experience most of us have of religion is the modern Christian model, which is of no use when your day-to-day activities include direct physical violence. It's even less help when your priest worships a god who personifies evil, cruelty and downright nastiness.\\" Webb commented that with the faiths section for each god, \\"Faiths & Avatars provides players with loads of inspiration and plenty of guidance for roleplaying\\". He called the sub-classes the \\"final accomplishment of Faiths & Avatars\\", but felt that they were \\"almost dismissed in an appendix-like form\\", saying: \\"Although these descriptions are a little too concise for their own good, the sub-classes they deal with are welcome additions that work well with the Faiths & Avatars system. It's especially nice to see the return of the Oriental Adventures-style monk.\\" Aside from the sheer size of the subject matter, Webb outlines what he considers two major problems with the book: \\"Functionally, the print's too small and the background tints are too dark, which makes reading a chore and cross- referencing difficult. In addition, it's stylistically po-faced, overly pious and almost puritanical about the subject matter. There's no excitement or enjoyment to be had here.\\" He goes on to say that \\"Faiths & Avatars is scarily serious and seriously scary. Personally, I'd be terrified of implementing it in a campaign for fear of having missed some vital link and consequently undermining both my campaign and the Faer√ªnian pantheon. But if you've got powerful characters running around one of the Forgotten Realms you'd be doing your players a disservice if you didn't toy with this hi-octane, high-power playing aid.\\" Webb concluded by saying: \\"Reading Faiths & Avatars is a real struggle, but you'll plough on because the ideas are good, the research thorough, and because it offers a lot to any Forgotten Realms campaign. Faiths & Avatars is the bible for the Forgotten Realms. Unfortunately, just like many real-world religions, it takes itself far too seriously.\\" References Category:1996 books Category:Forgotten Realms sourcebooks ","title":"Faiths &amp; Avatars"},{"id":"10695121","text":"Peter Reynolds or Pete Reynolds may refer to: * Pete Reynolds (coach) (c. 1885‚Äì1951), American college football coach * Pete Reynolds (pilot) (1944‚Äì2014), American test pilot * Peter H.

Wayne was also credited as \\"Duke Morrison\\" as a property assistant in the Art Department. Ward Bond, Wayne's lifelong good friend, also had a bit part in the movie.

The two men each ask Mary to sing for them, but eventually, she chooses Phil as her beau, and it is he who also has the winning song. Although the film was largely devoid of much plot line, as was typical of musical revue pictures of the period, there is a great deal of singing and dancing. Many of Lois Moran's numbers were actually footage that was cut from the film Fox Movietone Follies of 1929, which were edited out when the film was found to be too long.

College playing career Cabral lettered three seasons for Colorado at linebacker from 1975 to 1977 under Coach Bill Mallory, as he was a captain and played a big role on The Buffaloes' Big Eight champion team in 1976. He led Colorado with 13 tackles (12 solo) in the 1977 Orange Bowl against Ohio State. As a senior, he was honored as the Big Eight Conference's player of the week for a monster 25 tackles in a CU 27-21 win over Stanford and shared the team's Sure Tackler Award with Mark Haynes.

Known as one of the top linebacker coaches in the nation, his students have included Matt Russell, the 1996 Butkus Award winner, all-Big Eight performers Greg Biekert, Chad Brown and Ted Johnson, all of whom went on to stardom in the National Football League, and all-Big 12 linebacker Jordon Dizon, a consensus All-American who was also the league defensive player of the year for 2007. He also recruited tailback Rashaan Salaam, the 1994 Heisman trophy winner, and Chris Naeole, a 1996 All-American guard. Hawkins promoted him to assistant head coach on February 7, 2008. Hawkins cited his leadership, noting that \\"no one person has had more influence in the success of Colorado football than Brian Cabral.\\" Cabral's 21 years as a full-time assistant rank as the most in Colorado athletic history, not only for football but for all sports sponsored by the University. Cabral has served twice as interim head coach for the Buffaloes. His first stint was a three-month period in 2004 before the start of the season when Head Coach Gary Barnett was placed on paid administrative leave. In that role, he continued to coach his position players but also took care of day-to-day operational details of the program. On November 9, 2010, Cabral was again named interim head coach when Dan Hawkins was fired. He won his initial game as interim head coach against Iowa State after Hawkins firing, with Hawkins' son having his best game of the season. In 2013, Cabral became associate head coach and defensive coordinator at Indiana State. Personal life Cabral grew up in Kailua, Hawaii and remains involved in recruiting efforts in Hawaii for the Buffaloes. Cabral has worked youth camps in the state as well as all-Polynesian camps in the continental U.S. He is a founding board member of the Polynesian Coaches Association. Cabral earned a B.S. degree in therapeutic recreation from Colorado in 1978.

He studied the history of Croatia and was an associate of the Lexicographic Institute in Zagreb. During his life, he authored more than 20 books and numerous articles, and also worked as a literary critic. ≈†tedimlija is also known as editor-in-chief of publications promoting the Croatian Orthodox Church of Usta≈°e regime. Biography ≈†tedimlija was born in Stijena Piperska, a small village of Piperi Highland near Podgorica in the Principality of Montenegro. He attended the Gymnasium in Leskovac and moved to Zagreb in 1930. There he worked as a journalist and writer who published numerous articles and reviews on literature, politics and history in newspapers and periodicals. ≈†tedimlija‚Äôs articles on Montenegrin history complained about lost independence of the Kingdom of Montenegro after the Podgorica Assembly in 1918, and his articles on domestic policy of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia were influenced by Croatian nationalism of that time. In 1941, after political changes in the balkans, he founded a Montenegrin National Committee of the Independent State of Croatia and a year later, he became editor-in-chief of publications promoting the Croatian Orthodox Church of Usta≈°e regime. At the end of 1944 he escaped to the Ostmark of Nazi Germany, in 1945 he was arrested in the Soviet zone of Austria and deported to a Gulag in the USSR. After ten years of detention, he came back to SFR Yugoslavia in 1955, was prosecuted for fascist collaboration and sentenced to 8 years in prison for his political activities during the war. In 1959, he was already released on condition that he accepted the prohibition of publishing works under his name.

Historiographical publications He published his central theory on the origin of the Montenegrins for the first time in his books Red Croatia and Basics of Montenegrin Nationalism from 1937. He explained in his theory that Montenegrins were descendants of the Croatian people, who would then have settled the old Montenegrin territory of the legendary Red Croatia. The Montenegrin language would be nothing but a dialect of Croatian. The final point of that theory resulted in his assertion that the population had gradually been serbianisationed over the centuries.

It is also widely cultivated as an ornamental and naturalized in the West Indies, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, the southeastern United States from Texas to Florida, Zimbabwe, South Africa, China, Korea, the Ryukyu Islands, Assam, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Solomon Islands, Queensland, Society Islands, Kiribati, and Caroline Islands.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Zephyranthes carinata has large bright pink flowers, around , and green strap-like leaves. They are found naturally in moist, open areas, often near woodlands. Like other rain lilies, their common name refers to their habit of blooming soon after a heavy rainfall. They are widely grown in gardens as annuals and as container plants, although they will overwinter in warm climates. Zephyranthes carinata are often incorrectly referred to as Zephyranthes grandiflora, especially in horticulture. Description Zephyranthes carinata grows from tunicate globular bulbs in diameter. The tunics are wine-red in color. Four to six linear and flattened leaves are produced by each bulb. Each is long and wide, reddish at the bases and bright green for the rest of their lengths. The funnel-shaped flowers are solitary, with pink to rose red perianths. They are borne erect or slightly inclined on scapes long. The deep lilac to purplish spathes are long. There are two lengths of the stamen filaments - and . The anthers are in length. The style is filiform. The flowers develop into more or less spherical or three-lobed capsules. The seeds are shiny black and flattened. Classification Zephyranthes carinata belongs to the genus Zephyranthes (rain lilies) of the tribe Hippeastreae. It is classified under the subfamily Amaryllidoideae of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae). In broader classifications, they are sometimes included within the lily family (Liliaceae). Zephyranthes carinata is often referred to as Zephyranthes grandiflora, especially in horticulture. But the former was published earlier, hence Z. grandiflora is considered superfluous and illegitimate. Another name identified as an earlier synonym of Z. carinata is now considered to be a different species - Zephyranthes minuta. Nomenclature Zephyranthes carinata is also known as the 'rosepink rain lily', 'rosepink magic lily', or 'pink magic lily'. Like other rain lilies, their common name refers to their habit of blooming soon after a heavy rainfall. However, cultivated specimens of Z. carinata can be induced to flower all throughout the year by maintaining humidity. They are one of the three species of rain lilies commonly known as 'pink rain lilies'. The other two are Zephyranthes rosea and Habranthus robustus. Z. rosea is a much smaller species with pink flowers that have green centers. H. robustus, on the other hand, have generally paler pink and more strongly bent flowers. Non-English common names of Z. carinata include: * Chinese ‚Äì Jiu lianÔºåÈü≠Ëò≠(Tradition Chinese) * French ‚Äì petit lis rose, lis bordures * German ‚Äì gro√übl√ºtige, Windblume * Korean ‚Äì Na-do-saf-ran * Spanish ‚Äì adelfa, Coraz√≥n de Maria, duende rosado, L√°grimas de Mar√≠a Distribution and habitat Zephyranthes carinata is native to Central America, from Mexico to Colombia. They have been introduced elsewhere and have become widely naturalized. They are usually found in open pastures and hill slopes. Uses Zephyranthes carinata are widely cultivated as ornamentals. They are able to survive colder temperatures than other species of Zephyranthes. Chemical composition It contains lycorine, galanthine, tazettine, haemanthamine, pretazetine, carinatine, tortuosine, trisphaeridine, hamayne and pancratistatin. Toxicity Like other species of Zephyranthes, Z. carinata contain toxic alkaloids including pretazettine, carinatine, lycorine, galanthamine, and haemanthamine. If ingested, they can cause vomiting, convulsions, and death.

Budi is synonymous to akal budi or kebudayaan. This original Indonesian word is very philosophical, since it has been explained, interpreted, re-interpreted, and made a philosophical discourse in Indonesian philosophers' circle up to this time. Indonesian philosophy world is not considered as complete without mentioning this discourse. Its derivatives, such as Budayawan, Budiman, and Budi daya, are now also discussed among Indonesian philosophers, especially those who are called philosophers of Kebudayaan. Philosophers of the various schools of philosophy define the word Budi (plural, Budaya) with different definitions, suited to their school interests. The oldest definition of the word is found in the 18th century Ancient Javanese manuscript Serat Centhini. According to the text, Budi is suprahuman, spiritual entity which mediates between God's being and human's being. It is a purely spiritual substance originated from God. Here is the excerpt: English translation: It is the Budi with this meaning that is used by Dr. Wahidin Soedirohusodo to name his and his fellows' first native political society Budi Utomo in the Dutch East Indies of the early 19th century. The Budi in this meaning is also similar to the Sufi concept of Nur Muhammad or the Platonic concept of The Universal Soul or the Islamic philosophical concept of Al-'Aql Al-Awwal. Modern definition (19th century onwards) Modern European learning introduced by the Portuguese-Spanish Catholics and the Dutch Protestants to Indonesian native educational institutions in the 20th century influenced the definition of the word Budi. In this intellectual period, Budi is re-defined and re-interpreted not as spiritual as understood before, but as human entity. In 1961, for example, Nicolas Drijarkara defined Budi as ethical reason or moral reason as understood by the moralist Immanuel Kant.N. Drijarkara, Percikan Filsafat, Jakarta, PT. Pembangunan, 1978, 3rd edition, p. 47 Poedjawijatna, another philosopher, defined Budi as Indonesian translation of the English word reason or reasoning and Filsafat Budi as of the English word Logics.Poedjawijatna, Pembimbing ke Arah Alam Filsafat, Jakarta, PT. Pembangunan, 1980, 5th edition, p. 14 Ki Hajar Dewantara, a preeminent Javanese thinker, in the early 1970s defined Budi as the matured human soul.as quoted by Karkono Kamajaya Partokusumo in his Kebudayaan Jawa dan Proses Demokratisasi, in Agus R. Sarjono (ed.), Pembebasan Budaya-Budaya Kita, Jakarta, Gramedia, p. 210 Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, a great Indonesian thinker of the century, defined Budi as psychological pattern contained in it basic life needs, instincts, feelings, thought, passions and fantasies. Here is the excerpt: Budi as culture The philosopher in Indonesian history of philosophy who firstly understood Budi (or more frequently, Kebudayaan) as culture is Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana (1908‚Äì1994).Koentjaraningrat, an American-trained anthropologist, then continued using the meaning in his famous book, Manusia dan Kebudayaan di Indonesia.Koentjaraningrat, Manusia dan Kebudayaan di Indonesia, Jakarta, Penerbit Djambatan, 1995, 15th edition, p. 19 Sidi Gazalba, another philosopher of Kebudayaan, defined Budi or Kebudayaan as a way of life owned and held by any cultural unity.Sidi Gazalba, Sistematika Filsafat Buku I, Jakarta, Bulan Bintang, 1985, 4th edition, pp. 59-60 Today's Indonesian thinkers, like Sutan Syahrir, Soedjatmoko, Dick Hartoko, Abdurrahman Wahid, Mochtar Kusumaatmaja, Mochtar Lubis, Sayidiman Suryohadiprojo, Y.B. Mangunwijaya, Nurcholish Madjid, Darmanto Jatman, and other modernists, hold this cultural-anthropological meaning of Budi. It can even be said that this meaning has been dominating the philosophical discourse of today. All philosophers holding this meaning has been acknowledged nationally as Philosophers of Kebudayaan.

In the Middle Ages, the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine opened the Bordeaux region to the English market and eventually to the world's stage. The Gironde estuary and its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers play a pivotal role in the history and success of this region.K.

These disruptions continued into the 5th century to the period of Frankish rule.H.

In the 12th century however, the popularity of Bordeaux wines increased dramatically following the marriage of Henry Plantagenet and Ali√©nor d‚ÄôAquitaine. The marriage made the province of Aquitaine English territory, and thenceforth the majority of Bordeaux claret was exported in exchange for other goods. Upon the ascension of their son, Richard, to the English throne Bordeaux became the base for Richard's French operations.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 140 Simon & Schuster 1989 As the popularity of Bordeaux wine increased, the vineyards expanded to accommodate the demands from abroad. Henry and Ali√©nor youngest son, John was in favor of promoting the wine industry, and to increase it further, abolished the Grande Coutume export tax to England from the Aquitaine region.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 142 Simon & Schuster 1989 In the 13th and 14th century, a code of business practices called the police des vins emerged to give Bordeaux wine a distinct trade advantage over its neighboring regions.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 149 Simon & Schuster 1989 The citizenry of Bordeaux worked diligently to promote and foster their relationship with the English market. In 1205, King Alfonso VIII of Castile laid claim to Aquitaine and put Bordeaux under siege. The village was able to withstand the attack and King John rewarded the Bourgeois with orders for wine in excess of 120 tons. In 1224, King Louis VIII of France attempted to purge the English from French soil and was halted in his advance in the town of Bordeaux. In the aftermath Bordeaux received privileged access to the English market through London, and their exports to the market soon dwarfed the production from other French wine making regions. During the 13th century, the Graves was the principal wine region of Bordeaux. While there were some vines growing in the Entre-Deux-Mers, Saint-√âmilion and Blaye, the M√©doc during this period was virtually a barren marshland.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 143 Simon & Schuster 1989 At the turn of the 14th century, the town of Libourne was vying for dominance in the area, exporting 11,000 tons of wine to London from the 1308 vintage. A year earlier, this area fulfilled an order for 1,152,000 bottles to be used for the celebration of Edward II's wedding.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 145 Simon & Schuster 1989 The wine of this time period was highly alcoholic and fruity but did not age well, often spoiling a year after the vintage was released.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 144 Simon & Schuster 1989 The export of Bordeaux was effectively halted by the outbreak of The Hundred Years' War between France and England in 1337 followed by the outbreak of the Black Death which ravaged the area. By the end of the conflict in 1453 France had repossessed the province, thus taking control of wine production in the region. As part of the Auld Alliance, Scots merchants were granted by the French a privileged position in the trade of claret, a position which continued largely unchanged with the cession of the military alliance between France and Scotland with the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh. Even when the by then Protestant kingdoms of England and Scotland, both ruled by the same Stuart king by this point, were trying to militarily aid the Huguenot rebels in their fight against Catholic France in La Rochelle, Scots trading vessels were not only permitted to enter the Gironde, but they were escorted safely to the port of Bordeaux by the French navy for their own protection from Huguenot privateers. Second golden era Harbour at Bordeaux, √âdouard Manet, 1871 In the seventeenth century, Dutch traders began to drain the marshland around the M√©doc and encouraged the planting of vineyards. The Dutch would also open new distribution channels to the Bourgeosis which helped usher in a second era of prosperity.C. Fallis, editor The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine pg 180 Global Book Publishing 2006 At the turn of the 18th century, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out which made navigation along the French coast line and the English channel very risky. Additionally, the tensions between English and French governments halted all \\"official\\" trade between Bordeaux and the London market. Despite the government sanction, bottles of prized Bordeaux wines began showing up in large quantities at auction houses in London, Bristol, and Plymouth as the captured bounty of privateers. Wine historian, Hugh Johnson, speculates that this was an arranged affair between the Bordeaux chateaux, the privateers and the London auction houses to get around the war time politics of the period.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 208 Simon & Schuster 1989 In 1725, the spread of vineyards throughout Bordeaux was so vast that it was divided into specific areas so that the consumer could tell exactly where each wine was from. The collection of districts was known as the Vignoble de Bordeaux, and bottles were labeled with both the region and the area from which they originated. During this period, Nicolas-Alexandre, marquis de S√©gur rose to prominence as the \\"Prince of Vignes\\" due to his ownership of some of Bordeaux's most prestigious estates and Pierre de Rauzan laid the foundation for Ch√¢teau Rauzan-S√©gla, Ch√¢teau Rauzan-Gassies, Ch√¢teau Pichon Longueville Baron, and Ch√¢teau Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 256 Simon & Schuster 1989 In 1855, a classification system was set up that ranked the top chateaus of the M√©doc according to their market price. Phylloxera epidemic From 1875‚Äì1892 almost all Bordeaux vineyards were ruined by Phylloxera infestations. The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock from Augusta, Missouri, the first viticultural region in the United States. All Bordeaux vines that survive to this day are thanks to this action. Some grape varieties responded better to the grafting than others and these varieties‚ÄîCabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc, Merlot, Semillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle‚Äîbecame Bordeaux's leading grapes.C. Fallis, editor The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine pg 181 Global Book Publishing 2006 Economic uncertainty Due to the lucrative nature of this business, other areas in France began growing their own wines and labeling them as Bordeaux products. As profits in the Aquitaine region declined, the vignerons demanded that the government impose a law declaring that only produce from Bordeaux could be labeled with that name. The INAO or Institut National des Appellations d'Origine was created for this purpose. In the twentieth century, the French wine market saw the effects of over cropping and the early developments of the wine lake phenomenon as supply far out paced demand. The two World Wars, Great Depression and 1970s oils crisis also had a detrimental effect on the industry. 20th century Bordeaux wine displayed for sale locally in France. In 1936, the government responded to the appeals from the winemakers and stated that all regions in France had to name their wines by the place in which they had been produced. Labeled with the AOC approved stamp, products were officially confirmed to be from the region that it stated. This law later extended to other goods such as cheese, poultry and vegetables. The economic problems in the 1970s, in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis marked a difficult period for Bordeaux. A series of scandals coincided with a commercial crisis in Bordeaux. The vintage of 1972 had been overpriced as was 1973 and 1974. And when the market crashed the n√©gociants were stuck with overpriced wine that they could not sell. The early 1980s saw a new trend. Inheritance taxes were doubled in 1981 and on top of the crisis in the 1970s, many families found it increasingly difficult to hang on to their ch√¢teaux. Enter domestic and foreign insurance companies, banks and other corporate giants. Some of these companies were looking for a quick profit, others were in it as a long-term investment. But the 1980s decade wasn't all bad. It also saw more great vintages in a single decade than ever before and a new era in other respects. First, wine critics (rather than just official classifications) started to have an influence on demand and prices. Wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr. reviewed the 1982 Bordeaux vintage as the most sumptuous vintage in decades. Not only was this a turning point for Bordeaux wine economically, it also represented the beginning of an American domination of the reviewing of wine, especially Bordeaux.Stephen Brook, The Complete Bordeaux - The Wines - The Ch√¢teaux - The People p. 30-31. Octopus Publishing Group Ltd. 2007 The result was a broader appeal of Bordeaux wine where the presence of fruit became a much more important factor than previously.Stephen Brook, The Complete Bordeaux - The Wines - The Ch√¢teaux - The People p. 31. Octopus Publishing Group Ltd. 2007 This critical selection of grapes also resulted in many chateaux introducing second wines, so not to waste good but not optimum quality grapes. It was also the introduction of the en primeur concept where traders alongside critics are invited to Bordeaux six months after harvest, to sample the new wine.Stephen Brook, The Complete Bordeaux - The Wines - The Ch√¢teaux - The People p. 31-32. Octopus Publishing Group Ltd. 2007 Bordeaux used to have a significant production of white wines, with Entre-deux-Mers, a primarily white wine area. Unlike the style of dry white Bordeaux favoured today, with almost 100% Sauvignon Blanc and a heavy influence of new oak, the traditional Entre-deux-Mers whites had a high proportion of Semillion and were made in either old oak barrels or steel tanks. Starting in the 1960s and 1970s, these vineyards were converted to red wine production (of Bordeaux AOC and Bordeaux Sup√©rieur AOC), and the production of white wine has decreased ever since. Today production of white wine has shrunk to about one tenth of Bordeaux's total production, with 11.0% of the vineyard surface in 2007 used for white wines (7.8% for dry, 3.2% for sweet).CIVB: Production , accessed on December 18, 2009 References Category:Bordeaux wine Bordeaux wine Category:Bordeaux ","title":"History of Bordeaux wine"},{"id":"10695407","text":"The Australian Antarctic Names and Medals Committee (AANMC) was established to advise the Government on names for features in the Australian Antarctic Territory and the subantarctic territory of Heard Island and the McDonald Islands.

It is home to 1,200 residents, mostly in single- family homes.  History  Crescent Beach has been a summer destination for centuries. In pre-colonial times, it was the location of a significant temporary summer camp for area aboriginals. The tidal mudflats were a good clam digging area. Wild berries, especially cranberries, and a weir site were located at nearby Nicomekl River and Serpentine River areas. The area was part of Snokomish territory until a smallpox epidemic in 1850 forced the survivors and their lands to be amalgamated into the Semiahmoo First Nation. Musqueam bands also travelled to use the lands seasonally. Artifacts such as arrowheads and jade have been found on the beach in the modern era. First Nations' burial sites were uncovered in 1970 by sewer excavation. The Semiahmoo First Nation attributes three to five metres depth of the land base to archaeological deposits of clams, charcoal and fire-cracked rocks without which the area would largely just be a sandspit. Modern excavations in some parts have also uncovered more than 700 human remains. The first Europeans to chart the area were Spanish sailors. Captain Galiano titled it San Rafael Point on his map. After the creation of British Columbia, the first owner of Crescent Beach area was John Musselwaite of Royal Engineers in 1871. In 1909, development of the Great Northern Railway from Blaine, Washington to New Westminster provided easier access to the beach for Vancouver-area residents. In 1913, permanent dikes (now serving as the waterfront walkway) were established to permit subdivision development. In 1912, a pier was and the Crescent Beach Development Company promoted Crescent Beach as a resort area. Notable Vancouverites began building summer homes in the neighbourhood. That year, Captain Watkin Williams also opened the Crescent Beach Hotel, a 21-room building with a restaurant, store and post office. The hotel burned down in February 1950. Oysters imported from Japan seeded a thriving business for some decades until the Crescent Oyster Company was closed in 1961 due to river pollution and contemporary concerns about shellfish paralytic poisoning.  Recreation  South-facing view of Crescent Beach at high tide Crescent Beach is home to Alexandra Neighbourhood House, the Crescent Beach Pier and Blackie Spit Regional Park, all local landmarks. Crescent Beach is the home of the \\"Crescent Beach Swim Club\\", a local club that offers swimming, sailing, tennis, water polo, volleyball, and triathlon lessons to kids. South-facing view of beach and walkway in Crescent Beach in Surrey, British Columbia On the southern end of Crescent Beach near the bottom of 101 steps staircase at 24th Ave. is the 120 tonne Crescent Rock boulder. Crescent Rock Beach is the 6.5 km. long rugged strip of shoreline from this large rock to White Rock at the base of the Ocean Park bluffs that is utilized by naturists and nudists for nude sunbathing and skinny-dipping. The City of Surrey refuses to endorse its clothing-optional use as it is outside their jurisdiction but the RCMP have acknowledged that nude use on this area out of sight from the marine parks at Crescent Beach and White Rock is legal under Canadian case law. The beach area has showers to wash feet and legs to prevent Swimmer's itch, a short-term immune reaction cause by waterborne parasites seeking Freshwater snails. = Blackie Spit birdwatching = Northeast-facing view of Mud Bay from Blackie Spit The northernmost portion of Crescent Beach is Blackie Spit, named after a settler and known as a birdwatching site beside Mud Bay and near Nicomekl River. The City of Surrey created Blackie Spit Park in 1996. North-facing view of Mud Bay at high tide from Blackie Spit. Skyscrapers in Burnaby and the North Shore Mountains visible in distant background The park is an annual migration rest stop for the Pacific Flyway for 300 species of birds including 10,000 ducks and geese. It is the only area in Boundary Bay where purple martins nest. The eelgrass meadows, mud flats and tidal marsh serve as bird habitats year-round. Shorebirds feed off biofilms, a paper-thin mucus, that consist of bacteria, diatoms (microscopic plants) and organic detritus.  Transportation  Crescent Beach has two accesses by road to the rest of Surrey (Crescent Road and McBride Avenue) which both cross the BNSF Railway. Implications for emergency access and impact of noise and coal dust from the trains are long-time concerns for residents. From 2002 to 2014, the number of trains quadrupled from five to 20 a day. Public transportation is provided by TransLink bus route 351. The commuter bus service connects Crescent Beach makes a stop at White Rock Centre before travelling north into Richmond. The Crescent Road corridor connects the beach area to King George Boulevard near Nicomekl River. The road is registered with the city and national historic place registries because it enabled transport to pioneer locations (such as Historic Stewart Farm) due to its first construction in 1882 shortly after incorporation of the City of Surrey. Beecher Street, known as the Marine Drive of Crescent Beach, is home to bistros, ice cream cafes and small stores. Boats are also stored at Crescent Beach Marina at the tip of Nicomekl River.  Arts & culture  A 2008 teen novel Reading the Bones by Gina McMurchy-Barber featured 12-year-old heroine Peggy Henderson uncovering an archaeological skull in her uncle's backyard in Crescent Beach.Reading the Bones: A Peggy Henderson Adventure Scenes from the 2010 film Tron: Legacy were filmed along the waterfront at Crescent Beach, with one of the houses there functioning as the home of Kevin and Sam Flynn. In 2012, Beach House Theatre began annual production of Shakespeare plays in August in open-ended tents similar to Vancouver's Bard on the Beach festival. In 2015, Beach House Theatre began performing plays outside of Shakespeare, starting with Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. A season two episode of Better Things was filmed at Crescent Beach in June 2017 near the main swimming area.

The Bordeaux region is naturally divided by the Gironde Estuary into a Left Bank area which includes the M√©doc and Graves and a Right Bank area which includes the Libournais, Bourg and Blaye. The M√©doc is itself divided into Haut-M√©doc (the upstream or southern portion) and Bas-M√©doc (the downstream or northern portion, often referred to simply as \\"M√©doc\\"). There are various sub-regions within the Haut-M√©doc, including St-Est√®phe, Pauillac, St.-Julien and Margaux and the less well known areas of AOC Moulis and Listrac. Graves includes the sub-regions of Pessac-L√©ognan and Sauternes (among others), and Sauternes in turn includes the sub-region of Barsac. The Libournais includes the sub- regions of Saint-√âmilion and Pomerol (among others). There is an additional wine region of Entre-Deux-Mers, so called because it lies between the Garonne and Dordogne rivers, which combine to form the Gironde. This region contains several less well known sweet wine areas of Cadillac and St. Croix de Mont. All of these regions (except the Libournais) have their own appellation and are governed by Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e laws which dictate the permissible grape varieties, alcohol level, methods of pruning and picking, density of planting and appropriate yields as well as various winemaking techniques. Bordeaux wine labels will usually include the region on the front if all the grapes have been harvested in a specific region and the wine otherwise complies with the AOC requirements. There are about 50 AOCs applicable to the Bordeaux region. Both red and white Bordeaux wines are almost invariably blended. The permissible grape varieties in red Bordeaux are: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. While wine making styles vary, a rule of thumb is that the Left Bank is predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon based with the Right Bank being more Merlot based. The Graves area produces both red wine (from the grapes previously mentioned) and white wine from the Sauvignon blanc, S√©millon and Muscadelle grapes. The area of Sauternes (including Barsac) is known for its botrytized dessert wines. Bordeaux wine regions of Gironde department and its appellations Classifications There are a number of classifications of Bordeaux wines, covering different regions. None of these attempts to be a comprehensive classification of all the producers within a given area: rather, only the producers (universally known as ch√¢teaux, although not usually possessing the architectural grandeur that might imply) perceived as being of an unusually high standard are included in the classification. The ch√¢teaux included in the classification are referred to as classed or class√©, and those not included are referred to as unclassed. Some classifications sub-divide the classed ch√¢teaux, according to the perceived quality. On the Left Bank, the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 is the starting point for classification. Although this purports to be a classification of all Bordeaux wine, it in fact exclusively lists red wine producers from the Haut-M√©doc plus Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion of Graves, and (in a separate list) sweet white wine producers from Sauternes (including Barsac). Estates in the M√©doc which were not classified in that listing may be classified under the Cru Bourgeois label. In 1953, a Classification of Graves wine was produced. Although this purports to classify the whole of Graves, it exclusively lists ch√¢teaux in Pessac-L√©ognan. In 1954, a separate classification of Saint-√âmilion wine was set up for this Right Bank region. Generic Bordeaux A dry white Bordeaux made under the generic Bordeaux AOC. There are eight AOCs that cover the entire department of Gironde. Any producer within the region is entitled to use these appellations, whether or not they are also entitled to use a more specific regional appellation. These appellations are: Bordeaux, Bordeaux Sup√©rieur, Bordeaux Sec, Bordeaux Moelleux, Bordeaux Clairet, Cr√©mant-de- Bordeaux, Bordeaux Ros√© and Vin de Pays de l'Atlantique. Where these appellations are used for wines which would otherwise be entitled to use a more specific appellation, they are generally used for wines of lower quality made by a n√©gociant or co-operative. Many of Bordeaux's supermarket brands like Mouton Cadet, Dourthe Numero 1 and Sichel Sirius utilise these generic Bordeaux AOCs.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" pg 67-68 Dorling Kindersley 2005 More than half of Bordeaux's production uses these generic appellations. Red wine produced under the Bordeaux AOC is made mostly from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with the addition of Cabernet Franc and small amounts of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carmen√®re. This appellation covers around 42,600 hectares of vines and produces around 223 million litres of wine (which is nearly a third of the total wine production of Bordeaux). White wine produced under the Bordeaux Sec AOC is made mostly from Sauvignon blanc and S√©millon, with the addition of some Muscadelle, Colombard, Mauzac, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Ugni blanc.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pgs 42-43 Firefly Books 2004 It must contain no more than 4g/l of residual sugar. This appellation covers around 6500 hectares of vines and 38 million litres of wine. If it has more than 4g/l of residual sugar, then it may be labelled as Bordeaux Molleux AOC, but little wine is in fact produced under this AOC. Bordeaux Sup√©rieur AOC covers both red and white wines, and the grapes used are the same, but permitted yields are slightly lower, minimum alcohol content is slightly higher and slightly longer aging is required. The amount of red wine produced under this appellation (around 45 million litres, from 10,000 hectares of vines) is much greater than the amount of white wine produced (around 170,000 litres from 60 hectares). Ros√© wine produced under the Bordeaux Ros√© AOC is made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. As is usual for Ros√©, the grape skins are briefly left in contact with the must, but are removed prior to fermentation. This appellation covers around 4725 hectares of vines and 17 million litres of wine. Bordeaux Clairet AOC is intermediate between red and ros√© wine, and is made from the same grapes as Bordeaux Ros√© but undergoes a longer maceration (between 24 and 48 hours). Production is around 5 million litres from 925 hectares of vines. Note that, although the description 'clairet' may be derived from the English 'claret', 'claret' in fact refers exclusively to red Bordeaux. A small amount of sparkling wine is made in the Bordeaux region, under the appellation Cr√©mant- de-Bordeaux AOC (known before 1990 as Bordeaux Mousseux). This is made using the methode traditionelle from the same grapes as white Bordeaux if white and the same grapes as red Bordeaux if ros√©. The great majority is white, accounting for around 900,000 litres of production, as opposed to 20,000 litres of ros√©. The appellation Vin de Pays de l'Atlantique was introduced in 2006, as a complement to the existing range of Bordeaux appellations, and covers grape varieties not permitted in classic Bordeaux, notably Chardonnay for white wines and Syrah for red wines. Nearly 4 million litres of wine is produced under this appellation, 62% of it red. Left Bank The wine regions of the Left bank of the Gironde estuary are bordered by large coniferous forest land that have a tempering effect on the maritime climate of the area. =The M√©doc= The region spans the left bank of the Gironde from the mouth of the river to the city of Bordeaux and includes the four famous communes of St-Estephe, Pauillac, St. Julien and Margaux. It is about 60 km north to south, and about 10 km wide, with around 10,600 hectares under vines and a production of about 50 million litres per year. All the wine made here is red. The M√©doc appellations * M√©doc AOC * Haut-M√©doc AOC  Saint-Est√®phe AOC  Pauillac AOC  Saint-Julien AOC  Listrac-M√©doc AOC  Moulis-en- M√©doc AOC  Margaux AOC Bas-M√©doc The northern or down-stream part was formerly known as the Bas-M√©doc (lower M√©doc), but is now simply (but confusingly) labeled as M√©doc. This region is some 34 km long, by 10 km wide, stretching from the mouth of the Gironde to St-Est√®phe, and includes some 5800 hectares of vines, producing around 28.5 million litres of wine annually. Although the region does not have any classified growths, there are a number of Crus Bourgeois located in the soft clay soil of the M√©doc. As Merlot favors the clay more than Cabernet Sauvignon, the wines from this region tend to resemble the right bank style of St.-Emilion more than other left bank wines.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 86 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Haut-M√©doc The southern or up-stream part is known as the Haut-M√©doc (upper M√©doc). This region is some 45 km long, by 10 km wide. The total area under vines is around 4800 hectares, producing 22 million litres of wine a year. 6 villages have their own appellations: Margaux, St- Julien, Pauillac, St-Est√®phe, Listrac and Moulis. The remainder is classified simply as Haut-M√©doc. The predominant grape planted here is Cabernet Sauvignon, although before 1800 it was Malbec. =St-Est√®phe= Among the four famous Left Bank communes, St-Est√®phe is the northernmost region with the jalle du Breuil dividing it from Pauillac to the south. The soil of St-Est√®phe is a heavy composite of clay washed ashore from the Gironde. This soil type drains slowly and gives St-Est√®phe estates an advantage during dry summers. The wines produced here tend to have more acidity than other red Bordeaux and with less perfume.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 88 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 While Cabernet Sauvignon is still the dominant grape, this sub-region has more planting of Merlot than any other area in the Haut-M√©doc.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 133 Workman Publishing 2001 St-Est√®phe has five classified estates and numerous Cru Bourgeois. The area is also home to several independent vignerons who produce wine as various co-operatives such as the Marquis de Saint-Est√®phe and Canterayne. The Ch√¢teau Latour tower in Pauillac is featured on every bottle of this First Growth wine =Pauillac= Located south of St-Est√®phe, the area around Pauillac has the highest elevation of the M√©doc with the estates of Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild and Ch√¢teau Pontet-Canet sitting on a summit of 30m. Vineyards in Pauillac are not as fragmented as most of the M√©doc, with entire slopes and plateaus belonging to a single estate.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 90 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The area of Pauillac contains three of the five first growth estates of Bordeaux. These are Ch√¢teau Lafite- Rothschild, Ch√¢teau Latour and Ch√¢teau Mouton Rothschild. It also includes 15 other classed growths. =St-Julien= Situated on two plateaus between Pauillac and Margaux, the wine region of St-Julien has the smallest wine production of the four major regions in the M√©doc. The region is divided into essentially two areas - the riverside estates around the village of St.Julien and the southern estates around the village of Beychevelle where the areas Cru Bourgeois are also grouped.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 92 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The waters of the Gironde estuary have a warming influence on the climate which, coupled with the south-easterly exposure of most vineyards, helps to fully ripen the Cabernet Sauvignon vines in this area.C. Fallis, editor The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine pg 188 Global Book Publishing 2006 St-Julien has the highest proportion of classified estates of all the regions in Bordeaux. These eleven classed growths account for nearly 80 percent of the entire region's wine production. Just to the west of St-Julien is the village of St-Laurent, with three further classed growths: Ch√¢teau La Tour Carnet, Ch√¢teau Belgrave and Ch√¢teau Camensac. Vineyard of Moulis-en-M√©doc =Central M√©doc= This includes the area between St. Julien and Margaux. This area is home to many Crus Bourgeois. Within the Central Medoc there are the appellations Listrac-M√©doc and Moulis-en-M√©doc. Within Moulis, some wines estates near the village of Grand Poujeaux have added that name to their labels. The Listrac appellation is located on a limestone based plateau and produced highly tannic wines that require a bit of aging before they soften.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 94 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 =Margaux= The Margaux appellation encompasses the village of Margaux and the neighboring villages of Arsac, Labarde, Soussans and Cantenac. It is the most southerly of M√©doc's appellations. This region has the thinnest soil in the region with the highest proportion of gravel that allows the soil to drain very well. The wines from this area are very susceptible to weather effects during the growing season and harvest.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 96 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The area is home to more 21 classified growths, more than any other appellation, with numerous second and third growths as well as one first growth, Ch√¢teau Margaux. =Southern M√©doc= The area just south of Margaux is called Southern M√©doc with wines produced in this area using the Haut-M√©doc designation. This area includes the classified growths of Ch√¢teau La Lagune in Ludon and Ch√¢teau Cantemerle in Macau.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 97 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 =Graves= This region is bordered on the north by the Garonne river and contains the sub regions of Pessac-L√©ognan, Sauternes and Barsac. It is known for its intensely gravelly soil.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 98 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The soil is the result glaciers from the Ice Age which also left white quartz deposits that can still be found in the soil of some of the top wine making estates.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 134 Workman Publishing 2001 While Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion was included in the 1855 classification of the M√©doc, the Graves appellation itself was classified in 1953 for its red wine producers. White wine were included in an updated 1959 classification.C. Fallis, editor The Encyclopedic Atlas of Wine pg 194 Global Book Publishing 2006 The Graves is considered the birthplace of claret. In the Middle Ages, the wines that were first exported to England were produced in this area. Ch√¢teau Pape Cl√©ment, founded at the turn of the fourteenth century by the future Pope Clement V, was the first named chateaux in all of Bordeaux. In 1663, Samuel Pepys' mention of Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion was the first recorded mention of French Claret in London.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson Oxford Companion to Wine pg 325 Third Edition Oxford University Press 2006 The Graves appellations * Graves AOC / Graves Sup√©rieures AOC  Pessac-L√©ognan AOC  C√©rons AOC  Sauternes AOC * Barsac AOC Pessac- L√©ognan This area of the Graves, located just south of the city of Bordeaux, is home to the first growth estate Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion, as well as all the 1953 classified Graves Growths, including Ch√¢teau La Mission Haut- Brion and Ch√¢teau Laville Haut-Brion. In addition to wine production, the area is known for its crops of pine trees and vineyards are often separated by rows of forest trees.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 100 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The soil of Pessac-L√©ognan is composed of gravel terraces with sediments from different geological eras. The area received appellation status in 1987 and produces both red and white wines. All of the estates named in the 1959 Graves classification are located in this appellation. Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant grape variety, followed by Merlot and the white wine grapes Sauvignon blanc and S√©millon. The white wines of this area are barrel fermented and aged on their lees. Sauternes and Barsac A Sauternes vineyard Sauternes is a subregion of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as the Premier Cru Sup√©rieur classified Ch√¢teau d'Yquem. Wines produced in the region of Barsac, such as Premiers Crus Ch√¢teau Climens and Ch√¢teau Coutet are allowed to be labeled either with the commune name or with Sauternes. The intense sweetness is the result of the grapes being affected by Botrytis cinerea, a fungus that is commonly known as noble rot. In the autumn, the Ciron river produces mist that descends upon the area and persists until after dawn. These conditions are conducive to the growth of the fungus which desiccates the grape and concentrates the sugars inside. The three main grapes of this area are S√©millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 102 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Production costs for this area's botrytized wines are comparatively high. The evaporation and fungus produce low yields, five to six times less than in other Bordeaux regions. The grapes are normally harvested individually from the bunch with pickers going through the vineyards several times between September and November to ensure that the grapes are picked at their optimal points. The wine is then fermented in small oak barrels, further adding to the cost. Even with half bottles of the First Growths priced at several hundred dollars, these wines still have difficulties turning a profit and in the mid 20th century a string of bad vintages drove many growers in the region out of business. Right Bank =The Libournais= The area of Libournais encompasses much of what is referred to as the Right Bank. Named for its historical capital, Libourne, this area sits on the right bank of the Dordogne river and expands west past the convergence of the Isle river. Further west, after the Garonne and Dordogne rivers meet, the region of Bourg and Blaye is found the right bank of the Garonne. The expression Right Bank typically refers to wines from the Pomerol and St-Emilion areas of Libournais.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 104 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The vineyards of the Libournais are crossed by two rivers, Isle and Barbanne. The Libournais appellations * Saint-√âmilion AOC * Saint-√âmilion Grand Cru AOC * Montagne-Saint-√âmilion AOC * Saint-Georges-Saint-√âmilion AOC * Lussac-Saint-√âmilion AOC * Puisseguin-Saint-√âmilion AOC * Pomerol AOC * Lalande-de-Pomerol AOC * Fronsac AOC * Canon-Fronsac AOC * Castillon - C√¥tes- de-Bordeaux AOC (formerly C√¥tes-de-Castillon AOC), a sub-appellation of C√¥tes- de-Bordeaux AOC * Francs - C√¥tes-de-Bordeaux AOC (formerly Bordeaux Cotes-de- Francs AOC), a sub-appellation of C√¥tes-de-Bordeaux AOC Pomerol The area of Pomerol was first cultivated by the Romans during their occupation of the area. Up until the early 20th century the area was known mostly for its white wine production. This area within Libournais doesn't have a distinct city center with several villages spread across an area about the same size as St.-Julien. The area overall has gravel-based soil that is typical of Bordeaux, with western and southern sections having more sandy soil while the northern and eastern sections toward St.-Emilion have more clay composition.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 106 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The wines of Pomerol have a high composition of Merlot in their blends and are considered the gentlest and least tannic and acidic of Bordeaux wines. Cabernet Franc, known in this area as Bouchet is the second leading grape and helps to contribute to the dark, deep coloring that is typical of Pomerol wines. Due to the reduced tannins found in these wines, they can typically be drunk much younger than other red Bordeaux. The chateaux in the area are not classified, with the winemakers seemingly disinclined to devise one, although Ch√¢teau P√©trus is often unofficially grouped with the First Growths of Bordeaux. Saint-√âmilion Saint-√âmilion The wine region of Saint-√âmilion centres on the commune of the same name. There are several villages around the region that share the Saint-√âmilion name, such as Montagne-Saint-√âmilion and St-Georges-Saint-√âmilion, and are permitted to label their wines under the same name. The area is bordered to the west by Pomerol. Merlot is the dominant grape in this area, followed by Cabernet Franc. The climate and damper, cool soils of the area makes it difficult for Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to fully ripen and as such is less often used. The wines take a little longer to mature than the ones in Pomerol but are still able to be drunk relatively young for a Bordeaux (4‚Äì8 years). In favorable vintages the wines have a good aging potential.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 108 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Saint-√âmilion wines were first classified in 1878 and have been continuously revised with the most recent revision occurring in 2006. Chateaux are divided into two First Growth classifications ‚Äì Premiers Grands Crus Class√©s A, which currently includes Ch√¢teau Ausone and Ch√¢teau Cheval Blanc, and Premiers Grands Crus Class√©s B, which currently includes 13 chateaux such as Ch√¢teau Ang√©lus and Ch√¢teau Figeac. Below the Premiers crus are the Grands Crus Class√©s which currently includes 55 chateaux. Estates can apply for classification by passing two tasting panels. Vineyards in Saint-√âmilion =Bourg and Blaye= The Garonne and Dordogne rivers meet near Bourg North of Libournais, this area sits on the Right Bank of the Garonne and Dordogne rivers and is one of the oldest wine producing regions in Bordeaux, exporting wine long before the M√©doc was even planted. Merlot is the main grape of the area followed by Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The area around Bourg also has sizable Sauvignon blanc planting for sparkling wines and Ugni blanc for cognac.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 111 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 The Blayais-Bourgeais appellations * Blaye AOC * Blaye-C√¥tes-de-Bordeaux AOC (formerly Premi√®res-c√¥tes-de-Blaye AOC), a sub-appellation of C√¥tes-de-Bordeaux AOC * C√¥tes-de-Bourg C√¥tes-de- Bourg Historians date the first vineyards from the 2nd century AD, when the Romans planted the first ‚ÄúVitis Biturica‚Äù. The appellation has a range of gravel, alluvium, clay and limestone soils. The wine from C√¥tes-de-Bourg is mostly red made from a combination of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc grapes. There is only a small amount of white wine made from Ugni blanc and Colombard grapes. There are around 200 Chateaux producers in the appellation including Chateau Bujan, Chateau Roc de Cambes, Chateau Nodoz, Chateau Fougas Maldoror, Chateau Falfas, Chateau Civrac, Chateau Tayac, Macay, Chateau Rousette, Chateau Haut Maco, Chateau Guiraud. Pascal Meli shows us the entrance to his cellar at Chateau Bujan in the Cotes de Bourg, Bordeaux, France. Entre-Deux-Mers A white Bordeaux from the Entre-Deux-Mers region. Entre-deux-mers (literally, between two seas) is a dry white wine made in Bordeaux. The appellation is one of the largest in the Bordeaux region and is situated between the Garonne and the Dordogne (which are actually considered inland seas). The area is responsible for three quarters of the red wine sold under the generic Bordeaux AOC or Bordeaux sup√©rieur labels.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 82 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 =The Entre-Deux-Mers appellations= * Entre-Deux-Mers AOC * Graves de Vayres AOC * Premi√®res C√¥tes de Bordeaux AOC (now merged into C√¥tes-de- Bordeaux AOC) * Cadillac AOC * Loupiac AOC * Sainte-Croix-du-Mont AOC * Bordeaux-Haut-Benauge AOC * Entre-Deux-Mers Haut-Benauge AOC * C√¥tes-de- Bordeaux-Saint-Macaire AOC * Sainte-Foy-Bordeaux AOC See also *French wine *History of Bordeaux wine References External links * Bordeaux.com Conseil Interprofessionnel du Vin de Bordeaux (CIVB) * Bordeaux wine map * Bordeaux wine discovery * Bordeaux wine guide * Acad√©mie du vin de Bordeaux * Map of The Bordeaux Wine Regions Category:Bordeaux wine Category:Bordeaux AOCs ","title":"Bordeaux wine regions"},{"id":"10695510","text":"Scar literature or literature of the wounded () is a genre of Chinese literature which emerged in the late 1970s during the \\"Boluan Fanzheng\\" period, soon after the death of Mao Zedong, portraying the sufferings of cadres and intellectuals during the tragic experiences of the Cultural Revolution and the rule of the Gang of Four.Chen 1996: 160  Historical background  During the Boluan Fanzheng period, the growth of scar literature corresponded with the Beijing Spring, a period of greater openness in Chinese society; scar literature has even been described as a \\"second Hundred Flowers Movement\\".Watson 1992: 107-108 Though scar literature focuses on trauma and oppression, and has been described as largely negative, love and faith remained its major themes; its practitioners were typically not opposed to Communism, but on the converse retained faith in the ability of the Party to rectify past tragedies, and \\"embraced love as a key to solving social problems\\".Liu 2003: 24 Regardless, though their writing was hailed as marking a revival of the tradition of socialist realism in the arts, it in fact represented a break from that tradition, as it was no longer subject to party control, and was not under an obligation to serve the purpose of political education for the masses.Chen 1996: 161  Examples  The first exemplar of the genre is generally agreed to be Lu Xinhua's 1978 story \\"Scar\\", which attacked official hypocrisy and corruption.Chen et al. 2004: xiv-xvii Liu Xinwu's 1977 short story \\"The Class Monitor\\" () has also been described as the pioneer of scar literature, though this assessment is disputed.Xie 2000 Most of the representative authors were in their thirties and forties at the time; they worked as salaried writers and editors, and published their works in state-sponsored literary journals.Siu and Stern 1983: xxxviii The moral outrage they expressed in their works resonated with the public, contributing to its popularity.Watson 1992: 106 Not all works by authors who lived through the Cultural Revolution can be classified as scar literature. Zhang Chengzhi in particular is notable for his idealism regarding his experiences during the Cultural Revolution; his works such as Black Steed and Rivers of the North have been described as rebuttals to the \\"negativism of scar literature\\".McDougall and Louie: 395-396  Responses  However, scar literature did not entirely receive a free pass from the Party establishment; due to its criticisms of the Communist Party and of Mao himself, as well as its exposure of social problems, it came under attack by conservatives as early as 1979. Events such as the trial of Wei Jingsheng signalled writers that there were limits to the open discussion of the past errors of the Party, and after the end of the trial of the Gang of Four, the political climate chilled significantly.Berry 2004: 92-93 Eventually, the government began to crack down on scar literature as part of a wider campaign against \\"bourgeois liberalism\\".Harding 1987: 188 Deng Xiaoping himself provided major support for the campaign, even though his return to Chinese politics after his earlier disgrace and his political victory over rival Hua Guofeng relied heavily on the repudiation of Maoism inherent in scar literature, and its influence on public opinion. The campaign against scar literature was itself unusual in that, unlike earlier campaigns against liberalism, official criticisms were generally limited to attacks on its content, rather than denunciations of individuals.White 1998: 166-168  See also  * Cultural Revolution * Boluan Fanzheng * Reform and Opening-up References =Notes= =Sources=    * Category:Chinese literary genres Category:Cultural Revolution Category:Literary genres Category:Cold War history of China ","title":"Scar literature"},{"id":"10695532","text":"Thomas R. \\"Tom\\" Galligan (born August 6, 1946)U.S. Public Records Index Vol 1 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010. is a former three-term mayor of Jeffersonville, Indiana, United States, serving from 1996 to 2003 and again from 2008 to 2011.

Its world premiere, at an outdoor shopping centre in Cardiff on 27 March 1993, was accompanied by a nine-piece band conducted by Carlo Rizzi, director of Welsh National Opera. The performance, sung by soprano Rhian Owen and baritone Dominic Burns, was timed at 4 minutes 9 seconds, and was certified by adjudicators from the Guinness Book of Records as the world's shortest opera, beating the previous record held by Darius Milhaud's Deliverance of Theseus (1928), which lasts just over 7 minutes. A later performance for the BBC reduced the overall time to 3 minutes 34 seconds. In 2019, Sands of Time was performed in a triple bill (with Samuel Barber's A Hand of Bridge and Jacques Offenbach's Le 66) at the Grimeborn Festival, Dalston, London. Scenario The opera's two protagonists are Stan and Flo, a married couple who quarrel during breakfast. They are interrupted by a knock on the door from which they learn that they have won a large sum of money on the football pools, and are reconciled. The duration of the opera is that required to boil an egg, which is placed in the pan at the start and removed as the opera ends. Form Despite its brevity the work, which consists of eight identifiable numbers, contains in condensed form the traditional elements of classical opera: an overture, opening chorus, arias, recitative and a finale. There is a notable influence of 19th century Italian opera in Stan's aria \\"Down with a splash of cologne\\", which references the heroic tenor style of Verdi's Il trovatore. In the middle section of the work there is a short, rapid patter-song, reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan. According to Reynolds, \\"the intention was to create a piece which bore the same relationship to opera as a miniature does to a full-length portrait\\". The work has not been published, though it has been performed at regular intervals. It was written in a single evening; Reynolds admitted embarrassment over the state of the only copy of the score: \\"I didn‚Äôt produce the neatest score in the world\\", he said.

Founded in 1874 by German settlers in the area of the now- defunct town of Siegel. The church has been in continuous operation and remains active, although the membership has declined from its high in the 1920s. History of the church German settlers in the area of Siegel formed St. Paul's Lutheran Church of Siegel, in 1872. When differences arose either over a conflict concerning the burial of one of the members of that church or due to dogmatic differences between adherents of the Lutheran church and those of the German Evangelical Synod of North America, 18 members under the leadership of Reverend P. Hagemann broke away to form St. John's Church of Siegel on February 22, 1874. The first pastor was Rev. David Kurz. The founding members secured a plot in Douglas Township in Bremer County on which they proceeded to build a church with living quarters for the minister in the rear and cemetery. In 1889, during the tenure of Rev. John Reinecke, the church built a separate parsonage. In 1897, a schoolhouse was built to the south of the church and parsonage. In 1922, the current church building was dedicated and in 1924, the church celebrated its 50th anniversary. The current parsonage was built in 1925. The church was originally affiliated with the German Evangelical Synod of North America, which joined with another denomination of German background, the Reformed Church in the United States, to form the Evangelical and Reformed Church in 1934. This church united in 1957 with the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches to form the United Church of Christ. At its largest, the church had a membership of almost 400 members in the 1920s. Today St. John's Church has about 80 members and an active Christian education program. The pastor is the Rev. Eugene Walther, a native of the area, who was called to the church in 1973. List of pastors *Rev. David Kurz * Rev. Christopher Siegel *Rev. John Reinecke *Rev. J. Fischer *Rev.

Lambert, for whom the hall is named. History On July 31, 1927, the church held the ground-breaking ceremony and the cornerstone was laid. Many Houston celebrities took part, including: Mayor Oscar F. Holcombe; Dr. Edison E. Oberholtzer, Superintendent of Public Schools and founder/President of the University of Houston; and pastors from other local churches. On October 23, 1927, the building was dedicated. Present were architect C. N. Nelson and contractor P. H. Fredericks. The building had been erected at a cost of $39,904.30, an amount that included the pews, art glass and lighting fixtures. Heights Christian Church built its new sanctuary, next door to Lambert Hall, in 1967. After that year, Lambert Hall became available for community events. For several years Lambert Hall was home for the Heights Museum, now in the fire station on 11th Street. Opera in the Heights Opera in the Heights, a non-profit, professional regional opera company, held its first Gala Opera Evening, a Fledermaus Party, in Lambert Hall on April 12, 1996. A few days later, an arsonist set fire to Lambert Hall, having poured flammables onto the piano and the backstage storage. A neighbor, Marie Campos, saw the fire in the early morning, and called the fire department, which arrived in minutes and saved the building. Opera in the Heights held its next performance, a Gala II Concert, on May 11, 1996, in Lambert Hall, with a curtain hanging over fire damaged wall. Clean-up was financed by this benefit concert, a dinner party, and the sweat of church members, Opera in the Heights company members and neighbors. The restoration was done by Opera in the Heights Board member Theo Bashshiti and his construction crews. Since 1996, Opera in the Heights and Heights Christian Church have worked together to renovate Lambert Hall. By fall of 2004, Lambert Hall was renewed and beautified with new floor surfaces, a rebuilt air conditioner, new seats ‚Äì and restoring the beautiful stained glass windows. New lighting and sound equipment were installed in 2005. Grants from Houston Endowment Inc. have been instrumental in making Lambert Hall the architectural gem it is today. Opera in the Heights provides professional opportunities for opera's rising stars, allowing them the coveted opportunity to sing a leading role under the direction of a talented maestro and director. Mission: Opera in the Heights, a regional, professional company, exists to provide a stage for emerging opera performers and to bring affordable opera to the Greater Houston Area. UpStage Theatre Upstage Theatre was a performing arts tenant at Lambert Hall from December 2005 until August 2015. In December 2005 UpStage Theatre produced its first show at Lambert Hall with the original holiday musical, Santa's Magic Timepiece. Thus dawned a new era for UpStage and Lambert Hall, welcoming this family-friendly theatre company to the beautiful venue. UpStage, founded in 2000, launched a full season of Evening and Young Audience Series productions in 2006 and adopted Lambert Hall as its new home. UpStage produced wonderful classics such as The Sunshine Boys, Plaza Suite, The Odd Couple; musical delights such as Buddy, The Buddy Holly Story and Back to the 80's; and fabulous entertainment for the young and young-at- heart with Cinderella, Hans Christian Andersen, and Too Many Beagles!.

History The building was constructed in 1892 as the ' (People's Theater on the Pfauen Square) with a Bavarian beer garden and a bowling alley. It served initially as a music hall or vaudeville stage. In 1901 the building was rented by the director of the Z√ºrich Opera House and opened as a play house with Goethe's comedy ' (The Accomplices). From 1903 until 1926 the play house was run by a private cooperative. In 1926 Z√ºrich wine wholesaler and play house director Ferdinand Rieser acquired the house and had it renovated. Then in 1938 it was leased to the ', a company founded by the city of Z√ºrich in order to save the theater from its financial difficulties.

However, the effort to establish an ambitious theater in Z√ºrich met with little success at first, and until 1933 the theater was rarely thought of outside of Switzerland. After the rise of the Nazis in 1933, however, many important actors and directors immigrated to Switzerland from Germany and Austria. With the help of these artists, the theater achieved great success, staging many anti-fascist works, importantly the world-premiers of several plays by Bertolt Brecht. During this time the was the largest free stage in the German-speaking world, as stages in Germany and Austria were strictly regulated. After the war, the theater retained its important place in world and German-language theater. During this time it saw world premiers of such important playwrights as Max Frisch, Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt, Carl Zuckmayer, Georges Schehad√©, Botho Strau√ü and Yasmina Reza. Established in 1959, the Theater am Hechtplatz served for a short time as a second stage.

It stands in the middle of the market place in the old center of Heidelberg not far from the Heidelberg Castle. The steeple of the church, rising above the roofs, dominates the town. Early history The Church of the Holy Spirit is first mentioned in a manuscript from 1239. In 1398, the foundations of the current late Gothic church were laid on the site of a late Romanesque basilica which, in turn, had been erected in the place of an even older church. Thus the current church is the third sacral building on the site. Construction The church from the Heiligenberg Documents name Arnold Rype, who was also mayor of Heidelberg for a time, as the master builder. In the usage of the time, the term \\"master builder\\" referred not to the architect but the financial coordinator. The only known architects during the church's construction are Hans Marx, who worked on the church until 1426, as well as Jorg, who was responsible until 1439. Both men probably supervised work on the nave. Under the reign of Prince-elector Frederick I a noted specialist in the construction of church towers, Niclaus Eseler, came from Mainz to Heidelberg and was probably responsible for the execution of the primary work on the spire of the Church of the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, the steeple was completed by Lorenz Lechler. Stages of construction The construction lasted for some one hundred and fifty years. The Choir was consecrated in 1411 and the nave was finished in 1441. Probably in the same year the construction of the steeple was started. The work was interrupted until 1508 and the tower was finished in 1544. In 1709, after the church had been set on fire by the French during the War of the Palatinian Succession, it was rebuilt and received a baroque spire. Use The interior of the church In the 14th century, the Church of the Holy Spirit took over as parish church from St. Peter's Church, which became the university church for the University of Heidelberg. Originally, the Church of the Holy Spirit contained the tombs of the Palatinate electors but they were destroyed by fire during the War of the Palatine Succession. Today only the tomb of Prince-Elector Rupert III, the founder of the church, is still preserved. The exterior of the church. The building on the right in the background is the famous Hotel zum Ritter The famous Palatine Library, the Bibliotheca Palatina, was founded and at first kept in the gallery of the Church of the Holy Spirit, where good light for reading was available. During the Thirty Years War from 1618 to 1648, this collection of manuscripts and early printed books was taken as booty by Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria and presented to the Pope. Of the approximately 5,000 books and 3,524 manuscripts taken, a mere 885 were eventually returned in 1816. The rest form the Bibliotheca Palatina section of the Vatican Library. For the University Jubilee, many of these books were briefly brought back and displayed in Heidelberg. The apsidal end with fountain, surrounded by bookstalls and caf√©s In the course of its history, the Church of the Holy Spirit was used by both Catholics and Protestants, even simultaneously. Starting in 1706, a partition was inserted so that both congregations could hold their services without any mutual disturbance. In 1720, Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine came into conflict with the town's Protestants as a result of fully handing over the Church of the Holy Spirit to the Catholics. Karl Philip gave way, due to pressure from Prussia, the Dutch Republic, and Sweden and repartitioned the wall. In 1936 the separating wall was removed and the church is now exclusively Protestant (Protestant Church in Baden). At the beginning of the 1970s, the steps at the rear of the Church of the Holy Spirit were popular with the Hippies and the Flower Power movement and became a tourist attraction during this time. In 1972, a rock concert by Werner Pieper and the English band Quintessence was organised in the church and attended by students and Hippies alike.

Built 1892-1929 for a congregation founded in 1867, it was the first major commission of architect Ralph Adams Cram, a major influence in the development of early 20th-century Gothic church and secular architecture. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and is protected by a preservation easement held by Historic New England. Architecture All Saints is located in southern Dorchester, a short walk from the Ashmont station of the MBTA Red Line. It occupies a parcel bounded on three sides by Ashmont, Bushnell, and Lombard Streets. The main body of the church is essentially a long rectangle, with several small projection the sides, and a larger eastern projection at the southern end, joining it to the parish house. At the northern end is a large square tower with buttressed corners and a parapeted top. The front of the tower has a large stained glass window, below which an extended entrance vestibule projects forward. The church is built out of rough-face Quincy granite, with trim that is a light colored sandstone from Nova Scotia. The interior is richly decorated with Gothic features, and includes wood carvings of Johannes Kirchmayer, stone carvings by John Evans (a noted Welsh sculptor who worked on later Cram projects), and stained glass by Charles Jay Connick, another Cram friend and collaborator. Douglass Shand Tucci said of the church: \\"Architect Ralph Adams Cram's first church, designed in partnership with Bertram Goodhue, was All Saints ‚Äî Ashmont. A significant landmark in American architectural history, All Saints is, of its type, Cram and Goodhue's masterpiece, and a model for American parish church architecture for the first half of the 20th century.\\" History The parish began in 1867 as a mission of nearby St. Mary's Church. The cornerstone for current structure was laid in November 1892, and the congregation held its first services in the new edifice December 27, 1893. Construction was financed largely through the generosity of Colonel Oliver Peabody, one of the founders of Kidder, Peabody & Co., but was not substantially completed until 1929, when the side chapels were added.

NOD2 plays an important role in the immune system. It recognizes bacterial molecules (peptidoglycans) and stimulates an immune reaction. NOD2 is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor, which is similar in structure to resistant proteins of plants and recognizes molecules containing the specific structure called muramyl dipeptide (MDP) that is found in certain bacteria.  Structure  NOD2 protein model consisting two N-terminal CARD domains (red) connected via helical linker (blue) with central NOD domain (green). At C-terminus LRR domain (cyan) is located The C-terminal portion of the protein contains a leucine-rich repeat domain that is known to play a role in protein‚Äìprotein interactions. The middle part of the protein is characterized by a NOD domain involved in protein self-oligomerization. The N-terminal portion contains two CARD domains known to play a role in apoptosis and NF-Œ∫B activation pathways.  Function  This gene is a member of the NOD1/Apaf-1 family (also known as NOD-like receptor family) and encodes a protein with two caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) and eleven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). The protein is primarily expressed in the peripheral blood leukocytes. It plays a role in the immune response by recognizing the bacterial molecules which possess the muramyl dipeptide (MDP) moiety and activating the NF-Œ∫B protein.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene have been associated with Crohn's disease, Blau syndrome, severe pulmonary sarcoidosis and Graft-versus-host disease. The NOD2 gene is linked to inflammatory diseases such as Inflammatory bowel disease/Crohn's disease and Blau syndrome.  Interactions  NOD2 has been shown to interact with NLRC4. NOD2 has also been shown to bind to MAVS in response to ssRNA or viral RNA treatment and activate the IFN response.

The string sections are at the front of the orchestra, arrayed in a semicircle around the conductor's podium. The string section is composed of bowed instruments belonging to the violin family. It normally consists of first and second violins, violas, cellos, and double basses. It is the most numerous group in the typical Classical orchestra. In discussions of the instrumentation of a musical work, the phrase \\"the strings\\" or \\"and strings\\" is used to indicate a string section as just defined. An orchestra consisting solely of a string section is called a string orchestra. Smaller string sections are sometimes used in jazz, pop and rock music and in the pit orchestras of musical theatre. Seating arrangement One possible seating arrangement for an orchestra. First violins are labelled \\"Vln I\\"; second violins are \\"Vln II\\"; violas are \\"Vla\\"; and double basses (in German \\"Kontrab√§sse\\") are \\"Kb\\". The most common seating arrangement in the 2000s is with first violins, second violins, violas and cello sections arrayed clockwise around the conductor, with basses behind the cellos on the right.Stanley Sadie's Music Guide, p. 56 (Prentice-Hall 1986). Nicolas Slonimsky described the cellos-on-the-right arrangement as part of a 20th-century \\"sea change\\" (Lectionary of Music, p. 342 (McGraw-Hill 1989). The first violins are led by the concertmaster (leader in the UK); each of the other string sections also has a principal player (principal second violin, principal viola, principal cello and principal bass) who play the orchestral solos for the section, lead entrances and, in some cases, determine the bowings for the section (the concertmaster/leader may set the bowings for all strings, or just for the upper strings). The principal string players sit at the front of their section, closest to the conductor and on the row of performers which is closest to the audience. In the 19th century it was standard (1948). \\"Orchestra\\" in Encyclopedia Americana, . to have the first and second violins on opposite sides (violin I, cello, viola, violin II), rendering obvious the crossing of their parts in, for example, the opening of the finale to Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony. If space or numbers are limited, cellos and basses can be put in the middle, violins and violas on the left (thus facing the audience) and winds to the right; this is the usual arrangement in orchestra pits.Gassner, \\"Dirigent und Ripienist\\" (Karlsruhe 1844). Rousseau's Dictionnaire de musique (1768), however, has a figure showing second violins facing the audience and principals facing the singers, reflecting the concertmaster's former role as conductor. The seating may also be specified by the composer, as in B√©la Bart√≥k's Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta, which uses antiphonal string sections, one on each side of the stage. In some cases, due to space constraints (as with an opera pit orchestra) or other issues, a different layout may be used. =\\"Desks\\" and divisi= In a typical stage set-up, the first and second violins, violas and cellos are seated by twos, a pair of performers sharing a stand being called a \\"desk\\", Each principal (or section leader) is usually on the \\"outside\\" of the first desk, that is, closest to the audience. When the music calls for subdivision of the players the normal procedure for such divisi passages is that the \\"outside\\" player of the desk (the one closer to the audience) takes the upper part, the \\"inside\\" player the lower, but it is also possible to divide by alternating desks, the favored method in threefold divisi.Norman del Mar: Anatomy of the Orchestra (University of California Press, 1981) weighs the various merits in the chapter \\"Platform planning\\", pp.49- The \\"inside\\" player typically turns the pages of the part, while the \\"outside\\" player continues playing. In cases where a page turn occurs during an essential musical part, modern performers may photocopy some of the music to enable the page turn to take place during a less important place in the music. There are more variations of set-up with the double bass section, depending on the size of the section and the size of the stage. The basses are commonly arranged in an arc behind the cellos, either standing or sitting on high stools, usually with two players sharing a stand; though occasionally, due to the large width of the instrument, it is found easier for each player to have their own stand. There are not usually as many basses as cellos, so they are either in one row, or for a larger section, in two rows, with the second row behind the first. In some orchestras, some or all of the string sections may be placed on wooden risers, which are platforms that elevate the performers. Numbers and proportions The size of a string section may be expressed with a formula of the type (for example) 10-10-8-10-6, designating the number of first violins, second violins, violas, cellos, and basses. The numbers can vary widely: Wagner in Die Walk√ºre specifies 16-16-12-12-8; the band orchestra in Darius Milhaud's La cr√©ation du monde is 1-1-0-1-1.\\"Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra\\" (program notes), Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, 1999, TheSPCO.org webpage: SPCO-98 In general, music from the Baroque period (ca. 1600-1750) and the Classical period (ca. 1720-1800) used (and is often played in the modern era with) smaller string sections. During the Romantic period (ca. 1800-1910), string sections were significantly enlarged to produce a louder, fuller string sound that could match the loudness of the large brass sections used in orchestral music from this period. During the modern era, some composers requested smaller string sections. In some regional orchestras, amateur orchestras and youth orchestras, the string sections may be relatively small, due to the challenges of finding enough string players. The music for a string section is not necessarily written in five parts; besides the variants discussed below, in classical orchestras the 'quintet' is often called a 'quartet', with basses and cellos playing together. =Double bass section= The role of the double bass section evolved considerably during the 19th century. In orchestral works from the classical era, the bass and cello would typically play from the same part, labelled \\"Bassi\\".Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, online edition, article \\"Orchestra\\", section 6. Given the pitch range of the instruments, this means that if a double bassist and a cellist read the same part, the double bass player would be doubling the cello part an octave lower. While passages for cellos alone (marked \\"senza bassi\\") are common in Mozart and Haydn, independent parts for both instruments become frequent in Beethoven and Rossini and common in later works of Verdi and Wagner. Variants =String section without violins= In Haydn's oratorio The Creation, the music to which God tells the newly created beasts to be fruitful and multiply achieves a rich, dark tone by its setting for divided viola and cello sections with violins omitted. Famous works without violins include the 6th of the Brandenburg Concerti by Bach, Second Serenade of Brahms, the opening movement of Brahms's Ein Deutsches Requiem, Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem, and Philip Glass's opera Akhnaten. Faur√©'s original versions of his Requiem and Cantique de Jean Racine were without violin parts, there being parts for 1st and 2nd viola, and for 1st and 2nd cello; though optional violin parts were added later by publishers. Some orchestral works by Giacinto Scelsi omit violins, using only the lower strings. =String section without violas= =String section without violins or violas= Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms has no parts for violins or violas.Paul Griffiths, Stravinsky (London: J. M. Dent & Sons Ltd, 1992): 104. =Third violins= Richard Strauss' Elektra (1909) and Josephslegende, the third movement of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 and some of George Handel's coronation anthems, are notable examples of the violins being divided threefold. In other musical genres \\"String section\\" is also used to describe a group of bowed string instruments used in rock, pop, jazz and commercial music. In this context the size and composition of the string section is less standardised, and usually smaller, than a classical complement.

Top to bottom: Supralateral arc, thumb Circumzenithal arc, Supralateral arc, Parry arc, and Upper tangent arc, in Salem, Massachusetts, Oct 27, 2012. A supralateral arc is a comparatively rare member of the halo family which in its complete form appears as a large, faintly rainbow-colored band in a wide arc above the sun and appearing to encircle it, at about twice the distance as the familiar 22¬∞ halo. In reality, however, the supralateral arc does not form a circle and never reaches below the sun. When present, the supralateral arc touches the (much more common) circumzenithal arc from below. As in all colored halos, the arc has its red side directed towards the sun, its blue part away from it. Formation Supralateral arcs form when sun light enters horizontally oriented, rod-shaped hexagonal ice crystals through a hexagonal base and exits through one of the prism sides. Supralateral arcs occur about once a year. Confusion with the 46¬∞ halo Due to its apparent circular shape and nearly identical location in the sky, the supralateral arc is often mistaken for the 46¬∞ halo, which does form a complete circle around the sun at approximately the same distance, but which is much rarer and fainter. Distinguishing between the two phenomena can be difficult, requiring the combination of several subtle indicators for proper identification. In contrast to the static 46¬∞ halo, the shape of a supralateral arc varies with the elevation of the sun. Before the sun reaches 15¬∞, the bases of the arc touch the lateral (oriented sidewise) sides of the 46¬∞ halo. As the sun rises from 15¬∞ to 27¬∞, the supralateral arc almost overlaps the upper half of the 46¬∞ halo, which is why many reported observations of the latter most likely are observations of the former. As the sun goes from 27¬∞ to 32¬∞, the apex of the arc touches the circumzenithal arc centered on zenith (as does the 46¬∞ halo when the sun is located between 15¬∞ and 27¬∞). In addition, the supralateral arc is always located above the parhelic circle (the arc located below it is the infralateral arc), and is never perfectly circular. (Including a photo from January 1996, a 1980 computer simulation of a supralateral arc relative to a 46¬∞ halo, and a table pinning down differences between 46¬∞ halos and supralateral arcs.) Arguably the best way of distinguishing the halo from the arc is to carefully study the difference in colour and brightness.

West Mount Barren, along with East Mount Barren and Mid-Mount Barren were all named by Matthew Flinders in 1802 after their barren appearance. Description West Mount Barren rises 372 metres above sea level and forms part of the Barren Range within the national park. Mount Bland (320 metres) is the closest mountain feature and is situated approximately 5 km northeast from West Mount Barren. The Barren range is not continuous and although there are three distinct Mount Barrens (West, Mid and East) they are distinct peaks that are connected by coastal plain. Mid Mount Barren is approximately 20 km northeast of West Mount Barren and East Mount Barren is approximately 50 km northeast of West Mount Barren. Other peaks in the area include Woolbernup Hill, Thumb Peak, Mt Drummond and Mt Maxwell. West Mount Barren is accessible by an unsealed road suitable for 2WD vehicles that runs off Pabelup Drive. A carpark with a plaque at the base of the mountain marks the beginning of a track that is an easy two hour return walk to the summit. Visitors are encouraged to stay on the footpath so as to minimise the spread of dieback which is a threat to the native plants of the area. A commanding view of the national park and the coastline is seen from the summit. Geology The Ravensthorpe region is underlain by basement rocks of the Albany-Fraser Orogen and Yilgarn Craton. These rocks consist of granite, gneiss and minor enclaves of sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The Barren Ranges consist of metasediments, mostly folded and faulted quartzite, phyllite, dolomite and conglomerate.Johnson, S.L. (1998). Hydrogeology of the Ravensthorpe 1:250,000 Sheet: Western Australia, Hydrogeological Map Explanatory Notes Series, Report HM 4, Water and Rivers Commission, East Perth, Western Australia. The Barrens are composed of rock beds that have been tilted and folded. These rock beds were once layers of sand deposited on the sea floor. They were subsequently compressed, heated and uplifted by movements of the Earth's crust. Botany The vegetation surrounding West Mount Barren is best described as scrub-heath with many types of shrubs that thrive in the quartzitic or lateritic sand, often in rocky situations. The shrubs are mostly Proteaceae and Myrtaceae. Several species are unique to the area and can be found on and around West Mount Barren. Species include Royal Hakea (Hakea victoria), Qualup Bells (Pimelea physodes), Oval-leaf Adenanthos (Adenanthos ellipticus), Blue Dampiera (Dampiera linearis), Silver-leafed Barrens regalia (Regelia velutina), Barrens clawflower (Calothamnus validus), and the Broad- leaved Brown Pea (Bossiaea ornata).George, A.S. (1974). Five new species of Adenanthos (Proteaceae) from Western Australia. in Nuytsia 1(4):381-386.  Fire  The area around West Mount Barren is often burnt out by bush fires. Lightning strikes are the most usual cause of fires that often devastate large areas of the park. The last large scale fire was in December 2006 where four fires, that were started by lightning strikes, joined into one much larger blaze that burned out several hectares of bushland.

Three Ages The Three Ages of Buddhism are three divisions of time following Buddha's passing:Marra, Michele (1988). The development of mapp≈ç thought in Japan (I), Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 15 (1), 25. PDF # Former Day of the Law‚Äîalso known as the Age of the Right Dharma (; Jp: sh≈çb≈ç), the first thousand years (or 500 years) during which the Buddha's disciples are able to uphold the Buddha's teachings; # Middle Day of the Law‚Äîalso known as the Age of Semblance Dharma (; Jp: z≈çh≈ç), the second thousand years (or 500 years), which only resembles the right Dharma; # Latter Day of the Law‚Äîalso known as the Degenerate Age (; m√≤f«é; Jp: mapp≈ç), which is to last for 10,000 years during which the Dharma declines. In the Sutra of the Great Assembly (Skt. Mahasamnipata Sutra) (Jpn. Daijuku-ky≈ç), the three periods are further divided into five five-hundred year periods (‰∫î‰∫îÁôæÊ≠≥ Cn: w«î w«î b«éi s√πi; Jp: go no gohyaku sai), the fifth and last of which was prophesied to be when the Buddhism of Shakyamuni Buddha would lose all power of salvation and a new Buddha would appear to save the people. This time period would be characterized by unrest, strife, famine, and natural disasters.Marra, Michele (1988). The development of mapp≈ç thought in Japan (I), Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 15 (1), 26-27. PDF The three periods are significant to Mahayana adherents, particularly those who hold the Lotus Sutra in high regard, namely the Tiantai and Tendai and Nichiren Buddhism, who believe that different Buddhist teachings are valid (i.e., able to lead practitioners to enlightenment) in each period due to the different capacity to accept a teaching (Ê©üÊ†π Cn: jƒ´gƒìn; Jp: kikon) of the people born in each respective period. Latter Day of the Law Traditionally, this age is supposed to begin 2000 years after Shakyamuni Buddha's passing and last for 10,000 years or more. Shakyamuni, in the Sutra of the Great Assembly (Jpn. Daijuku-ky≈ç), describes the Latter Day of the Law (Jpn. Mappo) as \\"the age of conflict\\", when ‚ÄúQuarrels and disputes will arise among the adherents to my teachings, and the Pure Law will become obscured and lost.‚Äù In this evil latter age, when society is disordered, Shakyamuni's Buddhism will lose its power to benefit the people, as people born into the Latter Day of the Law, do not have the seed of Buddhahood sown into them. In the Lotus Sutra (Jpn. My≈çh≈ç-Renge-Ky≈ç), Shakyamuni Buddha entrusted the propagation of the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of the Law to Bodhisattva Superior Practices (Jpn. Jogyo Bosatsu), the leader of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth. Shakyamuni predicted in the 21st Chapter of the Lotus Sutra (jinriki), that the Votary of the Lotus Sutra would appear in the Latter Day of the Law, dispel the fundamental darkness of all mankind, and lead the people to attain enlightenment. The Nichiren Shoshu school of Buddhism, believes that Nichiren Daishonin is votary of the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of the Law. Shakyamuni declared that the Votary of the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of the Law would be \\"spoken ill of and cursed\\", \\"would be wounded by swords and staves and pelted with stones and tiles\\" and \\"again and again banished.\\" Nichiren Shoshu states that Nichiren Daishonin's actions matched the prediction that Shakyamuni Buddha taught. They cite the Izu and Sado Exile (\\"again and again banished\\") and the Tatsunokuchi Persecution where the government attempted to execute the Daishonin (\\"wounded by swords and staves\\") for propagating the Lotus Sutra (Jpn. My≈çh≈ç-Renge-Ky≈ç) throughout Japan. Thus, the Shoshu states that Nichiren Daishonin proved he was the votary of the Lotus Sutra by \\"reading the Lotus Sutra with his very life.\\" Maitreya Buddhist temporal cosmology assumes a cyclical pattern of ages, and even when the current Buddha's teachings fall into disregard, a new Buddha will at some point (usually considered to be millions of years in the future) be born to ensure the continuity of Buddhism. In the Lotus Sutra, Visistacaritra is entrusted to spread Buddhist law in this age and save mankind and the earth. He and countless other bodhisattvas, specifically called Bodhisattvas of the Earth (of which he is the leader), vow to be reborn in a latter day to re-create Buddhist law, thus turning the degenerate age into a flourishing paradise. Gautama Buddha entrusts them instead of his more commonly known major disciples with this task since the Bodhisattvas of the Earth have had a karmic connection with Gautama Buddha since the beginning of time, meaning that they are aware of the Superior Practice which is the essence of Buddhism or the Dharma in its original, pure form. Ksitigarbha is also known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds, in the era between the death of Gautama and the rise of Maitreya.The Earth Store (Treasury) Sutra Teacher Savaripa would also live in the world to teach someone.Masters of Mahamudra: Songs and Histories of the Eighty-Four Buddhist Siddhas (Suny Series in Buddhist Studies) Teachings of different groups The teaching appeared early.‰∏≠ÂúãÊú´Ê≥ïÊÄùÊÉ≥Êé¢ÂæÆ References to the decline of the Dharma over time can be found in such Mahayana sutras as the Diamond Sutra and the Lotus Sutra, but also to a lesser degree in some texts in the PƒÅli Canon such as the Cullavagga of the Vinaya Pitaka.

Moreover, the name 'Lucilia' was not associated with Lucretius until many centuries after his death. In Walter Map's twelfth century work titled De nugis curialium, 'Lucilia' is the name of a woman who murders her husband by giving him a potion that causes him to go insane. It wasn't until 1511, in Pius's vita, that the name 'Lucilia' became associated with Lucretius. Some have even questioned whether this association was made-up for the sake of writing, that is, to maintain literary style.  Chronological development of the story of Lucilia  = Fourth century = St. Jerome contributed to our understanding of Lucretius's death when he wrote: > The poet Titus Lucretius was born. In later life he was sent mad by a love > potion; in the intervals of his madness he composed a number of books, later > edited by Cicero. He died by his own hand at the age of forty-four. Whether this account of Lucretius's death is historically accurate is a matter of dispute. What is certain, however, is that St. Jerome's biographical account of Lucretius influenced later writers. = Twelfth century = Walter Map mentioned a woman named 'Lucilia' though he does not mention her in connection with Lucretius. Instead, he described Lucilia as a woman who accidentally gives her husband a deadly potion when she had intended to give him a love potion. Map wrote (in Latin): > Liuia uirum suum interfecit quem nimis odit; Lucilia suum quem nimis amauit. > Illa sponte miscuit aconiton, hec decepta furorem propinauit pro amoris > poculo. Amice, contrariis contendunt uotis iste; neutra tamen defraudata est > fine fraudis feminee, proprio id est malo. Variis et diuersis incedunt > semitis femine; quibuscunque anfractibus errent, quantiscunque deuient > inuiis, unicus est exitus, unica omnium viarum suarum meta, unicum caput et > conuentus omnium diuersitatum suarum, malicia. Exemplum harum experimentum > cape, quod audax est ad omnia queccunque amat vel odit femina, et > artificiosa nocere cum vult, quod est semper; et frequenter cum iuuare parat > obest, unde fit ut noceat et nolens. In fornace positus es; si aurum es, > exibis aurum. = Thirteenth and fourteenth centuries = Vincent of Beauvais (Spec. Hist. 5.95), Walter Burley, and Guglielmo da Pastrengo are known to have written about the death of Lucretius. Though writing after Walter Map, they did not mention Lucretius in connection with Lucilia. Rather, their accounts of Lucretius's death parallel that of St. Jerome's. A medieval scholar attributed an epigram to Lucretius on verse 419 of Ovid's Ibis. In the epigram, Lucretius, speaking through a character named 'Almenicus', talks about a boy named Asterion, who might have been a possible lover. He wrote (in Latin): > Cur puer Asterion crudelis? ne fuge amantem. Ne fuge, non equidem est > effugiendus amor. Crudeli puero nihil est crudelius umquam. Crudeli puero > nil mihi peius obest. Vis verum dicam? Sum mitis: ne fuge amantem. Ni > fugias, nil te mitius esse potest. Sed iam non puer es, puero nil mitius > umquam. Crudeli puero mihi peius obest. Geoffrey Chaucer, in \\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\\", mentioned a woman named 'Lucia' who murdered her husband. He wrote: > Of Livia told he me, and of Lucy. They both√® made their husbands for to die; > That one for love, that other was for hate. Livia her husband on an evening > late Empoisoned has, for that she was his foe. Lucia likerous loved her > husband so That for he should always upon her think, She have him such a > manner love-drink That he was dead ere it were by the morrow... In other versions of the same story, 'Lucilia' appears in place of 'Lucia'. = Fifteenth and sixteenth centuries = Girolamo Borgia was the first to associate Lucretius's death with a female figure. There was, however, no mention of a woman named 'Lucilia'. He wrote: > [Lucretius] lived forty-four years, and at last, driven mad by the noxious > potion of an evil woman, he resolved to take his own life by hanging himself > or else, as others think, he fell on his sword. Johannes Baptista Pius was the first to associate a woman named 'Lucilia' with the death of Lucretius. He wrote (in Latin): > Morbi vi, iit fit, consiimtiin esse, sed, ut ejus obitiim faciant, scribunt, > eum sibi ipsum manus attulisse: aliitaedio vitae, quod patriara suam > ambitionc, avaritia, luxuria, discordia, etsimilibus civitatuin, qiiap diu > floruerunt, et jam senescunt, morbis aestuare atque afflictari videret: alii > aegritudine animi, quod memmii sui, qui in exilium pulsus erat, tristem > casum aequo animo ferre non posset: alii iurore percitum, in quem Lucilia, > sive uxor sive amica, amatorio poculo porrecto, eum imprudens adegerat, cum > ab eo amari, non ei necem inferre, aut bonam mentem adimere, vallet. Quoniam > autem de numero libronim a nostro poeta scriptorum nonnulli dubitarunt, et, > levissiniis argumentis adducti, plures, quam sex, ab eo scriptos esse > existimarunt, videturhic error minuendus, atque haec dubitatio tollenda. > Omino igitur sex libros duntaxat de natura rerum scripsit T. Lucretius > Carus... Gifanius and Lambin speculated on the nature of the relationship between Lucilia and Lucretius.

The tower was to feature 30,000m¬≤ of commercial office space, 192 one and two bedroom hotel apartments, and 109 single and double story residential apartments. The tower's name was derived from these three components. The tower was designed by Cottee Parker Architects, who have also designed many completed and proposed Brisbane buildings such as Aurora Tower, Felix Tower and Evolution. The companies behind Trilogy Tower were APH Capital Partners (APH), a multi-award-winning Brisbane developer along with the Contractor Laing O'Rourke. At the top of the building a large, solar-powered lamp visible from across the city was planned.

In all species of this subfamily, a gland on their caudal fin is found almost exclusively in the males, which allows the release and pumping of pheromones; also, members of this subfamily have complex courtship behaviors which lead to insemination. The ecology and life history of these fish is complex yet little studied. Glandulocaudines are important as food fish for larger fish important for commercial and subsistence reasons. Taxonomy Glandulocaudinae consists of twenty genera divided among seven monophyletic, morphologically differing tribes. The monophyly of the subfamily itself needs much further investigation. There are about 60 species. However, there remain many undescribed species. Distribution and habitat Glandulocaudines occur in practically all major South American drainages. Along Pacific drainages, they are distributed from Costa Rica to Ecuador, and along Atlantic drainages, their range extends to northern Argentina. These fishes are found in every South American country, including Trinidad and excluding Chile; they inhabit streams that are tributaries to larger rivers such as the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraguay Rivers in tropical species, or coastal streams tributary to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Caribbean Sea in the few subtropical species. The habitats of these fish vary. A few species are known from elevations as high as , and Lophiobrycon weitzmani is known as high as . Some species are confined to acidic black rainforest waters, and others are found in clearer, neutral to somewhat alkaline waters; a few species are even adapted to both kinds of waters. However, there are no brackish water species. Characteristics Glandulocaudines are small, less than 13 centimetres (5 in). Most are between about 5‚Äì6 cm SL (about 2 in), but some species can be even smaller, between . The reproductive adaptations of glandulocaudines is what sets this group apart from the other Characins. Males have a caudal organ associated with gland tissues. Synapomorphies of this subfamily include insemination, a posterior sperm storage area in the testes, and an elongate sperm nucleus. All males have some form of modified caudal gland used to release pheromones as part of courtship. The structure of this gland depends on the specific tribe; the organ may consist of modified caudal fin rays; modified caudal fin scales, a derived hypural fan, or modified caudal fin musculature, or combinations of the above. Modified scales may act as bellows in releasing chemicals into the water. A caudal fin ray pheromone pump, unique to tribe Glandulocaudini, consists of glandular tissue associated with modified scales and fin rays. The tribe Diapomini is the only tribe in which the caudal gland is equally developed in both the males and females. Females of all glandulocaudine species are inseminated. The females produce fewer eggs per unit body weight than externally fertilizing species; this is possibly because insemination increases the efficiency of fertilization, so fewer eggs are necessary. This insemination is preceded by courtship in all species. After insemination, the female may retain the live sperm for many months in her ovaries. This allows the eggs to be laid when environmental conditions are favorable. However, there is no evidence of an intromittent organ, and the exact mechanism of insemination is unknown. Hooks on the anal fin of males may play a role, although these are also found in characins that exhibit external fertilization. It was originally believed that internal fertilization occurs in glandulocaudines. However, the exact time of fertilization is unknown and no fertilized eggs are found internally; this suggests fertilization occurs when the eggs are being laid or even outside of the body. Due to insemination, the sperm of glandulocaudines has adapted. In many species, an elongate cytoplasmic collar binds the flagellum to the elongate nucleus at some stage of spermiogenesis. In almost all species, the sperm cell bodies are elongate. In the tribe Diapomini, the genus Planaltina expresses only round sperm (like that of externally fertilizing characins) and the genera Diapoma and Acrobrycon only express slightly elongated sperm; this may indicate a possible plesiomorphy. Some sperm have enlarged regions containing mitochondria, which may help in prolonging the life of the sperm while stored in the ovary. In some genera, sperm clumping and patterns of arrangement are observed in the sperm ducts and storage regions. In the tribes Xenobryconini (in the genera Tyttocharax, Scopaeocharax, and Xenurobrycon) and Glandulocaudini, there is a form of sperm packaging which would allow for a higher sperm density during transfer from the male to the female. These packets are called spermatozeugmata, and the sperm are packaged parallel to each other; this packaging is further increased by the elongation of the sperm cells. In Xenobryconini, each spermatozeugma is produced and is released fully formed in the spermatocysts, but in Glandulocaudini, the sperm is released from the spermatocysts and packaged elsewhere. The spermatozeugmata are situated in the posterior end of the testes, which serves as a storage area for sperm. Many of the genera also have a gland situated in the gill cavity called a \\"gill gland\\", a secondary sex characteristic found in sexually mature male glandulocaudines that is apparently suited to release chemical signals. No genus contains species that have glands and other species without glands. This gill gland is derived from anterior gill filaments of the first gill arch. Gland size and degree of gill modification varies with species. Though the true function of the gill glands has yet to be determined, they are probably used to release chemical signals into the gill current. There are many examples of sexual dimorphism (differences in appearance between the genders). In Corynopoma riisei, the males have extended finnage (giving it the common name \\"swordtailed characin\\") as well as paddle-like extensions of the operculum. Many other species also have other secondary sex characteristics believed to be involved in courtship. Many of these characteristics are also shared with the tribe Compsurini in Cheirodontinae. Though unrelated, this group contains inseminating species with caudal organs. However, the caudal organs and other similar characteristics are structured differently. They also share the elongate cytoplasmic collar binding the flagellum to the elongate nucleus at some stage of spermiogenesis, which was previously assumed to be exclusive to glandulocaudines. These fish also occasionally have gill glands. Courtship Like other ostariophysans, glandulocaudines show a reaction to chemical signals in the water. Many ostariophysans have a fright reaction in response to an alarm substance. In Corynopoma riisei, it has been shown that a sexually mature male's presence actually inhibits the maturation of immature males. In C. riisei, the female is often situated parallel to and somewhat behind the male, which allows for chemical signals released from the male's gill glands to be carried directly to the female. Glandulocaudines have complex courtship behavior. In C. riisei, the male has paddle-shaped extensions of the operculum which can be extended perpendicular to its body and twitches and flutters due to movements of his body; the female follows and nips at these projections during courtship. A croaking behavior is recorded in some species of Mimagoniates. This behavior has a part in courtship as well. Courtship involves the male chasing and hovering near the female. As the male hovers, he will quickly swim to the surface and take a gulp of air and return, expelling the gas and making continuous, rhythmic pulses of croaking sounds, interrupted only by the male returning to the surface for more air. The fish also zigzags while hovering by swimming up and down, when the fish intends to resurface but does not. Croaking behavior may have evolved from a behavior called \\"nipping surface\\", a feeding behavior that occurs when the fish is searching for food; the fish often will gulp air when doing this. This gulping of air has no respiratory significance. Note: This paper precedes the reclassification of G. inequalis under Mimagoniates In the aquarium Some species of Glandulocaudinae are important in the aquarium trade. Herbert R. Axelrod has discussed the care of a number of species, including Corynopoma riisei, Gephyrocharax caucanus, Mimagoniates microlepis, M. lateralis, M. inequalis, Pseudocorynopoma doriae, and Tyttocharax madeirae. These species reach about 5‚Äì6 cm (about 2 in). However, T. madeirae reaches 2 cm (less than 1 in), while P. doriae reaches . Like most tetras, they prefer to swim in schools; some species may be nippy, and should be kept in groups to divide aggression. Many species are very active and will almost constantly swim, which translates to a larger aquarium. They have been bred in captivity. These fish may not be as easily weaned onto dry foods as other fish, and will appreciate live foods. Some species appreciate cooler water than the average tropical fish, so this should be kept in mind when maintaining some of these species. Also, many imported specimens, even if they seem healthy, may mysteriously waste away. Some species are delicate and are not easily collected or transported, or are rarely seen available. Species Species list is according to FishBase. ITIS does not list Characin subfamilies as they believe subfamilies are likely to change.

He was also a member of the U.S. Olympic team in London in 1948. He was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1976. Youth Pariani grew up in a working-class Italian neighborhood called The Hill in St. Louis, Missouri. The younger of two brothers, Pariani's childhood consisted primarily of school, working at a local laundromat and playing street sports.The Game of Their Lives Pariani joined a local youth club when he was thirteen. Club career In 1943, Pariani joined Schumachers when he was fifteen. That year, he won his first title, a St. Louis Municipal League championship, with Schumachers. He then moved to Raftery's S.C. and remained with them through the 1946‚Äì1947 season. That year he was voted the league MVP. In 1947, Carrenti Cleaners came under new sponsorship. The renamed team, now known as St. Louis Simpkins-Ford, recruited Pariani. He would experience considerable success with Simpkins, winning the 1948 and 1950 U.S. Open Cup championships. He continued to play until 1963. Some time during his career, he also played for Calcaterra and Wildcats A.C. Pariani was a St. Louis all-star selection every year from 1946 through 1953. National and Olympic team His success at the club level led to Pariani's selection to the U.S. soccer team at the 1948 Summer Olympics. The U.S. lost 9-0 to Italy in the first round of this single elimination tournament. Pariani did not play in this loss. Pariani gained his first caps with the U.S. national team in an 11-0 loss to Norway on August 6, 1948. His second cap came five days later in a loss to Northern Ireland. He did not play again with the full national team until the 1950 FIFA World Cup. The invitation into the team came unexpectedly and Pariani had scheduled his wedding during the finals. With the support of both families, he and his fianc√© moved up the day to allow him to play in Brazil.Obituary When he left St. Louis for New York, he had been married for only three days. He went on to score the lone U.S. goal in the team's first game of the finals, a 3-1 loss to Spain. Four days later, he was a key part of the U.S. victory over England, maintaining good ball possession. He also sent Frank Wallace on a break towards the English goal, a break stopped by Alf Ramsey. The U.S. ultimately won the game, one of the greatest upsets of World Cup history. Pariani's last cap came in a 5-2 loss to Chile which put the U.S. out of the cup.Soccer Hall of Fame game results In January 2004, Pariani and the four other living members of the 1950 World Cup Team (Walter Bahr, Frank Borghi, Harry Keough and John Souza) were recognized as Honorary All-Americas by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America at its annual convention in Charlotte, N.C.

Photograph shows a number of discarded hydrogen gas cylinders used for meteorological analysis at Wilkes Station in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Wilkes Station was an Antarctic research station established 29 January 1957 by the United States as one of seven U.S. stations established for the International Geophysical Year (IGY) program in Antarctica. It was taken over by Australia on 7 February 1959. History Navy personnel from the United States constructed the main part of Wilkes in a period of 16 days in January and February 1957, unloading 11,000 tons of material and supplies. It took a crew of over 100 to erect the station which housed 24 naval personnel and scientists for the next 18 months. As this was the time of the Cold War, there was considerable concern by the United States and Australia about Russian activity in Antarctica. Wilkes was seen to be strategically located because of its proximity to the south magnetic pole. Australia assumed custody of Wilkes, which remained the property of the U.S. State Department, in February 1959. Although Australia officially took over the operational command, the remaining US personnel did not take kindly to being under Australian control. Consequently, there was a 'back down' until 1961 when the station came under exclusive ANARE control. Wilkes had originally been built in 1957 for a two- year period. By 1964 the buildings had become a fire hazard due to fuel seepage, and the station was becoming buried by snow and ice. The new station of Casey Repstat (Replacement Station) was developed on the other, southern, side of Newcomb Bay, about two kilometers across the bay south of Wilkes. It was commissioned in 1969 and Wilkes was closed down. Current status Wilkes Station is now almost permanently frozen in ice and is only occasionally revealed during a big thaw every four or five years. Many objects remain embedded in the ice, and visitors are often able to see the remains of the station through the ice. What remains at Wilkes are a number of barracks buildings known as Clements huts, and the remnants of the semi-cylindrical canvas store buildings known as Jamesway huts. Clean-up program Wilkes features a series of storage dumps and a considerable amount of waste resulting from 12 years of occupation, including approximately 7000 fuel and oil drums. In early 1988, the Australian Army's 17th Construction Squadron deployed Lieutenant Andrew Stanner to Wilkes Station, Antarctica in order to develop an environmental clean-up plan to remove, make safe or dispose of a large accumulation of rubbish, fuel in drums, explosives, chemicals and gas cylinders deposited since the late 1950s. The plan was subsequently carried out over a period of years for the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions by a series of detachments from the squadron.

The location was where the Texas Road crossed Cabin Creek, near the present-day town of Big Cabin, Oklahoma. Both the First and Second Battles of Cabin Creek were launched by the Confederate Army to disrupt Union Army supply trains. The first was a raid by a Confederate Army detachment on a Union Army supply train bound for Fort Gibson in July 1863. It failed to stop the Union detachment, which enabled the Union to succeed in winning the Battle of Honey Springs later that month. The second engagement, in September, 1864, again a Confederate raid on a Union supply train, resulted in the Confederates capturing over a million dollars worth of mules, wagons and supplies. However, this was too late to have a strategic impact on the outcome of the war. Confederate General Stand Watie led the attackers during both raids. First Battle of Cabin Creek Map of Cabin Creek I Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The First Battle of Cabin Creek took place on July 1 through July 2, 1863, in Mayes County, Oklahoma during the American Civil War. The Confederate forces under Colonel Stand Watie attempted to ambush a Union supply convoy led by Colonel James Monroe Williams. Williams was alerted to the attack and, despite the waters of the creek being swelled by rain, made a successful attack upon the entrenched Confederate position and forced them to flee. The battle was the first in which African American troops fought side-by-side with their white comrades. =Background = Colonel James M. Williams had charge of the escort of a Union supply train from Fort Scott, Kansas to Fort Gibson, Oklahoma (which was then in Indian Territory). His force marched along the Texas Road and consisted of detachments of the 2nd Colorado Infantry Regiment, 3rd Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, 9th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, 3rd Regiment, Indian Home Guard, 1st Kansas Colored Infantry and the 2nd Kansas Artillery. Confederate Colonel Stand Watie had intended to ambush Williams' convoy and had 1,600 to 1,800 men lying in wait at the Cabin Creek crossing. Watie had counted on 1,500 additional men, led by Brigadier General William L. Cabell to strengthen his force prior to the attack but Cabell's troops were delayed by high waters on the Grand River. = Battle = Williams arrived at the crossing on 1 July and learned of the intentions of Watie's force from captured Confederate soldiers. Watie's battle line extended around one mile either side of the crossing in trenches dug into the brush lining the creek. Owing to the unusually high water level in the creek, which reached above shoulder height, Williams chose to delay his attack on the Confederates until the following day and corralled his wagons defensively on a nearby prairie. Williams ordered a half-hour artillery bombardment before launching an assault with the Third Indian Home Guard. They failed to make it across the now waist-deep creek, pushed back by heavy Confederate fire, and so the Ninth Kansas Cavalry were ordered to charge under the covering fire of the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry. With the cavalry having gained a bridgehead across the creek, Williams led the men of his own regiment, the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, in a headlong charge across the stream and into the brush. This forced the Confederates back and Williams pursued them for a quarter of a mile as they attempted to rally in a clearing. Williams then led his convoy to successfully resupply Fort Gibson. Confederate casualties amounted to 65 men killed with the Union Army suffering between 3 and 23 dead with 30 wounded. = Impact = The action made possible the continuation of a Union force in the Indian territory, allowing the later victories at Honey Springs and Fort Smith. Soon after the battle the Union established defensive outposts along the Texas Road, including one at the Cabin Creek crossing. The battle has the distinction of being the first in which African American soldiers (the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry) fought alongside white troops. A monument to the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry was erected on the battlefield on 7 July 2007. Second Battle of Cabin Creek The Second Battle of Cabin Creek was part of a plan conceived by Confederate Brigadier General Stand Watie (who had been promoted from colonel after the First Battle of Cabin Creek). The plan was to have a Confederate force attack central Kansas from Indian Territory, raiding Union Army facilities and encouraging Indian tribes in Western Kansas to join in an attack on the eastern part of the state. Watie presented the plan to his superior, General S. B. Maxey on February 5, 1864. Maxey approved the plan on the condition that the attack would start by October 1, to coincide with an attack on Missouri already planned by General Sterling Price. =Preparation= Brigadier General Richard Montgomery Gano and Watie met at Camp Pike in the Choctaw Nation on 13 September 1864, to make plans for the coming expedition. Gano, commanding several Texas Confederate units, had agreed to join Watie as co-leader of the campaign. Watie, however, knew that most of the Texans hated all the Indians, including their allies, and resented his promotion in the Confederate Army. According to one account, \\"...Colonel Charles DeMorse of the 29th Texas Cavalry Regiment refused to serve under him.\\"\\"Gano's Big Haul.\\" Warriors of the Lone Star. Barnhart, Don. January 31, 2012. Retrieved September 5, 2014. Watie, therefore, deferred to Gano as commander of the expedition. Both Gano and Maxey commended Waite for this act of solidarity. Moreover, Gano had more seniority as a Confederate general than did Watie. Watie would continue to command the Indian Brigade, composed of about 800 men. Gano's brigade comprised Texas cavalry and artillery units containing about 1,200 men. The raid had targeted a wagon train that left Fort Scott on 12 September. It carried supplies and provisions intended for Native Americans who had fled their homes and camped near Fort Gibson. It was led by Major Henry Hopkins. The train was escorted by 80 soldiers of the Second Kansas Cavalry, 50 men from the 6th Kansas Cavalry and 130 men of the Fourteenth Kansas Cavalry. A group of 100 pro-Union Cherokees joined the train at Baxter Springs, Kansas, but half were left at the Neosho River junction to guard the rear. The escort was to be increased by 170 Union Cherokees of the Second Indian Regiment, based at Cabin Creek, and 140 Cherokees of the Third Indian Regiment en route from Fort Gibson Major Hopkins received a message to move the train to Cabin Creek as fast as possible and await further orders. The message also said that Major John A. Foreman, six companies of men and two howitzers were en route as a relief force. The train arrived at Cabin Creek station during the afternoon of September 18. =Flat Rock attack= On 16 September, as they were waiting for the supply train, the Confederates happened to encounter a detachment of black Union soldiers conducting hay-making operations at Flat Rock, near the confluence of Flat Rock Creek and the Grand River, about northeast of present- day Wagoner, Oklahoma and northwest of Fort Gibson. Captain E. A. Barker leading a small group of the 2nd Kansas Cavalry and a detachment from the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, who were guarding the operation, were soon surrounded and attacked from all sides. In desperation, Barker ordered his men with horses to attempt a breakout. Only 15 of the 65 men who attempted to break out reached the fort. The Union troops lost all their hay-making equipment, several hundred tons of hay and over 100 casualties (including prisoners). There were unconfirmed reports that many of the black troops were killed by the Texans. These killings led to one historian's calling the action one of Watie's three most infamous actions of the war.Franks, Kenny A. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. \\"Watie's Rifles.\\" Retrieved October 5, 2013. =Confederate attack= The Second Battle of Cabin Creek began at 1:00 A.M. on September 19. The Confederates advanced with the Texans covering the left flank and the Indian Brigade on the right flank. After the Union troops began to fire, the Confederate artillery answered. The barrage caused the mules to panic and run. Many dragged their wagons with them. Some were so terrified that they fell off the bluff and into Cabin Creek. The teamsters managed cut many of the mules from their traces. The men jumped on the mules and rode across the ford to safer ground. Sunrise revealed the Union positions. Gano moved part of his artillery to his right flank, so that the wagon train would be caught in crossfire. The two Cherokee regiments moved across the creek to capture the wagons that had escaped in the darkness. The Texans, led by Gano himself, attacked the Union flank, driving it back until the defenders were scattered in the wooded bottoms along the creek. By 9:00 A.M., the Union forces had been routed. Major Hopkins escaped to Fort Gibson, hoping to meet the Major Foreman's relief force and recapture the train. Failing to find the relief force, he continued to Fort Gibson bearing the news of the disaster. =Outcome= The Confederate force, led by Watie, and Brigadier General Richard Montgomery Gano, captured a Federal wagon train about $1 million worth of wagons, mules, commissary supplies, and other needed items.Knight, Wilfred (1988).

Although Watie and his troops were commended for their success by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and the Confederate Congress, this battle had no significant impact on the outcome of the Civil War in Indian Territory. Preserving the battlefield A young Cherokee named Joseph Martin acquired land on Cabin Creek in 1840. This would become his headquarters for a ranch named Pensacola that he developed over the next twenty years containing over . By 1860, he had also developed a station on his property along the Texas Road, where travelers to Texas could buy provisions and have their wagons repaired.\\"Cabin Creek, more than a battlefield.\\" Grand Lake News. Barber, Janet. Retrieved September 5, 2014. A part of this land would become the Cabin Creek battleground. There was little interest in preserving the site of these two battles until 1958. That was when the Vinita Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) decided to buy a plot of ground that now considered the core of the battlefield. The group approached the landowner about the proposed purchase and agreed on a price of $300. The UDC chapter spent the next three years raising funds and finalized the purchase in 1961. They donated the land to the Oklahoma Historical Society later in the same year. The same UDC chapter donated a monument to the Confederate victory of 1864 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the event. The OHS created a circle drive within the park and added some small monuments that commemorated the battle positions of the two forces. Interest in the park waned for a number of years and maintenance was neglected. Many monuments were vandalized. In 1992, the OHS and the Grand Lake Chamber of Commerce jointly sponsored a reenactment of the battles. It was considered a success, drawing about 15,000 visitors, with reenactors coming from many parts of the United States. Encouraged by the public response, the OHS proposed to repeat the event every three years. A non-profit organization named \\"The Friends of Cabin Creek Battlefield, Inc.\\" was formed to clean up the park, repair the damaged monuments, and add trash cans and park benches. A day-use only policy was put into effect, with the park gates unlocked in the morning and locked in the evenings 365 days a year.

The supergiant primary star, known as W Cephei A, is one of largest known stars and as well as one of most luminous red supergiants. Discovery W Cephei was reported in 1896 as a red star varying from magnitude 7.3 to 8.3. It was catalogued as BD+57¬∞2568 in the Bonner Durchmusterung published in 1903, and HD 214369 in the Henry Draper Catalogue. In 1925, W Cep was included in a listing of Be stars. It was recognised as a cool star with spectral type Mep. It was classified as K0ep Ia from a 1949 spectrum, but also recognised to have a small hot companion, plus an unusual infrared excess. Ultraviolet spectra allowed absorption lines from the companion to be studied and it was given a spectral type of B0-1. System The W Cephei system contains a luminous red supergiant star with a non-supergiant early B companion. The star has unusual emission lines including both permitted and forbidden FeII, produced by a circumstellar envelope containing dust and ionised gas. The two components have been resolved at 0.262\\" using Speckle interferometry. An orbital period of 2,090 days has been proposed. Variability W Cephei varies in brightness from 7th to 9th magnitude.

It is about a fan, named Joxer, who travels to the Republic of Ireland national football team's first major international tournament, Euro 1988, in West Germany. It is sung to the tune of the Match of the Day theme music, composed by Barry Stoller. The song is as much a comical social commentary on Ireland in the late 1980s as it is a celebration of the Irish team beating England at a major footballing tournament. The main focus of the song is the game that took place in Stuttgart's Neckarstadion against England on 12 June 1988, a game which Ireland won by a 1-0 scoreline, thanks to a sixth-minute goal from Ray Houghton. However, the song also documents the lives of those following the team and the impact of the tournament on Irish fans. Some fans of the Irish football team later, more romantically than accurately, attributed the economic development that followed the success of the team in the tournament, and the 1990 World Cup two years later, to that very success itself along with the 'feel good' factor the performances of the side helped foster throughout the country.

Between sunrise and before the observed Sun reaches about 50¬∞ over Earth's horizon, two infralateral arcs are located on either side (e.g. lateral) of the 46¬∞ halo, their convex apexes lying tangent to the 46¬∞ halo. As the observed Sun reaches above 68¬∞ the two arcs unite to a single concave arc tangent to the 46¬∞ halo vertically under the Sun. (Including a photo from January 1996 and a 1980 computer simulation of infra- and supralateral arcs relative to a 46¬∞ halo.) Infralateral arcs form when sunlight enters horizontally oriented, rod-shaped hexagonal ice crystals through a hexagonal base and exits through one of the prism sides. Infralateral arcs occur about once a year. They are often observed together with circumscribed halos and upper tangent arcs.

He did not play 11-man ball until he began college at Augustana in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. His early college years were outstanding, playing on a college team that showed unusual success and talent. The team during his final two years, however, had only mediocre success, and his hope to be claimed in the pro football draft faded. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Josephson was signed by the Dallas Cowboys in 1964 as an undrafted free agent, because they were impressed with his athletic ability. The Cowboys needed an offensive tackle because of injuries and although they didn't want to lose Josephson, he was traded during training camp to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for Jim Boeke. =Los Angeles Rams= He joined the backfield of Roman Gabriel as a rookie fullback/running back, and became a team leader for the next decade. Josephson was selected for the Pro Bowl in 1967, after having his best professional season with 800 rushing yards. In the Pro Bowl, he scored a first-quarter touchdown in the 38‚Äì20 West victory. The next year, he suffered a left calf injury in pre-season, while running through the stadium tunnel to the field. After the cast for the injury was removed, he tore the Achilles tendon of the same leg while rehabilitating jumping rope and was placed on the injured reserve list. Injuries slowed him down (broken jaw, ruptured Achilles tendon) but he contributed to the team for many years after his worst injuries. He retired in 1975 after he was waived during the preseason.

(Summer) York Boulevard is a Lower City arterial road in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Formerly known as Highway 2 and Highway 6, it starts in Burlington, Ontario at Plains Road West as a two-way arterial road that wraps around and over Hamilton Harbour, enters the city of Hamilton in the west end at Dundurn Park, and ends at James Street North. It has a one-way section from Queen Street to Bay Street North, and continues east of James Street North as Wilson Street.) History York Boulevard was part of the military road that connected the chain stations lying between Kingston and the Niagara River, and was the used as the main road to York, Upper Canada (present-day Toronto). As a result, it became known as York Street. In 1976, the road was closed for construction, over the protests of residents and businesspeople, widened and renamed York Boulevard on November 29, 1976 at a final cost of $5.5-million. No street runs parallel with York Boulevard. George Hamilton, a settler and local politician, established a town site in the northern part of Barton Township after the war in 1815. He kept several east-west roads which were originally Indian trails, although the north-south streets were on a regular grid pattern. Streets were designated \\"East\\" or \\"West\\" if they crossed James Street or Highway 6, and \\"North\\" or \\"South\\" if they crossed King Street or Highway 8. York Street was originally one of those Indian trails; it cuts through the Strathcona and Central neighbourhoods diagonally. In 1857, 57 passengers were killed when a train derailed near the Desjardins Canal. The old City Hall, with its 38-metre clock tower, was demolished in 1961 (corner of York and James Street) to allow expansion of Eaton's department store. The clock and bell went into the tower of the 1990 Eaton Centre. Hamilton's Central Library was opened in 1980 by Prince Philip. FirstOntario Centre, a sports and entertainment arena with a capacity of up to 19,000 (depending on event type and configuration) opened its doors for business in 1985. It was originally named Copps Coliseum after the former Hamilton mayor, Victor K. Copps, and was renamed in 2014. As part of the Hamilton master transportation plan, York Boulevard was converted from a one way street to allow two-way traffic. This change came into effect at 10 am on December 10, 2010. = Parks = Dundurn Park Loyalists marker In 1790, Richard Beasley occupied Burlington Heights (now the site of Dundurn Park and Harvey Park) and was granted land by the Crown in 1799. A local entrepreneur, Beasley's business ventures included fur trading, land acquisition and establishment of a grist mill in Ancaster. He was a member of the legislative assembly of Upper Canada from 1791 to 1804 and was appointed colonel of the 2nd regiment of the York militia in 1809. Financial difficulties forced Beasley to sell lands at Burlington Heights, but they were purchased in 1832 by Sir Allan Napier MacNab who built Dundurn Castle on the foundations of Beasley's brick home. Richard Beasley was a United Empire Loyalist who preferred to stay British and came to Canada following the American Revolution of 1776. Sir Allan Napier MacNab, (1798‚Äì1862), was a businessman, land speculator and soldier, and was active in public life. He was a successful lawyer and was appointed Upper Canada's first Queen's Council. In 1838 he was knighted for his role in suppressing the rebellion of Upper Canada. The profits from his extensive land speculation were fed into a variety of projects, including construction of his monument, Dundurn. He was influential in establishing the Gore Bank and in promoting the Great Western Railway. During a political career spanning three decades, he was three times Speaker and, from 1854 to 1856 Joint Premier of the Province of Canada. Dundurn Castle was built between 1832‚Äì1835 for Sir Allan Napier MacNab, and named after his family ancestral seat in Scotland. Incorporating an existing farmhouse, it was designed by local architect Robert Wetherell as a statement of its owner's place in society. The house features classical and Italian motifs, French windows, broad verandahs, and a panoramic view of Burlington Bay. With its outbuildings and grounds, Dundurn Castle stands as an important example of the Picturesque movement in Canada. After years in private hands, the property was purchased by the city and from 1964 to 1967 was restored to its former splendour. Hamilton Harbour, view from Harvey Park, just West of Dundurn Park Harvey Park was named after Colonel John Harvey, a British officer during the War of 1812. The name was accepted by Hamilton City Council June 11, 1894. From Harvey Park Lieutenant-Colonel John Harvey set out with about 700 men on the night of June 5, 1813, to launch a surprise attack on an invading United States force of some 3,000 men camped in Stoney Creek. His rout of the troops commanded by Brigadier-General John Chandler under cover of darkness in the early hours of June 6 is generally credited with saving Upper Canada from being overrun by the enemy. Harvey was knighted in 1824, served as Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick (1834‚Äì1841), Lieutenant- Governor of Newfoundland (1841‚Äì1846), and Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia (1846-18851). Cootes Paradise is a haven for naturalists. Close to the downtown, this sanctuary provides an undisturbed refuge for birds, fish and animals of all types and can be reached from York Boulevard by following the Harvey Park Trail west and descending the stairs at the Thomas B. McQuesten High Level Bridge. = Festivals and events = Stairway, T.B. McQuesten high level bridge, leading down to Waterfront Trail. The Around the Bay Road Race is the oldest long distance road race in North America, held annually in Hamilton, Ontario since 1894, 3 years before the Boston Marathon. This 30-kilometre race is also known as the Billy Sherring Memorial Road Race. All races start on York Boulevard, one block west of FirstOntario Centre, and finish inside FirstOntario Centre. On Sunday, March 30, 2008, a record 8,500 participants crossed the finish line. The City's Parks Board drew up plans in 1927 for the construction of a full-scale botanical gardens. By 1930 work had started on the project which converted an ugly stone quarry into a horticultural showcase, known as the Royal Botanical Gardens. A decade later a bill was introduced in the Provincial Legislature calling for an even more ambitious project which when completed would become the \\"Mecca of flower lovers from all parts of North America\\" its supporters claimed. The sponsor of the legislation was the Minister of Highways in the Provincial Government, and native Hamiltonian, T.B. McQuesten. The Royal Botanical Gardens was established as an independent entity in 1941 by an act of the provincial government, but the project traces its origins to the late 1920s when the City of Hamilton began acquiring land for the beautification of the city's northwest entrance. Breathtaking gardens and spectacular nature sanctuaries plus three on-site restaurants and gift shop, over 30 kilometres of nature trails, and more can be found here. The Royal Botanical Gardens also plays host to a number of festivals throughout the year. Some of these include the Tulip Celebration, Lilac Celebration, Iris Festival, Rose Celebration and Music @ the Gardens. In addition to the festivals, hundreds of educational programs are offered for all ages as well as day camps for children. Waterfront Shuttle Waterfront Shuttle The Waterfront Shuttle is a free service offered by the Hamilton Street Railway. It has a seasonal schedule that runs daily from late June to early September connecting Hamilton's downtown core to the waterfront and attractions that can be found there, such as HMCS Haida, Bayfront Park, Pier 4 Park, and the Hamilton Waterfront Outdoor Rink. The bus leaves the loop point on King Street West opposite Summers Lane and circles Hamilton's downtown core on Bay Street North, York Boulevard, and James Street North, where it travels through the Art District until it reaches the waterfront at Guise Street and passes the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club, Hamilton Chamber of Commerce and the Harbour West Marina Complex, ending on Discovery Drive at Pier 8. Also at this site is the Hamilton Harbour Queen (cruise boat), Hamiltonian (tour boat) and the Hamilton Waterfront Trolley.

The band's name derives from a verse of the song \\"Lucifer Sam\\" by Syd Barrett. History Jennifer Gentle was formed by Marco Fasolo and Alessio Gastaldello in early 2000, after the breakup of Marco‚Äôs previous band, Carcers. Later, these two young men teamed up with guitarist Isacco Maretto and bassist Nick Crivellari, which would complete the early stage of this Northern Italian rock group. Jennifer Gentle imitated the influence of 60s psychedelic rock icon Syd Barrett (Pink Floyd), and recorded their first album I Am You Are in their own basement (Silly Boy Entertainment 2001). However, it wasn‚Äôt until their second basement-recording, Funny Creatures Lane (2002), that they began to gain attention from radio stations across the US and Britain. They began touring with Acid Mothers Temple‚Äôs Kawabata Makoto and cut a session with WFMU, releasing the tour on a live album, The Wrong Cage in 2002. When Crivellari left Jennifer Gentle, Paolo Mioni (guitar), Liviano Mos (keyboards) and Francesco Candura of Rivulets (bass) were welcomed into the band as live stage members. In February 2004, Jennifer Gentle became the first Italian band to be signed to Sub Pop records. They released their third studio album, Valende, which was recorded in the same basement on the outskirts of Padova, Italy, in 2004. Marco and Alessio are responsible for all instrumentation and vocals on their albums. This Italian duo is known to have incorporated instruments such as kazoos, cow bells, toy glockenspiel, bowed guitars, old Bontempi air organs, plastic flutes, chains and clocks, and deflating balloons (\\"I Do Dream You\\", Valende). They were the first European band to receive a contract with Sub Pop Records.

The colony was subsequently to become a state of Australia in 1901. The court had jurisdiction to deal with civil disputes where the amount in dispute in the colony was not more than ¬£50 sterling. The Supreme Court of New South Wales replaced the court in 1823 when the Supreme Court was created by the Third Charter of Justice. Background The British government established the colony of New South Wales primarily as a penal colony with the intention of encouraging later settlement. Captain Arthur Phillip was appointed as the colony‚Äôs first governor and did much to ensure the colony survived and transformed into a modern colonial outpost Arthur Phillip Notwithstanding its beginnings as a penal colony, it soon prospered as a booming agricultural and mercantile colony. With the increased prosperity came the need for better access to forms of civil justice. Systems for the resolution of commercial disputes are an important part of the common law tradition in British based legal systems, particularly with the establishment of the rule of law. The British authorities foresaw the need for a civil judicial system to be established when the colony was first established. A court styled the ‚ÄúCourt of Civil Jurisdiction‚Äù was established by the First Charter of Justice as well as a Court of Vice-Admiralty pursuant to letters patent from the High Admiralty in Great Britain. The Governor of New South Wales would also in time authorise magistrates (the common name for justices of the peace in the colony at the time) to determine smaller debt claims that were taking up the time of these original civil courts. Hilary Golder points to research that magistrates were in fact dealing with small debt claims as early 1789, one year after the commencement of the colony. Ellis Bent, the first barrister appointed as deputy judge advocate for the colony, made recommendations to Governor Lachlan Macquarie for the establishment of new civil courts to reflect the changing nature of the society from a penal colony to a trading colony. This reflected the public sentiment in New South Wales that it was time for a legally qualified judge to head a superior court in the colony, rather than a military officer who happened to have legal qualifications. Macquarie supported this and eventually the British authorities arranged for new charters to issue for the reform of the civil courts. Constitution The British authorities introduced three new civil courts to the colony. There was a Supreme Court of Civil Judicature (commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúSupreme Court‚Äù which had jurisdiction over civil claims in New South Wales and the settlement at Van Diemen‚Äôs Land. There was also established a Lieutenant Governor‚Äôs Court to deal with civil claims in Van Diemen‚Äôs Land. In respect of New South Wales, a court styled the ‚ÄúGovernors Court‚Äù was established. The court was created by Letters Patent dated 4 February 1814 issued by King George III the reigning sovereign of England at the time.Documenting Democracy It was composed of the deputy judge-advocate, commonly known in the colony as the ‚Äújudge-advocate‚Äù, and two other persons appointed by the Governor of New South Wales. The judge-advocate was the presiding officer. Alternatively, the court could be constituted by just the judge-advocate and one of the two persons appointed by the governor. The court had jurisdiction to hear and determine actions summarily relating to land, houses, debt, contract, trespass, and just about any other common law or equitable cases up to ¬£50 sterling in value. One defect in the Court was the ability for a governor to possibly ‚Äústack‚Äù the court. Sir John Wylde, the last judge-advocate for the colony, and the last judge-advocate to preside, noted in a report to the British authorities that there was such a possibility of appointing laymen with no legal knowledge to the court Wylde, Sir John (1781 - 1859) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online and R. J. Mckay suggests that Governor Thomas Brisbane had in fact attempted to do this. Thomas Brisbane Sittings of the court The court first sat in May, 1815.Law & Justice in Australia  State Library of New South Wales Macquarie appointed Richard Brooks and Charles Hook as respectable persons to sit with Bent on the new Court.Bent, Ellis (1783 - 1815) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Bent, being under the influence of his brother Jeffery Hart Bent, had Brooks and Hook unanimously adopt a rule that no attorney who had been struck off the roll of lawyers should be admitted to practise before the court. This was to lead to a falling out between Bent and Macquarie over the status of emancipated convicts. The rule was particularly onerous as there were no attorneys in the colony who hadn‚Äôt arrived there as convicts. As each convict attorney had been struck off the roll, effectively there was no attorney who could appear in the court. The court later sat with Frederick Garling as acting deputy judge advocate after the death of Bent. Sir John Wylde was appointed by the British authorities in 1815 as Bent‚Äôs successor and presided in the Court until its abolition in 1823. From about 1817, the court also sat twice a year outside Sydney. New South Wales State Archives records show that the court at least sat at Parramatta and Windsor for the trial of causes. Building where court was held in early 1800s Appeals There was no right of appeal from decisions of the court. This was in contrast to the situation with the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature where there was a right of appeal to the governor sitting as a court of appeal, with a possible further right of appeal to the Privy Council. The lack of a right of appeal reflected the fact that British authorities intended the court as a Court of Requests dispensing justice in a more summary way. As the amounts involved before the court were usually quite small, the cost of an appeal would have exceeded whatever was recovered in any event. Rules of court The Rules and Orders of the Governors Court were drawn up by Ellis Bent who was the deputy- judge-advocate at the time of the creation of the court. The rules included provisions relating to the rights of attorneys to practise, how writs were issued and returned, the keeping of court records, the execution of judgements and pleading procedure. An original copy of those rules is held by the State Library of New South Wales with annotations later made by Bent‚Äôs successor Wylde. Abolition The court was abolished in 1823 after sitting for some eight years. It was replaced by the newly created Supreme Court of New South Wales established by Letters Patent dated 13 October 1823.Documenting Democracy Those letters were authorised by the British Parliament through the passing of the New South Wales Act 1823 (UK).

The OSA works with ISVs, system integrators, and the broader open source software community to improve interoperability among software products by publishing best practices, promoting technical standards, and making tools and application programming interfaces available. History In early November 2006, a group of application developers got together to form an alliance dedicated to improving interoperability and awareness of their products. Open source development had proven itself at the operating system and middleware layers but had yet to make a significant impact at the application level. Founders identified three important areas where collective action could be successful in lowering barriers to adoption of open solutions by business users: * Define and promote guidelines and best practices for interoperability between applications. * Foster a multivendor metacommunity of users, developers, and systems integrators. * Drive awareness and advocacy All of those present agreed that none of these challenges could be readily addressed by any one vendor in isolation. Issues of awareness, interoperability and community are inherently collective in nature, such that collective action is needed to address them. This led to the decision to create a trade association. The result was the OSA. In December 2006, The Open Solutions Alliance was incorporated as a 501c6 in the State of California, and the initial founding members officially joined during January 2007. Members Notable members of OSA include Palamida, CSC, Concursive Corporation, Essentia Corporation, Ingres Corporation, IONA, Jaspersoft, Openbravo, SourceForge.net, and Unisys.

Design In 2004, Emirates Team New Zealand head Grant Dalton revamped the Team New Zealand program. Following the unfortunate defeat of a design-led campaign in 2003 which was mainly due to deficiences in the boat, Dalton saw the need for a combination of a sailor-led campaign with a 'good all round boat' as seen in the 2003 America's Cup winner Alinghi's SUI 64. Two new yachts were designed and built relatively quickly and were assigned the sail numbers NZL 84 and NZL 92 respectively. The two new TNZ yachts were among the first of their generation to be built. NZL 84 debuted in Louis Vuitton Act 10, and beat Alinghi in Act 12. With its \\"full\\" bow similar to NZL 84, NZL 92 quickly mirrored the race-winning results that NZL 84 had established in the Louis Vuitton Cup Acts leading up to the Louis Vuitton Cup 2007. Initially considered unattractive, the unique full bow on both NZL 92 and NZL 84 are quickly appearing to set a new evolution of yacht design and style in the 2007 America's Cup. This is reflected in the comments of race commentator and Cup organizer Bruno Trouble who remarked, 'ugly boats quickly become attractive once they start winning races!' When compared with NZL 82 and NZL 81, and most of the 2007 America's Cup edition boats which have a very flat double-knuckle bow, with exception of both Alinghi's SUI 64 and BMW Oracle Racing's USA 71. Both the benchmark in aesthetics and speed with some of the other 10 challengers mimicking its design, particularly in the bow. This can be seen especially on Areva-Challenge and CHINATeam, FRA 93 and CHN 95 respectively. Career NZL 92 won the 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup in five races on the 6 June 2007 against Luna Rossa Challenge ITA 94, but was defeated by the defender Alinghi SUI 100 in the 2007 America's Cup, losing 5 races to 2 on 3 July 2007.

He was one of Italy's leading authorities on the law of civil procedure. After studies in Pisa and Rome, Calamandrei assumed a professorship at the law school at the University of Messina in 1915. He fought as a volunteer in the 218th infantry regiment in World War I, rising to the rank of captain, and turning down a further promotion to resume teaching. In 1918, he resumed teaching at the University of Modena, then went on to teach at the law school in Siena, and finally, in Florence. His notable works include La cassazione civile (Appellate Review of Civil Judgments) (1920) and Studi sul processo civile (1930). He also co-founded the journals Rivista di diritto processuale (1924), Il foro toscano (The Tuscan Courts) (1926) and Il Ponte (The Bridge) (1945), and participated in the 1942 revision of the Italian code of civil procedure. Calamandrei was highly critical of Italian fascism; he signed, for instance, Benedetto Croce's 1925 Manifesto of Anti-Fascist Intellectuals and was linked to the Florentine journal Non mollare! (Don't Give Up!) published between January and October 1925. After the fall of the fascist regime in 1943, the Allies named him rector of the University of Florence. He was elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1945 and, as a Social Democrat, to the National Assembly in 1948. On 4 December 1952, Calamandrei also penned the antifascist poem, Lapide ad ignominia (\\"A monument to ignominy\\"). The German general Albert Kesselring who was responsible for various war crimes during the Nazi occupation of Italy had been sentenced to death, a sentence that was later commuted. When Kesselring was freed, he refused to repent for his crimes and claimed the Italians ought to build him a monument for his good work there. Calamandrei responded with this poem, stating that if Kesselring returned, he would indeed find a monument but one stronger than stone and comprising Italian resistance fighters who \\"willingly took up arms, to preserve dignity, not to promote hate, and who decided to fight back against the shame and terror of the world.\\" Calamandrei's poem appears in monuments in the towns of Cuneo and Montepulciano.

Algeria made its first appearance in the tournament. Argentina defeated the United States in the Americas Zone final, Australia defeated New Zealand in the Eastern Zone final, and France and Italy were the winners of the two Europe Zones, defeating Romania and Spain respectively. In the Inter- Zonal Zone, Australia defeated Argentina and Italy defeated France in the semifinals. Australia then defeated the defending champions Italy in the final to win their 24th title overall and their first since 1973. The final was held at the White City Stadium in Sydney, Australia on 2-4 December. Politics in the Davis Cup Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the Davis Cup had been affected by a number of protests and defaults by teams showing their opposition to the apartheid policies and white minority rule in South Africa and Rhodesia, and the human rights violations which occurred in Chile under Augusto Pinochet's military junta. Several high profile incidents included Mexico's repeated refusal to play against South Africa in the 1975 and 1976 Americas Zones; widespread protests in Sweden against the Pinochet junta during the 1975 Inter-Zonal semifinal between Sweden and Chile; and South Africa's victory by default at the 1974 tournament when India refused to travel to South Africa for the final.Anno 75 (1976), √Örskalender utgiven av F√∂rlagshuset Norden AB, Malm√∂, och Svenska Dagbladet, Stockholm, pp. 35, 36. This show of political will in a sporting context was not welcomed by some, and for a brief time the United States, the inaugural winner of the cup, announced their decision to withdraw from the competition entirely due to the apparent lenience of the tournament's organisers to prevent defaults by teams. In a show of solidarity, Great Britain and France also announced their intentions to withdraw. In response, the Davis Cup committee made a greater commitment to keep politics out of the competition and disqualified the Soviet Union, which had refused to play against Chile in the 1976 Inter-Zonal semifinals and had already been barred from competing in the Federation Cup for refusing to play against South Africa and Rhodesia, from the tournament. Proposals were also brought forward to bring in an automatic one-year ban for any nation which pulled out of the tournament after the draw had been made, in an effort to prevent teams from defaulting on political grounds. The United States, Great Britain and France all eventually returned and competed in the 1977 tournament.

It was released on November 8, 2000, in Japan, while the US version was released on July 10, 2001, by Nettwerk. A departure from Ivy's previous studio albums Realistic (1995) and Apartment Life (1997), Long Distance was influenced by new wave, but maintained Ivy's signature blend of indie pop and indie rock music. Ivy collaborated with long-time producer Peter Nashel for two of the album's tracks, while the rest were written and produced entirely by members Andy Chase and Adam Schlesinger. Long Distance received positive reviews upon its release. Many critics favored Ivy's new approach, although some found it less interesting compared to the material on Apartment Life. Three singles were released from the album. \\"Lucy Doesn't Love You\\" and \\"Disappointed\\" were both commercially unsuccessful, while the album's third single, \\"Edge of the Ocean\\", appeared in numerous films and television programs and has since been considered the band's signature song. The songs \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Worry About You\\" were also used in media; the latter track was used as the theme song for the ABC miniseries Kingdom Hospital. Promotional music videos were created for both \\"Lucy Doesn't Love You\\" and \\"Edge of the Ocean\\".  Development  Shortly after the release of Apartment Life (1997), Ivy began work on a new studio album; however, the band was dropped by their label, Epic Records, shortly after the reissue of Apartment Life was released. After the end of their contract with Epic, and lead singer Dominique Durand's pregnancy, the New York City studio where Ivy regularly recorded music burned down. In order to forget about these events, Ivy resumed recording sessions, and began incorporating influences from new wave. Member Adam Schlesinger detailed the album's exploration of different genres: \\"The first songs [we] recorded were jangly and simple and straight-ahead. We started gravitating toward the groovier, slightly more melancholy stuff. It works well with Dominique's voice.\\" According to Schlesinger, Ivy then signed with Nettwerk because \\"their roster was similar to Ivy across the board\\". After being released prematurely in Japan on November 8, 2000, the album was a quick success. Nettwerk's head of marketing, Marie Scheibert, stated that Long Distance became one of Amazon.com's top imports. The album was released in the United States on July 10, 2001, eight months later. During recording sessions, Durand, Schlesinger and fellow band member Andy Chase decided \\"to go one hundred percent\\" on one of the tracks, which would later become \\"Edge of the Ocean\\". Ivy stated that the song, which would later be released as the album's third single, was created in hopes that it would \\"mean the difference between making our next album or not\\". Along with \\"Edge of the Ocean\\", the trio started writing songs that were \\"less atmospheric\\" than those on Apartment Life, but contained more \\"infectious melodies\\", which the band preferred.  Composition  Long Distance opens with \\"Undertow\\", a track featuring \\"pastoral tones\\" layered with \\"a lifting guitar frame\\"; Tom Topkoff of Hybrid Magazine noted that Durand's vocals have \\"aged like a fine wine\\". The single \\"Disappointed\\", the \\"fast-paced\\" second track, consists of a \\"taut rhythm and slinky guitars\\" that \\"provide a sleekly sexy backdrop for Durand's wistful vocals\\". Its sound was compared to Ivy's previous tracks on Realistic (1995) and Apartment Life (1997), particularly the songs \\"No Guarantee\\" and \\"I Get the Message\\". The next song, \\"Edge of the Ocean\\", is an indie pop and trip hop song, and has been called a \\"captivating and escapist tune\\". Since its release, it has been commonly referred to as one of Ivy's signature songs, including by Ivy themselves. \\"Blame It on Yourself\\" is a \\"memorable\\" track, with instrumentation provided by distorted guitars. The fifth track, \\"While We're in Love\\", is a trip hop-inspired track, with the singer and her partner realizing, \\"We know it won't last forever / Because we're not meant to be together\\". \\"While We're in Love\\" uses keyboards that add a groovy feeling to \\"fill out the sound more than ever before\\". The album's lead single, \\"Lucy Doesn't Love You\\", uses 1960s-style horns with \\"jangly guitars\\" to reintroduce Ivy's signature indie pop style into the album. It has a \\"sassy brass and lifting melody,\\" accompanied by electric guitars to create an \\"atmospheric\\" mood. According to Tom Topkoff of Hybrid Magazine, \\"Worry About You\\" is Ivy's \\"furthest departure from their tried and true practice\\". The composition is relatively ambient, with \\"Portishead styled ethereal-dub characteristics\\". \\"Let's Stay Inside\\", the album's eighth song, uses keyboard and acoustic guitar instrumentation to provide a \\"comforting\\" feeling; \\"bossa nova-tinged\\", it results in an \\"intimate approach\\". \\"Midnight Sun\\" and \\"I Think of You\\" both use violins and organs to achieve a sense of effortlessness. The violins are headed by Ivy's longtime partner James Iha. The next track, \\"Hideaway\\", is another \\"escapist tune\\", featuring \\"Durand's sensually emotive vocals\\". The album's 12th track, \\"One More Last Kiss\\", contains longing lyrics discussing Durand's final moments with a lover. Its composition consists of guitar passages similar to the majority of those on the album. A cover of The Blow Monkeys' \\"Digging Your Scene\\" concludes the standard edition of the album, with its production sounding \\"natural\\", as if it was an original Ivy track.  Promotion  While Ivy did not heavily promote the album through live appearances, several tracks from Long Distance were featured in various television series and films. \\"Edge of the Ocean\\" was used in the movies Angel Eyes, Music and Lyrics and Shallow Hal, and the television series Grey's Anatomy and Veronica Mars. \\"Worry About You\\" served as the theme song for the ABC drama series Kingdom Hospital, and was featured on the CBS sci-fi series The 4400, and its soundtrack. \\"Lucy Doesn't Love You\\" was played in the similarly titled 2002 film I'm with Lucy, while \\"One More Last Kiss\\" was in the 2002 movie Insomnia. \\"Digging Your Scene\\" was released as a radio single and sent to modern rock radio stations in June 2001. In 2002, the single received a proper release to promote Ivy's fourth studio album, Guestroom. Ivy visited various record stores throughout the US and Japan to promote the album, including at Sam Goody locations and in the West Village in New York City. Ivy's touring schedule coincided with the re-released version of Apartment Life, on September 18, 2001. = Singles = Ivy released four singles from Long Distance. In late 2000, \\"Lucy Doesn't Love You\\" was released as the album's lead single. Two CD singles were issued in Japan, the first contained B-side track \\"Blame It on Yourself\\", while the second additionally contained \\"Digging Your Scene\\". The track received favorable reviews from critics, and a music video was filmed in 2000 to promote the song. The album's second single, \\"Disappointed\\", was released as a radio single on July 10, 2001. Similarly, the track received positive feedback, and was promoted by a live performance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2001. Third single \\"Edge of the Ocean\\" was also released on July 10, 2001, in the US. Compared to their previous work, the single was both a critical and commercial success, appearing in several television series and films, and peaking at No. 160 on the UK Singles Chart. Its accompanying music video became Ivy's most-watched clip on the video-sharing website YouTube.  Critical reception  Long Distance received positive reviews upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on nine reviews. Jonathan Cohen of Billboard commented that \\"Durand's sensual vocals are beguiling as ever\\" and favored singles \\"Disappointed\\" and \\"Edge of the Ocean\\". A critic from Resonance magazine praised the album for \\"stay[ing] true to the belief that guitar pop can have cool, utopian sounds without bringing in a truckload of keyboards and sequencers\\". A Launch.com reviewer stated that \\"no one else stateside is currently making pop quite this lush and lovely,\\" but disapproved of the track \\"Undertow\\" for being \\"short of perfection\\". One of E! Online's music critics declared \\"Lucy Doesn't Love You\\" a summer anthem and predicted that Long Distance would increase Ivy's popularity. Critics from both Rolling Stone and Blender made strong comparisons between Long Distance and the English musical duo Everything but the Girl. The former stated that \\"any fan of Everything but the Girl, Saint Etienne or vintage Blondie should find plenty to swoon over\\", while the latter called the sound \\"cloudy and distant, [but it] takes tentative steps toward Everything but the Girl\\". In a more mixed review, a critic from SonicNet stated that \\"Ivy specialize[s] in nebulously oriented dream-pop: too ethereal for straight pop fans, too structured for the 4AD crowd.\\" In a divided review, Michaelangelo Matos of City Pages noted that he preferred Ivy's previous releases, but stated, \\"If your band had spent four years getting dropped and picked up and dropped again by record labels, you'd sound tired too.\\" Similarly, a reviewer from Alternative Press was negative, expressing that \\"the 13 tracks here are improbably edgeless, all love-me-do/love-me-don't plaints that evaporate on impact\\".

Car Wars is a clone of the 1979 Sega/Gremlin arcade game Head On.\\"The TI-99/4A Arcade: Arcade Clones\\" from Retrogaming Times Monthly The player controls a car starting at the bottom of the screen and navigates it through an open grid full of dots. The object is to collect all the dots while avoiding crashing into other cars. The player's car is always moving counter-clockwise. The player, who can never stop the car or change direction, is only able to control the relative speed of the car and move the car across one or two lines of the grid. Gameplay During the play of the game, the player is represented by a red car, and the computer, at the beginning, uses a yellow car. The player's car always moves counterclockwise around the board, and the computer's cars move clockwise. There are five \\"lanes,\\" each of which forms a circumference around the board. The outer lanes are larger than the inner ones. The lanes (from inner to outer) have 4, 20, 36, 52, and 68 dots respectively. Each lane is divided into four sectors, with breaks at the 12:00, 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 points. It is at these locations where lane-changing is possible. The player has the ability to switch up to two lanes at each break, while the computer's cars can only switch one lane at a time. In the center of the screen is a \\"pit,\\" where spare cars are displayed. The game begins with two cars in the pit. When a level is cleared, a new car is added to the pit, and bonus points are scored. When a crash occurs, a car is removed from the pit. A maximum of four cars can occupy the pit at any given time. If a level is cleared with four cars in the pit, bonus points are scored, but no new cars are added. When the game starts, the player's red car and the computer's yellow car face off back-to-back at the bottom of the screen (6:00 position), and start off moving in the opposite direction. The player has the ability to speed up at any time by pressing the joystick button. The object is to clear all 180 dots from the board, which will result in bonus points, a new car being added to the pit (unless full), and advancement to the next level. The maximum score is 99,990. The game ends when the player crashes into a computer car while no spare cars are in the pit. After one level is cleared, the starting position of the computer's yellow car moves to the left of the screen (9:00 position). When the second screen is cleared, the yellow car moves back to its original position, but the computer adds a new blue car, which starts at the left. After this level is cleared, the blue car shifts to the second-outermost lane. On the fifth level, the computer adds a third car, which is green. The three cars start at different positions, depending on the level. No new cars are added from this point on. =Options= Prior to the game, the player can select playing options from a menu. These determine the speed of the player's and computer's cars and when the computer cars speed up. There are three speeds, identified as creepin', fast, and flyin'. Both the player and the computer will move at the selected speed. The three speed-up options are titled late, early, and look-out!. The computer's cars speed up after clearing 150, 120, and 90 dots, respectively.

Dagon 1 offers classes from kindergarten to tenth standard (recently renamed Grade 1 to Grade 11) to about 6500 students. Attended almost exclusively by the children of the wealthy, Dagon 1 has some of the best educational facilities available in a Burmese private school. The school routinely sends a disproportionate share of students to the country's most selective universities each year. Its most famous alumna is the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Many of the Burmese entertainment industry's top stars are Dagon 1 alumni. Dagon 1 in recent year has lost some of its appeal as a top school as ultra-wealthy parents now send their children to expensive English language medium \\"international\\" private schools. The school's main colonial era building is on the Yangon City Heritage List.  History  Music Festival of Dagon1 in 2004 The school was founded in 1882 as Methodist Episcopal Girls School on Lewis Street (now Seikkantha Street). In 1894, the school was moved to its current campus on the corner of Lancaster Road (now Nawaday Road) and Signal Pagoda Road, and was also renamed Methodist English Girls High School. The school consisted primarily of a three-story Victorian- era style building long and wide. At first, boys were accepted only in the elementary level (from K to 3). During the interwar period, boys were allowed from K to 4. Just before World War II, the school had 55 students. The school was closed down for 6 years after World War II and later reopened in May, 1947. The principal, Mrs. Logie, repaired the school buildings that were destroyed during the war. At that time, the school began to prepare its students not only for the matriculation exam but also for the GCE (General Certificate of Education) exam from the University of London. In 1951, the number of students increased to 850 and the four-story Kindergarten building (113'√ó51') with 15 rooms was built in 1952 to accommodate the students. The school's name was Methodist English High School (MEHS). On 14 April 1965, the institution was nationalized and became a public school and has been operated by the government ever since. In 1986, a new three-story building (90'√ó34') was built to correspond to the increased number of students. The school is currently running under the Department of Basic Education which is directly controlled by the Ministry of Education. During 1988 democracy uprising, Dagon1 was one of the first high schools in Burma to form student union and participate in the protest boycott marches. Throughout the uprising, members of Dagon1 student union lead their fellow students and teachers in various protest marches. Dagon1 protest column can be clearly distinguished amongst other columns by their Green Flag with White Fighting Peacock emblem, former official flag of All Burma Federation of Student Unions and the green and white represents the uniform colours of high school students. After September 1988 coup by the military, some of dagon1 students went to Thai-Burma border and joined All Burma Student Democratic Front (ABSDF) to achieve democracy and human rights in Burma through armed struggle.  Student body  Dagon 1 has the largest student body in Yangon and in Myanmar, numbering near 6,600. A high student-to-teacher ratio exists, like most of the schools in Myanmar. The students are spread across eleven standards or grades, from Grade 1 (formerly Kindergarten) to Grade 11 (formerly Tenth Standard). Because an increasing demand for enrollment at the school, Dagon 1's student body is in the shape of a pyramid, with the number of younger students outnumbering that of older students. New classes are formed to handle the increased enrollment each year.  Uniform  Like all public schools in Myanmar, Dagon-1 requires that students wear the school uniform at all times. There are two sets of uniform, one for wear from Kindergarten to 5th Standard (Grades 1 to 6), and another, more traditional one for wear from the 6th Standard to 10th Standard (Grades 7 to 11). But all uniforms are of the same colour - a white shirt or blouse, with a green garment for the torso. = School badge = A circular badge, bearing an oil lamp (representing wisdom and education), with a circular cogwheel and a rice plant together with the school's name. Inside the cogwheel, there are 5 coloured sections: Orange, Yellow, Green, Red and Blue representing the school council team colors. = Boys uniform = * From Grade 1 to the Grade 6, male students are required to wear a white shirt (with or without the collar), tucked into a green long pants. Tee shirts and sports shirts are not acceptable. Shoes and the traditional slipper, Hnyat-phanat are permitted as footwear. * From the Grade 7 onwards, the students have to wear a white shirt (with or without the collar), and a green paso. Only the Hnyat- phanat is permitted. Traditional Mandalay slippers, usually of velvet or other materials, are worn. = Girls uniform = * From Grade 1 to Grade 5, girls can wear either skirts or pants, with a white shirt. Girls usually wear slippers. * For Grade 6 onwards, the uniform also becomes more traditional like its male counterpart. The girl must wear only the side opening (yin- phone) traditional Burmese blouse, with the Htamein as the lower garment.  Accomplishments  It ranks the highest overall in Burmese High School in the University Entrance Examination, conducted by the Board of Examinations. Dagon-1's student body produces many high scoring students both in terms of collective subjects and individual subjects, making into the very competitive \\"nationwide outstanding top-ten students' list\\", colloquially known as the whole-Burma or top ten list quite often. Although Myanmar's education system is extremely academic oriented, Dagon-1 has been able to produce some good athletes and artists. Dagon 1 has produced many nationally selected athletes, in the fields of swimming, football (soccer), sailing, wushu, and badminton, have won medals in both national and international competitions, such as South East Asian Games. Many students have also won medals in \\"Myanmar Traditional and Cultural Performing Arts Competition\\" (So-Ka-Yay-Tee) and win painting competitions. In 2011, the top nine scorers of the 2011 Matriculation Exam came from Dagon 1. In 2015, the four of the top 10 scorers in the 2015 Matriculation Exam came from Dagon 1.  Renovations  Due to increasing number of students, a new seven-story building was built in front of the soccer field. To build this building, an old cafeteria building was demolished. With the rising use of the internet and government promotion of information technology, two IT labs have been added to the campus facilities. The Dagon Thiri hall, Chemistry Lab, Physics Lab and Biology Labs are renovated in 2004 for the practical classes. A new cafeteria building was also built and renovated year by year. Security cameras were also installed within the school campus. Some classrooms had been renovated and installed air- conditioners donated by students.

It is a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The acquisition of XTO Energy in 2010 made ExxonMobil the largest producer of natural gas in the U.S. Since then, XTO Energy's resource portfolio has tripled through several acquisitions. The company owns interests in approximately 40,000 active oil and natural gas sites across North America. Corporate overview XTO Energy is an energy producer based in Fort Worth, Texas which has operated as a subsidiary of ExxonMobil since 2010. It is involved with the production, processing, transportation, and development of oil and natural gas resources. The company specializes in developing shale gas via unconventional means like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. XTO Energy owns interests in approximately 40,000 active oil and natural gas sites across North America, with locations in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming and Western Canada. History =Early history= XTO Energy was founded in 1986, and was initially called Cross Timbers Oil Company. The company was started by Bob R. Simpson, Steve Palko and Jon Brumley with US$35 million raised by former Goldman Sachs co-chairman Robert Rubin. Initially, the company purchased and developed long-lived oil and gas production properties. The company went public in 1993. In 1996, Bob R. Simpson, one of the company's founders, became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Simpson received his undergraduate and master's degrees in finance from Baylor University. After Simpson took over, the company changed its strategy, from an even split of oil production and natural gas to focusing more heavily on natural gas. In June 2001, the company changed its name from Cross Timbers Oil Company to XTO Energy Inc., to reflect the company's new focus on natural gas rather than oil. \\"XTO\\" was chosen as it was the company's stock ticker symbol. The company continued to grow through the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties, and in 2002 XTO Energy was ranked 5th on Fortune's \\"100 Fastest Growing Companies\\" list. =ExxonMobil purchase= On December 14, 2009, ExxonMobil agreed to acquire XTO Energy Inc. through a merger. ExxonMobil acquired XTO Energy in a deal valued at $36 billion, involving the issuance of 416 million shares of stock and assuming the company's $11 billion in debt. The deal increased ExxonMobil's U.S. natural gas production to 3.68 billion cubic feet per day, making it the largest producer in the U.S. The purchase by ExxonMobil was the largest by the company since the deal that created ExxonMobil in 1999. The acquisition was finalized in June 2010. =2011 - present= In June 2011, ExxonMobil acquired two natural gas companies in Pennsylvania‚ÄîPhillips Resources Inc. and TWP Inc.‚Äîfor $1.69 billion. After the acquisition, both companies were managed by XTO Energy. The acquisition added about 317,000 acres in Marcellus Shale to ExxonMobil's portfolio. In August of the same year, ExxonMobil leveraged XTO Energy's expertise in a trade with Russian oil company Rosneft in a deal worth $3.2 billion, giving ExxonMobil access to oil and gas opportunities in the Russian Arctic. In September 2012, ExxonMobil and XTO Energy signed a land exchange agreement with Denbury Onshore LLC, acquiring 196,000 acres in the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana. In exchange for the acreage, Denbury Onshore received $1.6 billion in cash and operating interests in the Hartzog Draw Field in Wyoming and the Webster Field in Texas. During 2013, XTO Energy expanded its production in the Appalachian region of the U.S. by nearly 30%. In February 2014, XTO Energy agreed to let American Energy‚ÄìUtica LLC buy into 30,000 acres of its holdings in the Utica Shale located in the Harrison, Jefferson and Belmont counties of Ohio. , the size of XTO Energy's resource portfolio had tripled since it was acquired by ExxonMobil in 2010. In August 2015, Exxon Mobil Corporation signed two agreements to drill on 48,000 acres in the core of the Midland Basin to be operated by XTO Energy. XTO operates 11 horizontal and four vertical rigs across 1.5 million net acres in Texas' Permian Basin. Charitable contributions In 2008, XTO Energy began supporting Navarro College's petroleum technology certificate program. Since 2009, XTO Energy has partnered with Habitat for Humanity to build homes in Fort Worth. In 2010, XTO Energy and ExxonMobil gave a $5 million grant to Colorado State University to fund studies on the impact of oil and gas drilling on wildlife. The grant resulted in 20 research projects. In April 2013, XTO Energy gave $100,000 to Butler County Community College. The funds helped establish a petroleum technology training center. Also in 2013, XTO Energy donated $200,000 to the American Red Cross to support efforts to help Colorado communities with natural disaster protection and recovery. In April 2014, XTO Energy donated $25,000 in the form of grants to Westmoreland County Community College in Pittsburgh to help students enrolled in the Petroleum Industrial Processing Operations Technology program offset tuition and travel costs, as well as purchase equipment for the school. Also in 2014, XTO Energy donated 21 historic Navajo blankets to the Farmington Museum in New Mexico; the blankets were valued at $175,000. In 2015, XTO contributed $5 million to the North Dakota Housing Incentive Fund, supporting the construction of low- cost apartments for teachers and emergency personnel. The donation was the largest since the fund was established in 2011. Regulatory issues  In July 2013, XTO agreed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to pay a $100,000 fine for a November 2010 water spill at a Pennsylvania water recycling operation. In September 2013, the Pennsylvania Attorney General filed criminal charges against XTO, stemming from this incident. In October 2013, the federal Office of Natural Resources Revenue issued a $648,000 civil penalty against XTO for not providing data regarding a federal lease in Kansas. XTO has stated that it did provide the required records, but that the process was time consuming. As of 2013, XTO Energy had requested a hearing on the matter. In April 2015, a study published by researchers at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in Dallas allegedly connected two XTO-operated wastewater disposal wells with a series of earthquakes in Azle, Texas, occurring in 2013. In August 2015, preliminary findings by investigators with the Texas Railroad Commission found a disposal well operated near Azle by XTO Energy was unlikely to have caused the seismic activity, which contradicted the SMU study. In November 2015, the final decision by the Texas Railroad Commission unanimously agreed with hearing examiners that there was not enough evidence to support findings that the wells contributed to seismic activity and that XTO should be able to maintain its permit for the wells.

It is the official historical museum of San Francisco. The SFMHS conducts walking tours of San Francisco and holds monthly programs, tours, and special events. History The San Francisco Historical Society was originally founded in 1988 by historian Charles A. Fracchia. It is a membership-based organization focused on programs and publications, and owns the Barbary Coast Trail walking tour. From 2002 until 2019, it was called the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society, created from the merger of two organizations. The Museum of the City of San Francisco was founded in 1991 by the late Gladys Hansen, former city archivist of San Francisco. It had a small exhibit space at The Cannery (a former Del Monte fruit-canning plant that is now a shopping center) until 2000, when it lost its lease. It then had temporary exhibits at Pier 45 (near Fisherman's Wharf) and at San Francisco City Hall. The two organizations merged in February 2002. One of the purposes of the merger was so that they could put together one proposal to renovate and operate the Old Mint as a history museum. However, the Museum of the City of San Francisco's original web site, operated directly by Gladys Hansen, remained independent, and in 2003 renamed itself as the Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco. Hansen's personal research collection of artifacts from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake also remained in her possession. The San Francisco Museum and Historical Society took over management of the Old San Francisco Mint in 2004, with plans to make it the museum's permanent home. The City of San Francisco proclaimed SFMHS as the official historical museum of San Francisco. The organization spent about US$14 million to stabilize and partially renovate the building. However, the building still needed about US$60 million in additional work, and the City of San Francisco concluded the organization was not making progress quickly enough after 11 years of work, so it ordered the SFMHS to vacate the building in 2015. In 2019 the organization returned to its original name, The San Francisco Historical Society, which still has the mission to preserve, interpret, and present San Francisco history. SFHS remains active in the community and today has just under 2,000 members.

In addition to their substantial wealth and social standing, they are remembered for setting up the first Malay newspaper in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and China, the Jawi Peranakan and their influences on Malay culture. History Since Penang and Singapore's founding in 1786 and 1819, the number of South Asian immigrants to these colonies grew rapidly. Many were South Indian men. However, Jawi Peranakan ancestry does include a large number of other South Asians, from northern India and Pakistan. Women travelled to Singapore only from the 1860s, and even then in small numbers. This led to a shortage of South Asian brides, and so South Asian Muslim men often married Malay Muslim women. The descendants of these unions were called Jawi Peranakan. \\"Jawi\\" is an Arabic word to denote Southeast Asia, while Peranakan is a Malay word meaning \\"born of\\" (it also refers to the elite, locally born Chinese). More broadly, South Asian Muslims without mixed parentage but born in the Straits Settlements were sometimes also called Jawi Peranakan, as were children from Arab-Malay marriages. Similar terms for mixed Malay-South Asian people were \\"Jawi Pekan\\" (mostly used in Penang). Jawi Peranakan families were found throughout Malaysia, especially Penang, and Singapore. Description The Jawi Peranakan chose their spouses carefully, screening prospective matches for wealth and status, rather than racial origins. This enabled intermarriage between Jawi Peranakan and other prosperous local Muslim communities, like the Arabs, Indians and the Malay aristocrats. Despite assimilating into the Malay culture, the Jawi Peranakan maintained a distinct identity which was captured in their architecture, clothing, jewelry and cuisine. Also, the community placed a strong emphasis on getting an English education, especially since many Jawi Peranakans hold Colonial Government jobs. Culturally, they contributed to the arts scene of the region, especially in music. The Jawi Peranakan were enterprising and progressive and by the late 19th century, they had accumulated considerable wealth and status and contributed to the economy as merchants and landlords. They were also literate and English-educated, easily qualifying for government jobs. A group of Jawi Peranakan financed the first Malay language newspaper, the Jawi-Peranakan. Its first editor was Munsyi Mohamed Said Bin Dada Mohiddin, a South Indian Muslim who remained as editor for 12 years, from 1876 to 1888. Demise of the community There are a few Jawi Peranakan families left in Singapore and Malaysia, especially Penang, which used to be their largest settlement. However, most today register as Malays. The loss of their identity is due to various causes. Economically, other competing mercantile groups were emerging. The Great Depression led many Jawi Peranakan business empires to bankruptcy and a severe fall in rent collected by landlords. Over time, the Jawi Peranakan grew increasingly dependent on government and clerical jobs. By the turn of the 20th century, the political climate favoured the Malays. As the largest racial group and the indigenous people of Malaya, they were seen as the natural successors to the British, with the waning of the British Empire. Projecting an identity that was distinctly apart from the Malays was therefore not expedient. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Jawi Peranakan were also criticised for their brand of religious belief of Hanafi Islam which different from Shafi'i Islam practised by the Malays. Furthermore, the Jawi Peranakan tended to be reformist and they challenged the authority of Malay royalty in religious matters. Most were born and bred in the Straits Settlements, and had never been a subject of the Sultan. They therefore lacked this political and cultural quality which was seen to define a \\"true Malay\\". Descendants In colonial Singapore and British Malaya, the Jawi Peranakan remain a community held in high regard by the local Malays primarily due to the educational achievements and the wealth inherited. Families such as the Angullias have left their mark on modern day Singapore with places like Angullia Park near Singapore's famous Orchard Road still bearing the name of the clan. Other families include the Maricars or Maricans. While due to the intermarriage with other Muslim communities, many of their descendants inherited an Arab (Syed, Sayyid) or to some extent Malay surnames (Tengku, Wan, Megat). Many whom are married to the Malays have also dropped their surnames since most Malays practised a Patronym naming system.

History  In March 1936, the Hammarlund Manufacturing Company initiated the first of the famous \\"Super-Pro\\" line, the SP-10 receiver, followed in January 1937 by the SP-100. Their efforts to improve the design resulted in October 1939 with the SP-200 series, an 18-tube, single conversion superhet receiver.http://www.radioblvd.com/Pre- WWII%20Ham%20Gear.htm Western Historic Radio Museumhttp://www.antiqueradios.org/gazette/superpro.htm AntiqueRadios.org The SP-200 series Super-Pro receivers were manufactured through 1945, with thousands delivered to the military during World War II; they saw wide use by the U.S. Signal Corps as the BC-779.

From 1946 to 1948, Hammarlund produced the SP-400 Super Pro for the amateur radio market. In 1947 the SP-600 Super-Pro receiver, which surpassed the SP-200 in performance, was introduced.

I just... wanted the audience to understand it's worth making the effort, whether you win or lose.\\" Kennedy replied, \\"Well, that's what I think.\\"Schlesinger, Arthur M. (1978; 1990). Robert Kennedy and His Times. Ballantine Books. It was actually Robert Kennedy's favorite song. One of Kennedy's close friends, Andy Williams, was one of many vocal artists of the Sixties that recorded the song. The song was also a favorite of younger brother Ted Kennedy and was performed by Brian Stokes Mitchell at his memorial service in 2009. The song was a favorite of Philippine hero Evelio Javier, the assassinated governor of the province of Antique in the Philippines, and the song has become a symbol of his sacrifice for democracy. Javier was shot and killed in the plaza of San Jose, Antique, during the counting following the 1986 Snap Elections, an act which contributed to the peaceful overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos by Cory Aquino in the People Power Revolution. Every year, Javier is remembered on Evelio Javier Day and the song is featured. The song's lyrics are written in brass on a monument in the plaza where he was shot.

Modernism had emerged as a generic term to replace Post-Impressionism for the paintings of Manet, C√©zanne, van Gogh, and Gauguin. According to Smith, the key emphasis in such work is the importance of form and flatness. The term was soon applied also in architecture (e.g. Frank Lloyd Wright and Walter Gropius) and sculpture (e.g. Epstein and Br√¢ncu»ôi). After 1960, Modernism was displaced by Postmodernism, and then by the art still at present referred to as \\"contemporary art\\". Since Modernism is no longer \\"modern\\", Smith argues that it requires a more appropriate period style name to distinguish it: hence his introduction of Formalesque. Like \\"romanesque\\" and \\"arabesque\\", the name is intended to indicate a style that arose by the development of a basic interest in form (but without the specific connotations of the term Formalism).

It criticises Australian immigration policy and the direction in which it is pushing the country. The book examines the way policy developed in the 1970s and 1980s and explores what Blainey views as the disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration to Australia since the mid-1970s. In All for Australia, Blainey argues: * For the sake of national unity, the typical nation practises discrimination against migrants on the basis of ethnicity. Ironically, the Asian countries that Australia is too afraid to \\"offend\\" have no hesitation in using that right to retain their current ethnic compositions. * Every nation relies on a sense of community belonging, which can easily be damaged by the rapid entry of foreign people who unintentionally erode national cohesion. * Immigration is one of the most important issues facing a nation. The notion that it is too contentious to be publicly debated makes a mockery of democracy. * Multiculturalism tends to emphasise the rights of ethnic minorities at the expense of the majority of Australians, thus unnecessarily encouraging division and threatening social cohesion. * The policy of multiculturalism has tended to be implicitly anti-British, despite Australia's British colonial heritage and the large number of British immigrants to Australia after World War II. * Australian immigration policy has moved from one extreme to another, from a policy that sought to encourage European immigration and restrict Asian immigration (White Australia policy) to a policy that now gives disproportionate preference to Asian immigration. Blainey asserts that the preferential treatment of Asian immigrants arose partly from a sense of guilt over the Vietnam War, but it also reflected Canberra's misguided view that more trade with Asian countries would come with a larger Asian population.

It is situated on the eastern foothills of Mount Kembla as is its southern neighbour Farmborough Heights. Its northern boundary of housing is along Cordeaux Road which goes to Mount Kembla Village. Cordeaux Heights has several shops, including a cafe, supermarket/takeaway, bottle shop, hairdresser, dentist and pizzeria. History Up to 1973, the area which today is the site of Cordeaux Heights, was made up of 3 dairy farms, and had been grazed extensively. At this time, the farms were purchased by R. W. Sheargold Pty. Ltd., for the potential development of a new suburb (R.W. Sheargold, 1974). In 1974, a feasibility study was carried out by the company Golder, Moss Associates, Consulting Geotechnical Engineers. In April, 1979, Wollongong City Council formulated a Development Strategy ‚Äì Cordeaux Heights Estate, to be put to a Special Meeting of council held on 9 April 1979. The area of land released was sufficient to provide housing and amenities for up to 5,000 people (Forbes and Associates, 1978; Dunk, K.R., 1979). The plan was based on road and allotment layout being primarily dictated by pedestrian movement within the neighbourhood. The suburb was to include dedicated open space of not less than 3 hectares per 1,000 head of population, to cater for active and passive recreational activities. The developer was also required to construct a new section of road to facilitate access to and within the new suburb. The road layout and design was based on a hierarchical function of roads, conforming to the road strategy in the Unanderra area, with main distributors (Central Road and Cordeaux Road), and minor collector roads to service the area. Such things as bus routes, services (schools), accessibility around the suburb by both cars and pedestrians, and protection of the environment, were all factored into the development (Dunk, K.R., 1979). Cordeaux Heights was named after William Cordeaux (1792‚àí1839), an early resident and land commissioner.

The Soviet Union's Red Army raised divisions during the Russian Civil War, and again during the interwar period from 1926. Few of the Civil War divisions were retained into this period, and even fewer survived the reorganization of the Red Army during the 1937‚Äì1941 period. During the Second World War 400 'line' rifle divisions (infantry), 129 Soviet Guards rifle divisions, and over 50 cavalry divisions as well as many divisions of other combat support arms were raised in addition to the hundreds of divisions that existed in the Red Army before Operation Barbarossa. Almost all the pre-war mechanized and tank divisions were disbanded during the war. There were also Red Air Force aviation divisions, and the NKVD divisions which also took part in fighting. The territorial principle of manning the Red Army was introduced in the mid-1920s. In each region able-bodied men were called up for a limited period of active duty in a territorial unit, which comprised about half the Army's strength, each year, for five years.Scott and Scott, 1979, p.12 The first call-up period was for three months, with one month a year thereafter. A regular cadre provided a stable nucleus. By 1925 this system provided 46 of the 77 infantry divisions and one of the eleven cavalry divisions. The remainder consisted of regular officers and enlisted personnel serving two-year stints. The territorial system was finally abolished, with all remaining formations converted to the other 'cadre' divisions, in 1937 and 1938.David Glantz, Colossus Reborn: The Red Army at War 1941‚Äì43, University Press of Kansas, 2005, p. 717 note 5.

Cavalry Divisions Cavalry divisions in the Red Army were first formed in the early days of the Russian Civil War. The Red cavalry played a key role in the war, as the relatively small size of the forces involved and the large open spaces were ideal for mobile cavalry operations. 27 cavalry divisions were formed during the war, of which all but eleven were disbanded after the end of the war in 1921. The Red Army's cavalry forces was gradually expanded during the interwar period, reaching a peak in 1936, when the Red Army included 36 cavalry divisions. However, the increasing demand for mechanized units resulted in drastic reductions in the Red Army cavalry force during the last few years before the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. At the time of the German invasion, there were nine regular cavalry divisions and four mountain cavalry divisions in the Red Army. The rapid destruction of Soviet mechanized forces in the summer and autumn of 1941 resulted in a rapid expansion of cavalry units to provide the Red Army a mobile, if not armored, force. This expansion produced some 87 new cavalry divisions by early 1942, many of which were later disbanded as the Red Army rebuilt its tank and mechanized formations. 17 of the cavalry divisions were granted Guards status and renumbered accordingly. At the start of the conflict, a cavalry division had some 9,000 men; by 1945, they were authorized 6,000 men and often organized into corps of three divisions that were reinforced by artillery, tank, and assault gun elements.Red Army Handbook, Chapter 3. For 5 GCD, see also thread at Axis History Forum for more details After the end of World War II, the remaining 26 cavalry divisions were mostly converted into mechanized and tank units or disbanded.

Tank Divisions The Red Army tank divisions of the Great Patriotic War (1941‚Äì1945) were short-lived. In the face of the German invasion of 1941, many poorly maintained vehicles were abandoned, and those that did meet the Germans in battle were defeated by the superior training, doctrine, and radio communications of the Panzertruppe. The magnitude of the defeat was so great that the mechanized corps parent headquarters of the tank divisions were either inactivated or destroyed by July 1941. Most of the tank divisions facing the Germans had met a similar fate by the end of 1941. The Soviets opted to organize more easily controlled tank brigades instead, eventually combining many of these into three-brigade tank corps in 1942, an organizational structure that served them until the end of the war. Until late in the war, two tank divisions remained in the Far East, serving in the Transbaikal Military District. *1st Tank Division ‚Äì with 1st Mechanised Corps in Jun 1941. *2nd Tank Division ‚Äì formed June‚ÄìJuly 1940.

Early life Dodds was born in Durham, England, the son of William Dodds and his wife Annie, n√©e Shute. The family moved to Hobart, Tasmania, arriving in 1853. His father died soon afterwards and Dodds was educated in Hobart. At 16 years old he began to study law, was admitted to the bar in 1872, and in a few years had a large practice. He took an active part in sport and was a good oarsman and cricketer. Career In 1878 Dodds was asked to stand for parliament, was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly for East Hobart, and was given a seat in the William L. Crowther ministry as attorney-general in December 1878. When W. R. Giblin formed his coalition ministry in October 1879 Dodds held the same position until December 1881, when he exchanged it for that of colonial treasurer. Giblin retired from politics in August 1884 and Dodds became attorney-general under Adye Douglas until March 1886, when Douglas went to London as Agent-general. Douglas recommended that Sir James W. Agnew should be asked to form a ministry, but he could not do so because Dodds, who was the leader of the assembly, felt that he should have been sent for. Dodds then succeeded in forming a ministry, and having established the principle, stood aside and Agnew became premier. It was, however, felt by many that Dodds, who took the portfolio of attorney-general, was the real leader of the government. In 1887 he was appointed one of the representatives of Tasmania at the colonial conference held at London, and while on the voyage was offered and accepted the position of puisne judge of the supreme court. He held this position for 12 years and in 1898 was appointed chief justice. Five years later he became lieutenant-governor and administered the government on several occasions. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1889, was knighted 22 January 1900, and created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) 15 May 1901, in preparation of the forthcoming royal visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary). Legacy Dodds died in his home on 23 June 1914. He married Minna Augusta, daughter of the Rev. James Norman, who predeceased him. He was survived by two sons. Dodds was in office for practically the whole of his nine years in parliament and did some excellent work, succeeding in obtaining reductions in mail subsidies, and reducing the rates for postages and telegrams. Dodds was also responsible for the establishment of post office savings banks. He was regarded as a very capable judge. As chief justice and lieutenant-governor his duties were always admirably discharged, and as chancellor of the university, president of the Art and other societies, he did much to foster the cultural life of Hobart.

They are located in Urbana Township, on the border of the U.S. city of Urbana, Illinois and on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. The University of Illinois was home to one of the Agricultural Experiment Stations, located at U.S. universities, which were at the heart of the promotion of the round barn. At least one round barn in Illinois was built specifically after its owner viewed the barns at the university. Though originally an experiment the three barns helped to lead the way for round barn construction throughout the Midwest, particularly in Illinois. The barns were listed as contributing properties to the U of I Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District, which was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1994. History The Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Illinois was formed in 1888, one year after the Hatch Act provided federal funds. After its initial establishment U of I's College of Agriculture began to grow and it was divided into three distinct components, classroom instruction at U of I, the Agricultural Experiment Station, and a statewide extension service. In 1899 Eugene Davenport replaced George E. Morrow as Dean of the College of Agriculture, he immediately reorganized the college into four departments, agronomy, animal husbandry, dairy husbandry, and horticulture. The Experiment Station was originally established to \\"administer research activities within the College.\\" The Department of Dairy Husbandry, seeking to increase milk productivity by promoting efficiency, prompted the Experiment Station to construct the Experimental Dairy Farm at an area known as South Farms. The layout and design incorporated three round barns. scale drawing of the 1912 Dairy Experiment Barn. The three round barns in the historic district were inspired by the work of Benton Steele, Samuel Francis (\\"Frank\\") Detraz, Isaac and Emery McNamee, and Horace Duncan, who, in various combinations, had built at least 8 round barns in Indiana by mid-1902. Steele was an aggressive marketer of the circular barn concept, and in early 1902 began advertising in various agricultural newsletters. In 1903 his concepts caught the attention of Professor C. B. Dorsey of the University of Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station, who traveled to Indiana to view the barns built by Steele and his associates. Dorsey was apparently impressed, for he hired Steele and Detraz to construct a barn on his farm in Gilberts, Illinois. By 1908 Dorsey's interest in round barns had caught the eye of his University of Illinois colleague Wilber J. Fraser.[John T. Hanou, A Round Indiana: Round Barns in the Hoosier State, 1993, West Lafayette, Indiana, Purdue University Press.] Fraser was the first head of the Department of Dairy Husbandry from 1902‚Äì1913. He was also a strong advocate of the round barn which he said offered the \\"economy of consideration, low maintenance, and labor efficiency.\\" Fraser asserted that round barns had a better ability to withstand Midwest windstorms as well.Campus Landmarks, The Round Dairy Barns, University of Illinois.

The barns at the University of Illinois were instrumental in round barn era. In Illinois, at least one round barn was built with direct inspiration from the U of I round barns. The first barn was built around 1907 or 1908 and was known as the Twenty Acre Dairy Barn; it was erected at a cost of US$3,200. The 1910 Dairy Horse Barn set the university back an additional $2,000 and the 1912 Dairy Experiment Barn was the most expensive at $11,000. Design The barns were engineered by and designed by James M. White and Kell & Bernard. They were built every two years from 1908‚Äì1912 and as such, incorporated advances in construction and design to improve each subsequent round barn. Two of the three University of Illinois barns are built into hillsides, providing an example of banked barns. White, the university architect, acted as supervising architect. Little is known about Kell & Bernard. =Twenty Acre Dairy Barn= Barn 1 The 1908 Twenty Acre Dairy Barn, the earliest of the three round barns at U of I, is an example of a banked barn. Its east face is entirely exposed while the rest of the barn and its foundation rests within a hillside. The diameter barn's interior is dominated by a large central silo which extends from the basement to the apex of the roof. =Dairy Horse Barn= Barn 2 Through advances in construction technology the 1910 Dairy Horse Barn was constructed without the use of scaffolding. The interior of this diameter building is divided into two stories; the lower level has a concrete floor. =Dairy Experiment Barn= Cow shed, and Barn#3 The most expensive of the three barns, the 1912 Dairy Experiment Barn (Barn #3 on the map), is also the largest, at in diameter. Located on a hillside, it is the furthest barn from the Manager's House. The hillside around the building's south side was entirely excavated, thus it has its basement entirely exposed on that elevation. The north portion of the barn rests within the hillside giving the building a banked quality. This final round barn at U of I was built with a \\"wing\\" which allowed more cattle to be stored in the building. Significance The Twenty Acre Dairy Barn, the Dairy Horse Barn, and the Dairy Experiment Barn were all listed as contributing properties within the University of Illinois Experimental Dairy Farm Historic District when it joined the National Register of Historic Places on February 4, 1994. The barns played a broader role in the history of American agriculture, specifically in the Midwest states. The barns at the University of Illinois were part of a larger move by Agricultural Experiment Stations meant to promote round barn design, mostly on account of their \\"efficiency.\\" For a time, the round barn became a popular design across the Midwest, with hundreds being constructed in Illinois and Indiana alone. While the earliest round barns date to the 1820s, earlier if the round barn at Mount Vernon is included, the \\"round barn era\\" spanned the decades from 1880 to 1920. In Illinois the round barns at the University of Illinois led to an increase in the style's popularity statewide. This was due, in part, to the access to audience that the U of I's Agricultural Experiment Station has through the publication of regular \\"Bulletins.\\" The Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin coupled with an article by H.C. Crouch touting round barns in the Illinois Agriculturalist led to the construction of round barns across the state. Anecdotal evidence of the impact of the University of Illinois round barns can be collected from farmers today. Stories about fathers and grandfathers recollect round barns being constructed on account of what was going on \\"over at the University.\\" Notes External links * Survey number HABS IL-1211 ‚Äì University of Illinois Round Barns, Urbana, Champaign County, IL.

Shanmukham Chetty was the first Finance Minister of independent India. He presented the first budget of independent India on 26 November 1947. Organisational structure The Union Finance Ministry of India comprises five departments. =Department of Economic Affairs= The Department of Economic Affairs is the nodal agency of the Union Government to formulate and monitor country's economic policies and programmes having a bearing on domestic and international aspects of economic management. A principal responsibility of this Department is the preparation and presentation of the Union Budget to the parliament and budget for the state Governments under President's Rule and union territory administrations. Other main functions include: * Formulation and monitoring of macroeconomic policies, including issues relating to fiscal policy and public finance, inflation, public debt management and the functioning of Capital Market including Stock Exchanges. In this context, it looks at ways and means to raise internal resources through taxation, market borrowings and mobilisation of small savings; * Monitoring and raising of external resources through multilateral and bilateral Official Development Assistance, sovereign borrowings abroad, foreign investments and monitoring foreign exchange resources including balance of payments; * Production of bank notes and coins of various denominations, postal stationery, postal stamps; and Cadre management, career planning and training of the Indian Economic Service (IES). The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB), housed in the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, was an inter-ministerial body, responsible for processing of FDI proposals and making recommendations for Government approval. FIPB is now abolished as announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley during 2017-2018 budget speech in Lok Sabha. Shri tarun bajaj is the current secretary of this department.Pranab Mukherjee, Former Finance Minister of India with Former US President George W. Bush . =Department of Expenditure= The Department of Expenditure is the nodal Department for overseeing the public financial management system (PFMS) in the Central Government and matters connected with the finances. The principal activities of the Department include a pre-sanction appraisal of major schemes/projects (both Plan and non-Plan expenditure), handling the bulk of the Central budgetary resources transferred to States, implementation of the recommendations of the Finance and Central Pay Commissions, overseeing the expenditure management in the Central Ministries/Departments through the interface with the Financial Advisors and the administration of the Financial Rules / Regulations /Orders through monitoring of Audit comments/observations, preparation of Central Government Accounts, managing the financial aspects of personnel management in the Central Government, assisting Central Ministries/Departments in controlling the costs and prices of public services, assisting organizational re-engineering thorough review of staffing patterns and O&M; studies and reviewing systems and procedures to optimize outputs and outcomes of public expenditure. The Department is also coordinating matters concerning the Ministry of Finance including Parliament-related work of the Ministry. The Department has under its administrative control the National Institute of Financial Management (NIFM), Faridabad. The business allocated to the Department of Expenditure is carried out through its Establishment Division, Plan Finance I and II Divisions, Finance Commission Division, Staff Inspection Unit, Cost Accounts Branch, Controller General of Accounts, and the Central Pension Accounting. Dr. T. V. Somanathan is the current secretary of this department. =Department of Revenue= The Department of Revenue functions under the overall direction and control of the Secretary (Revenue). It exercises control in respect of matters relating to all the Direct and Indirect Union Taxes through two statutory Boards namely, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC). Each Board is headed by a Chairman who is also ex officio Special Secretary to the Government of India (Secretary level). Matters relating to the levy and collection of all Direct taxes are looked after by the CBDT whereas those relating to levy and collection of Customs and Central Excise duties and other Indirect taxes fall within the purview of the CBIC. The two Boards were constituted under the Central Board of Revenue Act, 1963. At present, the CBDT has six Members and the CBIC has five Members. The Members are also ex officio Secretaries to the Government of India. Members of CBDT are as follows: # Member (Income Tax) # Member (Legislation and Computerisation) # Member (Revenue) # Member (Personnel & Vigilance) # Member (Investigation) # Member (Audit & Judicial) Ajay Bhushan Pandey is the current secretary of this department. =Department of Financial Services= The Department of Financial Services covers Banks, Insurance, and Financial Services provided by various government agencies and private corporations. It also covers pension reforms and Industrial Finance and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise. It started the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. PFRDA, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is a statutory body which also works under this department. Shri Debasish Panda is the current secretary of this department. =Department of Investment and Public Asset Management= The Department of Disinvestment has been renamed as Department of Investment and Public Asset Management or 'DIPAM', a decision aimed at the proper management of Centre's investments in equity including its disinvestment in central public sector undertakings. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced the renaming of the Department of Disinvestment in his budget speech for 2016-17. Initially set up as an independent ministry (The Ministry of Disinvestment) in December 1999, the Department of Disinvestments came into existence in May 2004 when the ministry was turned into a department of the Ministry of Finance. The department took up all the functions of the erstwhile ministry which broadly was responsible for a systematic policy approach to disinvestment and privatisation of Public Sector Units (PSUs). Tuhin Kanta Pandey is the current secretary of this department.

In the years 1925-1940 he was a director of P&O;, British-India Steam Navigation Company, National Provincial Bank, Eastman Kodak and Northern Assurance. Denison-Pender was the son of Sir John Denison-Pender and his wife Beatrice Katherine (n√©e Ellison). His paternal grandfather was Sir John Pender, the submarine communications cables pioneer. His half-uncle Sir James Pender (from Sir John Pender's first marriage) was the first chairman of Eastman Kodak (UK). He was educated at Hazelwood School in Limpsfield, Surrey, until the spring of 1896 when he went to Eton College, leaving in 1899. On leaving school he joined the Eastern Telegraph Company passing through several of their branches including cable laying. He was a member of the London County Council for South St Pancras between 1910 and 1919 and sat as Member of Parliament for Newmarket from 1913 to 1918 and for Balham and Tooting as a Coalition Conservative supporting the Coalition Government from 1918‚Äì22.

At the age of 30, Schenker together with two partners founded the freight forwarding company Schenker & Co on 1 July 1872 in Vienna. The managerial ingenuity of the Swiss-born entrepreneur was the introduction of groupage consignments by train. The idea to consolidate small shipments into larger units led to a completely new, reasonably priced and fast transport system by rail, road, sea, and inland waterways. The network of branches was expanding rapidly. At the end of the 19th century, Schenker already was the only enterprise offering tariffs calculated through from London to Istanbul. His successful approach‚Äî\\"house to house transport with one single forwarder\\"‚Äîsoon made him market leader, as he was able to meet the requirements of his customers better and faster than all the competitors. The company has maintained this approach until today. A present-day historian wrote about Gottfried Schenker, who died in 1901, \\"He was one of the great economic pioneers of the 19th century and became renowned far outside the borders of the Austro-Hungarian empire\\". At the turn of the century, Vienna was a metropolis in a country at the heart of Europe, where ten languages were being used actively. Starting from Vienna, the company opened up markets within and without the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. In rapid succession, Gottfried Schenker founded branches in Budapest, Trieste, Prague, Belgrade, Sofia, Salonika, and Constantinople. At that time, the distribution within the cities and individual regions was still carried out by horse-drawn coaches. Impressive warehouses, like the one in Vienna, acted as trade hubs. Consignments for longer distances were transported by rail. However, groupage transports across the entire continent or the transport of bulk cargo also required transport by sea. Anticipating further developments, Gottfried Schenker acquired interests in shipping lines. Starting from Trieste, he organized transports across the Mediterranean Sea, to Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK, as well as to the United States. The company's ships with his own name, \\"Gottfried Schenker\\" and that of his wife, \\"Betty\\", were crossing the Atlantic Ocean. In 1913 the first branch office outside Europe was founded in New York. At the same time the company also consistently exploited the possibilities modern technology was offering, by combining forwarding with the emerging methods of telecommunications. Just when the new transport routes to America were being opened up, the company acquired interests in well known telegraph companies which, for the first time, connected Europe and America by communication cables. Gottfried Schenker created the foundation for a future-oriented network of transport means, the utilization of information technology and the company's global presence. For 136 years Schenker's success has been based on these principles.

Gleaning is a feeding strategy by birds in which they catch invertebrate prey, mainly arthropods, by plucking them from foliage or the ground, from crevices such as rock faces and under the eaves of houses, or even, as in the case of ticks and lice, from living animals. This behavior is contrasted with hawking insects from the air or chasing after moving insects such as ants. Gleaning, in birds, does not refer to foraging for seeds or fruit. Gleaning is a common feeding strategy for some groups of birds, including nuthatches, tits (including chickadees), wrens, woodcreepers, treecreepers, Old World flycatchers, Tyrant flycatchers, babblers, Old World warblers, New World warblers, Vireos and some hummingbirds and cuckoos. Many birds make use of multiple feeding strategies, depending on the availability of different sources of food and opportunities of the moment. Techniques and adaptations Common tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius) gleaning among flower buds. Foliage gleaning, the strategy of gleaning over the leaves and branches of trees and shrubs, can involve a variety of styles and maneuvers. Some birds, such as the common chiffchaff of Eurasia and the Wilson's warbler of North America, feed actively and appear energetic. Some will even hover in the air near a leaf or twig while gleaning from it; this behavior is called \\"hover-gleaning\\". Other birds are more methodical in their approach to gleaning, even seeming lethargic as they perch upon and deliberately pick over foliage. This behavior is characteristic of the bay-breasted warbler and many vireos. Another tactic is to hang upside-down from the tips of branches to glean the undersides of leaves. Tits such as the familiar black-capped chickadee are often observed feeding in this manner. Some birds, like the ruby-crowned kinglet and red-eyed vireo of North America use a combination of these tactics. Gleaning birds are typically small with compact bodies and have small, sharply pointed bills. These features are even seen in gleaning birds that are not closely related. For example, in flycatchers of the family Tyrannidae, in which some member species are more adapted for hawking insects on the wing and others for gleaning, the gleaners have bills that resemble those of tits and warblers, unlike their larger-billed relatives. Also, some members of the woodpecker family, particularly piculets such as the rufous piculet of Southeast Asia, are similarly adapted for gleaning, with small, compact bodies and sharp bills, rather than the long, supportive tails and wedge-shaped bills more typical of woodpeckers. Birds such as the aforementioned piculet are specialized for gleaning the bark of trees, as are nuthatches, woodcreepers, and treecreepers. Most bark-gleaners work their way up tree trunks or along branches, though nuthatches are well known as the birds that can go the opposite direction, facing down and working their way down the trunk, as well. This requires strong legs and feet on the part of the nuthatch and piculet, while birds that face upwards tend to have stiff tail feathers to prop them up. Birds often specialize in a particular niche, such as a particular stratum of forest or type of vegetation. In South and Southeast Asia, for example, the mountain tailorbird is often found gleaning in thickets and stands of bamboo, Abbott's babbler gleans lower-storey foliage in lowland forest, the rufous-chested flycatcher and brown fulvetta are birds of the mid-storey forest, the yellow-breasted warbler gleans in the mid- to upper-storey, and the greater green leafbird specializes in the upper-storey forest. The Javan white-eye is a bird of coastal scrub and mangroves, while the related black-capped white-eye is restricted to montane forest. Golden- crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa) gleaning from twigs. Cinereous tit (Parus cinereus) hanging from a leaf and gleaning. Further specialization within a habitat is associated with behaviors and morphological adaptations (physical traits of size and shape). Tiny birds are lightweight enough to hang onto the ends of twigs and pluck small prey; the goldcrest of Europe and its counterpart the golden-crowned kinglet of North America exhibit this feeding style. The related common firecrest is very similar in size and shape, but slightly bulkier, and has less of a tendency to glean along twigs and more of a habit of flying from perch to perch. Having a very small bill seems to be good for taking tiny prey from the surfaces of leaves, and small-billed birds such as the blue tit forage in broad-leafed woodlands. The long-billed gnatwren and speckled spinetail of Central and South America, and the ashy tailorbird and striped tit-babbler of South Asia, show a preference for gleaning in tangles of vines. The ash-browed spinetail of South America specializes in gleaning among epiphytes on moss-covered tree branches. Many hummingbirds take small insects from flowers while probing for nectar, and some species glean actively among bark and leaves. The Puerto Rican emerald is one such hummingbird. Found only on the island of Puerto Rico, the female subsists on insects and spiders, while the male has a typical hummingbird diet of nectar. Hummingbirds and other gleaners are also sometimes attracted to the sap wells created by sapsuckers. Sapsuckers, which are in the woodpecker family, drill small holes in living tree branches to get the sap flowing. The sap and the insects it attracts are then consumed, and rufous hummingbirds have been observed to follow the movements of sapsuckers and take advantage of this food source. Clusters of dead leaves also often harbor invertebrate prey, and the Bewick's wren and worm-eating warbler of North America have long bills well-suited for probing them, as do certain Asian babblers, such as the rusty- cheeked scimitar-babbler. In Central and South America, foliage-gleaners such as the red-faced spinetail and buff-throated foliage-gleaner are also examples of birds that glean clusters of dead leaves. Crevice-gleaning is a niche particular to dry and rocky habitats. Adaptations for crevice-gleaning are similar to that of bark-gleaning. Just as the Bewick's wren, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, has a long bill suited for poking around in the small places of woods and gardens, another North American wren, the canyon wren, has an even longer bill, which allows it to probe crevices in rocky cliffs. It also has skeletal adaptations to aid it in reaching deep into small spaces. These same traits are useful for gleaning the sides of buildings, as well. Another kind of rocky habitat is found along mountain streams, where birds such as the Louisiana waterthrush of North America and the forktails of Asia pick over stream-side rocks and exposed roots for aquatic insects and other moisture-loving prey. Other foraging techniques Foraging for invertebrate prey on the ground often involves gleaning the leaf litter of the forest floor, sometimes flicking, flipping, or scratching through dead leaves. Birds can use their bills to flick or toss dead leaves from the ground to reveal prey residing beneath. The leaftossers of Central and South America and the pittas and laughingthrushes of Asia do this. An example of a bird that employs flipping is the ovenbird, a species of North American wood-warbler. It deliberately turns over leaves on the ground to search for spiders, worms, and such underneath. In other parts of the world, similar leaf-flipping behavior has been observed in unrelated birds, such as the jungle babbler of India. Some birds, such as hummingbirds, will use their wings to create a blast of air to roll leaves over. Other birds rake a foot through the leaf litter, like a chicken, for the same purpose. This has been observed in buttonquails. Some American sparrows, such as the green-tailed towhee, perform a double-scratch by raking both legs simultaneously through the leaf-litter. They then catch prey items dislodged by the disturbance. Ground-foraging birds can be very hard for humans to observe, as they often occupy densely vegetated habitat, as in the case of the Bornean wren-babbler, which specializes in gleaning leaf litter in gullies in the forest of Southeast Asia. A feeding technique that is somewhere between gleaning and hawking is where a bird flies from a perch and takes prey off foliage; this is called \\"sally-gleaning\\". The pygmy tyrants of South America are tiny flycatchers that feed this way. The todies of the Caribbean employ a distinct version of sally-gleaning. These small birds choose a perch within their lush forest and plantation habitats in the Greater Antilles, from which they scan the undersides of leaves above them. Upon spotting an insect or spider, they fly up in an arcing sally, pluck their prey item without stopping, and complete the arcing movement to land on a new perch. Yellow-billed oxpecker (Buphagus africanus) foraging on a living animal. An unusual feeding strategy is that of the oxpeckers of Africa. They perch on living animals and glean parasites from the animals' hides. On furry animals, such as buffalo, giraffe, and donkey, these birds run their bills through the fur of the animal, using a scissors-like motion to extract ticks and lice from near the skin. When they pull the insect out to the end of the fur, they catch it and eat it. (On animals with bare hides, such as rhinoceros and hippopotamus, oxpeckers pick at any open wounds the animals happen to have, consuming blood and pus, and possibly keeping the wounds free of maggots.) Historically, rhinoceros and other large wild mammals have been among the favored hosts, but as the populations of large mammals in the African savanna have declined in modern times, the population and range of both red-billed and yellow-billed oxpecker have also changed, and now the birds will use donkeys and domestic cattle as hosts. There are other tactics. Dippers forage underwater in fast-moving streams. Common grackles have been observed to follow farmers‚Äô plows to glean the grubs exposed in the fresh soil. Similarly, on the island of Borneo, the Bornean ground-cuckoo will follow wild pigs and sun bears as they turn up soil while foraging in the forest. Brewer's blackbirds are often seen in parking lots, where they pick off dead insects from car grilles. Some hummingbirds are known to take prey items from spiderwebs. Behavioral implications Black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) inspecting foliage. Gleaning, like other methods of foraging, is a highly visual activity, and as such has some implications for birds. First, to see requires light, and thus time allotted to gleaning is limited to daytime. Second, while a bird focuses on examining an area for prey items, it must necessarily divert its attention from scanning its surroundings for predators. Birds that glean in tree branches will often join together in a flock, and often with other gleaners in a mixed-species foraging flock. It has been shown that individual birds feeding in flocks are able to spend more time looking for food and less time looking for predators. On the other hand, it is not a universal trait of gleaning birds to join with other species or even to be gregarious with their own kind. The leafbirds of Asia are foliage-gleaners, but are often found singly or in pairs. Also, where multiple species of gleaning birds forage in the same area, they may show niche segregation; for example, one species may stick to conifers while another species inhabits broadleaf trees, or they may even divide up a habitat, with smaller species feeding among higher, smaller tree branches and larger species staying on lower, larger branches.

Manea‚Äô hune‚Äôele, the forerunner to fara It is believed that fara traces its roots back to the ‚Äúmanea‚Äô hune‚Äôele‚Äù (beach parties) of old, where young people would picnic at the beach from late afternoon through night-time, singing, dancing and making- merry. For young people it was primarily undertaken as a carefree environment in which they could spend time with prospective partners without the prying eyes of a normal close-knit Rotuman community. However, the politically powerful churches, particularly the Methodist Church, fearing the rise in immoral behaviour resulting from such licentious escapades, and family‚Äôs fears of loss of the socially important virginity (girls were expected to be married with their virginity intact, attracting a higher bride-price in traditional betrothals) sparked calls to end the practice of manea‚Äô hune‚Äôele. According to research, in the search to replace the tradition, the practice of fara was created, providing a more wholesome way for the young to court. Modern-day fara Modern fara involves groups of performers of varying size, often travelling in village or sometimes even district-sized groups. Once at a particular house or hall, they begin dancing and singing, accompanied by guitars, drums and ukulele, and invite the hosts to join in. In return the recipients of this entertainment give the performers food and drink, (usually fruit and cordial) and enact the ‚Äúnau te‚Äù, an unceremonious tradition of sprinkling performers (in all Rotuman social environments) with perfume or talcum powder. This historically involved home-made turmeric, but the easier western alternatives now hold precedence. Fara season is considered the highlight of the year for Rotuman people the world over. It is common for groups of Rotuman individuals who have spread across the globe through diaspora, to return to the island at av‚Äô mane‚Äôa and participate in the festivities. It is said that the island‚Äôs population often doubles at fara time, as compared to the mid-year numbers, as a result of the popularity of the fara.

It is a subsidiary of the Court Theatre professional theatre company, acting as a second company within the theatre. The group provide entertainment for corporate and private clients, run weekly community improv workshops and an annual Theatresports competition for high schools, as well as performing their own weekly or twice-weekly improv comedy show, Scared Scriptless. History =Origins= Theatresports at The Court Theatre began in 1987 under the direction of Bryan Aitken and Judie Douglass. This was largely due to the upswing in popularity of improvised theatre internationally and the desire to introduce it to a New Zealand audience. The popularity of the style led to the formation of a permanent improvisational wing of The Court Theatre under the moniker \\"The Court Jesters\\" in late 1989. In 1990 the Court Jesters manager Michael Robinson (working alongside Jim McLarty and Lori Dungey) began a late-night improvised comedy show titled Scared Scriptless, at The Court Theatre. Scared Scriptless still runs to this day, and as such is the longest-running (and continuously running) show in New Zealand. Original members of the company were John Hudson, Patrick Duffy, Geoff Dolan, KC Kelly, Greg Cooper, Ross Gumbley, Cal Wilson, Simon Peacock, Susan Fogarty, Matthew Gould, Kevin Smith, Craig Cooper, Carl Nixon, Andie Spargo and Michael Robinson. =1990s= During the rest of the 1990s, though some members left for television and film work in Auckland and overseas, the Jesters expanded their repertoire with corporate entertainment and teaching improv/theatresports to high schools (as part of the \\"Theatresports in Schools\\" programme) and community improvisation classes. The Jesters also had considerable success with dinner theatre including a show at Mona Vale called The Wedding. In 1994 The Court Jesters sent a team of improvisors to the World Theatresports Championships in Los Angeles. Teams from the UK, South Africa, Canada, Australia, Denmark, America, New Zealand, The Netherlands and other countries competed. New Zealand's team, comprising Simon Peacock, Cal Wilson, Susan Fogarty and Greg Cooper, won the competition. The late 90s saw the company push the boundaries of improvisational practice through script-based improv works such as I Spy, The X-Philes, Blood, and Doctor Pussy Finger Says No To Tomorrow. The company's first fully scripted work was The Complete History of New Zealand (Abridged), first presented in Christchurch in 1998. Their only other fully scripted play was A Fistful of Dolores which premi√®red in 2002. The Complete History of New Zealand (Abridged) continues to be presented throughout the country, most recently performed in Hagley Park, Christchurch in 2012. The company also pioneered a school holiday theatre programme using tight casts of three to four actors and scripts that could effectively use the main stage sets for daytime performances. The Court Theatre continues to use this production model for holiday performances. Alongside the newfound confidence with scripted and part-scripted work, The Court Jesters continued to explore pure improv. The 1997 season of Abandon Script used an approach that saw a full 90-minute show generated from a single word offered by the audience. =2000s= By the early 2000s, natural attrition saw the company with only one original member (Andie Spargo). In 2002 the then-current members, dissatisfied with their relationship with The Court Theatre, left to form their own corporate entertainment/improvisation business, 'The Outwits'. In response, The Court Theatre announced that it was reforming The Court Jesters under the management of Nicola Wellbourn and the direction and tutelage of Patrick Duffy (one of the original Jesters who had left the troupe in the early-mid 90s). They held open auditions and from the various actors, singers, entertainers, comedians, street performers, and improvisors who applied formed the new troupe of Court Jesters in December 2002, effectively a reboot for the company. These new Jesters took over Scared Scriptless, Theatresports In Schools and corporate entertainment at the beginning of 2003. Effectively starting from scratch, the Jesters had to rebuild a fan base and increase audiences for Scared Scriptless, as well as attract more corporate entertainment work and retain the goodwill of the Court Theatre management. While described as a \\"hard slog\\" by many, progress was made financially and artistically. Fairyable was performed in the Christchurch Botanic Gardens in February 2004 as part of the Christchurch City Council's \\"Summertimes\\" festival. The format of the show was a long-form improvised fairytale. In 2005 Kirsty Gillespie took over as manager of the Court Jesters with Jeff Clark remaining as assistant to the manager. While Patrick Duffy remained an active member of the Jesters, Ross Gumbley (another original Court Jester who had moved to Centrepoint Theatre in the mid 90s, and then returned to take the position of Associate Artistic Director of The Court Theatre in 2000) took a much more active role in the performance side of the company. At the beginning of 2006 the Court Jesters enjoyed a marked surge in numbers at Scared Scriptless (coupled with a change of the start time to 10pm) and continued to build audiences, often moving the show to the larger Court One venue to accommodate ticket sales. Ross Gumbley was appointed Artistic Director of the Court Theatre in March 2006, effectively securing the company's position. In May 2006 the company received improvisation tutelage from Keith Johnstone to couple the rise in financial success with increased artistic standards. Scared Scriptless ended its 2006 season having set a new record for box office sales. The Jesters staged Pulp William (a long-form mash-up of the Shakespeare and Tarantino genres),theatreview.org.nz press release and reviews of Pulp William \\"Scriptless Uncut\\" (an Oscars-themed improv show) and A Very Merry Scriptless as a part of the 2008 Forge season. The latter show is scheduled to return as an annual production, each time with a slightly different take on Christmas: in 2008, this took the form of an improvised retelling of Dickens' A Christmas Carol and in 2009 the story revolved around the nativity and the Magi. The Early Early Late Show returned as part of the 2009 Forge season: both The Early Late Show and A Very Merry Scriptless returned in 2010. =2010s= A 20th anniversary \\"30-Hour Improvathon\\" was held in 2010, featuring both current and past members of the Court Jester company. Following the closure of the Christchurch Arts Centre after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, Scared Scriptless resumed performances within three weeks and performed in a variety of venues whilst The Court Theatre constructed its new venue. Companies also hired the Court Jesters directly to perform for them, for example a law firm that was based at the PGC House, one of the two large office buildings that collapsed during the February 2011 earthquake. After the earthquakes, shows were staged at 8 pm Fridays and Saturdays. From 10 February 2012, late-night shows of Scared Scriptless resumed in the new venue, dubbed \\"The Shed\\", in Addington. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the Court Theatre's shows were postponed or cancelled. The Court began staging productions, including Scared Scriptless, in The Shed's foyer with safety measures in place in August 2020 and on 21 September 2020 announced that the main auditorium would be reopening. In October 2020 the company celebrated its 30th anniversary. Scared Scriptless Taken from the Scared Scriptless 2006 poster. The flagship Court Jesters show is Scared Scriptless, a short-form improvisation show on at 10pm (originally 11pm) every Friday (and, since June 2009, Saturday) at The Court Theatre. The show was established in 1990 and is New Zealand's longest-running comedy show. Scared Scriptless is hosted by an MC, along with anywhere from 4 to 10 players, a muso (a musician who improvises the backing music) and at least one technician/stage manager (who operates the lights and sound). Players and MCs are all members of the Court Jesters and rotate frequently. The format for the show can change from week to week but is mainly focused on shortform improvisation. Formats include Micetro, Theatresports, Gorilla Theatre and themed performances, as well as variations on these and original formats devised by the Court Jesters. Scenes are based on suggestions from the audience and often challenges/rules (also called \\"handles\\" or \\"games\\") from the MC. Scared Scriptless is usually performed on the set of a current Court Theatre production, although in some cases rudimentary furniture and props may be used. Similarly, players often do not use any props or costumes, relying instead on mime and physicality. The usual exception is when the MC may bring along props or costumes for special scenes/games or to fit with the theme of the night. When it debuted in 1990, Scared Scriptless was staged at 11pm on Friday nights at the Court Theatre. This timeslot continued until the beginning of 2006 when the start time was moved to 10pm which, while still remaining a late-night show, became more accessible to a wider range of the public. In mid-2009, a second weekly late-night Scared Scriptless show was added on Saturday nights due to the demands of an increased attendance. Following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake whilst the new Court Theatre venue was being built, Scared Scriptless was held at various locations around the city at 8pm Fridays and Saturdays. From 2012 onwards the show returned to The Court Theatre with performances at 10:15pm. Performers Over the years the roster of The Jesters has changed regularly. The original members were either acting interns at The Court Theatre or were brought in through auditions and recruitment. Members often left to pursue other careers or move overseas; subsequently people from school teams, workshops or other towns were recruited into the company as \\"Associate\\" Jesters ‚Äì improvisers who played Scared Scriptless semi-regularly but were not used for corporate work or permanently contracted. By the mid-1990s, many if not all of the troupe were 'second- generation' Jesters, having been coached/taught by the Court Jesters themselves and gone from Associate to Full Jestership. When the company reformed in late 2002, many of the new troupe were garnered from the University of Canterbury Comedy Club, high school teams and other entertainment groups/organisations. Over the years there have been numerous reshufflings and recruitments as the company continues to evolve. The current roster of regular performers is around 20, with auditions and recruitment of \\"Apprentice\\" Jesters biennially.

Adults feed on crabs, shrimp, and smaller fish. Taxonomy The permit was first described by the \\"father of taxonomy\\", Carl Linnaeus in his tenth edition of the work Systema Naturae, which was published in 1758. He originally classified it as Labrus falcatus, though the fish has since been placed in the genus Trachinotus. It is the type species of the genus Trachinotus. Etymology The permit's genus name, Trachinotus comes from a fusion of the Greek words ' (), which means \\"rough\\", and ' (), meaning \\"back\\".Romero, P., 2002. An etymological dictionary of taxonomy. Madrid, unpublished. The species name for the permit, ', is a Latin adjective, which roughly means \\"armed with scythes\\". This serves as a reference to the permit's dorsal fin that occasionally protrudes from the water when schools of permit feed near the surface. Anatomy and morphology A preserved permit from the Gulf of Mexico Permits can be distinguished by their elongated dorsal fins and anal fin. The dorsal fin is shaped like a scythe. Permit tails are also deeply forked, and their bodies are compressed laterally, making the fish tall and thin when viewed from the front. The average permit has six to seven dorsal spines, and 18 to 20 one soft rays. The anal fin has two to three spines, and 16 to 18 soft rays. Both dorsal and anal fins have dark, anterior lobes.Smith, C.L., 1997.

The permit fish can reach a maximum length of 48 in (122 cm) and can weigh up to 79 lb (36 kg), according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. Distribution and habitat Permit are usually found in shallow, tropical waters such as mudflats, channels, and muddy bottoms. Although permit are found close to shore and even in some brackish areas, they spawn offshore. Young are found usually in the surf zone where plenty of small invertebrates are available for them to eat. Permit are found in the western Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts to Brazil, including most of the Caribbean islands.

See Talk:Prong setting#Merger proposal. A prong set diamond in a gold ring. Prong setting or prong mount refers to the use of metal projections or tines, called prongs, to secure a gemstone to a piece of jewelry. A prong setting is one component of what is known to jewelers as a head, a claw-shaped type of binding (typically 3, 4, or 6 individual prongs per head) that is welded or soldered to a jewelry item in order to mount (or set) a gemstone to the jewelry item. A common setting for diamond engagement rings, the prong setting allows light to strike a gemstone from more angles, increasing its brilliance. Prong setting engagement rings are sometimes referred to as Tiffany setting rings, although this is a trademarked term specifically used to describe prong setting rings sold by Tiffany & Co. A 2017 $19 million lawsuit confirmed the exclusive right of Tiffany & Co. to utilize the term \\"Tiffany\\" within the jewelry sales industry. Characteristics =General features= The head can be handmade, cast or die struck, and it is made from some type of precious metal, such as gold, silver and platinum. Heads used to prong set a gemstone come in a variety of sizes and shapes, depending on the shape of the gemstone, the size of the gemstone, or whether or not the gemstone is faceted or cabochon shaped. Common shapes of heads used in stone setting include round, oval, emerald cut, princess cut, marquise cut, pear shaped and trillian cut. V-shaped prongs are recommended for a marquise-cut or pear-shaped stone, while flat prongs are recommended for a flat-cut emerald. A prong setting holds the gem securely while allowing the gem to be struck with more light and from more angles, increasing the brilliance of the gemstone. =Drawbacks= A prong setting offers less protection to the gem than inset mounts. In addition, prongs can snag on clothing or fabric. High quality settings are less likely to snag on clothing, as the prongs are firmly attached to the gem and well finished. Over time, prongs may get worn out or become loose. Getting the ring checked regularly is a good idea in order to prevent any accidental loss of your mounted gemstone. Some effective ways include using a 10X loupe to check for gaps between prongs and gemstone, listening for sounds made by loose gemstone and taking it to a professional jeweler once every 6 months for checks. Tiffany design and trademark One well-known prong setting is the \\"Tiffany setting\\", a trademarked engagement ring design created by Charles Tiffany in the 1880s that has become the signature line of Tiffany & Co. engagement rings. The Tiffany setting popularized the general use of prong setting engagement rings, and as of 2012, the trade association Jewelers of America reports that multi-prong solitare rings are the most sought-after form of engagement ring available. While some in the jewelry industry use the term \\"Tiffany setting\\" to describe multi-prong solitaire rings, the Tiffany setting is a specific trademarked design of Tiffany & Co. In February 2013 Tiffany & Co. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Costco Wholesale Corp. over Costco's practice of selling prong setting engagement rings described as \\"Tiffany setting\\" rings. The lawsuit alleged that Costco was unlawfully using the \\"Tiffany\\" trademark to describe products that were not made or licensed by Tiffany & Co. In its defense, Costco asserted that it did not infringe because the terms \\"Tiffany\\" and \\"Tiffany setting\\" were genericized by common usage to describe prong setting engagement ring. However, on September 8, 2015, a federal judge ruled in favor of Tiffany & Co., rejecting Costco's generic use argument and finding that Costco's usage of the \\"Tiffany\\" name violated Tiffany & Co.'s trademark rights.

This year Cooper Macneil teamed with Jeroen Bleekemolen in the Porsche while the Ferrari was piloted by last year's team of Townsend Bell and Bill Sweedler. Despite only claiming two class wins, the team's consistent performance earned them their second GTC Drivers‚Äô Championship, while the Teams‚Äô Championship went to the Flying Lizard Motorsports team.2013 ALMS Drivers Championship Results 20132013 ALMS Teams‚Äô Championship Results 2013 The teams GT campaigned started the year at Sebring with a suspension failure-induced wreck and subsequent DNF. The team however repaired the car and campaign the rest of the season. Bill Sweedler and Townsend Bell finished 16th and 15th in the Drivers‚Äô Championship and 8th in the Teams Championship.  Rolex Sports Car Series  In 2006, the Alex Job Racing team competed for the first time in the Grand Am Rolex Sports Car Series with a Porsche-powered Daytona Prototype. Drivers Mike Rockenfeller and Patrick Long recorded two overall wins at Homestead and Virginia International Raceway. By season's end, Rockenfeller would finish 5th in the Drivers' Championship. In 2007, the team's second full season of competition, drivers Patrick Long and Jorg Bergmeister, would claim an overall win at Laguna Seca as well as three top-five finishes and eleven top-ten results. Long would finish the season seventh in the Daytona Prototype Drivers' Championship. In 2008 would claim two podium finishes as well as three top-five and seven top-ten results. Full season drivers Bill Auberlen and Joey Hand would finish outside the top ten in the Daytona Prototype Drivers' Championship.  United SportsCar Championship  With the merging of the American Le Mans Series and the Rolex Sports Car Series for the 2014 season, the Alex Job Racing team would field a two car Porsche 911 GT America effort in the new GT Daytona class. Dagys, John (November 5 2013) Seattle, Alex Job Racing to field Porsche GT America Cooper MacNeil would team with Leh Keen in the WeatherTech entry while Mario Farnbacher and Ian James would pilot the \\"Heart of Racing\\" entry in partnership with Team Seattle.

The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions. The court in Currie v Misa Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 893 declared consideration to be a ‚ÄúRight, Interest, Profit, Benefit, or Forbearance, Detriment, Loss, Responsibility‚Äù. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.Wade v Simeon (1846) 2 CB 548White v Bluett (1853) 2 WR 75Bronaugh R. (1976). Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict. William & Mary Law Review. Consideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into contracts. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as \\"consideration\\": for example, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the $5,000, and B's consideration is the car. Additionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further if A signs a contract with B such that A will not repaint his own house in any other colour than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also a consideration. Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise not to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the forbearance in painting his own house in a colour other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it is a valid gift. In common law it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed. However, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of quantum meruit (sometimes referred to as a quasi-contract) or promissory estoppel. Legal rules regarding consideration There are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract: # Part payment is not good consideration Pinnel's Case (1602) 5 Co Rep 117a Jorden v Money (1854) 5 HLC 185 Foakes v Beer (per incuriam?) (1884) AC 605 # Consideration must move from the promisee but need not flow to the promisor Tweddle v Atkinson,, (1861) 1 B&S; 393 # Consideration must be sufficient but need not be adequate De la Bere v Pearson [1908] 1 KB 280Chappell v Nestl√©s [1960] AC 87The Atlantic Baron [1979] QB 705 (aka North Ocean Shipping v Hyundai Construction) # Consideration cannot be illusory # Consideration must not be past. Past consideration is not good consideration Roscorla v Thomas (1842) 3 QB 234Re McArdle [1951] Ch 669Lampleigh v Braithwaite (1615) Hob 105Kennedy v Broun (1863) 13 CB (NS) 677Re Casey's Patents (aka Stewart v Casey) [1893] 1 Ch 104Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980] AC 614 (PC) # Moral consideration is not sufficient (except for contracts by deed, where \\"love and affection\\" is often cited as the [unnecessary] consideration) # Performance of existing duties is not good consideration Stilk v Myrick (1809), 2 Camp 317Hartley v Ponsonby (1857) 7 E&B; 872Glasbrook Bros v Glamorgan CC [1925] AC 270Williams v Roffey [1990] 2 WLR 1153 History and comparative law Systems based on Roman law (including Germany German Civil Code ¬ß 311, accessed 15 July 2017 and Scotland) do not require consideration, and some commentators consider it unnecessary and have suggested that the doctrine of consideration should be abandoned, See: Harvey McGregor's Contract Code and estoppel used to replace it as a basis for contracts.e.g. P.S. Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in Essays on Contract (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press However, legislation, rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. Lord Justice Denning famously stated that \\"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind\\".Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd. [1947] KB 130 The reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th-century judges of two distinct threads: first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of assumpsit, which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England and Wales until 1884 when the old forms of action were abolished; secondly, the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems, was promoted by the 18th-century French writer Pothier in his Traite des Obligations, much read (especially after translation into English in 1805) by English judges and jurists. The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially John Stuart Mill's influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.For a detailed and authoritative account of this process, see A. W. B. Simpson, A History of the Common Law of Contract: The Rise of the Action of Assumpsit, (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1975). Civil law systems take the approach that an exchange of promises, or a concurrence of wills alone, rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis. So if A promises to give B a book and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return, B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift. However, in common law systems the concept of culpa in contrahendo, a form of estoppel, is increasingly used to create obligations during pre- contractual negotiations.Austotel v Franklins (1989) 16 NSWLR 582. Estoppel is an equitable doctrine that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an assurance and the other has relied on the assurance to his detriment. Monetary value of consideration Generally, courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fair--merely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party.Thomas v Thomas (1842). The dispositive issue is the presence of consideration, not the adequacy of the consideration. The values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable. For instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, and private jet, there is still consideration on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the value of a peppercorn to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, \\"for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration.\\" However, some courts in the United States may take issue with nominal consideration, or consideration with virtually no value. Some courts have since thought this was a sham. Since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court, some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty, and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals, and consequently, no contract is formed. However, this is a minority position. Pre-existing legal duties A party that already has a legal duty to provide money, an object, a service, or a forbearance, does not provide consideration when promising merely to uphold that duty.; See also ..Wigan v Edwards (1973) 1 ALR 497. That legal duty can arise from law, or obligation under a previous contract. The prime example of this sub-issue is where an uncle gives his thirteen-year-old nephew (a resident of the NY) the following offer: \\"if you do not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol until your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $5,000\\". On the nephew's 18th birthday, he tells the uncle to pay up, and the uncle does not pay. In the subsequent lawsuit, the uncle wins, because the nephew, by U.S. criminal law, already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes while under 18 or drink alcohol while under age 21. The same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted. For example, A agrees to paint B's house for $500, but halfway through the job A tells B that he will not finish unless B increases the payment to $750. If B agrees, and A then finishes the job, B still only needs to pay A the $500 originally agreed to, because A was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount. An exception to this rule holds for settlements, such as an accord and satisfaction. If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000, and offers to settle it for $5,000, it is still binding, if accepted, even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000. Pre-existing duties relating to at-will employment depend largely on state law. Generally, at-will employment allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason, and allows the employee to resign for any reason. There are no duties of continued employment in the future. Therefore, when an employee demands a raise, there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working. Similarly, when an employer demands a pay-cut, there is also no contractual issue with consideration, because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker. However, certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment, to enforce terms demanded later by the employer, in particular, non-competition clauses. Bundled terms Contracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable. Consider the uncle's situation above. If the same uncle had instead told his 13-year-old nephew the following offer: \\"if you do not smoke cigarettes, do not drink alcohol, swear or play cards for money (gamble) before your 21st birthday, then I will pay you $5,000\\". On the nephew's 21st birthday, he asks the uncle to pay up, and this time, in the subsequent lawsuit, the nephew may win.Hamer v Sidway parallelcite=(1891) 124 NY 538 Although the promise of not drinking alcohol and gambling while under the age of 21 was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited), most states allow smoking by age 18 and swearing, while some consider it vulgar, is not illegal at any age. Even though smoking is legally restricted until age 18, it is legal for those above 18, and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value. However, the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew drank alcohol, even though that consideration is valueless, because it was paired with something of legal value; therefore, adherence to the entire, collective agreement is necessary. Past consideration Generally, past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value. Past consideration is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. Past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages.see . An exception to this rule is where there is a duty owed to a third party. An act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. For this to hold, three conditions must be satisfied (Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980]): # The act must have been done at the promisor‚Äôs request # The parties must have understood the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit # Payment/conferment of the benefit must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance Option contracts and conditional consideration Generally, conditional consideration is valid consideration. Suppose A is a movie script writer and B runs a movie production company. A says to B, \\"buy my script.\\" B says \\"How about this ‚Äì I will pay you $5,000 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now. If I do produce your movie in that year, then I will give you another $50,000, and no one else can produce it. If I do not produce your movie in that year, then you're free to go.\\" If the two subsequently get into a dispute, the issue of whether a contract exists is answered. B had an option contract‚Äîhe could decide to produce the script, or not. B's consideration passed was the $5,000 down, and the possibility of $50,000. A's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year. In settlements Suppose B commits a tort against A, causing $5,000 in compensatory damages and $3,000 in punitive damages. Since there is no guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court, A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5,000 compensatory damages. This is sufficient consideration, since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery, and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5,000, instead of $8,000.

Background Born in Charters Towers, Queensland, Scott is of Indigenous descent and played his junior rugby league for Souths Townsville, alongside future teammate Gene Miles. Playing career Scott played senior rugby league for Souths Townsville, where he first represented Queensland in the interstate series in 1979. In 1980, he moved to Brisbane, joining the Easts Tigers. That season, he was selected at fullback for the first ever State of Origin game, despite being in reserve grade at the time. In 1981, Scott moved to the Wynnum Manly Seagulls, starting at fullback in their BRL's Grand Final victory over Souths Magpies a year later. In 1983, Scott was selected at fullback in the Australian side for their second Test match against New Zealand after an injury to incumbent 1982 Kangaroo Tour fullback Greg Brentnall. Despite 25 appearances for his state during his career (including 17 State of Origin appearances), Scott did not represent Australia again. In 1985, Scott joined the Castleford Tigers, spending two seasons with the club.

Food safety in China is a growing concern relating to agriculture. China's principal crops are rice, corn, wheat, soybeans, and cotton in addition to apples and other fruits and vegetables.USDA China - Key Statistics China - Key Statistics 2005 China's principal livestock products include pork, beef, dairy, and eggs. The Chinese government oversees agricultural production as well as the manufacture of food packaging, containers, chemical additives, drug production, and business regulation. In recent years, the Chinese government attempted to consolidate food safety regulation with the creation of the State Food and Drug Administration of China in 2003; officials have also been under increasing public and international pressure to solve food safety problems. Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang said, \\"Food is essential, and safety should be a top priority. Food safety is closely related to people's lives and health and economic development and social harmony,\\" at a State Council meeting in Beijing.  Overview  Food safety has been a concern for many decades in China. The majority of food problems lies within poisonous foods deliberately contaminated by producers for higher profits. The most common types poisonous foods in china include: adulteration, additives, pesticides, and fake foods. These poisonous food production techniques allowed producers to either increase production, increase mass of produce, lower market prices, and increase shelf-life. Poisonous food production was very well-organized and largely scaled, involving government agencies participating in such malpractice. The growing unrest over food safety in China reached a climax in early 2007, shortly after circulation to the State Council of an Asian Development Bank policy note based on a technical assistance project in collaboration with the State Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization. The note and a subsequent report applauded increased efforts by the Chinese government but noted remaining gaps, calling in particular for urgent reforms to strengthen and streamline inter-agency coordination and enact an overarching \\"basic food law\\". The State Food and Drug Administration of China also published a survey in early 2007 where 65% of the respondents expressed concern about food safety. Shortly afterwards, Lu Jianzhong, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and China's Vice Premier, Wu Yi, issued statements of apology and promised to create a food safety monitoring system.China Digital Times Apologies for food safety in china China's food regulations are complex, its monitoring system can be unresponsive, and the government departments that oversee and enforce policies have overlapping and often ambiguous duties. There are around ten national government departments that share the responsibility to ensure food safety. There are also numerous provincial and local agencies that monitor local food production and sales. The food and drug laws themselves have been created \\"in an ad hoc way without the benefit of a basic food law,\\" as Henk Bekedam of the World Health Organization told the Wall Street Journal (9 April 2007, B1).Zamiska, Nicholas. \\"Who's Monitoring Chinese Food Exports?\\" Wall Street Journal.

Wei, Liu. \\"Safe Food For All Should Be the Recipe.\\" March 15, 2007 There are also local and regional food safety agencies, but there is no clear hierarchy of agencies at the local or national levels. In response to complexity of numerous agencies monitoring and regulating food safety, the National People's Congress established the State Food and Drug Administration in 2003. The State Food and Drug Administration was supposed to oversee the all aspects of food safety regulations and unify food safety controls. However, the State Food and Drug Administration has not become the main governing department as the government had intended, and the other national agencies have continued to regulate and monitor food safety. This unclear division of duties has created conflict and confusion when citizens have sought to complain or when a major crisis needed to be resolved.

The Institute not only undertakes basic research and field studies, but also organizes and conducts nationwide research programs. In addition, the Institute gives advice on the nutrition and food hygiene projects of the health units at the provincial level. The Institute comprises 13 departments, including Elderly Nutrition, Maternal and Child Nutrition, Community Nutrition, School Nutrition, Food Chemistry, and Food Toxicology. The Institute has been authorized to award doctoral and master's degrees in the field of nutrition and food hygiene. Since 1981, the Institute has been designated as the FAO/WHO Collaborative Center for Food Contamination Monitoring in China. The office of the Chinese Nutrition Society is also located in the Institute building. The Institute was formerly known as the Nutrition Division of the National Institute of Health of the Public Health Administration, which was established in 1941. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Institute was affiliated with the following leading bodies under the title of the Department of Nutrition or the Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene: *1950-1957: National Institute of Health, Ministry of Public Health *1957-1983: Institute of Health, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences *1983-1985: Institute of Health, China National Center for Preventive Medicine *1985-1986: Institute of Health, Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine *In 1986, the Institute of Nutrition and Food Hygiene was established under the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. Food safety regulations In October 2007, China approved new legislation aimed at improving and monitoring national standards in food production. New laws will standardize food production and clamp down on illegal activity in the industry. The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine drafted the new regulations covering the production, processing and sale of food. They will create national standards and replace the existing patchwork of rules which are overseen by several government agencies.WHO chief praises China's efforts on food safety AFP  Food safety incidents The People's Republic of China (PRC) has received increased international media scrutiny following the reform and opening of the country, its joining the World Trade Organization, and the increased awareness of Chinese people in urban areas to food safety. There have been numerous incidents involving food safety in the PRC including the unconventional use of pesticides or other dangerous chemical additives as food preservatives or additives and the use of unhygienic starting materials as food ingredients. There were two catastrophic food scandals in the past decades that resulted around 300,000 cases of food- borne diseases. The first incident occurred 3 decades ago in Shanghai where consumption of raw clam lead to a Hepatitis A outbreak. The second incident is the 2008 Chinese milk scandal which caused kidney stones in infants, devastating almost 300,000 children. The 2008 Chinese milk scandal received the most attention among food safety incidents. This incident brought China's food safety policy under scrutiny in the international eye, playing a part in the institution of the Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China in June 2009.  The Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China  The Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China took effect on June 1st, 2009 and became the major food safety protection law. This legislation describes all the responsibilities of food safety regulations to the Ministry of Health, who is responsible for food safety risk assessment, formulating food safety standards, food safety information dissemination, and setting codes of practice for food testing organizations. The law also clearly describes the duty to monitor food production, servicing, and circulation by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, the State of Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the State Food Drug Administration. The Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China does not clearly state how these food safety monitoring duties are divided among these agencies. This law offers a new aspect of authorizing consumers to seek compensation from the distributor or producer of harmful food products, up to 10 times the price of the said food product. The Food Safety Law does not state clearly whether local governments shall provide compensation if there is malpractice in government action. Food contamination incidents in China have not shown signs of decline after this particular Food Safety law.  Legislative Reform after the Food Safety Law  China began a new legislative reform four years after the Food Safety Law of the People's Republic of China. These amendments contain frameworks stating regulation for online food trading, mandatory food safety liability insurance, infant formula, and enhanced penalties for violations. These amendments encourage regulation from nongovernmental stakeholders in the food industry, such as food industry associations, nongovernmental organizations, the media, and consumers. The promotion of a reporting measure where any person may report alleged food safety violations and receive rewards is an example. Moreover, the amendments will require the National Food Safety Standard Evaluation Committee to include members of consumer associations and food industry associations. These reforms present a shift from a government-centered framework of China's food safety policy.

The main user population was the UK Universities and some government agencies. Now called the Atlas centre, it is home to European Space Agency's (ESA) Business Incubation Centre (ESA BIC), and the Space Applications and Telecommunications (ESA ESCAT) and the Science and Technology Facilities Council's (STFC) Innovations Technology Access Centre (I-TAC). From 1964 to 1971, the laboratory housed the largest of the three examples of the Ferranti Atlas 1 computer that was purchased for ¬£2.5 million, and after which the laboratory was named. For a time, it was the fastest and most innovative of the computers available worldwide. Throughout its life it was headed by Jack Howlett. Early staff or visitors included A. O. L. Atkin (1964‚Äì1970), I. J. Good (1964‚Äì1967), and Donald Michie who had worked together at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. High quality text and graphics output on both paper and film was provided by a Stromberg-Carlson SC4020 microfilm recorder that provided a unique service for many years, especially to people interested in doing computer animation. Associated with the SC4020 was a PDP15 satellite computer that provided previewing facilities for the SC4020 and a range of interactive graphics facilities for users. From 1971, an ICL 1906A was installed with twice the computing power of the Atlas 1. About the same time, work started on replacing the ageing SC4020 with a modern III FR80 microfilm recorder which expanded the range of output media to include microfiche and was able to generate colour as well as black and white output. From 1967 until 1985, several of the earliest computed generated image (CGI) or computer animated films were produced at the laboratory, particularly for the Open University. Most famously, the laboratory's facilities were used to produce the raster wireframe model rendering shown on the navigation monitors in the landing sequence of the 1979 Ridley Scott film Alien which won the 1979 Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The Atlas Computer Laboratory made important contributions to systems software including operating systems, compilers, computer graphics, and networking. Basic software in the areas of statistics, mathematics, linguistics, chemistry and many other areas was also developed. In 1975, the Atlas Computer Laboratory was closed, moving some parts to the Daresbury Laboratory and amalgamating the rest with the neighbouring Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, and then in 1979 with the Appleton Laboratory to form the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Since 2007, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory has been operated by the Science and Technology Facilities Council. In July 2009, The European Space Agency Business Incubation Centre Harwell (ESA BIC Harwell) moved into the Atlas building, now named the Atlas Centre. ESA BIC Harwell supports small and medium businesses that use space technology for everyday applications to develop their products and expand their companies. The building is also home to The Science and Technology Facilities Council's (STFC) Innovations Technology Access Centre (I-TAC) and RAL space robotics division where the team is developing autonomous robotic platforms that can be used both for space and terrestrial applications; and ESA's European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications (ECSAT).

Variations of the name's translation, including ‚Äúthe Mystery Man with the 21 Faces‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Phantom with 21 Faces‚Äù, have also been used in articles and books featuring the case. Letters =Letters to Ezaki Glico= The Monster with 21 Faces sent its first letter on May 10, 1984, to the giant food company Ezaki Glico following the kidnapping and escape of Katsuhisa Ezaki, president of Glico. The letter stated it had laced $21 million worth of the company's confections with potassium cyanide soda, and it later threatened to put them on store shelves. None of these poisoned candies were found, but Glico products were removed from stores, resulting in a loss of more than $20 million and the laying off of 450 part-time workers. Meanwhile, the Monster with 21 Faces also sent letters to the media, taunting police efforts to capture the culprit(s) behind the scare. An excerpt from one such letter, written in hiragana and with an Osaka dialect, reads, ‚ÄúDear dumb police officers. Don't tell a lie. All crimes begin with a lie as we say in Japan. Don't you know that?‚Äù Another taunting letter was sent to Koshien police station. ‚ÄúWhy don't you keep it to yourself? You seem to be at a loss. So why not let us help you? We'll give you a clue. We entered the factory by the front gate. The typewriter we used is PAN- writer. The plastic container used was a piece of street garbage. Monster with 21 faces.‚Äù On June 26, the Monster with 21 Faces issued a message proclaiming its forgiveness of Glico, and subsequent harassment of the company ceased. =Letters to Morinaga= After ceasing its harassment of Glico, the Monster with 21 Faces began targeting Morinaga, another confectionery company, and food companies Marudai Ham and House Food Corporation with similar criminal campaigns, using the same alias. In October 1984, a letter addressed to \\"Moms of the Nation\\" and signed by the Monster with 21 Faces was sent to Osaka news agencies with a warning similar to those sent to Glico. It stated that 20 packages of Morinaga candy had been laced with deadly sodium cyanide. After receiving this letter, police searched stores in cities from Tokyo to western Japan and found over a dozen lethal packages of Morinaga Choco Balls and Angel Pie before anyone was poisoned. These packages had labels, such as \\"Danger: Contains Toxins\\", put on them. More tampered confections were found in February 1985, making a total of 21 lethal sweet products. =Death of Superintendent Yamamoto and cessation of letters= Unable to capture the suspect believed to be the mastermind behind the Monster with 21 Faces, the police superintendent Yamamoto of Shiga Prefecture died by suicide by self- immolation in August 1985. Five days after this event, on August 12, \\"the Monster‚Äù sent its final message to the media: > Yamamoto of Shiga Prefecture Police died. How stupid of him! We've got no > friends or secret hiding place in Shiga. It's Yoshino or Shikata who should > have died. What have they been doing for as long as one year and five > months?

The statute of limitation for the kidnapping of Katsuhisa Ezaki, president of Glico, ran out in June 1995, and the statute of limitation for the attempted poisonings ran out in February 2000. No suspect was ever caught or convicted of the crimes, and the identity of the Monster with 21 Faces remains a mystery. Major suspects =\\"The Videotaped Man\\"= The released image of the \\"Videotaped Man\\" Following threats by the Monster with 21 Faces to poison Glico confections and the resulting mass withdrawal of Glico products from shelves, a man wearing a Yomiuri Giants baseball cap was caught placing Glico chocolate on a store shelf by a security camera. This man was believed to be behind the Monster with 21 Faces. The security camera photo was made public after this incident. =\\"The Fox-eyed Man\\"= On June 28, 1984, two days after the Monster agreed to stop harassing Marudai Ham in exchange for 50 million yen, police came close to capturing the suspected mastermind. An investigator disguised himself as a Marudai employee and followed the Monster's instructions for the money exchange. As he was riding a train to the money's drop point, he noticed a suspicious man watching him. He was described as a large, well-built man wearing sunglasses and with his hair cut short and permed. He was also quoted to have \\"eyes like those of a fox.\\" As investigators tailed him from train to train, the eventually eluded them. In a later incident, investigators saw the Fox-eyed Man again, accompanying the alleged \\"Monster\\" group during another secret money exchange with House Food Corporation. Once again, he was able to elude police and avoid capture. Tokyo Metropolitan Police at first identified Manabu Miyazaki, a known yakuza, as the Fox-eyed Man and the Videotaped Man because of his resemblance to these suspects, but after his alibis were checked, he was cleared of the Glico- Morinaga crimes.

The genus is endemic to New Zealand. There are seven species within the genus Hemideina, found throughout the country except lowland Otago and Southland. Because many tree wƒìtƒÅ species are common and widespread they have been used extensively in studies of ecology and evolution.  Habitat  Tree wƒìtƒÅ are commonly encountered in forests and suburban gardens throughout most of New Zealand. They are up to 40 mm long and most commonly live in holes in trees formed by beetle and moth larvae or where rot has set in after a twig has broken off. The hole, called a gallery, is maintained by the wƒìtƒÅ and any growth of the bark surrounding the opening is chewed away. They readily occupy a preformed gallery in a piece of wood (a \\"wƒìtƒÅ motel\\") and can be kept in a suburban garden as pets. A gallery might house a harem of up to 10 adult females and one male.  Behaviour  Tree wƒìtƒÅ are nocturnal and arboreal, hiding in hollow tree branches during the day and feeding at night. Their diet consists of leaves, flowers, fruit and small insects. Males have larger heads and stronger jaws than females, though both sexes will stridulate and bite when threatened.

Men who carry the CT clade have Y chromosomes with the SNP mutation M168, along with P9.1 and M294. These mutations are present in all modern human male lineages except A and B-M60, which are both found almost exclusively in Africa. The most recent common male line ancestor (TMRCA) of all CT men today probably predated the recent African origin of modern humans, a migration in which some of his descendants participated. He is therefore thought to have lived in Africa before this proposed migration. In keeping with the concept of \\"Y-chromosomal Adam\\" given to the patrilineal ancestor of all living humans, CT-M168 has therefore also been referred to in popularized accounts as being the lineage of \\"Eurasian Adam\\" or \\"Out of Africa Adam\\"; because, along with many African Y-lineages, all non-African Y-lineages descend from it.Genes, Culture, and Human Evolution: A Synthesis, By Linda Stone, Paul F. Lurquin, 2007, , page 187Darwinian Detectives: Revealing the Natural History of Genes and Genomes, by Norman A. Johnson, 2007, , . No male in paragroup CT* has ever been discovered in modern populations. This means that all males carrying this haplogroup are also defined as being in one of the several major branch clades. All known surviving descendant lineages of CT are in one of two major subclades, CF and DE. In turn, DE is divided into a predominantly Asia-distributed haplogroup D-CTS3946 and a predominantly Africa-distributed haplogroup E-M96, while CF is divided into an East Asian, Native American, and Oceanian haplogroup C-M130 and haplogroup F-M89, which dominates most non-African populations.

It was most notable for being the band on which both members ‚Äì singer David McAlmont and multi-instrumentalist/producer Saul Freeman (the latter to go on to trip-hop band Mandalay) ‚Äì based their subsequent musical careers. Critically feted by the British weekly music press during their lifetime, the duo also won two Single of the Week awards in Melody Maker but split shortly before the scheduled release of their debut album (which was later released as McAlmont's debut solo album). History =Formation= David McAlmont (born David Irving McAlmont, 2 May 1967, Croydon, EnglandKnittingcircle.org.uk mini- biography ), originally of Guyanese/Nigerian heritage, was raised as a Christian and spent his early years in Croydon, Cardiff and Guyana. He began his musical life in Guyana singing in church choirs. His Christian upbringing would clash with his growing realisation of his homosexuality in his teenage years . By the age of 20, his experiences had ultimately led him to decide to be true to his sexual nature. While exploring the London independent pop scene of the early 1990s, McAlmont encountered Saul Freeman, an accomplished multi- instrumentalist and programmer with whom he formed Thieves (naming the band after a work by Jean Cocteau). Freeman was influenced predominantly by post- punk pop and rock bands (such as Scritti Politti, Associates and Cocteau Twins), and Thieves blended this with McAlmont's own gospel and soul influences to create a lush and highly textural pop music drawing equally on \\"black\\" music and \\"white\\" avant-garde indie rock. Freeman and McAlmont opted to remain as a duo, using detailed backing tapes and programmed percussion tracks (Live, Freeman concentrated on playing strongly-processed electric guitar). =Early live work= Thieves began playing concerts in small London venues, where they immediately began to attract attention. The group's format of black singer/white instrumentalist was not in itself unusual, but as a black frontman who was also a flamboyantly \\"out\\" homosexual (with presentation to match) McAlmont was seen as an exotic rarity, as was his striking three- octave voice. McAlmont's outrageous dress sense (and taste for cross-dressing) also became notorious, with one review describing him as \\"a strawberry daiquiri in a dress\\". The outspoken and photogenic McAlmont became a minor celebrity on the London indie scene, while the quieter Freeman took more of a smaller role in interviews and concentrated more heavily on Thieves' multi- layered and complex musical arrangements with producer/engineer Michael J. Ade. =Singles (\\"Through The Door\\" and \\"Unworthy\\")= In 1992 Thieves signed to the tiny Nursery Records label, on which they released their debut single. \\"Through the Door\\" (on which Freeman's Cocteau Twins influences dominated) won the Single of the Week award in Melody Maker and gained sufficient interest for Thieves to move up to Nursery's parent company, Hut Recordings (itself a subsidiary of Virgin Records). Later in the year, the first Hut release ‚Äì Thieves' second single \\"Unworthy\\" ‚Äì showed the duo moving in a much more pop- orientated direction. With more obvious soul influences (having some melodic and atmospheric similarities to Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\"), it also sampled dialogue from a variety of additional pop culture touchstones including Torch Song Trilogy and Thirtysomething. Like its predecessor, it became a Melody Maker Single of the Week. The band's next step was to play as support act to Morrissey on the latter's British tour, helping them to build a new audience. Album recording and split With strong expectations of a commercial breakthrough, Thieves were booked into a studio in Soho, London, to complete material for their debut album. Pulp producer Ed Buller oversaw the sessions, with further strong input from musician/producer Paul Sampson. During the sessions, problems began to develop. McAlmont would subsequently complain that Buller's approach to Thieves' music had ended up sidelining him, and that he had increasingly been provided with musical backdrops to sing over with which he had little sympathy or feeling. (This experience would help McAlmont find common ground with a subsequent collaborator, Bernard Butler, who claimed similar frustrations with Buller's production of the second Suede album Dog Man Star.) Shortly before the scheduled release of the album, the working relationship between Freeman and McAlmont broke down completely. The album was temporarily shelved. The duo were unable to reach agreement on the issues dividing them and Thieves consequently split up. =Release of remaining material under \\"McAlmont\\" name= Once legal matters with Freeman had been cleared up, Hut Recordings were left with the completed Thieves recordings. As David McAlmont was comparatively celebrated in indie circles (while Freeman had had less of a presence in publicity and interviews) it was decided that these recordings would be released under the project name of \\"McAlmont\\" to further McAlmont's career. A third single, \\"Either\\", was the first formal McAlmont release. The Thieves album was released as the eponymous McAlmont album in 1996, with Saul Freeman's instrumental and songwriting contributions fully credited but with all artwork featuring McAlmont alone. The album contained two of the three singles ‚Äì \\"Either\\" and \\"Unworthy\\" ‚Äì plus the \\"Unworthy\\" B-side \\"They Hide\\" and a cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"Conversation\\", but did not contain any of the material from the \\"Through The Door\\" EP (Some of the \\"Through The Door\\" material was contained on a limited- edition second CD enclosed with early versions of the album). McAlmont was well received by those critics who reviewed it, but the delay (and the loss of the Thieves brand name) had already stalled its momentum. It did not sell well or make a public breakthrough. Post Thieves Saul Freeman teamed up with singer-composer and multi-instrumentalist Nicola Hitchcock in 1995 to form the trip hop duo Mandalay. This project would go on to greater success than Thieves, releasing two albums ‚Äì Empathy and Instinct ‚Äì plus the US-only compilation Solace before splitting in 2002. David McAlmont continued his career by linking up with former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler for the intermittent McAlmont and Butler project (which scored a Top 10 single in 1995 with its debut release \\"Yes\\" and has gone on to release two albums, The Sound of McAlmont and Butler and Bring It Back, plus several more singles). He would continue his solo career with a more conventional soul album (A Little Communication, 1998) and the unreleased dance-orientated album Be (2000). Most recently he has been recording albums containing new versions of song standards (the first of which, Set One: You Go To My Head, was released in 2005) and working with Michael Nyman. Over the years he has toned down the flamboyance (and, to a degree, the outright expression of his sexuality) which he displayed with Thieves in favour of a more neutral image, and has concentrated more on his abilities as a singer. Despite their past differences, Freeman and McAlmont were reconciled briefly in 2000 (at the time of the second Mandalay album Instinct) . The duo worked for fun on a number of tracks and one of these ‚Äì Santa Getrudis ‚Äì was signed to the Echo Label under the name Playas. This jazz tinged house influenced track recounted the story of McAlmont hanging out with Mandalay in a villa in Ibiza during the summer of 2001 whilst they were on the island appearing at festivals and staying up late.

Where applicable, PTIPS can also provide transport vehicles with priority at traffic signals. PTIPS consists of a number of hardware and software components installed on-board buses which wirelessly communicate with a central set of servers. PTIPS also relies on an interface with Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS - to provide the priority feature) and bus/route/timetable data provided by bus organisations and government authorities. PTIPS provides: * Real-time tracking of bus location and status * Traffic light priority for late running buses * Bus/Timetable performance and reliability reports * Real-time Bus arrival information for bus stops How PTIPS Works PTIPS works by combining, on the one hand, schedule and route path information for buses performing timetabled services (as opposed to, say, charter trips), and on the other hand, live location data transmitted by the buses to PTIPS. PTIPS receives XML data files from the public and private bus operators, which contain information relating to planned trips (for example, route paths, trips & schedules, bus stops etc.) Each bus that PTIPS tracks is equipped with a hardware device that records its location via GPS, and transmits it to the central PTIPS servers via the 3G radio communications network. Buses transmit these messages at certain intervals (which are configurable, and which vary depending on what the bus is doing), and also when they pass certain points along their intended route. Apart from GPS location, the transmitted messages also include information about the vehicle and which trip it is doing. With the above information, PTIPS can compare the location of a bus performing a certain trip, at a certain point in time, with where it should be, based on the planned route and timetable data. Real time apps Transport for New South Wales worked with several developers in late 2012 to create, and release smartphone applications with access to the realtime bus data provided from PTIPS. Currently, only State Transit bus operating in Inner Sydney including South Harbour, Inner North, and Northern Beaches and Eastern Suburbs (Bus regions 6 - 9) have data available. Released in December 2012, several iOS and Android apps went live on their respective App Stores, allowing customers to open the apps, and track where their buses were in realtime, as well as any delays or timetable changes as they occur. In 2013, this realtime data was further expanded to provide live train information from Sydney Trains, Hillsbus and Busways Blacktown as well.

Sufficient data is not always available to determine which, if any, member haplogroup a Y chromosome in BT belongs to. For instance, a survey of Y chromosomes in over 2000 men from different parts of Africa reported that 7.5% carried haplogroup BT(xDE, KT), i.e. were members of haplogroup BT but not DE or K; such a sample might or might not include members of haplogroups B, C, or F (excluding K), or some undiscovered branch(es) of BT belonging to none of these.

History =Origin= The circuit was designed in the late 1960s by the Japanese company Honey, in the form of a multi effect called the Honey Psychedelic Machine. Later on, Honey was taken on by Shin-ei, who produced the effect separately (who also produced another well known fuzz box, the Shin-ei Companion FY-2) and imported in the USA by Unicord. The first Super-Fuzzes were made in 1968, and production continued until the late 70s. =Design= The first units were made in a simple stamped sheet metal box, painted grey, with a blue metal Univox sticker on the top. Around 1970 production was changed to a die-cast metal box, with a large pedal featuring a rubber cover that had the words \\"Super-Fuzz\\" embossed on it. The first die cast units were either grey or black, with a green or black foot pedal. Around 1973 or so, they were all produced with an orange pedal, with a green or blue foot pedal. The later models also featured an internal trim pot for controlling the octave balance. =Alternative manufacturers= Although the Univox units are the most well-known incarnation of this circuit, Shin-ei licensed this circuit out to dozens of manufacturers. Sound This fuzz is an octave fuzz using two germanium diodes to produce the square wave clipping. The controls are 'Balance' (volume), 'Expander' (fuzz amount), a two position 'tone' switch, and an on/off footswitch on top. There are two unique features of this device that set it apart from other distortion and fuzz pedals. The first is that the full-wave rectification of the circuit produces an upper octave as well as a slight lower octave. This also gives the sound a lot of compression and gives a mild ring modulator effect. The second unique feature is a tone switch that engages a 1kHz filter that \\"scoops\\" the mids, giving a very fat, almost bassy tone, unique to this circuit. Super-Fuzz users Notable musicians who have used the Super-Fuzz include: * Adam Yauch of Beastie Boys * Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins * Billy Cox of Jimi Hendrix * Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie * Elliott Frazier of Ringo Deathstarr * Gary Louris of The Jayhawks * Hillel Slovak of Red Hot Chili Peppers * J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. * Joe Denardo of Growing * Jon Niederbrach of The Untold Fables * Joe Preston of Thrones * Josh Homme of Them Crooked Vultures, Queens of the Stone Age and Kyuss * Jus Oborn of Electric Wizard * Kurt Cobain of Nirvana * Mark Arm and Steve Turner of Mudhoney * Pete Townshend of The Who * Poison Ivy of The Cramps * Scott Hill of Fu Manchu * Steve Hackett of Genesis (rebranded as the Shaftesbury Duo-Fuzz) * Tony McPhee of The Groundhogs * Paul Vinegar of Jahbulong References External links * Effects Database page on the Super-Fuzz * Coda Effects post about the history of the Super Fuzz Category:Effects units ","title":"Univox Super-Fuzz"},{"id":"10699234","text":"Providence Holy Cross Medical Center is a hospital in the Mission Hills district of Los Angeles, California, US.

The name \\"large-billed lark\\" may also refer to Bradfield's lark. The name \\"thick-billed lark\\" more commonly refers to the species of the same name (i.e. Rhamphocoris clotbey). Taxonomy and systematics The large-billed lark was originally placed in the genus Alauda, and then Calendula until that genus was subsequently re-named to the present Galerida. Another alternate name used for the large-billed lark is the long-billed lark. = Subspecies = Three subspecies are recognized: * G. m. magnirostris (Stephens, 1826): Found in south-western South Africa * G. m. sedentaria Clancey, 1993: Found in south-western Namibia and western South Africa * Orange Free State large-billed lark, G. m. harei (Roberts, 1924): Found in central South Africa, Lesotho Description The large-billed lark is 18 cm in length. It is relatively short-tailed and has a thick bill with a yellow base to the lower mandible. It has streaked brown-grey upperparts, and a long white supercilium. Like other species in the genus, it has a crest that can be raised in display or alarm. The underparts are cream-coloured with heavy dark streaking on the breast. The heavy bi-coloured bill distinguishes this species from all other African larks. The call of this very vocal species is a soft creaking \\"treeeeleeeeleee\\". Distribution and habitat The large- billed lark is a resident breeder in southern South Africa, Lesotho and southernmost Namibia. Its natural habitat is fynbos, karoo scrub and mountain grassland. The large-billed lark is also found in cultivated and fallow agricultural land. Behaviour and ecology Like other larks, the large- billed lark nests on the ground. Its food is seeds and insects, the latter especially in the breeding season.

Robert Fitzharding (c. 1095‚Äì1170) was an Anglo-Saxon nobleman from Bristol who was granted the feudal barony of Berkeley in Gloucestershire. He rebuilt Berkeley Castle, and founded the Berkeley family which still occupies it today. He was a wealthy Bristol merchant and a financier of the future King Henry II of England (1133-1189) in the period known as the Anarchy during which Henry's mother, the Empress Matilda (1102-1167), mounted repeated military challenges to King Stephen (d. 1154). Fitzharding founded St. Augustine's Abbey, which after the Reformation became Bristol Cathedral. Many members of the Berkeley family were buried within it, and some of their effigies survive there. As J. Horace Round asserted he was one of the very few Anglo-Saxon noblemen who managed to retain their noble status in Norman England and successfully integrate with the Norman nobility, if not the only one.Round, J. Horace, Family Origins and Other Studies, London, 1930, \\"An Approved Pre-Conquest Pedigree\\", pp.13‚Äì22 Early life Robert Fitzharding Robert Fitzharding is believed to have been the grandson of Eadnoth, who had held the post of Staller under King Edward the Confessor and King Harold. Robert's father Harding of Bristol was the King's Reeve in Bristol, with a house in Baldwin Street. Robert later built a large house in Broad Street, on the River Frome. He became a burgess of the city and sufficiently wealthy to buy from Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester extensive manorial lands around Bristol to its south and west, including Redcliffe, Bedminster, Leigh, Portbury and Billeswick. St Augustine's Abbey In 1140, Fitzharding founded St Augustine's Abbey as a Victorine Augustinian monastery. The chosen site was in Billeswick, just across the River Frome from Bristol Castle. He endowed the abbey with many lands, and the rights to revenues from many churches, in Bristol and within several counties. In 1148 he chose Richard of Warwick as the first abbot. In 1155 King Henry II made endowments to the abbey and in 1159 Fitzharding confirmed his own endowments by charter. The abbey carried out a building programme during Fitzharding's lifetime which created a new abbey church, the chapter house and the Great Gatehouse. Barony of Berkeley alt=Berkeley Castle In the conflict of the Anarchy, Bristol Castle was held by Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester for the Plantagenet cause against King Stephen. In 1152 Roger de Berkeley was dispossessed by Plantagenet forces of the fee-farm of Berkeley Castle, held from King Stephen, for refusing to give allegiance to the Plantagenet cause. These lands included Berkeley, Filton, Horfield, Almondsbury and Ashleworth, and other English and Welsh possessions including land in Gwent and Glamorgan. This left Roger de Berkeley with a truncated barony centred on Dursley.Stacy, N. Henry of Blois and the Lordship of Glastonbury, in The English Historical Review, Oxford, vol CXIV, Feb.1999,pp.13‚Äì14. Following the victory and crowning of King Henry II, Fitzharding was rewarded by the king for his support with the grant of a feudal barony which comprised lands which had formerly been held at fee-farm from Stephen by Roger de Berkeley, including Berkeley Castle itself, which became the caput of the new barony.Sanders, 1960, \\"Certain\\" Barony of Berkeley, p.13 Fitzharding made further endowments to St Augustine's Abbey from these territories. In 1153‚Äì54 Fitzharding received a royal charter from Henry II giving him permission to rebuild the castle at Berkeley. The previous castle was originally a motte-and-bailey built by William FitzOsbern shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and had been rebuilt in the 12th century by the dispossessed Roger de Berkeley and his father. Fitzharding built the shell keep between 1153‚Äì56, on the site of the former motte. The building of the curtain wall followed, around 1160‚Äì90. Later life According to the 13th- century Norman verse The Song of Dermot and the Earl, Fitzharding acted as an intermediary between Dermot MacMurrough, the exiled King of Leinster, and Henry II in Dermot's attempts to raise Norman support for his planned recapture of Leinster. The song tells that Dermot was a guest in Fitzharding's house in Bristol. Some time before his death Fitzharding became a canon of the abbey he had founded. He died in 1170. Robert Fitzharding also owned a property in Gloucestershire where Beverston Castle (completed in 1229) would later be built by his grandson, Marice de Gaunt.https://books.google.ca/books?id=esIHAAAAQAAJ&pg;=PA62&lpg;=PA62&dq;=Beverston++Maurice+Paynel+de+Gaunt&source;=bl&ots;=_wl8nlzGLf&sig;=ACfU3U29pW- OjI8QS8F7dzfK32U5Jf9KfQ&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwj5m93C9dLjAhWXU80KHa66DEwQ6AEwDXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Beverston%20%20Maurice%20Paynel%20de%20Gaunt&f;=false, page 61-62 The ancestry of Robert Fitzharding's wife Eva is not certain. She was founder and first abbess of the Augustinian nunnery of St Mary Magdalen on St Michael's Hill, Bristol, having endowed it with lands in Southmead. Eva was buried alongside her husband in the choir of St Augustine's Abbey. They are commemorated with a 19th-century stained glass window in the Cathedral, depicting them with Henry II. Descendants Robert's first son, and heir, was Maurice fitzRobert fitzHarding, also known as Maurice de Berkeley, born c. 1120. Duke Henry of Aquitaine (the future Henry II) had clearly regretted the effect of his action in dispossessing Roger de Berkeley of his former lands, and determined to facilitate the junction of the two families by encouraging dual intermarriages. In 1153‚Äì54 Maurice married Alice, the first daughter of the dispossessed Roger de Berkeley, who was now feudal baron of nearby Dursley.Sanders, I.J., English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086‚Äì1327, Oxford, 1960, Probable Baronies, Dursley, pp.114‚Äì115 At the same time Robert's first daughter Helen married Roger's heir, also called Roger. This double marriage contract, binding the son and heir of each man to marry a daughter of the other, was signed at the house of Robert FitzHarding in Bristol in the presence of Duke Henry and 16 witnesses.Jeayes, I.H. (ed.) Charters and Muniments at Berkeley Castle. Bristol, 1892. Charter no. 4, c. Nov. 1153, pp. 4‚Äì5. Robert Fitzharding's daughter, Adeva Fitzhardinge, married Nigel Fitzarthur, and from them began the Kingscote family.

It was later released for the Amiga 1200 and MS-DOS. Diggers was bundled with the CD32 at launch, along with a 2D platformer entitled Oscar on the same CD. A sequel, Diggers 2: Extractors, was released for DOS in 1995. Gameplay The game is set on the planet Zarg, where four races are vying for the gems and ores buried there. The four races are: the Habbish, who dig quickly and have high endurance, yet are impatient and prone to wander off; Grablins, who dig the fastest, have good stamina but are weak fighters; Quarriors, who are slow diggers but strong fighters; and the F'Targs, who are mediocre but regain their health quickly. The player chooses one of the four races, then sends out five man teams to mine a region. There are 34 regions in all, with two accessible at the beginning of the game. Each region has an amount of money the player must amass in order to beat it and open up the adjacent territories. Time plays a role, as there is always a computer-controlled opposing race in the region, competing with the player to be the first to achieve the monetary goal. The gameplay is similar in some ways to Lemmings, with the player issuing orders to his five miners, not directly controlling them. The stages themselves are viewed from the side - the mineshafts that extend throughout the levels give the impression of an anthill. The player commands his units to dig and, when needed, perform more specific actions such as picking up gems and fighting enemy diggers. The races have various personalities, and will occasionally do things without the player commanding them to; this can range from good (such as fighting an enemy) to very bad (walking into a deep pool of water and drowning). As the miners dig, rubies, gold, emeralds, and diamonds will appear. At any time the player can teleport a miner back to the starting point and send him to the 'Zargon Stock Exchange', in order to trade the finds for money. Only three commodities are traded at one time, and the prices for each fluctuate depending on how much of a particular item has recently been sold. Here the player may also visit a shop and buy special mining tools, such as dynamite, automated drillers and bridge components. The miners themselves are expendable (though a monetary loss will be incurred for each lost worker), with a fresh set of five available each time a new level is entered. Reception Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Diggers has all the appeal of Lemmings with a good dose of exploration and greed thrown in to boot.\\" References External links * *Diggers at Amiga Reviews Category:1993 video games Category:Acorn Archimedes games Category:Amiga games Category:Amiga 1200 games Category:CD32 games Category:DOS games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment franchises Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games scored by Richard Joseph ","title":"Diggers (video game)"},{"id":"10699514","text":"The Dials are a British band formed in 2002 in Brighton, England.

Often named as the most influential Muslim writer in China, his historical narrative History of the Soul, about the rise of the Jahriyya () Sufi order, was the second-most popular book in China in 1994.Gladney 2000 Biography Zhang was born in Beijing in 1948 to Hui parents of Shandong origin.Deng 1989 Despite his Muslim ancestry, he was raised as an atheist. He graduated from Tsinghua University Middle School in 1967, at the height of the Cultural Revolution. According to the People's Daily, Zhang was the first person to call himself a \\"Red Guard\\"; he used it as his pen name during his student days. Then on May 29, 1966, just two weeks after the People's Daily announced the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Zhang convinced around ten other senior-level students to use the collective name \\"Mao Zedong's Red Guards\\" in addition to their individual signatures when signing a big- character poster denouncing their school officials; three days later, they issued another large-character poster under the same collective name, entitled \\"We Must Resolutely Carry Out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to its End\\", with over one hundred signatures. Soon, students from all over Beijing began to call themselves \\"Red Guards\\".People's Daily 2001-04-13.

Yuan 2004Ujimqin Banner is administratively divided into East Ujimqin Banner and West Ujimqin Banner; sources do not specify exactly where Zhang worked Soon after his return, he entered the archaeology department of Peking University, graduating in 1975. He began his writing career in 1978, with the publication of a poem in Mongolian entitled \\"Son of the People\\" (ÂÅö‰∫∫Ê∞ë‰πãÂ≠ê/Arad-un-huu) and a Chinese- language short story \\"Why does the rider sing?\\" ().Xinhua 2006-05-17 That same year, he entered a master's program in history at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences's Department of Minority Languages, from which he graduated in 1981. In 1983, he received funding to go to Japan as an international exchange scholar, where he conducted research at Tokyo's T≈çy≈ç Bunko, the largest Asian studies library in Japan. Aside from Chinese and Mongolian, Zhang also speaks Japanese.The Black Steed, English edition back matterXinhua 2004-03-15 Zhang noted that during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Hui Muslims were suspicious of the intentions of Japanese researchers and deliberately concealed important religious information from them when interviewed. Literary career Zhang is often identified as a representative of the so-called xungen movement (\\"searching for roots\\"), despite the fact that he himself dismisses entire concept of xungen.Wang 2004.Shi 2002. His work repeatedly touches on the themes of martyrdom, everlasting tradition, and resistance to materialism and urban life.Wu 2000: 128‚Äì29. Unlike many other authors who lived through the Cultural Revolution and regret the chaos it created in their lives, even Zhang's early works such as Rivers of the North and Black Steed exhibit a noticeable level of idealism about his time as a Red Guard, and clearly demonstrate his desire to rebut the presumptions of scar literature.McDougall and Louie 1997: 395‚Äì96.J. Yuan 2004. Analyses of Zhang's impact on Chinese literature and thought vary greatly. Zhu Xueqin expressed his admiration of Zhang for \\"casting off his old self\\" and taking a \\"firm stand\\" for idealistic values and against ethnocentrism.Zhu 2003: 96. Dru Gladney, in contrast, analysed Zhang's popularity in terms of a larger trend of consumerist exoticisation of \\"ethnic chic\\" in 1990s China.Gladney 2000. Some scholars, both in China and abroad, go further in rendering harsh judgments: they denounce Zhang as \\"xenophobic\\" and criticise his continued support of Maoism even after his conversion to Islam.Fisac 2003: 164. The early 1980s have been described as Zhang's \\"lyrical phase\\".Li 2000: 115. As a result of his works during this period, he has been described as one of China's first practitioners of \\"stream of consciousness\\" fiction. In 1984, however, Zhang quit his job at the China Writers' Association and moved to China's Northwest, spending six years living with the Muslims of Xihaigu, Ningxia. His time there resulted not only in his conversion to Islam and, in one critic's words, his \\"open renunciation of Chinese culture\\", but also in what is easily his most famous book: History of the Soul, a work of narrative historical fiction which explores personal and religious conflicts during 172 years of development of the Jahriyya tariqah in China's northwest, interwoven with his own observations.Lin 2005: 133‚Äì36.

By revitalizing the refrigeration plant and installing new chillers, the CPP increased chilled water efficiency with new chillers that are 20 percent more efficient. These chillers aren't small‚Äîone can use more electricity than the Rayburn House Office Building or Hart Senate Office Building on the busiest day of the year. Water efficiency is reducing water wastage by measuring the amount of water required for a particular purpose and the amount of water used or delivered.Vickers, Amy. ‚ÄúWater Use and Conservation.‚Äù Amherst, MA Waterplow Press. June 2002. 434 Water efficiency differs from water conservation in that it focuses on reducing waste, not restricting use. Waterwise Solutions for water efficiency focus not only on reducing the amount of potable water used, but also on reducing the use of non-potable water where appropriate (i.e. flushing toilet, watering landscape, etc.).https://sftool.gov/learn/about/45/water-efficiency It also emphasises the influence consumers can have in water efficiency by making small behavioural changes to reduce water wastage and by choosing more water efficient products. Examples of water efficient steps includes fixing leaking taps, taking showers rather than baths, installing displacements devices inside toilet cisterns, males using urinals rather than toilet stalls, and using dishwashers and washing machines with full loads. These are things that fall under the definition of water efficiency, as their purpose is to obtain the desired result or level of service with the least necessary water. Importance According to the Second UN World Water Development Report, if present levels of consumption continue, two-thirds of the global population will live in areas of water stress by 2025.The 2nd UN World Water Development Report: ‚ÄòWater, a shared responsibility‚Äô Increasing human demand for water coupled with the effects of climate change mean that the future of our water supply is not secure. As of now, 2.6 billion people do not have safe drinking water. Added to this, are the changes in climate, population growth and lifestyles. The changes in human lifestyle and activities require more water per capita. This tightens the competition for water amongst agricultural, industrial, and human consumption.WWC Organizations In most countries, people have recognized this growing water scarcity problem. Water efficiency, while not yet a major priority in the agendas of governments, has been a growing concern. Global organizations like the World Water Council, the International Water Management Institute,IWMI IWMI and UNESCOUNESCO Water have been promoting water efficiency alongside water conservation. The Alliance for Water Efficiency, Waterwise, the California Urban Water Conservation Council, and Smart WaterMark in Australia, and the WaterBucket in Canada are some non- governmental organizations that promote or support water efficiency at national and regional levels. Governmental organisations such as Environment Canada, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Environment Agency in the United Kingdom, the Department of the Environment and Water Resources in Australia, among others, have recognized and created policies and strategies to raise water efficiency awareness. US EPA created its WaterSense program to encourage water efficiency in the United States through the use of a special label on consumer products. The People's Republic of China has put forward a 5-year plan (2010-2015) at a cost of Y500 billion ($78.1 billion) to Y600 billion ($93.7 billion) to upgrade most of the 4,000 water plants in China. The government hopes these steps will help to better conserve water and meet demands.Chinese Business Review: Water The Indian state of Haryana, has implemented State Rural Water Policy 2012; under this policy individual household metered connections would be provided to 50% of the rural population by 2017, to stop water wastage in villages.Water Preservation in Rural India http://iharnews.com/index.php/government/231-haryana-rural-water-policy-2012 A part of the industry sector has also recognised the benefits of water efficiency. Such journals as the Water Efficiency JournalWater Efficiency Journal from the US, Water Efficient Solutions JournalWater Efficient Solutions Journal and Water Energy and EnvironmentWater Energy and Environment Magazine from the UK, all mainly directed towards the industrial and professional sectors, attest to the growing consciousness of the need to develop more water efficient solutions. Water efficient solutions =Residential= Here are some simple ways to be more water efficient at home * Turning off the tap while brushing teeth - a running tap can waste over six liters per minute. * Putting a displacement device into the toilet cistern. * Installing aerators or flow reducer (NFR) of less flow on taps/faucet and reducing water wastage. * Installing water efficient showers in bathrooms for bathing. * Fixing dripping taps. A dripping tap wastes thousands of litres of water a year. * Using a full load in the dishwasher and washing machine. A person should be sure to buy a water efficient model when buying a new machine. * Having a short shower instead of a bath. * Washing fruits and vegetables in a bowl rather than under a running tap. * Using the leftover water to feed houseplants. * Using a watering can or a hosepipe with a trigger nozzle instead of a sprinkler. * Using a bucket and sponge when washing the car rather than a running hosepipe. * Using little amounts of water at every time * Washing clothing or linens in washing machines rather than washing by hand Consumers can also voluntarily or with utility or government incentives or mandates purchase water-efficient appliances, such as low-flush toilets and front-loading washers. Greywater can be recycled for toilet flushing or garden use. =Manufacturing= According to Savewater!, these are solutions useful to manufacturers:Savewater! * Identifying and eliminating wastage (such as leaks) and inefficient processes (such as continual spray devices on stop- start production lines). This may be the most low cost area for water savings, as it involves minimal capital outlay. Savings can be made through implementing procedural changes, such as cleaning plant areas with brooms rather than water. * Changing processes and plant machinery. A retrofit of key plant equipment may increase efficiency. Alternatively, upgrades to more efficient models can be factored into planned maintenance and replacement schedules. * Reusing wastewater. As well as saving on mains water, this option may improve the reliability of supply, whilst reducing trade waste charges and associated environmental risks. Waterless products * Using waterless car wash products to wash cars, boats, motorcycles and bicycles. This could save up to 150 gallons of water per wash. =Utilities= The US EPA, offer some water saving tips for communities and utilities:U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. \\"Using Water Efficiently: Ideas for Communities.\\" March 28, 2008. * Implementing a water-loss management program (e.g. locate and repair leaks). * Utilities should strive for universal metering. * Ensuring that fire hydrants are tamper proof. * Equipment changes - Setting a good example by using water efficient equipment. * Installing faucet aerators and low flow shower heads in municipal buildings. * Replace worn out plumbing fixtures, appliances and equipment with water-saving models. * Minimizing the water used in space cooling equipment in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Shut off cooling units when not needed. * Continue encouraging boys and men to use urinals rather than toilet stalls in school and work office restrooms. Utilities can also modify their billing software to track customers who have taken advantage of various utility sponsored water conservation initiatives (toilet rebates, irrigation rebates, etc.) to see which initiatives provide the greatest water savings for the least cost. Water policies and impact assessments Watercyclesummary Earth water distribution Environmental policies and the difference usages of models that are generated by these enforcements can have significant impacts on the society. Hence, improving policies regarding environmental justice issues often require local government's decision making, public awareness, and significant amount of scientific tools. Furthermore, it is important to understand that positively impacting policy decisions require more than good intentions, and they necessitate analysis of risk-related information along with consideration of economic issues, ethical and moral principles, legal precedents, political realities, cultural beliefs, societal values, and bureaucratic impediments.Sexton, Ken & Linder, Stephen H. (2010). The Role of Cumulative risk Assessment in Decisions about Environmental Justice. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2010, 7, 4037-4049 Also, ensuring that the rights of people regardless of their age, race, and backgrounds are being protected should not be neglected according to \\"The Role of Cumulative risk Assessment in Decisions about Environmental Justice.\\" Also, the article suggests that if a policy protects the natural environment but negatively affects those who in the reach of the enforcement of the policy, that policy is subjected to revaluation. Researchers suggests racial and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to environmental hazards describing the demographic composition of areas and their proximity to hazardous sites.House, J., Lantz, Paula M., Mero, R., Mohai, P., & Morenoff, J. (2009). Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Residential Proximity to Polluting Industrial Facilities: Evidence from the Americans' Changing Lives Study. American Journal of Public Health  Supplement 3, 2009, Vol 99, No. S3 Then, any improvements of a social policy and models that are generated by these improvements should reflect the policy- makers' and researchers' environmental justice beliefs. Therefore, researches and social changes should examine the promises and pitfalls associated with the environmental justice struggles, explore implications of proposed solutions, and recognize the fact that tools necessary to sufficiently carry preceding requirements are yet underdeveloped.Annu. Rev. Environ. Resourc. 2009.34:405-430. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org by University of California - Berkeley on 12/11/11 = Examples =  Reef Plan (Australia) The Reef Plan started as an attempt to come up with a new ways to create models that integrate environmental, economical, and social consequences.Smajgl, A., Morris, S., & Heckbert, S. (2008). Water policy impact assessment - combining modelling techniques in the great barrier reef region. Water Policy, 11(2), 191-202. Pre-existing Australian water policies were often criticizes previous models for focusing too much on investment prioritization and economic dimensions when it came to policy impact assessment. However, the policy makers and researchers in Australia now suggest that \\"sustainability focused policy requires multi-dimensional indicators\\" that combine different disciplines. The Reef Plan allows the policy makers to identify issues relating to Reef water quality and implement management strategies and actions to conserve and rehabilitate areas such as riparian zones and wetlands.Australian Government.(2003). Reef Plan: For catchments adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. With the Reef Plan, Nine strategies were implemented in the Great Barrier Reef region. They include self-management approaches, education and extension, economic incentives, planning for natural resources management and land use, regulatory frameworks, research and information sharing, partnership, priorities and targets, and monitoring and evaluation. And such improvements invoked benefits such as: # more comprehensive picture of the policy impacts. New models projected possible outcomes of different simulation of the proposed policies under various circumstances. In addition, they provided the optimal decisions to be made regarding each outcome through the usage of what is known as computable general equilibrium (CGE) which ‚Äúintegrate dynamics on a catchment scale‚Äù # helping the aggregation of both economics aspects of water and non- monetary elements of water usage. # acknowledging the fact that farm production should depend on the global dynamics  Conserved Water Statutes (United States)  Water-conservation-stamp-1960 Conserved Water Statutes are state laws enacted by California, Montana, Washington, and Oregon to conserve water and allocate water resources to meet the needs of increasing demand for water in the dry lands where irrigation is or was occurring. These laws helps the states to dismiss the disincentives to conserve water and do so without damaging pre-existing water rights.Behnampour, L. C. (2011). \\"Reforming a Western Institution: How Expending the Productivity of Water Rights Could Lessen Our Water Woes.\\" Environmental Law (Portland), 41(1), 201-232. Because any extra amount of water after applying water to a beneficiaries of the pre-existing water policies does not belong to the appropriators, such a condition creates an incentive to use as much water as possible rather than saving. This obviously causes costs of irrigation to be greater than the optimal amount which makes the policy very inefficient. However, by enacting Conserved Water Statutes, state legislatures are able to address the disincentives to save water. The policy allows the appropriators to have rights over the surplus water and enforces them to verify their water savings by the water resources department. Out of the four states that adapted the Conserved Water Statutes, Oregon is often renowned to be the most successful. According to \\"How Expanding The Productivity of Water Rights Could Lessen Our Water Woes,\\" The Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD) has been a success because a high percentage of submitted applications submitted, and the OWRD serves as a good intermediaries that help appropriators to conserve water. OWRD‚Äôs programs are not only a success because its effectiveness but also because of their efforts to improve the workers‚Äô working conditions.http://www.oregon.gov/oha/oei/Pages/cultural-competency.aspx According to OWRD's website, the state policies regarding the water rights are divided into Cultural Competency, Traditional Health Worker, Coordinated Care Organizations, and Race, Ethnicity and Language Data Collection.  Water pollution in Malaysia  Water Pollution with Trash Disposal of Waste at the Garbage Beach In Malaysia, the citizens have been experiencing harms from water pollutants in the river that have been accumulating over decades due to fast growing urbanization and industrialization.Muyibi, S. A., Ambali, A. R., & Eissa, G. S. (2008). Development-induced water pollution in Malaysia: Policy implications from an econometric analysis. Water Policy, 10(2), 193-206 The planners of Malaysia have been trying to coming up with models that indicate the amount of pollutants has grown over time as cities became more industrialized and how these chemicals are distributed in various regions with the usage of econometrics and various scientific tools. Such an attempt is encourages in-depth researches because sources should be able to analyzed numerically and give economic evaluations while also evaluating the environment.Bernardo, D. J., Mapp, H. P., Sabbagh, G. J., Geleta, S., Watkins, K. B., Elliott, R. L., & Stone, J. F. (1993). Economic and environmental impacts of water quality protection policies. 1. framework for regional analysis. Water Resources Research, 29(9), 3069-3080. With abundance of evidences provided by models which reveal the inadequacy of current policies, the Malaysian decisions-makers now recognize that appropriate treatments are necessary in regions that are industrialized to protect the residents from water pollutants. As a result, the government seeks to increase public awareness and provide affordable water services to residents by year 2020.http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/ab776e/ab776e02.htm = Benefits of impact assessments = Successful policies and assessments integrate environmental, economical, and social consequences which provides better models and potential future improvements of the policies. Understanding the importance of water policies and impact assessments is a crucial part of both water justice and environmental justice issues. Not only does it help to protect the quality of water but also the quality of living for humans who are directly affected by the environment. In addition, successful policies goes beyond water issues. Beneficial policies that are intended to benefit the general public touches upon subjects such as transportation and other environmental policies that may have significant impact on the surrounding environment.https://www.wholecommunities.org/pdf/WTJ4text%20and%20cover.pdf Instead of mere cost-benefit analysis, decisions are made so that they account for the priorities of the people.

This was done with cooperation of the Greenville Hospital System and LifePoint, South Carolina's organ and tissue recovery agency. A TV special was planned along with public service announcements. The result was an increase in registrations for organ donations in the state along with national and international recognition. Robelot received a George Foster Peabody Award because of her efforts.\\"Peabody Award for 'Paul's Gift': Jane Robelot DeCarvalho '82\\". Clemson World. Summer/ Fall 2010. p. 29.

He also played for the Yorkshire Second XI in 1938. A slow left arm orthodox bowler, his career was stymied by the presence of Hedley Verity in the Yorkshire side, and he found himself behind in the pecking order even when Verity was away on Test duties. After two matches, against Gloucestershire in 1936 and Nottinghamshire in 1938, in which he was given little opportunity to bowl, he did have his day in a remarkable final appearance against Leicestershire in 1939. After not bowling in the first innings at Aylestone Road, Leicester, he took 5 wickets for 16 runs in 11.2 overs, to bowl the home team out for 103 and win the game for Yorkshire. He took two wickets with his last two balls in first-class cricket. Despite a first-class bowling average of 5.40, the onset of World War II ended any chance of him gaining further appearances. He was less successful as a right- handed tail end batsman, scoring five runs in three innings, although two of these were not out. He also took one catch. A useful opening batsman in League cricket, he never played again for Yorkshire, but he spent years as a professional with Clackmannan C.C., in Scotland, and was with David Brown Tractors C.C. at Meltham when they won the Yorkshire Council Championship in 1960. He was also their groundsman. Johnson was also a professional footballer with Doncaster Rovers F.C. and Southport F.C. He was born in South Kirkby in Yorkshire and latterly lived at Netherthong near Holmfirth.

It came less than three months after Minh's junta had themselves come to power in a bloody coup against then President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. The coup was bloodless and took less than a few hours‚Äîafter power had been seized Minh's aide and bodyguard, Major Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nhung was arrested and summarily executed. Distrusted by his colleagues because of his tendency to change sides and his reputation as an intriguer, Kh√°nh was assigned to I Corps in the far north of the country after Di·ªám's overthrow to keep him away from the capital Saigon. Kh√°nh, who had played a minor role in Di·ªám's overthrow, joined forces with Generals Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu, who felt they deserved better posts in the junta, and Colonels Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi and ƒê·ªó M·∫≠u, the latter being the director of military security under Di·ªám and an effective strategist. During the three months of his rule, Minh, his civilian Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°, and his leading military colleagues, Generals Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n and L√™ VƒÉn Kim, attempted to defeat the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) non-militarily. They felt that a battleground victory was impractical or impossible and pursued a strategy of trying to politically integrate the insurgents into the mainstream. This meant an intensification of rural non-military initiatives and a reduction in armed operations. This brought them into conflict with the United States, who had plans to start bombing North Vietnam. At the same time, in January 1964, the French government of President Charles de Gaulle proposed the neutralization of Vietnam and the withdrawal of American forces. Kh√°nh and his fellow plotters exploited this to spread rumors that Minh's junta was about to make a deal with Hanoi and then gained the support of the US, most notably through the chief of military forces in Vietnam, General Paul Harkins, who supported Di·ªám and opposed Minh's November coup. Before dawn on January 30, the coup forces caught the junta completely off-guard and seized power without a fight. Kh√°nh grudgingly decided to keep Minh as a figurehead chief of state while maintaining real power in his hands as Minh was popular within the army and the Americans wanted a show of unity to be maintained. Kh√°nh also tried to consolidate his standing in the military by promoting a group of younger officers, and increasing the pay of the enlisted men. In the meantime, the other key generals in the junta, Don, Kim, ƒê√≠nh and Xu√¢n were put under house arrest, accused by Kh√°nh of attempting to negotiate a peace deal with North Vietnam. However, when they were brought to a military trial presided over by Kh√°nh, the junta leader did not provide any evidence and convicted them of \\"lax morality\\". Kh√°nh then allowed them back to meaningless desk jobs, but the show trial brought him much embarrassment. Kh√°nh later admitted that there was no basis to the charges of neutralism against the four generals, and after a tumultuous year in power, Kh√°nh was himself deposed in February 1965 and forced into exile.  Background  alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. Kh√°nh had long been regarded as an ambitious and unscrupulous officer. Following the partition of Vietnam, Kh√°nh, a French-trained officer who served in the French-backed Vietnamese National Army during the First Indochina War, had rallied to support Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, who became the first president of the anti-communist South Vietnam (Republic of Vietnam). He rose to become the deputy chief of staff in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), but his record of political loyalty was called into question. In 1960, during an attempted coup by rebel paratroopers, Kh√°nh jumped over the walls of the Independence Palace and joined Di·ªám during the siege, trying to negotiate an end to the stand-off with the rebels.Moyar, pp. 108‚Äì114. Kh√°nh parleyed with the rebels long enough for loyal forces to arrive from the outside the capital to suppress the uprising, but his critics contended that he was waiting to see which side would gain the upper hand and was not committed to Di·ªám.Karnow, pp. 351‚Äì352.Shaplen, p. 229. In any case, Di·ªám then promoted him to be the commander of II Corps.Kahin, p. 196. In his younger days, Kh√°nh had joined the Vi·ªát Minh but then defected to the French colonial army after a year. Kh√°nh claimed that he had left the Viet Minh because of its communist inclinations, but critics claimed that he was simply switching sides because the French-backed State of Vietnam offered him more opportunities for advancement.Karnow, pp. 354‚Äì355.Shaplen, p. 228. Kh√°nh participated in the 1963 South Vietnamese coup that deposed Di·ªám, playing a minor role, although he claimed to be a key player. Kh√°nh expected a large reward, but the junta instead sidelined him, excluding him from the twelve-man Military Revolutionary Council. In mid-December he was moved from the II Corps in the Central Highlands to the command of the I Corps based around Hu·∫ø and Da Nang in the far north of the Republic of Vietnam. This, it was speculated, was to keep him far away from Saigon in an attempt to stop him from involving himself in politics.Shaplen, p. 230. This was contrary to Kh√°nh's request for a transfer to the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta close to Saigon, where most of the fighting was taking place. In an interview with journalist Robert Shaplen, Kh√°nh made no attempt to hide his annoyance at not being given a more important job. With respect to the 1963 coup that overthrew and killed Di·ªám, he cryptically commented \\"It is too soon yet to tell the whole story, but someday I will tell it to you\\". The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also reported that Kh√°nh was motivated by a suspicion that Minh's junta knew he was untrustworthy and was going to give him an overseas government post to sideline him completely. = Harkins and his support for Kh√°nh = Luckily for Kh√°nh, although his colleagues did not like or trust him, the Americans, civilian and military regarded him highly.Blair, p. 107. Most notable among his supporters was the US commander, General Paul Harkins,Kahin, p. 195. who regarded Minh and his colleagues as \\"political generals\\" and thought poorly of them, in contrast to Kh√°nh, who he regarded as a serious soldier. Harkins prepared quarters for Kh√°nh next to his own when the Vietnamese officer visited the capital.Blair, p. 108. Harkins also mistakenly believed that Kh√°nh was happy to have been posted to I Corps and content to focus on military matters rather than politics, unaware of Kh√°nh's anger at being sidelined from Saigon.Blair, p. 109. The US commander thought that Kh√°nh had done an effective job in I Corps, restoring it to normality after the upheavals of Di·ªám's final months in power. Like Kh√°nh, Harkins was not on good terms with the junta. With respect to the overthrow of Di·ªám, Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and elements in the US State Department were in favor of regime change, while the US military leadership supported Di·ªám's retention. It was well known to Minh and his close supporters that Harkins had strongly opposed the coup and tried to stop it. As a result, they distrusted him as a \\"symbol of the old order\\" and did not \\"look for advice\\" from Pentagon officials. Lacking influence on the new government, Harkins fell significantly behind Lodge as the leading American in Saigon. According to Kahin, the two were never close and \\"if prior to the ouster of Di·ªám they appeared to be estranged team members, thereafter they hardly seemed to be on the same team.\\"Kahin, p. 194. In a report to US President Lyndon Baines Johnson in December 1963, McNamara claimed that \\"The Country Team is the second major weakness [after the Minh government]. It lacks leadership and is not working to a common plan...Above all Lodge has virtually no official contact with Harkins. Lodge sends in reports with major military implications without showing them to Harkins.\\" Harkins resented his decreasing relevance, especially as his term in Vietnam would be over in six months anyway, so he decided to try to regain influence lost to Lodge by altering the shape of the Saigon regime. The split between Harkins and Lodge was also kept unresolved by domestic political imperatives in Washington. The Defense Department would not drop their support for Harkins, so he was not recalled early. Although Johnson said of Lodge \\"He ain't worth a damn. He can't work with anybody. He won't let anybody else work\\", the president chose not to try to force any changes due to the upcoming US Presidential election. Lodge was the front-runner for the Republican nomination at the time, and Johnson wanted to keep him in Saigon rather than having the ambassador in the US campaigning against him and the Democratic Party.Moyar, p. 293. Aside from Harkins, General Maxwell Taylor, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was also known to regard Kh√°nh as the nation's foremost general, while Undersecretary of State George Ball told Lodge that \\"Our [the State Department's] impression is that Kh√°nh is one of the best of the generals, both courageous and sophisticated.\\" Kh√°nh was known for his pro- American views, and Lodge's aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Kh√°nh was not only a fluent speaker of English, but \\"he spoke American; American Army in fact.\\" On one occasion Kh√°nh had told American officials that South Vietnam \\"must rely on American support\\". At the time, the South Vietnamese government was plagued by infighting. A civilian government and cabinet led by Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆° was appointed by the MRC to ease some of the workload on non-military matters. However, the presence of Generals Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn ƒê√¥n and T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralyzed the governance process. ƒê√≠nh and ƒê√¥n were subordinate to Th∆° in the cabinet, but as members of the MRC they were superior to him. Whenever Th∆° gave an order in the civilian hierarchy with which they disagreed, they would go into the MRC and give a counter-order.Jones, p. 437. The junta was paralyzed because all twelve generals in the MRC had equal power. Each member of the MRC had the power of veto, enabling them to stonewall policy decisions.Shaplen, p. 221. The press strongly attacked Th∆°, accusing his government of being \\"tools\\" of the MRC. The media further derided Th∆° for the personal benefits that he gained as a landlord from the Di·ªám administration's token land reform policy.Shaplen, p. 223. On January 1, 1964, a Council of Notables comprising sixty leading citizens met for the first time. Its job was to advise the military and civilian wings of the government with a view towards reforming human rights, the constitution and the legal system. The council, which consisted almost entirely of professionals and academic leaders, soon became engaged in endless debate and never achieved its initial task of drafting a new constitution.Shaplen, p. 225. = Ineffective junta rule = The provisional government lacked direction in policy and planning, resulting in it quickly losing control.Shaplen, p. 213. Minh was criticized for being lethargic and uninterested in running the country.Shaplen, pp. 221‚Äì224. The number of rural attacks instigated by the Viet Cong surged in the wake of Di·ªám's deposal, partly due to the displacement of troops into urban areas for the coup. The increasingly free discussion generated from the surfacing of new and accurate data following the coup revealed that the military situation was far worse than what was reported by Di·ªám. The incidence of Viet Cong attacks continued to increase as it had done during 1963, the weapons loss ratio worsened and the rate of Viet Cong defections fell. The units that participated in the coup were returned to the field to guard against a possible major communist offensive in the countryside. The falsification and inflation of military statistics by Di·ªám's officials had led to miscalculations, which manifested themselves in military setbacks after Di·ªám's death. Kh√°nh claimed that \\"After the November coup, there was much relaxation, wining and dining, and little prosecution of the war effort.\\"Moyar, p. 294. Kh√°nh claimed that he had built up intelligence infrastructure to weed out the Viet Cong under Di·ªám's rule, but that the other generals had disbanded it and released communist prisoners. At the same time, Th∆° was also becoming unpopular in the military establishment. One of the goals of the coup plots at the time was to remove Tho and the prime minister's unpopularity helped to distract some of the incumbent officers from the fact that they were the primary target‚Äîat the time, the MRC was moving towards removing Tho, and Minh was the only senior general to still have confidence in him. A more important reason for the incumbent generals' lack of preparedness for Kh√°nh's coup was their misunderstanding of the US stance. After what had happened to Di·ªám, as well as other failed coup attempts, they regarded American backing as the decisive factor for the survival of any government and the success of any coup. As a result, repeated assurances from Lodge and Johnson's laudatory comments in private and public convinced them that they remained on firm ground. Johnson had told Lodge to assure Minh in a meeting on January 1, 1964, that he had \\"the complete support of the United States as the leader of Vietnam [emphasis in the original]\\".Kahin, p. 197. = The junta's policy conflicts with the US = Aside from non-military problems facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should be the focus of efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam.Kahin, pp. 182‚Äì186. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Di·ªám and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Di·ªám's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Di·ªám and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ng√¥ brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao ƒê√†i and H√≤a H·∫£o religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Di·ªám sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Di·ªám period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.Kahin, p. 183.Kahin, p. 182. Minh and his closest supporters tended to view regard Hu·ª≥nh T·∫•n Ph√°t, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªç and the other nominal NLF leaders as \\"former bourgeois colleagues\\" and moderate, nationalist non- communists who were uncomfortable with a foreign presence in South Vietnam, and whose political views had remained largely unchanged since their departure for the jungle a few years before. Minh's group thus believed that the NLF could be peacefully reintegrated into mainstream politics. After his overthrow, Tho said that his administration wanted to win over the religious sects and the Cambodian minority in the Mekong Delta who had felt alienated by Di·ªám, as according to him, avowed communists were a weak minority in the NLF. This would then make the communists irrelevant in a free electoral process in a normal peaceful society with a pro-western foreign policy that was not hardline anti-communist. According to Tho, this plan was not a deal with communists or the NLF as his group saw it as a political attempt to coax back non-communist dissidents and isolate those that were communists. Minh and ƒê√¥n also later described similar plans and said that they believed the Americans had become aware of this and grown hostile to them.Kahin, p. 185. At the same time, in accordance with the political strategy, Minh's junta was reluctant to carry out large-scale offensives, which concerned the Americans, particularly Harkins, Taylor and CIA chief John McCone. While Harkins and Taylor had opposed Di·ªám's ouster, the junta's policies also disappointed many supporters of the anti-Di·ªám coup as they saw regime change as necessary to their hopes of a more aggressive anti-communist war. For their part, Minh's leadership group believed that a more low-key military approach was needed for their political campaign against the insurgency.Kahin, p. 186. During the latter part of Di·ªám's rule, a centerpiece of the rural pacification campaign was the large- scale construction of strategic hamlets, whereby villagers were compelled to move into fortified camps in an attempt to lock out insurgents. However this failed as many were able to infiltrate the settlements, whereas a previous implementation of such principles in Malaya had been successful as the local communists were ethnic Chinese who were physically distinguishable from the anti-communist ethnic majority. It also angered the peasants, who were forced to abandon their ancestral lands and homes, and build new dwellings in the new villages. Many of these hamlets were subsequently overrun in communist attacks, something many villagers found to their liking.Karnow, pp. 272‚Äì276.Tang, pp. 45‚Äì50.Langguth, pp. 168‚Äì170.Jacobs, pp. 125‚Äì130. General L√™ VƒÉn Kim oversaw the future of the program for Minh and it was decided to liberalize the system to try to win over the peasants. They forecast that they could reduce the insurgency's support by 30% alone through these less restrictive arrangements, citing more cooperative attitudes in Mekong Delta regions heavily populated with H√≤a H·∫£o and Cao ƒê√†i. However this upset and aroused suspicions among the Americans.Kahin, p. 187. Minh's administration also opposed a proposed increase to US military and civilian advisers into district and village level, maintaining that this would give the impression of colonialism and that a low-key approach was more advisable and would not provoke resentment. This caused great concern among the Americans.Kahin, p. 189. In December McNamara and McCone visited Vietnam and wrote a very pessimistic report to Washington expressing concern at the effectiveness of the current policies in Saigon with respect to military gains and rural consolidation, and whether it would lead to a communist takeover.Kahin, p. 193. ƒê√¥n said that under orders from Harkins, the US officers attached to the four corps commanders had been vigorously trying to convince them of the need to bomb North Vietnam, and by implication, the need to have a coup due to the incumbent government's refusal to allow a bombing campaign. ƒê√¥n claimed that such lobbying was influential in convincing some officers to join the coup.Kahin, pp. 192‚Äì195. Most notably the Saigon junta opposed US proposals to escalate the war with a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam, as advocated by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. This plan called for the use of American resources badged as South Vietnamese. This was objected to on the grounds that it would lose moral capital for Saigon as they promoted their cause as just and compatible with the physical safety of fellow Vietnamese, as well as fears that it would provoke a communist land invasion from the north.Kahin, p. 188. The Americans became increasingly worried about the growing chasm in the outlook towards the war, and on advice from his advisers, Johnson described neutralism as \\"another name for a Communist takeover\\" in a New Year's message to Minh. As Minh remained adamant about these policies, Roger Hilsman and Lodge, the main proponents of removing Di·ªám, began to lose confidence in the junta, joining the military establishment, who had opposed the coup against Di·ªám in the first place. In a January 21 meeting between Harkins, Lodge, Minh, Kim and Tho, the Americans mooted a plan to bomb North Vietnam and were explicitly rebuffed by Minh, who thought that such actions would result in escalation and be counterproductive, possibly inducing a Chinese land incursion akin to what had happened during the Korean War.Blair, pp. 106‚Äì107. The Australian historian Anne E. Blair identified this meeting as sealing Minh's political \\"death warrant\\" because when Lodge reported the meeting to Washington, the leading generals in the US military lobbied McNamara claiming that it was no longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the US should simply take control of anti- communist military policy. There was also growing concern that the calls by Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia for the neutralization of his own country, and his attempts to convene an international conference on the matter, would increase such sentiment in Vietnam, something that was oft-repeated in the American media.Kahin, pp. 190‚Äì191. Minh publicly opposed Sihanouk's ideas and similar plans mooted by French President Charles de Gaulle, but discussion of the concepts continued to grow.Kahin, p. 192.  First moves  About a month before Minh's junta was overthrown, Kh√°nh was approached by one of the principal tacticians in the removal of Di·ªám, General ƒê·ªó M·∫≠u. A colonel at the time of the previous coup, M·∫≠u had been head of military security under Di·ªám. Although he did not explicitly command troops, M·∫≠u had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of most of the senior ARVN officers and their strengths and weaknesses. This had allowed him to help engineer the previous coup. The MRC respected M·∫≠u, but their fears about his shrewdness led them to place him in the relatively powerless post of Minister of Information. M·∫≠u's closest aides were posted further away from any real power in an attempt to fragment his networks of influence. M·∫≠u began to search for officers to replace the junta, searching for exiles in Cambodia and France as well as those who had returned to Vietnam after the overthrow of Di·ªám. The most important link in M·∫≠u's plan was Colonel Nguy·ªÖn Ch√°nh Thi, the former paratroop commander who had fled to Cambodia in the wake of the failed 1960 coup attempt against Di·ªám. M·∫≠u persuaded the junta to install Thi as Kh√°nh's deputy in I Corps. He tricked the junta into doing so by reasoning that as Kh√°nh had largely been responsible for putting down the 1960 revolt, Thi would be an ideal mechanism for keeping Kh√°nh in check, claiming that the two would be implacably opposed to one another. Privately, M·∫≠u predicted that Thi would be a bridge between him in Saigon and Kh√°nh in Hu·∫ø. He was correct in thinking that the 1960 conflict would be irrelevant in the shifting of allegiances over time and that the pair would work together for their current aims of advancement. M·∫≠u recruited a second figure in the form of General Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Khi√™m, who was one of Kh√°nh's fellow cadets and had worked with M·∫≠u during the November coup. Khi√™m had assisted Di·ªám in putting down the 1960 plot and had since been demoted from being Chief of Staff of the ARVN to the commander of the III Corps that surrounded Saigon. Khi√™m readily joined the plot and controlled the 5th and 7th Divisions of the ARVN, which were based in Bi√™n H√≤a and M·ªπ Tho north and south of Saigon respectively.Shaplen, p. 231. This brought the two division commanders subordinate to Khi√™m into the plot, as long as they would obey his orders. Khi√™m, Kh√°nh and M·∫≠u kept in touch surreptitiously on a regular basis, supplementing their forces with an assortment of Marine, Air Force and Special Forces officers. Another was General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn ƒê·ª©c, who had recently returned from exile in Paris and was an assistant to Kim, the chief of the junta's general staff.Shaplen, pp. 231‚Äì232. During this time, the plotters received encouragement from Harkins through their American advisers, something seen as crucial to the plot's increasing momentum. Among the notable recruits were several officers who had been prominent Di·ªám loyalists and were then cashiered or demoted soon after Minh's junta took charge. Others loyal to Di·ªám then became fearful that they would soon be removed too. Minh's junta proceeded slowly and gradually, hoping to avoid pre-emptive coups by officers fearing a demotion or sacking. However, their public drive against military corruption deeply worried Di·ªám loyalists who had bad reputations. A CIA report on December 7, 1963, concluded that \\"however desirable and perhaps even necessary\\" such a \\"threatened purge of corrupt elements from the ranks of the military establishment from a long term point of view...in the short term\\" it could be anticipated to cause a \\"disruptive effect on the solidarity of the military establishment.\\" Among those who did join the coup was the chief of the Civil Guard, Duong Ngoc Lam, a Di·ªám loyalist who had recently been promoted from colonel to brigadier general. He was under investigation by the junta for swindling military funds and was readily converted. alt=Three Asian men with black hair standing from left to right.

A third man on the right has his back to the camera and is wearing a cowboy hat. All are wearing military fatigues. During Minh's brief rule, several changes were made to military units in the capital that played into the hands of Kh√°nh's group. Following the removal of Di·ªám, the protection for incumbent rulers in Saigon also decreased. The Presidential Guard that Di·ªám used to protect Gia Long Palace against coups was dissolved and sent into the countryside, as were units of the ARVN Rangers, which had been kept in the capital for the same purpose. A significant boost to the plotter's scheme came on January 5, when Dinh relinquished command of the III Corps to Khi√™m following persistent pressure by the US military establishment that he needed to fully concentrate on his work as interior minister. Khi√™m took over and was now in accord with the subordinate 5th and 7th Division commanders Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu and L√¢m VƒÉn Ph√°t, both of whom played a large part in the coup forces. Dinh later reflected that his replacement by Khi√™m was \\"a prelude to the coup\\" while ƒê√¥n said that it gave Khi√™m a concrete base from which to organize a putsch.Kahin, pp. 195‚Äì196. Khi√™m had long been disgruntled with his position in the post-Di·ªám regime, as was Thieu, and had been planning a coup of his own. As the coup plot began to solidify, Kh√°nh came to the fore of the group. It has been concluded by some analysts that Khi√™m‚Äîwho went on to be Kh√°nh's second in command in terms of real power after the coup was successful‚Äîwas more pre-eminent during the early phases of the planning, but that as a Catholic who had been rapidly promoted by Di·ªám after changing religion, he \\"did not dare to carry out a coup d'√©tat himself out of fear that the Buddhists would react strongly against him and accuse him of trying to reestablish the Ng√¥ Regime.\\" Another factor seen as vital in bringing Kh√°nh to the forefront of the coup group was the fact that the US military leadership deemed Kh√°nh more capable than Khi√™m and equally likely to work in accordance with US interests. Kh√°nh was highly regarded by Harkins, who thought of him as \\"the strongest of all corps commanders.\\" According to a CIA assessment, Kh√°nh had been \\"consistently favorable to U.S. programs and advice\\". = Rumor campaign = In late December and early January, student demonstrations in South Vietnam were held against neutralism and French President Charles de Gaulle, who advocated the removal of the Americans and negotiations between the two Vietnams. The Council of Notables had accused the provisional government and junta of having an uncertain stance on the issue and went as far as to recommend that South Vietnam suspend diplomatic relations with France. The rumors and crisis heightened when a reputed French agent, Lieutenant Colonel Tran Dinh Lan suddenly returned to Saigon after several years in France. He had served in both the French and Vietnamese National Army and had brought with him several million US dollars worth of South Vietnamese piasters. Lan moved into the home of one of Kim's top aides, fuelling speculation that French agents were being systematically brought into the capital. Such rumors served to spread the belief that a French-sponsored neutralist deal was imminent and gave the conspirators an opportunity to act.Shaplen, p. 232. Duc had years of experience in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might be thinking and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for M·∫≠u. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and ƒê√¥n had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were brought to the attention of some senior American officials. Kh√°nh held a number of meetings with American officers in Hu·∫ø during the first two weeks of January. In addition to routine military matters, coup discussions were also reported to have taken place. Kh√°nh also regularly flew down to Saigon to take part in plotting with his colleagues. These usually took place in the secluded house of a colonel who was a nearby province chief. Meetings were also held at Kh√°nh's headquarters in Hu·∫ø. Kh√°nh began growing a small goatee, which he customarily grew when he was attempting a new project and would only shave once the job had been completed.Langguth, p. 278. During this time, Kh√°nh spread rumors in the capital that the French were behind a plan to install a pro-communist government that would implement de Gaulle's plans for the neutralization of Vietnam.Logevall, p. 161. Helping Kh√°nh in a concerted smear campaign were Khi√™m and Thieu. The French Foreign Office had announced that Paris would establish diplomatic relations with Peking on January 28, and Kh√°nh used this as an opportunity to play on American anti- neutralist sentiment. De Gaulle's attempt to cultivate relations with communist China was tied to his policy of calling on US troops to leave Vietnam. Kh√°nh told various American officials that ƒê√¥n, Kim and General Mai H·ªØu Xu√¢n, along with Minh, were \\"pro-French and pro-neutralist\\" and part of de Gaulle's plan. Kh√°nh claimed that the fact that ƒê√¥n had invited two members of the French National Assembly‚Äîboth from de Gaulle's party‚Äîto dinner. According to one source, Kim and Minh were also present, while another says that Kim, ƒê√≠nh and Xu√¢n were there.Logevall, p. 162. Kh√°nh alleged at the time that the generals discussed neutralization there, while ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh always denied it. Another incident that occurred publicly was a January trip by ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh to Thailand's capital Bangkok for a military event was a press conference at which ƒê√¥n did not rule out de Gaulle's plan if it applied to both Vietnams equally. The Bangkok and dinner incidents were believed to have been part of the basis for a report by Giovanni D'Orlandi, the Italian Ambassador in Saigon, passed on by Lodge to Washington on January 20. It alleged that ƒê√¥n and ƒê√≠nh were potential leaders of a group that might go along with de Gaulle's neutralization plan. At the time, Lodge said that his office had no solid evidence that either of the pair was contemplating neutralization, but just after the coup, he cabled Washington to say he was rethinking his position. He said that ƒê√¥n and Kim retained their French citizenship and \\"had never at any time foresworn the possibility of a neutral solution at what might seem to them the proper time.\\"Blair, p. 113. He said that although he thought their policies against the communists were effective, \\"none of us had ever discussed what the next step would be after the Government of Vietnam had reached a position of strength. Perhaps they did favor the French neutrality solution at that time.\\" On the other hand, Undersecretary of State W. Averell Harriman had been told by staffers that the claims were merely a smokescreen disseminated by Kh√°nh and his followers to gain support for a power grab. Lodge's personal staff had also failed to find evidence substantiating Kh√°nh's charges. Lodge had put embassy employee Frederick Flott in charge of American- French liaison in South Vietnam. Flott found nothing to support the claims of a linkage between de Gaulle's proposal and Minh's junta and reported that many French contacts had bemoaned their lack of success in rallying Minh's administration to de Gaulle's proposal.  Final preparations  On January 28, Kh√°nh flew from Hu·∫ø to Saigon dressed in civilian clothes on a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating that he had come for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in the day with a message from the other plotters that Kh√°nh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after.Kahin, p. 198. What Kh√°nh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.Kahin, p. 199. Through Wilson, Kh√°nh told Lodge that he possessed documents proving that ƒê√¥n, Kim and Xu√¢n were about to stage a coup and neutralize South Vietnam. He asserted that their planning involved talks with France. Kh√°nh claimed that pre-emption was needed because if the plot was not stopped immediately crushed, it was a realistic chance of success as a \\"neutralist platform might strike [a] responsive chord among junior officers.\\" Wilson then phoned Kh√°nh at 15:00 to confirm that Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) and the embassy did not object, using a predetermined codeword to convey the endorsement to Kh√°nh. It was later revealed that Harkins had reported in a cable that Wilson had seen him around 15:00 on behalf of Kh√°nh to determine whether Washington would support a \\"counter-coup\\" against those who \\"planned to seize control and immediately announce a position of neutralization\\". Harkins stated that he ordered Wilson to report to Lodge. Harkins then reported that he was undertaking \\"a field trip\\", believed to be an attempt to lobby Saigon-based forces to join the coup. Harkins was later reported to have said in response to Kh√°nh's asking whether he objected to a coup, \\"No, I think you are a very fine general.\\" Afterwards, when asked why he had not tipped off the junta, Harkins said that the ruling officers \\"weren't getting along anyway, so maybe it was a change for the better. I thought it was.\\" Kh√°nh flew into Saigon after Wilson's confirmation, and stayed at the house of a friend and waited for the coup, which was scheduled the coup for 04:00 January 30.Karnow, p. 352. According to the plan, Khi√™m's forces in Saigon would surround the homes of the sleeping junta members while Kh√°nh and a paratrooper unit would occupy the Joint General Staff headquarters near Tan Son Nhut Air Base. Thi followed Kh√°nh to the capital on the same day, and the plotters met in obscure places around town. At this time, there was one major obstacle, the armored units in the capital and its outskirts. The plotters needed help from Colonel D∆∞∆°ng Hi·∫øu Nghƒ©a, one of the leading ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát officers and temporary head of the Capital Armored Command, who was key to the coup's success. A friend and appointee of Minh, Nghia caused difficulties by failing to respond to Thi·ªáu's order that all armor be moved north out of Saigon to Thi·ªáu's 5th Division headquarters at Bi√™n H√≤a, a satellite city on the northeastern edge of the capital. A CIA cable reported that Nghia was aware that the movements were part of a coup against Minh and told Thieu that he would not deploy out of the capital and declared his support for Minh. This caught the plotters off guard, and as Harkins left on his \\"fieldtrip\\" at the same time, Kahin conjectured that he had actually gone to lobby Nghia to support the coup or at least partially back it by agreeing to help depose Minh's confidants ƒê√¥n, ƒê√≠nh, Kim and Xu√¢n. However, it was then reported that Nghia had agreed to support Thieu, who had apparently then gained the control of both the armored and marine elements in Saigon. He also gained the cooperation of Lieutenant Colonel L√Ω T√≤ng B√°, the commander of the 6th Armored Squadron and Brigadier General L√¢m VƒÉn Ph√°t, the Catholic and Di·ªám-loyalist commander of the 7th Division, which along with the Thieu's 5th Division was part of Khi√™m's III Corps.Kahin, p. 491. Harkins returned from his expedition on the same day and met Lodge, who told him of Kh√°nh's more recent meeting with Wilson. Less than two hours before the coup took place, in the middle of the night, Lodge told Harkins of the time that the coup would begin and the location of the coup command post.  Coup  On the night of January 29, M·∫≠u and Khi√™m alerted the rebel troops to assume their positions around Saigon. These included many of those used in the first coup: armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions, two airborne battalions and one Marine battalion and an assortment of Special Forces, Ranger and Civil Guard units. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 02:00. Lodge was kept fully informed throughout the night.Shaplen, p. 233. As the time approached, Kh√°nh donned his paratrooper uniform and headed to the military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, where he saw that the compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khi√™m, he found that his co- conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Kh√°nh had taken over the government without a shot being fired. Kh√°nh used the coup to enact retribution against Minh's leading generals. Kh√°nh had Kim, ƒê√¥n, ƒê√≠nh and Xu√¢n arrested, claiming that they were part of a neutralist plot with the French. Kh√°nh noted that they had served in the Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, under the French colonial administration, although he did as well. Lan was also arrested as a suspected French agent.Shaplen, p. 234. The junta members were caught totally unaware. Minh, ƒê√¥n and Kim woke up to find hostile forces surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers. Tho was apprehended during the coup and put under house arrest while the plotters consolidated their grip on power; he was then removed from the political scene. General Nguyen Van Vy, who had returned from France after Di·ªám's deposal to serve as Deputy Chief of Staff for training, was put under house arrest before being released within a day of the coup's success. Colonel Nghia showed his mixed feelings about the junta with the selective use of his armored troops. They supported Kh√°nh's move against ƒê√≠nh, ƒê√¥n, Kim and Xu√¢n, but tried to protect Minh by using tanks to shield Minh's house from Lam's Civil Guard units, which were also used to arrest the four other leading junta members. Although Minh was taken away, this was claimed to be a protective measure to shield him from some of Kh√°nh's more hawkish supporters, and he was never formally arrested and taken into detention. Throughout the morning the deposed officers were taken one by one to JGS headquarters by the plotters. The generals were then flown to My Khe beach, near Da Nang. Wilson accompanied Kh√°nh and reported the coup's progress to Lodge roughly twice an hour.Kahin, pp. 199‚Äì200. The US ambassador then relayed the information promptly to Washington. For 90 minutes up until 06:00, Wilson reported that matters were on track. During the early stages of the coup, the Airborne Brigade command post was used as the headquarters of the rebels, before they set up at JGS headquarters after matters were stabilized. At 06:10 Khi√™m arrived at the Airborne Brigade command post to join Kh√°nh and 35 minutes later the IV Corps commander, General Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu C√≥ came to join the coup.Kahin, p. 200. Paratroopers and infantry cut off the roads into the city to prevent any would-be loyalist units from storming into the capital, but no such attempt was made. In total, 3,000 troops from eight battalions were involved in the coup and tanks were brought in from M·ªπ Tho to the south. General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Chu√¢n was invited to the coup headquarters by Khi√™m after the takeover was complete. He recalled that there were 15‚Äì20 Vietnamese officers present along with Kh√°nh and Khi√™m, and that many had been placed on leave without pay or removed after Di·ªám's overthrow. Chuan said that Kh√°nh chaired a meeting, and claimed that Minh's government was \\"neutralist, pro-Communist and pro-French\\", and incompetent. He said that the plotters \\"didn't know what to call the coup d'√©tat to make it sound all right; it was only a while later that they thought of the term 'rectification'\\". Wilson was present at the meeting and telephoned Harkins \\"every five minutes\\", and Kh√°nh left the meeting early and left Khi√™m in charge, saying that he had to meet Harkins. During the meeting, Thieu and M·∫≠u turned up by 08:40 and the atmosphere of the meeting was likened to a triumphant election campaign function on vote-counting night. Before leaving and telling the others he was meeting Harkins, Kh√°nh had announced to the officers in the room that he would be heavily dependent on US advice and support. Chuan said that the obvious characteristic of the plotters assembled at the JGS headquarters was \\"the heavy involvement of the Harkins group...this action was not being carried out independently...[but] was directed by foreigners.\\" He concluded that Minh had been overthrown by the Americans for opposing their plan to expand the war and the US military presence.Kahin, p. 201. Bui Di·ªám, the future South Vietnamese Ambassador to the US, reflected years later that many people knew of the coup and the lack of action on the part of American officials was a sure indication of encouragement for Kh√°nh.Blair, p. 111. During the pre-dawn coup and throughout the day, there was little reaction by the public who went about their daily life as though nothing had happened. Many appeared unaware that a coup had occurred while they were still sleeping. There was no disruption to road traffic or the media, and although flights were halted in the morning, they resumed in the afternoon. There were plans to enact a curfew but this was abandoned.  Reaction and aftermath  alt=Middle-aged Caucasian man with a long face and small mustache in a half-profile, half-portrait pose, with his arms folded over his chest. He has a very prominent nose and is wearing a ceremonial military uniform with a tie, suit and a cylindrical military hat. Kh√°nh had told CIA officer alt=Clean-shaven Caucasian man wearing a suit and tie. He is glancing to the side and has his wavy hair combed back. US officials in Washington were surprised by the coup. Although Kh√°nh had already told CIA officer Lucien Conein‚Äîwho helped to plan the coup against Di·ªám‚Äîin December 1963 that he intended to overthrow Minh, the report was filed away among the many rumors that were received by American representatives. Following the coup, Kh√°nh was promoted by the Americans‚Äîin both the media and government‚Äîas South Vietnam's new hope. Kh√°nh was generally portrayed in the American media‚Äîwhich was widely supportive of the change in Saigon's leadership‚Äîas a \\"strong man\\". Kh√°nh presented himself as a robust and aggressive officer and was shown in photographs wearing his paratrooper's uniform. The newspapers had been strongly critical of Minh and went along with Kh√°nh's claim that he would \\"fight Communism to the final victory\\" and that the change was a turning point for the better. Kh√°nh had a meeting with Lodge in the morning of the coup for around an hour after arranging a meeting through Wilson.Blair, p. 114. Due to concerns as to whether Washington would express support for the coup and what the official policy was, the meeting was not held at the embassy but at the home of Lodge's aide Dunn. However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Kh√°nh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Kh√°nh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy. Lodge also reported that Kh√°nh wanted to give the impression that he seriously thought that neutralist deal involving de Gaulle was a genuine and ominous prospect, and that de Gaulle had made much progress in influencing the previous administration. In the immediate aftermath of the coup, Lodge claimed that the US had \\"nothing to do with the operation\\" and would not speculate on how the coup might affect policy in Washington. Blair said that \\"Lodge's role in the coup...[was] largely a passive one. He gave no \\"green light\\" to the conspirators, nor did he liaise with them.\\" After Kh√°nh's seizure of power, Vietnamese military officers referred to the leadership change as \\"Harkins's Revenge\\" or \\"The Pentagon's Coup\\". All the main Vietnamese figures from both sides, including Kh√°nh himself, Minh, ƒê√¥n, ƒê√≠nh and Tho all agreed in later years that the US was heavily and decisively involved and that a coup would have otherwise been impossible. In his first radio broadcast upon seizing power, which did not occur until 16:00, Kh√°nh assailed the former regime for its performance during its three months at the top. He said \\"The political, economic, and social situation in the countryside still offers no promising prospect. There has not been one single compensation worthy of the sacrifices accepted daily by the soldiers.\\" He alluded to a neutralist plot, claiming that \\"some persons\\" had joined \\"with the colonialists standing for neutralism in order to pave the way for the Communists to enslave us\\". Kh√°nh's broadcast was signed by 17 generals and 32 other senior officers. Many observers were immediately sceptical of the claims of neutralism and regarded personal ambition as the motivating factor all along. An anonymous source close to the plotters told The New York Times that \\"We were anxious about them indeed...and we had conclusive proof that they had been talking with the French in terms of a neutralized Vietnam and that North Vietnam had given support to the plan\\", explicitly naming Kim and Xu√¢n. It was not clear whether the Department of State or Lodge was enthusiastic about the political change in Saigon at the time, but if they were not, they were handed a fait accompli. A CIA report from Saigon soon after the seizure of power told the State Department that \\"It is safe to say that Kh√°nh's group will be essentially pro-American, anti- communist and anti-neutralist in general orientation.\\" As far as Harkins was concerned, with US policy committed to maintaining leadership in the hands of senior military officers, there were no other apparent options; he told General Taylor, \\"One thing is for sure with this coup. We've gone through all the eligible general officers.\\" For his part, Lodge chose not to warn the junta, to which the embassy had pledged their support, as to the imminent plot, despite being well aware of it.Kahin, p. 202. He said in a cable a few days after the coup that \\"General Kh√°nh's coup was extremely disconcerting at first blush\\", but that the lack of public reaction to the overthrow of Minh indicated that Kh√°nh's actions were not something to be alarmed about. He wrote that the progress of history was often made in many phases by different individuals or groups, using the analogy that in an American political party, the people who manage the primary campaigns are different from those who run the national elections, while the officer-holders are entirely separate. Lodge speculated that while Minh and his generals were successful in removing Di·ªám‚Äîsomething Lodge strongly encouraged‚Äîthey may not be the ideal administrators of a nation themselves. With respect to the prospects of defeating the communists, he said \\"Our side knows how to do it; we have the means with which to do it; we simply need to do it. This requires a tough and ruthless commander. Perhaps Kh√°nh is it.\\" Blair said that Lodge's habit of looking for American parallels to Vietnamese situations hindered his judgment, pointing out that Kh√°nh's rule merely saw more instability and chaos. At the end of February, Lodge was still positive and cabled Washington to say that \\"I continue to be favorably impressed by him. He is really very much more able than the Minh, Don, Kim group and, of course, he is so far above Di·ªám and Nhu that there is no comparison.\\" The State Department appeared to not be well- informed about the action, as Ball cabled Lodge a few hours after the coup started: \\"We have so little info on motivations and other factors involved in current crisis that we leave to your judgment how to handle. Meantime we trust you will make very clear that we had nothing to do with coup. If you consider it advisable and possible there would seem to us to be merit in preserving Minh as head of Government since he appears to have best potentialities for rallying support of people.\\" The Pentagon had opposed the removal of Di·ªám and opposed his successors, while the State Department supported such a move, and Kh√°nh later reflected: \\"Maybe in the coup of January 30, 1964, the U.S. Army had come to conclude that it too should have the capacity to bring about a coup.\\" The Johnson administration turned out to be very happy with the changed in power as it viewed Kh√°nh as being more amenable to its policy. Upon instructions from the US Embassy, Saigon's Foreign Ministry drafted a text for a media conference where the coup was described merely as a \\"change in the Chairmanship and composition of the Military Revolutionary Council\\".Kahin, p. 203. Washington promptly promised support for the new regime even before Kh√°nh had formed a government. At the same time, despite the fact that many senior members of Minh's junta were in custody, the Americans said that no change in power had occurred and that a fresh diplomatic recognition was not needed. Lodge claimed that Kh√°nh's actions were merely a leadership change at the top of the MRC. Having told his colleagues the same at the coup headquarters, Kh√°nh told Lodge at the embassy that he would be relying upon him for political advice. On January 31, he explicitly requested the ambassador's judgment for what type of government he should form and for suggestions for leadership roles. Rusk suggested that Kh√°nh should occupy the head of state as well as the chairmanship of the MRC, and on February 2, Johnson sent him a personal and supportive handwritten note, having been reported to be uneasy at first.Blair, p. 116. However, Johnson also sent McNamara to Saigon to warn the officers that continued power struggles could make the US Congress hostile to further requests for funding. According to Blair, Johnson had no \\"inside knowledge of its preparation and mechanics\\".Blair, p. 115. She concluded that Johnson had nothing to do with the coup and had no foreknowledge of it. According to Blair, \\"Kh√°nh could play Lodge like a musical instrument\\" in justifying his coup. The day after coming to power, Kh√°nh further claimed to Lodge that ƒê√¥n was in possession of briefing papers from the Americans on plans for the bombing of North Vietnam and said that they were in danger of being handed over to the communists. Kh√°nh further claimed to be desperately trying to retrieving the documents to prevent the communists from accessing the material. Blair cited Lodge's immediate response‚Äîhe took Kh√°nh seriously and sent an urgent cable to Washington through the top-secret CIA channel‚Äîas an example of gullibility with respect to Kh√°nh's tendency to make grandiose and self-serving claims. Lodge was also greatly reassured by Kh√°nh's assurances to support US bombing of North Vietnam, increased actions against the Viet Cong and an increase in US advisers down to village level. Lodge also told Kh√°nh that military progress was the bottom line as far as continued US support for his leadership was concerned. According to Blair, \\"For Lodge, when something was done, it was done, and he cleared his mind of all but the cover- story\\". She said that Lodge was not interested in getting detailed information on the coup, only that \\"the best information was that the coup was planned and carried out by General Thieu\\".Blair, p. 117.  Kh√°nh's consolidation of power  Kh√°nh swiftly attempted to cement his grip on power by announcing himself as the new head of state and as Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council in place of Minh. Kh√°nh had tried to convince Minh to stay on as a powerless head of state, and a standoff developed on the day of the coup before Kh√°nh concluded that Minh would refuse to serve. Minh was taken to military headquarters, and after refusing for several hours to cooperate, was taken under armed guard to his home for lunch. He continued to defy Kh√°nh throughout the afternoon, calling for his fellow generals to be released. Minh had not been implicated in the alleged French neutralist plot and he remained silent throughout the day. A week later, Kh√°nh managed to persuade Minh to remain as a figurehead head of state. This was partly due to American pressure, reasoning that the popular Minh would be a unifying and stabilizing factor in the new regime and that his cooperation would provide continuity. According to Kahin, it was \\"a means of symbolizing to the outside world a political unity and continuity that actually did not exist\\". Kh√°nh characterized Minh's real lack of power to the Americans in private as being \\"exactly like the King of England\\", but on a \\"provisional basis\\". Kh√°nh would have preferred to see Minh completely away from any public position along with his colleagues in Da Lat. For his part, Minh resented that he had been deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the detention of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Kh√°nh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot for as long as he could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Kh√°nh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat. Kh√°nh tried to ease hostile sentiment among the enlisted men in the South Vietnamese military towards the deposal of the popular Minh by raising the wages of privates and corporals by 20%, with the approval and funding of the US. He also tried to increase his support base among the senior officers several young colonels to the rank of \\"aspirant brigadier general\\".Kahin, p. 204. Recipients of the promotions were the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy Chung T·∫•n Cang, Republic of Vietnam Air Force commander Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, Airborne Brigade commander Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n, who was captured and almost executed by the deposed generals for refusing to turn against Di·ªám during the November 1963 coup,Moyar, p. 267.Hung and Schecter, p. 79. and Thi. T√¥n Th·∫•t X·ª©ng was promoted to brigadier general and made the commander of the Regional Forces. = Appointment of cabinet = Kh√°nh soon came to dominate the MRC. He turned out to be far more politically astute and motivated than the previous junta, seeking out veteran Vietnamese politicians and technocrats to create a new government. A week after taking power, Kh√°nh summoned Dr. Nguy·ªÖn T√¥n Ho√†, a Catholic who was one of the former leaders of the southern branch of the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát Qu·ªëc d√¢n ƒë·∫£ng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam). Hoan had been exiled in Paris during the Di·ªám era, but remained active, publishing a magazine and keeping up to speed with developments in Vietnam. Hoan had generated little popular following during his campaign for power in the 1940s and 1950s and was unable to form a government as prime minister when he returned. Kh√°nh thereupon decided to act as both Prime Minister and Chairman of the reorganized MRC, which he expanded to include 17 generals and 32 further officers for a total of 50 members. Hoan was appointed as the first Deputy Prime Minister in charge of rural pacification. He was given control of five ministries including the Interior, National Defense and Rural Affairs and two special commissions, which were primarily engaged in consolidating the strategic hamlets of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu into the renamed New Rural Life Hamlets. The second Deputy Prime Minister was Harvard University-trained banker and economist Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n O√°nh, who was associated to the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. Oanh was charged with managing the finance and economy of the country. M·∫≠u was the Third Deputy Prime Minister, overseeing social and cultural affairs.Shaplen, pp. 236‚Äì237.Karnow, p. 355. Other ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát politicians given cabinet posts included Phan Huy Qu√°t as foreign minister and Ha Thuc Ky as interior minister. However, the second most powerful member of the new regime was Khi√™m, who was defense minister, and Kh√°nh firmly controlled the civilian government through the junta, which he rearranged to give greater weight to his fellow coup-plotters. Kh√°nh selected a cabinet of thirteen ministers and two Secretaries of State at ministerial level, and chose new provincial and district chiefs. He originally tried to include members of a variety of political and religious groups including representatives of the Cao ƒê√†i and H√≤a H·∫£o sects, who still had remnants of their private armies intact after their defeat by Di·ªám in 1955. Although Kh√°nh insisted that he had no party affiliation, the orientation of his government was toward the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, who held many of the key posts in the government. This provoked bitterness from other anti-communist nationalists and groups that were banned under Di·ªám and were seeking a greater role in public life, as well as from a younger generation who felt that the established nationalist parties were responsible for dividing the people.Shaplen, p. 237. Kh√°nh promised that the village elections abolished under Di·ªám would be held as soon as feasible and that a new National Assembly would be elected within a year. He started by abolishing the Council of Notables. Many Vietnamese and American observers considered this rash and premature, as promises of elections been frequently broken and that the council had at least been an effective forum for dissent, giving the semblance of democracy in the absence of parliamentary representation.Shaplen, pp. 238‚Äì239.  Trial  Kh√°nh presided over the trial, which took place on May 28 after prodding by the Americans for him to give his opponents a hearing. Minh was accused of misusing a small amount of money, before being allowed to serve as an advisor on the trial panel. The generals were secretly interrogated for five and a half hours, mostly about details of their coup against Di·ªám, rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in the plot against Di·ªám, this did not reveal any information new to them. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Kh√°nh stated, \\"We ask that once you begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody\\".Langguth, pp. 289‚Äì291. The tribunal then \\"congratulated\\" the generals, but found that they were of \\"lax morality\\" and unqualified to command due to a \\"lack of a clear political concept\\". They were chastised for being \\"inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility\\" and of letting \\"their subordinates take advantage of their positions\\". Kh√°nh also assailed ƒê√≠nh, claiming that he had derogatorily compared Kh√°nh to Gamal Abdel Nasser in a meeting with Di·ªám. The four imprisoned generals were allowed to remain in Da Lat under surveillance with their families. However, there were reports that the trial ended in a festive manner akin to a party, as the officers shook hands and made up with one another. All four generals were barred from commanding troops for a period; Kim was banned for six years, and ƒê√¥n 18 months. Offices were prepared for the quartet so that they could participate in \\"research and planning\\". Worried that the group of idle officers would plot against him, Kh√°nh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the United States for military study, but this fell through.Shaplen, pp. 244‚Äì245. The trial was held behind closed doors and the public was not informed of the results nor that legal proceedings had occurred until a few days later. Despite the outcome, when the matter was made public, it was accompanied with a warning from Kh√°nh against neutralism. The public press release stated that Kh√°nh's junta had taken a lenient approach to enhance \\"the spirit of unity and the traditional comradeship in arms of the armed forces.\\" Some civilians in Kh√°nh's cabinet were caught off-guard by the secret hearing and one spoke out, saying \\"Letting them go like this removes the apparent justification for the whole Government's existence\\". The junta statement did not specifically charge anyone of neutralism but said that repetition of such activities could result in discharges from the military, implying that neutralist moves had occurred in the past. It warned of \\"infliction of all the punishments reserved for military personnel who have committed the crime of treason against the people in the struggled against the Communists and neutralists.\\" Kh√°nh's actions left divisions among the officers of the ARVN who became dissatisfied with him. When Kh√°nh was himself deposed in 1965, he handed over dossiers proving that the four generals were innocent;Langguth, p. 347. the original documents that Kh√°nh claimed proved his accusations of neutralism were neither presented to nor found by anyone. Robert Shaplen said that \\"the case...continued to be one of Kh√°nh's biggest embarrassments\\". Nevertheless, despite what the South Vietnamese public may have thought of him, Kh√°nh enjoyed continuing confidence among the Americans until the latter part of 1964.Kahin, pp. 200‚Äì225.

He has been called \\"the most militant-minded republican you could possibly meet\\" by historian Dr Shane Kenna. Early life and nationalism Carey was the son of Francis Carey, a bricklayer, who came from Celbridge to Dublin, where his son was born in James Street in 1845. James also became a bricklayer, and for 18 years continued in the employment of Michael Meade, builder, of Dublin; he then started business on his own account as a builder in that city, at Denzille Street. In this venture he was successful; he became the leading spokesman of his trade, and obtained several large building contracts. During all this period Carey was engaged in an Irish nationalist conspiracy, but to outward appearance he was one of the rising men of Dublin. He was involved in religious and other societies, and at one time was spoken of as a possible lord mayor. In 1882 he was elected a town councillor. In about 1861 he had joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), and soon afterward became its treasurer. He broke with the IRB in 1881, forming a new group which assumed the title of the Invincibles, and established their headquarters in Dublin. Carey took an oath as one of the leaders. The object of the Invincibles was to remove all \\"tyrants\\" from the country, and several attempts, but without success, were made to assassinate Earl Cowper and W. E. Forster.  Phoenix Park Murders and aftermath  No. 1, the secret head of the association, then gave orders to kill Thomas Henry Burke, the under-secretary to the Lord- lieutenant. On 6 May 1882, nine of the conspirators proceeded to the Phoenix Park, where Carey, while sitting on a jaunting-car, pointed out Burke to the others, who at once attacked and killed him with knives, and at the same time also killed Lord Frederick Cavendish, the newly appointed Chief Secretary, who happened to be walking with Burke. For eight months no clue could be found to the perpetrators of the act; but on 13 January 1883, Carey was arrested and, with 16 other people, charged with a conspiracy to murder public officials. When arrested he was erecting a mortuary chapel in the South Dublin Union, and the work was then carried on by his brother Peter Carey. On 13 February, Carey turned queen's evidence and betrayed the complete details of the Invincibles and of the killers in the Phoenix Park. His evidence ‚Äì together with that of another informer, getaway driver Michael KavanaghThe Argus, Melbourne, 13 March 1883, p. 5, \\"THE PHOENIX-PARK MURDER. CONFESSION OF THE CAR-DRIVER\\" ‚Äì resulted in the execution by hanging of five of his associates. With his life in great danger, he was secretly, with his wife and family, put on board the Kinfauns Castle, bound for the Cape, and sailed on 6 July under the name of Power. On board the same ship was Patrick O'Donnell, a bricklayer. He became friendly with Carey, without knowing who he was. After stopping off in Cape Town, he was informed by chance of the real identity of Carey. He continued with Carey on board the Melrose for the voyage from Cape Town to Natal, and when the vessel was 12 miles off Cape Vaccas, on 29 July 1883, using a pistol he had in his luggage, shot Carey dead. O'Donnell was brought to England and tried for murder, was found guilty, and was executed at Newgate Prison on 17 December 1883. Personal life He married Margaret (Maggie) McKenny, by whom he had several children.

The synchronism, first propounded by V. Kanakasabhai Pillai in 1904 in his The Tamils Eighteen Hundred Years ago, was adopted by some scholars of the time to date Tamil literature. Kamil Zvelebil, even while acknowledging the fragility of the synchronism, called it the \\"sheet anchor\\" of the dating of Tamil literature. The synchronism however, involves numerous conjectures and has been dismissed by Gananath Obeyesekere in his The Cult of the Goddess Pattini (1984) as ahistorical and invalid. The 'synchronism' From a mention in the Silappatikaram, the Sinhalese king of Lanka, Gajabahu is taken to be a contemporary of the Chera king Senguttuvan. The genuineness of Gajabahu synchronism as an instrument to date early Tamil literature is accepted by most scholars today. Dating of Senguttuvan In the Silappatikaram, there is reference to a certain Kayavaku, the king of Sri Lanka. He is said to have attended the coronation of the Chera king Senguttuvan. The 30th Canto, 160, in translation, reads - > The monarch of the world circumambulated the shrine thrice and stood there > proferring his respects. In front of him the Arya kings released from > prison, kings removed from central jail, the Kongu ruler of Kudagu, the king > of Malva and Kayavaku, the king of sea-girt Ceylon, prayed reverently to the > deity thus... Kayavaku here, despite some disagreement has been conjectured to mean Gajabahu.P. T. S. Iyengar in his \\"History of the Tamils\\"(p335) advances the theory that Kayavaku ought to be read as Kaval The Silappatikaram, therefore is read to imply that, Gajabahu was a contemporary of the Chera king Senguttuvan, the protagonist of the epic. Sri Lankan history, however records the reign of two Gajabahus. According to the Mahavamsa, Gajabahu I reigned between 113 - 134 CE, while Gajabahu II reigned in the 12th century CE. Kanakasabhai's reasoning for not considering Gajabahu II as the king mentioned is as follows: > In the long list of kings of Sri Lanka preserved in Singhalese chronicles, > the name Gajabahu occurs only twice. Gajabahu I lived in the early part of > the second century A.D. and Gajabahu II in the twelfth century. If the > latter was king referred to in the Cilappathikaram, Karikala Chola, the > grandfather of the Gajabahu contemporary, Imaya Varamban should have lived > in the eleventh or twelfth century A.D. But in many Tamil poems and > inscriptions on copper plates recording the grants of Chola kings who lived > in the tenth and the eleventh centuries, Karikala Chola I is described as > one of the earliest and most remote ancestors of the Chola kings then > reigning. It is evident therefore that the Gajabahu referred to in the > Cilappathikaram could not be Gajabahu II, but must have been Gajabahu I, who > was king of Ceylon from about A.D. 113 to A.D. 125.V. Kanakasabhai, pp 6 - > 7. This, in turn, has been used to imply that the Chera king kuttuvan, who, according to the Pathirruppaththu ruled for 55 years may be dated to c. 110 - 165 CE. This computation, which was first proposed by V Kanakasabhai Pillai in his book, The Tamils 1800 years ago (1904), has come to be known as the Gajabahu synchronism.V. Kanakasabhai, The Tamils Eighteen Hundred Years Ago, Asian Educational Services, pp 6 - 9. Kanakasabhai also mentions another reference from Silappatikaram which has the Chera king meet the Magadha king Nurruvan Kannar who is interpreted to as Satakarni, which was a common among the Satavahana and Andhra dynasties as an additional proof for the synchronism.V. Kanakasabhai, pp 7. Scholars Tieken and Swamy criticize this synchronism as of circular logic.Tieken, Herman Joseph Hugo. 2001. Kavya in South India: old Tamil Cankam poetry.

One of his wives died from diabetes.\\"IDI AMIN\\" at YouTube Olita died about 11:00 AM on June 1, 2014 at his rural home in Pap Oriang‚Äô in South East Alego of the Siaya District at the age of 70 after succumbing to high blood pressure. He had reportedly returned home on the day before from Nairobi, where he had been living after the funeral of his mother. According to his brother, Matthews Ogola, Olita was suffering from arthritis, diabetes and high blood pressure at the time of his death. Despite his stardom from Rise and Fall of Idi Amin, Olita died a poor man. According to Sipross Odero, a relative of Olita, his body was removed to Bama Private Hospital mortuary. A funeral committee has been set up in his home village chaired by the South Alego Ward representative Joshua Osuri. Along with his aforementioned living relatives, Olita is survived by one wife, by the name of Alice Atieno, and several children including daughter Risper Odero, and grandchildren.

It is funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) as a business resource efficiency activity (BREW).  Description  A Quality Protocol sets out criteria for the production of a product from a specific waste type. Compliance with these criteria is considered sufficient to ensure that the fully recovered product may be used without harm to human health or the environment and therefore without the need for waste management controls. In addition, the Quality Protocol indicates how compliance may be demonstrated and points to best practice for the use of the fully recovered product. The Quality Protocol further aims to provide increased market confidence in the quality of products made from waste and so encourage greater recovery and recycling. The purpose of the Quality Protocol is to provide a uniform control process for producers, from which they can reasonably state and demonstrate that their product has been fully recovered and is no longer a waste. It also provides purchasers with a quality-managed product to common aggregate standards, which increases confidence in performance. Also, the framework created by the Protocol provides a clear audit trail for those responsible for ensuring compliance with Waste Management Legislation. The Quality Protocol, www.aggregain.org.uk, retrieved 16.04.07 Work on producing protocols for eight other waste streams should be issued for public consultation in Summer 2007.

Non SAP-systems can use IDocs as the standard interface (computing) for data transfer. IDoc is similar to XML in purpose, but differs in syntax. Both serve the purpose of data exchange and automation in computer systems, but the IDoc-Technology takes a different approach. While XML allows having some metadata about the document itself, an IDoc is obliged to have information at its header like its creator, creation time etc. While XML has a tag-like tree structure containing data and meta-data, IDocs use a table with the data and meta-data. IDocs also have a session that explains all the processes which the document passed or will pass, allowing one to debug and trace the status of the document. Different IDoc types are available to handle different types of messages. For example, the IDoc format ORDERS01 may be used for both purchase orders and order confirmations. IDoc technology offers many tools for automation, monitoring and error handling. For example, if the IDocs are customised that way on a particular server, then a user of SAP R/3 system creates a purchase order; this is automatically sent via an IDoc and a sales order is immediately created on the vendor's system. When this order cannot be created because of an application error (for example: The price per piece is lower than allowed for this material), then the administrator on the vendor's system sees this IDoc among the erroneous ones and can solve the situation. If the error is in the master data at the vendor's system, he can correct them and order the IDoc to be processed again. Because of the flexibility and transparency of IDoc technology, some non-SAP technologies use them as well.  Structure of the IDoc An IDoc consists of * Control record (it contains the type of IDoc, port of the partner, release of SAP R/3 which produced the IDoc etc.) * Data records of different types. The number and type of segments is mostly fixed for each IDoc type, but there is some flexibility (for example an SD order can have any number of items). * Status records containing messages like 'IDoc created', 'The recipient exists', 'IDoc was successfully passed to the port', 'Could not book the invoice because..' The IDoc itself is a structured Text-File, that means IDocs can be used on all platforms, there is no need to translate binary data. Each record is identified by the name of the record. The load (data) is stored in a 1000 byte long container. Use transaction WE60 in a SAP-System to get documentation for IDocs, like HTML files and C-header files.

NAST  NAST is a technique in SAP-Systems to create messages. Messages can be printed, sent or transferred into IDocs. SAP uses this for many applications e.g. Purchase Orders (PO ). The PO can create a message which might be printed, sent by FAX, or translated into an IDoc of type ORDERS. The IDoc ORDERS can be forwarded in an B2B-process to a vendor.  Error Handling SAP provides a standard report (WE02) or (WE05) to display and edit IDocs. Unfortunately, the provided functionality is very basic; therefore, most customers are forced to create their own custom solution..

It was founded early in the 12th century. Initially it was the central house of the Congregation of Savigny, who were Benedictines; by 1150 it was Cistercian. Savigny Abbey  History  It was situated on the confines of Normandy and Brittany. The founder was Vital de Mortain, Canon of the Collegiate Church of St. Evroul, who, resigning his prebend to embrace an eremitical life under Robert of Arbrissel in the forest of Craon (Anjou), and leaving the latter, retired to the forest of Savigny (1105), where he built a hermitage. Soon, however, the number of disciples who gathered around him necessitated the construction of adequate buildings, in which was instituted the monastic life, following the Rule of St. Benedict, and interpreted in a manner similar to the Cistercians.Obrecht, Edmond. \\"Abbey of Savigny.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 31 Jan. 2015 Rudolph, lord of Fougeres, confirmed to the monastery (1112) the grants he had formerly made to Vital, and from then dates the foundation of the monastery. Its growth was rapid, and Vital and Saint Aymon were canonized. It had 33 subordinate houses, within thirty years. In 1119 Pope Celestine II, then in Angers, took it under his immediate protection, and strongly commended it to the neighbouring nobles. Under Geoffroy, successor to Vital, Henry I of England established and generously endowed 29 monasteries of this Congregation in his dominions. Bernard of Clairvaux also held them in high esteem, and it was at his request that their monks, in the times of the antipope Anacletus, declared in favour of Pope Innocent II. Serlon, third successor of the Founder, found it difficult to retain his jurisdiction over the English monasteries, who wished to make themselves independent, and so determined to affiliate the entire Congregation to Citeaux, which was effected at the General Chapter of 1147. In the mid-16th century the Abbey was pillaged and partly burned by Calvinists, and records of the following year mention but twenty-four monks remaining. It continued to exist until the Revolution reduced it to a heap of ruins, and scattered its then existing members. The church was restored in 1869. The church, a model of Cistercian architecture, was restored in 1869. The abbey was listed as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture in 1924, Ancienne abbaye and now serves for parish purposes.

Named after Emma Bonino, a leading Radical who had been European Commissioner in 1995‚Äì1999 (appointed by Silvio Berlusconi), after the unsuccessful \\"Emma for President\\" campaign, the list was the successor of the Pannella List, active from 1992 to 1999. History In the 1999 European Parliament election the Bonino List, thanks to its standard-bearer's popularity and a massive use of commercials, won a surprisingly high 8.5% of the vote and 7 MEPs (Emma Bonino, Marco Pannella, Benedetto Della Vedova, Marco Cappato, Olivier Dupuis, Maurizio Turco and Gianfranco Dell'Alba), thus becoming the fourth largest party in the country by European representation. The MEPs co-founded the short-lived Technical Group of Independents. The list, which gathered the support of disgruntled voters, women and young people, did particularly well in Northern Italy (13.2% in Piedmont, 13.0% in Friuli- Venezia Giulia, 11.9% in Veneto, 11.6% in Lombardy, 10.8% in Liguria), where its proposed libertarian policies were very popular, especially among disappointed Lega Nord's supporters, while it did fairly worse in the conservative and statist South (below 4% in Basilicata, Calabria and Sicily). The list failed to join any electoral major political coalition both for the 2000 regional elections (in which Radical regional councillors were elected in Piedmont and Lombardy) and especially for 2001 general election. The Radicals thus returned to their traditional share of vote at around 2%. This is what happened also in the 2004 European Parliament election, when only Bonino and Pannella were re-elected and were founding members of the ALDE Group. In 2001 the Radicals re-organised themselves as a party for the first time since 1989, when the late Radical Party was transformed into the Transnational Radical Party. The \\"Bonino List\\" banner was used for the last time in 2004 and the next year the Radicals decided to join the centre-left The Union coalition, by joining forces with the Italian Democratic Socialists in 2006 general election (through the Rose in the Fist), and directly the newly-formed Democratic Party in 2008.

He excelled as an amateur, winning fifty straight bouts and taking Metropolitan, New York State, National AAU, and both National and International titles. At the end of 1924, Tex Rickard, Dempsey's manager, rated Terris second behind only champion Benny Leonard. A world ranked lightweight from February 1925 until November 1929, his highest ranking was # 1. On February 6, 1925, he lost to Sammy Mandell in an elimination bout for the World Lightweight Championship. Early life Terris was born one of five children on September 27, 1904 on Clinton Street in the lower East Side of Manhattan to Fred and Gussie Terris. His father died when he was only eight, leaving his single mother to bring up the large family. An early coach, Dan Caplin recognized his skilled footwork, and had Terris learning to box by age thirteen. Boxing as an amateur, Terris was a prodigy from an early age, winning fifty bouts in a row, and accumulating titles that included the Metropolitan Amateur, New York State Amateur, and both National and International Amateur titles. Early boxing career Terris turned pro in 1922 at the age of eighteen, winning eighteen of nineteen fights that year. Author Ken Blady noted that Terris's greatest strength, his early speed and constant footwork in the ring, could also be a detriment against more skilled opponents, as it exhausted him and made him less a threat near the end of his fights. In his first years as a pro, and not yet nineteen, Terris beat exceptional boxer Eddie \\"Kid\\" Wagner in a ten-round points decision at the Henderson Bowl in Brooklyn on June 3, 1924 after a previous six round loss. Terris had a few exceptional wins by knockout as a young pro. He was the first boxer to get a full count from Andy Chaney winning in a third-round knockout at the Henderson Bowl in Brooklyn on May 23, 1924, as well as winning with a seventh-round knockout of Johnny Lisse on January 21, 1924 at the Lenox Athletic Club in New York. Chaney, in over 130 fights, had never been knocked out. Impressively, Terris fought Sammy Mandell, 1926-30 Lightweight Boxing Champion, to a ten-round draw at Madison Square Garden on December 17, 1923. One source noted that Terris's greatest bout in 1924, was a decisive win against French born Jewish boxing great Benny Valgar, in a ten- round decision at the Nostrand Athletic Club in Brooklyn.Blady, Ken, The Jewish Boxers' Hall of Fame, (1988). Shapolsky Publishers, Inc, New York, , Pgs. 164-168. Boxing peak and mid-career Sammy Mandell World Lightweight Champion July, 1926-July 1930 Boxing author Ken Blady believes Terris's best year as a boxer was 1925, when he lost only one of his eighteen major bouts. Unfortunately the loss was in a sanctioned twelve round World Lightweight elimination contest with future reigning Lightweight champion Sammy Mandell on February 6, 1925 in Madison Square Garden. This exceptional bout drew 13,000 fans. It was, in many ways a very close contest. Terris knocked Mandell to the mat for a nine count in the third round with a strong blow. Mandell, however, evaded Terris for the remaining rounds, and with greater energy and speed, somehow won the bout on points by unanimous decision.Blady, Ken, The Jewish Boxers' Hall of Fame, (1988). Shapolsky Publishers, Inc, New York, , Pgs. 164-168. Johnny Dundee, 1924 Jr. Light and Featherweight Champ His wins over Jimmy Goodrich in January and Pal Moran in March 1925, helped keep him highly rated in his division. From 1925 to 1927, Terris had an exceptional run and defeated boxing greats Jack Bernstein and Johnny Dundee twice each. Dundee was formerly both Jr. Lightweight and Featherweight World Champion. Bernstein held the Jr. Lightweight championship as late as June 20, 1924. Terris won every round in his victory over Dundee on May 4, 1925 in Madison Square Garden. His July 10, 1925 victory over Ace Hudkins was also impressive, showing an exceptional defense.Blady, Ken, The Jewish Boxers' Hall of Fame, (1988). Shapolsky Publishers, Inc, New York, , Pgs. 164-168.Johnny Dundee Temporary boxing retirement and slow decline Perhaps because Terris went into temporary retirement in 1926 for eight months, his chances at a second title shot began to slowly diminish. Taking up boxing again in 1927, he beat Billy Wallace, and followed with victories over Babe Herman, boxing great Ruby Goldstein, and Phil McGraw. For some reason, his managers were unable to again secure a Lightweight Title shot. At only 23 in early 1928, Terris was the victim of knockouts from the great Jimmy McLarnin, Ray Miller, and on January 28, 1929 from Babe Herman, speeding the end of his career. According to boxing writer Bert Sugar, even in his devastating first round loss to McLarnin on February 24, 1928 in Madison Square Garden, Terris was still getting in jabs and \\"boxing beautifully\\" shortly before being knocked to the canvas for the count.Blady, Ken, The Jewish Boxers' Hall of Fame, (1988). Shapolsky Publishers, Inc, New York, , Pgs. 164-168.Cited in Sugar, Bert, The 1930s: Send in the Clown-Plus a Trio of Good Little Men, Ring Magazine, (May, 1983), New York, Pg. 75. Terris, defeated Phil McGraw on August 24, 1927, showing incredible pluck. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune, wrote \\"Sid Terris, New York contender for the lightweight championship won a decision from Phil McGraw of Detroit in their ten round contest at Ebbets Field, Brooklyn, tonight.\\" He somehow performed this feat after \\"a sensational first round in which he was knocked down three times, once for the count of nine.\\"\\"Sid Terris Given Decision After Disastrous Round\\", Herald-Tribune, pg. 3, Sarasota, Florida, 25 August 1927. As early as 1928, the Milwaukee Journal, wrote that \\"It begins to look as though Sid Terris, once regarded as the uncrowned Lightweight Champion of the World, has reached the end of his fistic string.\\" The article lamented his one-round knockout from Ray Miller of Chicago on July 6, 1928 in Coney Island. But more tellingly, the article went on to note, \\"the Ghetto Ghost (Terris) was one of the fastest and cleverest lightweights. He fought the best there was in the division and lost few decisions.\\" The article also noted that in Terris's only lightweight title fight that \\"Mandell eked out a hairline decision at a great 15 round match at New York.\\" It also noted Terris's stunning amateur record of winning \\"fifty straight bouts.\\"\\"Sid Terris is All Through\\", Milwaukee Journal, pg. 10, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 7 July 1928. Retirement from boxing and later life Terris continued to fight after his devastating first round loss to Jimmy McLarnin on February 24, 1928 at Madison Square Garden, but the quality of his competition faded, as did the size of his audience. He lost as many as half of his contests from 1928 through his last bout with Johnny Gaito on May 7, 1931 in Columbus Hall in Yonkers.Blady, Ken, The Jewish Boxers' Hall of Fame, (1988). Shapolsky Publishers, Inc, New York, , Pgs. 164-168. In retirement in 1931, Terris worked many years as a matre d' at Stampler's Restaurant in Manhattan. He retired to Miami Beach with his family and died on December 30, 1974.Blady, Ken, The Jewish Boxers' Hall of Fame, (1988). Shapolsky Publishers, Inc, New York, , Pgs. 164-168.

The ground floor of a two-storey building on the main shopping street of the town is divided into a shop, now a gift shop and the entrance for visitors, and the printer's office. This has a connecting door to the shop as well as its own door to the street which leads to a counter for serving customers. A large desk at the office window has the clutter typical of the early twentieth century, drawers contain stationery including writing slates, pencils, sealing wax, pen nibs and bottles of ink. Wall shelves store job dockets, invoices, wages books and ledgers dating back to the start of the business. Framed photographs show how little the office has changed since 1900, and a certificate shows the authority to issue tickets for steamships to America. =Paper store and caseroom= The caseroom A door leads out the back to the paper store, a large room now housing an archive of nearly every printed job for a century. At one end the undershot water wheel which originally powered the works has been reconstructed. A composing stick on top of a lower letter case of movable type (image is not of the museum) Stairs lead up to the caseroom, a large rooflet room for typesetting with racks around the perimeter of drawer-like letter cases. The racks are up to a worktop height, with the pairs of cases in use by the compositors on top so that the case of minuscule (lower-case) letters is at a shallow angle, and the case of majuscule (capital or upper-case) letters stands above and behind it at a steep angle leaning against the wall. The letters are cast metal sorts, and visitors are shown by the compositor how to set this movable type by hand into a metal composing stick. He then binds the type forme set by each visitor in a galley, and (time permitting) prints these using a hand-operated printing press to make a galley proof of each for the visitor. The room also has many galleys which were made up and set aside for possible future use, including the last job set by Cowan Smail, \\"Closing Down Sale from Today\\". =Machineroom= One end of the machine room The machineroom is also rooflet, and the printing presses include a hand-fed pedal-operated platen press, a large belt-driven Wharfedale Reliance print machine bought in the 1870s which was originally powered by belt drive from the water wheel, and an automated Heidelberg Platen bought in 1952. A printer demonstrates the operation of these machines to the visitors. Events Robert Smail's Printing Works has printing workshops in the winter, and participates in events such as the Innerleithen Honey Festival at St Ronan's Wells. In September 2007 \\"living history tours\\" were introduced on the occasion of the celebrations of 500 years of printing in Scotland.

It was first broadcast on April 18, 2007. This episode marks the end of the first half of Season 11, which continued on October 3, 2007. The episode is rated TV-MA LV. It parodies various zombie movies, in particular George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead (including its remake), Day of the Dead and Land of the Dead, plus Return of the Living Dead (the homeless repeatedly utter \\"change\\" instead of \\"brains\\"). The episode is also a satire and commentary on how homeless people are often seen as \\"degenerates to society\\". Plot After a buildup of homeless people in South Park, Kyle recommends that they do something about it, and Cartman agrees. Cartman announces that he will jump over them on his skateboard, wearing a cape, insisting that it was Kyle's idea. The town council has also taken notice of the problem, but the Park County's expert on homelessness advises that if no-one gives them anything, they will leave. Kyle feels bad for the homeless, and gives one of them twenty dollars that he was originally saving up for a new Xbox game, but the homeless man just asks Kyle for more money. The number of homeless immediately grows dramatically, and they wander everywhere asking for change in a zombie-like manner. Randy, the Stotches, Jimbo, and Gerald Broflovski wind up stranded on top of the town Community Center, with hordes of homeless below. Gerald tries to make it through the homeless to get to the bus, but gives them all his change, only to realize that he has no money for the bus, to which Randy then proclaims \\"He has become one of them!\\". The boys escape the horde of homeless in the sewers and head for the home of the homeless expert. He informs the boys that homeless people actually live on change, almost like food. He tells them that the nearby town of Evergreen had solved a similar homeless problem, and that they should travel there and find out what they did. Once they leave, homeless people try to get into his home, and he shoots himself in the head to \\"take the easy way out.\\" This fails to work, since he consistently shoots himself nine times in various non-lethal areas of the head and torso (a close parody of the Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson shooting). As the boys travel, more adults escape to the Community Center roof. One of the adults, Glenn, is able to call his wife on his cellphone after getting a signal and discovers that, because of the high numbers of homeless in South Park, the property values have plummeted and his house has been repossessed, thus making him homeless, and Randy immediately points his shotgun at Glenn to make sure he doesn't become one of them. Glenn begins to ask the others for change to put his belongings in storage, and then Randy shoots Glenn's head off with the shotgun because of him behaving like the homeless afterwards. The boys make it to Evergreen, which has been completely devastated. There are only three remaining survivors, who are men dressed in camouflage and heavily armed. They are distrustful of the boys and threaten to shoot them, since, they are not home-owners due to them being minors, and are therefore \\"homeless\\", but they're able to recognize Cartman as \\"the same kid who jumped over thirty homeless people on his skateboard\\", so they decide to help the boys. While talking to the survivors, the men are able to explain that the homeless situation got so out of control that it was hard to tell who was homeless and who wasn't. During the discussion, Kyle finds a pamphlet on the ground, which advertises South Park as a \\"haven for the homeless\\"; He realizes that the Evergreen townspeople got rid of their homeless by convincing them to migrate to South Park, and the men were able to explain that most of the homeless from their town originally came from Texas, in which the city of San Antonio was able to get rid of their homeless population by sending them to Evergreen in the same manner. Just then, a hideously disfigured woman is able to emerge from the burnt remains of one of the buildings while holding a shotgun, revealing to be the wife of one of the men who tried to burn her alive after believing she was homeless, and she became quite angered with him as a result. She then tries to shoot her husband, and all the adults end up shooting and killing each other, with the boys realizing that they must get rid of the homeless because, as Stan reasons, their parents are just as stupid as the people of Evergreen, and South Park would fall apart just like Evergreen did. However, Kyle is able to come up with a plan to save their town, so the boys heavily reinforce a bus that they find and drive it to the Community Center in South Park, where the homeless have gathered below the adults. They advertise California as \\"super cool to the homeless\\" by singing a modified version of 2Pac and Dr. Dre's \\"California Love,\\" and leads them there. Afterwards, Cartman shows off by jumping his skateboard over three homeless people, and the episode ends with Stan saying to Kyle \\"Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.\\" Production Writing on the episode's basic story and jokes began at the show's writer's retreat at Hyatt Grand Champions Resort conference center, in Indian Wells, California during the break between seasons 10 and 11. The song at the end of the episode includes the lyrics, \\"In the city of Venice, right by Matt's house, you can chill if you're homeless.\\" According to the DVD commentary, Matt Stone does live in Venice and there are a lot of homeless people there. Reception The episode was rated 7.5 out of 10.0 on IGN, reviewer Travis Fickett describing the episode as \\"a take-it-or-leave-it episode\\". Fickett suggested that the episode was \\"sustained by mostly non sequitur jokes that work all on their own\\", singling out the multiple suicide attempts of the homeless advisor and Stan's suggestion that Kyle was responsible for suggesting jumping over the homeless. TV Squad's Adam Finley gave a more positive review, rating the episode as 7 out of 7. Finley noted the parody of zombie films and also singled out the running joke of jumping the homeless on a skateboard.

Industrial heritage refers to the physical remains of the history of technology and industry, such as manufacturing and mining sites, as well as power and transportation infrastructure. Another definition expands this scope so that the term also covers places used for social activities related to industry such as housing, museums, education or religious worship, among other structures with values from a variety of fields in order to highlight the interdisciplinary character of industrial heritage. It is also argued that it includes the so-called sociofacts or aspects of social and institutional organizations, and mentifacts that constitute the attitudinal characteristics and value systems industrial heritage sites. The scientific study of industrial remains is called industrial archaeology. The industrial heritage of a region is an aspect of its cultural heritage. It also forms part of a location's identity as it serves as evidence of progress and landmark achievements. The international organization dedicated to the study and preservation of such is The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage, known as TICCIH.

He represented Northumberland West in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Conservative member from 1883 to 1886. He was born near Cobourg in Upper Canada, the son of John Mulholland, an Irish immigrant, and studied at the Commercial College in Oswego, New York. He worked for a merchant in Baltimore for three years and was then given charge of a general store in Roseneath in Northumberland County owned by the same merchant. He also served as postmaster for Rosemeath. In 1857, with Alexander Kennedy, he purchased a general store in the nearby town of Alderville. In 1859, he married Mary Kennedy, his partner's sister. Around 1865, that business was sold and Mulholland moved to Cobourg where he opened a hardware and grocery store with Peter Brown. He also established a dry good business in partnership with William Graham. Mulholland served on the Cobourg town council. He died in February 1917 at Clifton Springs, New York.

In New Zealand they are known as ground wƒìtƒÅ due to their burrowing lifestyle. Hemiandrus wƒìtƒÅ are nocturnal, and reside in these burrows during the day. Ground wƒìtƒÅ seal the entrance of their burrow during the day with a soil plug or door so that their burrow is concealed. This genus was originally said to be distributed in Australia and New Zealand, however, with recent molecular genetic methods, this is under debate. Ground wƒìtƒÅ adults are smaller than other types of wƒìtƒÅ, with the unusual trait of having both long and short ovipositors, depending on the species. The name of this genus is said to come from this trait as hemi- mean half and -andrus means male, as the species where the female has a short ovipositor can sometimes be mistaken for a male. This genus has a diverse diet, depending on the species.  Taxonomy  The genus Hemiandrus was originally described by Kjell Ander in 1938. 10 undescribed species of this genus are said to be in Australia, however molecular analyses show that the two lineages genetically represent two separate lineages, therefore their Australasian distribution is under debate. Hemiandrus is however the most species rich genus of the New Zealand Anostostomatidae. Morphology The genus Hemiandrus has the smallest sized wƒìtƒÅ, in terms of body size, with individuals ranging from 12-45 millimetres, and weighing 1-3 grams. These wƒìtƒÅ have no tympanum, and instead are able to detect sound through their cuticle, which is adaptive for their underground lifestyle. Some species in this genus have unusually short ovipositors for being Orthopterans, the species with this morphological trait exhibit maternal care, which is uncommon as it occurs only in five families within the Orthoptera order. Diet The diet of these wƒìtƒÅ depends on the species, where H. maculifrons is carnivorous, H. maia is omnivorous, eating fruit and invertebrates. Other ground wƒìtƒÅ species however have been shown to be mainly herbivorous, eating apricots and various grass species.

Hemiandrus in New Zealand There are approximately 15 undescribed New Zealand species of this genus, with 18 described species. These species of Hemiandrus are eaten by native species such as the wattle birds, kiwi, but also by introduced species such as mice, stoats, and hedgehogs. Of the described species in this genus, half have a restricted range, but most are common and widespread, and are not thought to be endangered (as per the New Zealand Department of Conservation).

During Operation Defensive Shield in April 2002, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) invaded a Palestinian refugee camp in Jenin. The Israeli military refused to allow journalists and human rights organizations into the camp for \\"safety reasons\\" during the fighting, leading to a rapid cycle of rumors that a massacre had occurred.

Bakri gave voice to the perspective of Palestinians which would not reach the media due to the sealing of the city; as a result he chose not to interview Israeli officials for the film. Human Rights Watch investigations found \\"no evidence to sustain claims of massacres or large- scale extrajudicial executions by the IDF in Jenin refugee camp\\" although they reported that \\"Israeli forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, some amounting prima facie to war crimes\\".Jenin: IDF Military Operations - Summary The accusation of war crimes was repeated by Amnesty International.JOEL GREENBERG. \\"Amnesty Accuses Israeli Forces of War Crimes\\" .

Israel concurs that around 50 Palestinian died, but describes the event as a battle and blames civilian deaths on the close proximity of fighters and civilians. Twenty-three Israeli soldiers died. The film title referenced Palestinian taxi drivers calling \\"Ramallah, Ramallah, Ramallah\\", or \\"Jenin! Jenin!\\" to Palestinian workers and travellers moving through Israeli checkpoints. Bakri dedicated the film to its producer, Iyad Samoudi, who was killed by Israeli soldiers, at al-Yamun in the Jenin Governorate of the West Bank, shortly after filming ended.

The court rejected his request under the statement that regardless of the claim about the connection between the films, there is no legal basis to deny the screening of The Road to Jenin. The Tel Aviv and Jerusalem Cinematheques in Israel showed Bakri's film despite the ban. Bakri took the ban to court and the Supreme Court of Israel overturned the decision. According to Supreme Court Judge Dalia Dorner: \\"The fact that the film includes lies is not enough to justify a ban,\\";Israel court lifts Jenin film ban , BBC News, 11 November 2003. she implied that it is up to viewers to interpret what they see, citing the Maimonides quotation: \\"And with intellect shall distinguish the man, between the truth and the false.\\"Israel Supreme Court 316/03 (quoting Maimonides Guide for the Perplexed: (he: ◊û◊ï◊®◊î ◊†◊ë◊ï◊õ◊ô◊ù), Part 1, Chapter 2) On appeal, the Supreme Court's ruling was stayed, but in August 2004 the Supreme Court reaffirmed the overturning of the ban, stating that the film board does not have \\"a monopoly over truth\\".Israel's court defeats film ban , BBC News, 31 August 2004. Although the Supreme Court described the film as a \\"propagandistic lie,\\" the ruling affirmed that choosing not to show 'both sides' of a story is not grounds for censorship. =Defamation lawsuit= Five Israeli reserve soldiers who served in Jenin filed suit in 2002 against Bakri for defamation arguing that the movie had sullied their good names. The plaintiffs were not mentioned in the film. The judge dismissed the case, ruling that while the film did in fact slander Israeli soldiers, the five Israeli soldiers were not personally slandered and thus had no standing to sue. The judge said in her verdict that Bakri had not shown \\"good faith\\", had brought no witnesses, and had not proved his claim that his charges were backed up by reports from human rights groups.Court: 'Jenin, Jenin' untruthful, but does not slander soldiers , Ofra Edelman, Ha'aretz 30/06/2008 = Public critics = Dr. David Zangen, who was the chief medical officer for the IDF in Jenin during Operation Defensive Shield (Head of Pediatric Endocrinology at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem 'MEDICINE IN PEACE AND WAR/JEWISH AND ISRAELI PERSPECTIVE' with Dr. David Zangen (Google HTML version)) issued a public statement titled Seven Lies About Jenin,Commentary by Dr. David Zangen on lies concerning Jenin giving his personal accounts about his visit to a private premiere screening of the film at the Jerusalem Cinematheque. In his statement, he cited 7 discrepancies he had hoped to raise in front of the viewers who denied him the possibility to get past the second point. He claimed Bakri has 'skillfully made a crude, albeit well-done, manipulation' that it is difficult not to be drawn into the created distorted picture; and that he was amazed that the audience was not willing to hear his own accounts, a person who had 'physically' been there.'Seven Lies About Jenin: David Zangen views the film \\"Jenin, Jenin\\" and is horrified' (Translated from Hebrew: Ma'ariv, 8 November 2002) '\\"I Couldn't Stand the Lies\\"' by Asaf Haim (Translated from Hebrew: Ma'ariv, 22 April 2002) The version distributed in the English language is modified from the original movie, and some of the problematic scenes Zangen pointed out were omitted. =Defense= The Mohammad Bakri Defense Committee argues that \\"the importance of this case reaches beyond Bakri as an individual,\\" amounting to repression of Palestinian self-expression.About Mohammad Bakri's case\\" Mohammad Bakri Defense Committee At a screening of his latest film in New York, a disturbed audience member confronted Bakri with accusations that Jenin, Jenin exaggerated the atrocities of the invasion presented a one-sided view, and Bakri responded that he had \\"seen hundreds of films that deny and ignore what happened to Palestinians, yet never complained or tried to ban any film.\\" The main line of defense for Bakri and his film is that, as the Supreme Court found, choosing not to show 'both sides' of a story is not grounds for censorship. Bakri is being represented by attorney Avigdor Feldman, who told Haaretz, \\"Bakri doesn't say anything in this film. The people who talk are those he filmed. So the residents of the refugee camp say things which sometimes are true and sometimes not. It's a movie. It reflects the subjective understanding of the speakers. Sometimes they say things that are harsher [than they actually were] because that is how he experienced it.\\"Dan Izenberg, \\"Jenin Jenin now in court\\" Jerusalem Post, September 17, 2007 The Mohammad Bakri Defense Committee adds: \\"For his artistic integrity and his focus on the experiences and narratives of his fellow Palestinians, Mohammad Bakri faces the potential of financial ruin in the face of spurious legal charges and dubious claims of defamation.\\" A major component of the argument for the defense in the most recent allegations is that none of the plaintiffs, Ofer Ben-Natan, Doron Keidar, Nir Oshri, Adam Arbiv and Yonatan Van-Kaspel, are mentioned by name or shown in the film.

Based on Formant synthesis, it also has FM synthesis capabilities similar to the DX range. Its editing involves 2,000+ parameters in any one 'performance', prompting the creation of a number of third party freeware programming applications. These applications provide the tools needed to program the synth which were missing when it was in production by Yamaha. The synth was discontinued after two years, probably in part due to its complexity (particularly the formant sequencing), poor front-panel controls, brief manual and limited polyphony. The FS1R synthesizer has an impressive set of new wave forms over the earlier DX line of FM synthesizers, which have since been incorporated into the new Montage line from Yamaha (with the exception of the Formant wave form). These wave forms include Sine, All1, All2, Odd1, Odd2, Res1, Res2, and Formant. The new wave forms are each constructed with a large number of inherent harmonics making FM synthesis far more efficient. Each one of these operator wave forms can replace an entire column of operators in a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer algorithm. Formants are mainly associated with modeling the human voice, but have other uses as well. Formants are present in all instruments that use a resonating body, like the violin, viola, cello, bass viol, bassoon, saxophone, English horn, clarinet, oboe, acoustic guitar, etc. The fixed body of the instrument acts like a set of fixed frequency band pass filters, which is what a formant is. The resonating body instrument was previously very difficult to model using the DX7 family of FM synthesizers, and lacked authentic real instrument patches. FS1R's formant wave form capabilities allows users to access more realistic sounds absent from other models at the time. This capability is largely unknown due to the path synthesizer development has taken, the sample-based synthesizers has bypassed the need for combining formant synthesis with FM. Sample-based synths limit the user to a set of preset instrument patches, the user can't create their own instrument from scratch to create a custom new sound. The FM style of synthesizer has this capability and is drawing a new set of users to the older technology. The new FM-X synth engine in the Yamaha Montage is based on features from the FS1R. Formant sequencing The FS1R uses the \\"formant sequence\\", this being a series (128 or 512) of \\"frames\\" that define the level and frequency of each of up to eight 'voiced' (pitched) and eight 'unvoiced' (un-pitched) formant generators over time. The number of frames limits the typical length of a sequence to a few seconds, though this length and pitch can be varied in real-time with few or no artefacts. Applying a formant sequence to a sound allows a complex, evolving sound to be programmed in a relatively short time. 90 formant sequences were supplied with the FS1R. Yamaha FS1R Front Panel Yamaha FS1R Control Screen Sakura Free FS1R Editor Problems and shortcomings A 4-part synth with 32 voices was viewed as inadequate by 1998's standards [subjective] although the FS1R was designed not as an all-in-one workstation for producing entire songs but as a way to add original, complex tones that could not be produced by other synthesis methods. Software developed by Yamaha to convert samples to formant sequences was well known but never released for general use. Eventually, a programmer (Wouter van Nifterick, see FS1R utilities below) produced a freeware alternative and users could finally access all the unit's power a number of years after its initial release. Since this time additional fseq editors have popped up, but all of them suffer from the same problem as the original Yamaha editor. The sounds they produce are very gravelly and barely resemble the sound of the original sample. Rumours abounded of an 'FS2R' successor, with a USB port to connect to a Windows PC/Macintosh equipped with suitable editing software, but no such machine was forthcoming. The formant wave forms in the synth are unable to accurately mimic human speech, which may have been one of the original goals of the synthesizer's development.

The unit is purely ceremonial, as the security of the President of Bulgaria, members of the government, of the Parliament and foreign dignitaries on official visits is provided by the National Close Protection Service (Bulgarian: –ù–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∞ —Å–ª—É–∂–±–∞ –∑–∞ –æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ (–ù–°–û)). While it is considered by law to be a part of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Bulgaria, it is outside of the jurisdiction of the Defence Staff. The National Guard performs the ritual \\"Ceremonial changing of the honor guard of the Presidency\\" for the first time on 5 November 2003 and every hour changes guard at the administrative building of the President of the Republic of Bulgaria. The Guard also ensures the security of civil, military and industrial sites in Sofia.http://www.guards- bg.com/ The scarlet hussar style uniform of the Guards was established in 1883 and includes elements of national symbolism. Throughout political changes, uniform details such as the eagle feather on the cap and the Alexander star have been retained. The Alexander star was originally a feature of the Bulgarian royal order \\"St. Alexander\\".http://www.guards- bg.com/index.php/guards-uniform History The National Guards Unit of Bulgaria is the successor of the Personal Cavalry Convoy (squadron) of knyaz Alexander I, founded in 1879, when on July 12 the guards escorted the Bulgarian knyaz for the first time. Accordingly, 12 July is the official holiday of the modern National Guard Unit. Throughout the years the structure of the guards has changed from convoy to squadron, regiment and after 1942 - division. Today it includes military units for state and military ceremonies and a full military band. The guardsmen have however changed their weapons from cavalry sabres to infantry rifles. The standard issue rifle of the unit is SKS (Samozariadnaia karabina Simonova) and a ceremonial version of the AK-47 assault rifle. They also use the much heavier rifle Mosin‚ÄìNagant for training. In 2001 the National Guards Unit was declared the official military unit representing the Armed Forces of Bulgaria and one of the symbols of modern state authority along with the flag, the coat of arms and the national anthem. The mission of the National Guards Unit is not just to display military traditions and rituals but also to provide a center for their revival and enrichment in order to preserve and enhance the national identity of the Republic of Bulgaria and of its Armed Forces. The National Guards Unit has its own regimental colour, seal, distinctive insignia and full dress uniform. The scarlet Guards' uniform was created in 1883 and includes elements of Bulgarian national traditions and symbols. It has remained essentially unchanged throughout the political changes of the last 130 years. The current insignia was introduced in 2002 and consists of Alexander star, which is part of the royal medal \\"St. Alexander\\" and is worn on the Guard's hat since 1883. It is placed over a shield in colours of the Flag of Bulgaria. The current regimental colour, which follows the pattern of the traditional Bulgarian military colours during the royal period, dates from July 12, 2003. In 2003, on the eve of 6 May or St George's Day - the biggest Bulgarian military holiday, the Bulgarians saw for the first time the solemn show-ceremony \\"Iskra\\" (\\"Sparkle\\"). This performance is combination of spectacular demonstration of non-standard combatant positions, movement with and without weapon and saluting battle flags and the heroes, who gave their lives for the freedom and independence of Bulgaria.

McQuaid is also a qualified secondary school teacher. Family background McQuaid comes from a cycling family, with his father Jim being a top amateur cyclist and later coach and official, and his uncle a leader in national cycling organisation. His parents came from Dungannon in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, where his father already raced. The McQuaids moved to Dublin due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland, which had more opportunities and which provided a better atmosphere for mixed couples (his mother was Protestant and his father Catholic), and settled in Dublin's northern suburbs. On Ballygall Road, in the locality of Ballygall between Glasnevin and Finglas, Jim McQuaid ran a greengrocers and bakery, opposite a general store belonging to his brother, and the family lived above the shop. Jim (d. 1991) and Madge McQuaid raised 10 children, seven sons and three daughters. Pat McQuaid was the firstborn, in Dublin in 1949. Who is Pat McQuaid and why is he running our sport?, Cycling Weekly, March 21, 2012, Edward Pickering (and Lionel Birnie), visited Sept 14 2018 All seven brothers raced. Paul, Oliver and Darach McQuaid, the youngest of the ten, as well as cousin John McQuaid represented Ireland in world road championships and some in Olympic road racing. McQuaid himself was inspired by Shay Elliott, who visited his home when he was 12 or 13. Over the last twenty years there have been family-owned 'McQuaid cycles' bicycle shops in Dublin, beginning, and remaining, with one in Ballygall, while a brother, Kieron McQuaid, is the second largest importer of bikes in Ireland,McQuaid family about.shtml celtictrails.com and another, Paul, runs a bicycle rental shop at Ussher's Island. Two of Pat McQuaid's sons have long established business interests in the sport - David McQuaid owns DMC Sports and is the general manager of an international cycling team, while Andrew McQuaid is a lawyer, rider agent and a member of the three-person management team of Team Wiggins. Cycling career McQuaid raced from 1966 to 1982, starting as a junior and then riding nationally and internationally as a senior. =Amateur period= McQuaid rode for the small elite club founded in 1949 by his father and uncle, Emerald Cycling Club. The club was heavily involved in domestic road racing, international racing and cycling administration in Ireland. He also rode for the Clifton Cycling Club in Leeds, Yorkshire for some time in the late 1960s, and later still for a year in France. He was Irish national road champion in 1974. He won two of Ireland's three main road cycling events, the Tour of Ireland twice, in 1975 and 1976, and the Shay Elliott Memorial Race. South Africa visit McQuaid, his brother Kieron, and Sean Kelly, went to South Africa to ride the Rapport Tour stage-race in preparation for the 1976 Olympic Games. They and others rode under false namesFootnote: those names being J. Burns, G. Main, D. Nixon, P. Nugent and A.Owen because of an international ban on athletes competing in South Africa - a protest against apartheid. The three Irish were detected, and suspended from racing for seven months by the national governing body, the Irish Cycling Federation. They were allowed back two months early, and were racing again, when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned them from the Olympics (this did not inhibit McQuaid from becoming a member of the IOC itself later). =Professional period= At the end of his career, he rode for the Viking Cycles professional team in Britain. Educational career McQuaid qualified as a teacher of physical education (PE) and mathematics at Strawberry Hill Teacher Training College (now St Mary's University), Strawberry Hill, Twickenham near London. After qualification he worked as a teacher for year in England, including a period teaching at a young offender institution in Kidderminster. During his later amateur cycling career, his two years with Viking, and for a time after, he worked as a PE and maths teacher, first at Greenhills College in Walkinstown, a suburb of Dublin, where he held a full-time temporary post for three years. With a young family, at the age of 26, he was offered an interview for a permanent post, but chose instead to leave the job and focus on racing, in anticipation of the following year's Montreal Olympic Games. He later returned to teaching, at Ballinteer Community School. He also worked part-time on PE at Synge Street CBS. Cycling administration Having taken at least one leave of absence, McQuaid moved fully into race organisation in 1985, and then later full-time sports administration. Highlights of this part of his career include: =Cycling in Ireland= *1983 - 1986 (Appointed) Irish National Team Director *1985 - 1993 Founding Director of the Nissan Tour of Ireland *1995 - 1999 Elected to the Board of the Irish Cycling Federation, directly to the post of President *1998 Director of the Grand Depart for the Tour de France in Dublin, Ireland In 1983, McQuaid discussed taking an Irish national race on to a \\"pro-am\\" basis (all Irish racing was amateur at the time) with Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche. The idea did not immediately develop, but in 1984, McQuaid persuaded Kelloggs to sponsor a criterium-type road race, the Grand Prix of Ireland. After adding a similar event in Cork, McQuaid then began to try to organise a full-scale five-day stage race around Ireland, working with Alan Rushton, formerly of Kellogg's and Viking Cycles. In February 1985 they announced the first Nissan International Classic Tour of Ireland, to be headlined by Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche. McQuaid secured acceptance, with a favourable calendar \\"slot\\", 25‚Äì29 September, which allowed riders to use the race for preparatory purposes, from the UCI.\\"The Ascent - Sean Kelly, Stephen Roche and the rise of Irish cycling's golden generation\\", Barry Ryan, Gill Books, Chap. 11 McQuaid ran for the honorary post of President of the ICF in November 1994, losing heavily, but won a clear mandate in 1995, and was re- elected in 1997. In 1997, he was also elected to the Management Board of the international cycling federation, and due to the workload from this, and the coming of the Tour de France to Ireland in 1998, for the final year of his time as President, the role was, in effect, split, with a new position of Chairman temporarily created for Dermot Dignam to look after domestic duties, while McQuaid focused on international representation. In 1999, ICF rules did not allow for a third term, but he continued with the international governing body and race organisation. =International race organisation= *1993 - 1997 Director of the Tour of the Philippines *1993 - 2004 Director of the Tour of Langkawi (Malaysia) =International cycling administration= *1997 - 2005 (Elected) Member of the Board of Management of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) *1997 - 2005 (Appointed) President of the UCI Road Commission *2005 - 2013 (Elected, 2005 and 2009) President of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) Successor to Hein Verbruggen McQuaid put himself forward for election as UCI President in 2005, after 16 years of Hein Verbruggen's leadership. His predecessor, also running, withdrew at the last minute, as did another candidate, and he won strongly (31-11), making him the first Irish person to head a major global sport federation (Lord Killanin had previously chaired the Olympic co-ordinating body, the IOC, 1972-1980). Unlike the Irish cycling federation honorary presidency, the world role was a paid post, with a salary in excess of 360,000 euro or 500,000 dollars. When elected McQuaid put strong emphasis on three main areas: managing the professional side of cycling, so that riders' salaries were clean and assured, and teams had a viable business model, anti-doping measures, and development of cycling beyond the traditional core countries of Europe. Achievements During his time in office McQuaid extended anti-doping measures, including the biological passport of which the UCI was a pioneer, and addressed the dispute dating back to 2005 with the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO, organisers of the Tour de France) bequeathed by his predecessor, Tour organizers and UCI strike deal to end row, Reuters - Sports News, Gilles le Roc'h, Sept 26 208, viewed Sept 14 2018 and tensions with the organisers of the two other Grand Tours, continuing development of the professional tours, now working on a three-tier system; further problems arose with the AMO from time to time, but they did not become acute again during McQuaid's time in office. He also oversaw an expansion of paid cycling and broadcast activity, bringing new funding to the sport. He also promoted new races worldwide and worked to expand cycling activity in less active territories, for example negotiating with South Australian Premier Mike Rann to agree the first ProTour status event outside Europe, the Tour Down Under in Adelaide, Australia. Dealings with Igor Makarov In 2012 McQuaid has a number of discussions with a colleague on the UCI Management Committee, Igor Makarov, the billionaire All You Need to Know About Igor Makarov and his Yacht Areti, Super Yacht Fan, checked 16 Sept 2018 head of the Russian cycling federation, and advocate of cycling in his homeland of Turkmenistan, about the development of cycling in the former Soviet space. He stated that as he was considering not running for office again in 2013, due to the stress of the role, including the Lance Armstrong affair, he was open to new work, and in July of that year he signed a contract for consultancy on \\"the future development of cycling in ...Turkmenistan, including the preparation of a bid to bring the UCI Road World Championships there in 2017.\\" After a successful Olympic season, he four months later decided to seek to continue in office, and withdrew from the contract, and he clarified \\"I should stress that at no point did I carry out any work relating to this contract, nor did I ever receive any payment relating to this contract.\\" McQuaid divulges 2017 Worlds contract with Makarov, David Benson, March 6, 2015, Cycling News, visited Sept 14 2018 There was later tension when a cycling team promoted by Makarov was refused a licence by the independent Licensing Commission of the UCI. By mid-2013 Makarov was campaigning against McQuaid's re-election bid.

He had originally been nominated by the cycling federations of his countries of origin, Ireland, and residence, Switzerland, but both nominations were withdrawn. The election proceeded based on two third country nominations, allowed under a then-new UCI rule. The election took place at the UCI Congress in Florence, and Cookson prevailed by 24-18 votes. McQuaid had pledged not to launch a legal challenge should he be defeated, in particular with reference to allegations of that votes had been \\"bought\\" by a member of the Management Committee who wanted McQuaid removed.Pat McQuaid defeated in cycling's presidential election, theguardian.com, Friday 27 September 2013, retrieved 19 January 2014.Former UCI chief Pat McQuaid had laptop seized after election loss, theguardian.com, Thursday 24 October 2013, retrieved 19 January 2014. Cookson launched a review of some of McQuaid's and Verbruggen's policies and projects, such as the establishment of the Global Cycling Promotion company, which ran the new Tour of Beijing, the operation of the World Cycling Centre, and promised more proactive work on women's cycling. He also replaced the head of the UCI professional staff, the director-general, Christophe Hubschmid, with Martin Gibbs, a past UCI staffer who had managed his presidential campaign while Head of Policy and Legal Affairs of British Cycling. Corruption allegations, lawsuits and vindication For much of his term in office, McQuaid had to deal with allegations of doping in the sport, many dating back to previous decades, and especially around a handful of elite riders such as Lance Armstrong, Floyd Landis and Alberto Contador. As a result, he was also involved in defamation lawsuits, in Switzerland, against people who accused the UCI of corruption and insufficient action against the problem, most notably with regard to Armstrong. In September 2013, during the UCI presidential election campaign, elements of a dossier prepared for the UCI Committee of Management member Igor Makarov, and shared with the USA delegate, were leaked to the press - they included allegations that McQuaid had made a promotional deal with Makarov, that the UCI had sought payment to cover up Alberto Contador's 2010 positive drug test, and that McQuaid made private arrangements with Lance Armstrong regarding drugs testing and race appearances. While Makarov refused to hand the dossier over to the UCI's Ethics Commission, requesting instead a one-time independent commission, it was eventually shown to McQuaid for comment, and sent to USADA (who took no formal action on it), as well as in some form being shared within the UCI Management Committee. McQuaid denied the negative allegations, as did Armstrong for his part, and McQuaid clarified that he had in 2012 signed a contract to advise on the development of the sport in Turkmenistan but had withdrawn from that contract before commencing work or receiving payment. The UCI set up the Cycling Independent Reform Committee (CIRC) to investigate various allegations to do with historical governance and handling of doping. The committee interviewed UCI staff, cyclists and support staff, as well as having access to the UCI computer servers, accounts, departments and email and phone records, including those of McQuaid, both personal and business, in order to fully carry out their investigations. In March 2015, the CIRC report was made public. It stated that some matters might have been better handled, expressing concern that Lance Armstrong had received flexible treatment on several occasions, including being allowed to return to competition for a key event, the Tour Down Under, 10 days earlier than a six-month deadline, while he was also being asked to join a race in Ireland. However, it concluded that there was no evidence to support allegations against McQuaid or his predecessor of bribery from Armstrong, corruption or collusion with doping. =Olympic movement and WADA roles= *2006 - 2014 (Elected) Member of the Board of Management of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), Vice-President 2009-2014 *2009 - 2012 (Elected) Member of the Executive & Foundation Board of the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) *2009 - 2014 (Elected) Member of the Board of SportAccord, the association of sports federations and related bodies *2010 - 2013 (Elected) Member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), appointed to two IOC Commissions, Women in Sport, and Entourage, 2010-2013 Later life McQuaid left the UCI and cycling administration after failing to win re-election. He moved from Switzerland, and now lives in the south of France, running a holiday accommodation business. =Commentary on cycling and cycling administration= He has commented occasionally on his successors, and on ethics and doping. He has also spoken, somewhat harshly, on British cycling and especially Team Sky, for use of non-commercial and expensive bespoke bicycles, use of therapeutic usage exemptions (TUEs) and other matters.

But these were specially made bespoke machines.\\", \\"bemoaned the fact that in sport it was possible to abuse the TUE system without breaking any rules.

The customers draw products from the 'shelves' as needed and this can be detected by the supplier who then initiates a replenishment of that item. It was the observation that this 'way of working' could be transferred from retail to manufacturing that is one of the cornerstones of the Toyota Production System (TPS).  History  In the 1950s Toyota sent teams to the United States to learn how they achieved mass- production. However, the Toyota Delegation first got inspiration for their production system at an American Supermarket (a Piggly Wiggly, to be precise). They saw the virtue in the supermarket only reordering and restocking goods once they‚Äôd been bought by customers. In a supermarket (like the TPS) customers (processes) buy what they need when they need it. Since the system is self-service the sales effort (materials management) is reduced. The shelves are refilled as products are sold (parts withdrawn) on the assumption that what has sold will sell again which makes it easy to see how much has been used and to avoid overstocking. The most important feature of a supermarket system is that stocking is triggered by actual demand. In the TPS this signal triggers the 'pull' system of production.A study of the Toyota Production System, Shigeo Shingo, Production Press, 1989, p 90  Implementation  Market locations are appropriate where there is a desire to communicate customer pull up the supply chain. The aim of the 'market' is to send single unit consumption signals back up the supply chain so that a demand leveling effect occurs. Just as in a supermarket it is possible for someone to decide to cater for a party of 300 from the supermarket so it is possible to decide to suddenly fill ten trucks and send massively distorting signals up those same pathways. Thus the 'market location' can be used as a sort of isolator between actual demand and how supply would like demand to be, an isolator between batch demand spikes and the up upstream supply process.The Gold Mine, F & M Ball√©, Lean Enterprise Institute, 2005, p190 For example, if the market were positioned at the loading bay, then it will receive 'spikes' of demand whenever a truck comes in to be loaded. Since, in general, one knows in advance when trucks will arrive and what they will require to be loaded onto them, it is possible to spread that demand spike over a chosen period before the truck actually arrives. It is possible to do this by designating a location, say a marked floor area, to be the 'virtual' truck and moving items from the market to the 'virtual truck' smoothly over the chosen period prior to the load onto the actual truck commencing. Smoothly here means that for each item its 'loading' is evenly spread across the period. For regular shipments this period might start the moment the last shipment in that schedule departs the loading bay. This has four key impacts: # Loading movements rise, which is the reason often given for not doing this 'virtual' truck loading; # Demand evenness (Mura) increases which allows stock reductions and exposes new issues to be resolved; # Any last minute searching for items to load is eliminated since before the real truck need to be loaded the 'virtual' truck will have completed its loading; # Any potential shortages that may affect the shipment can be exposed earlier by the 'stockout' in the market location. This is true because the 'virtual' truck loading sequence will be constructed to fit with the supply process tempo. This logic can, obviously, be applied upstream of any batch process and not just deliveries to another plant. It is a workaround for the fact that the batch process hasn't been made to flow yet. It therefore has some costs but the benefits in terms of reducing the three wastes should outweigh these. Toyota use this technique and demand it of their suppliers in order to generate focus on the supply issues it uncovers. They then demand the preparation of loads for more frequent 'virtual' trucks than will actually appear in order to raise this pressure (see Frequent deliveries). At low stocking levels for some items the 'market location' can require Just in Sequence supply rather than Just in Time.

There is controversy surrounding whether it is a true neuropsychiatric disorder. Temporal lobe epilepsy causes chronic, mild, interictal (i.e. between seizures) changes in personality, which slowly intensify over time. Geschwind syndrome includes five primary changes; hypergraphia, hyperreligiosity, atypical (usually reduced) sexuality, circumstantiality, and intensified mental life. Not all symptoms must be present for a diagnosis. Only some people with epilepsy or temporal lobe epilepsy show features of Geschwind syndrome.Benson, D.F. & Hermann, B.P. (1998) Personality disorders. In J. Engel Jr. & T.A. Pedley (Eds.) Epilepsy: A comprehensive textbook. Vol. II (pp.2065‚Äì2070). Philadelphia: Lippincott‚ÄìRaven. Features =Hypergraphia= Hypergraphia is the tendency for extensive and compulsive writing or drawing, and has been observed in persons with temporal lobe epilepsy who have experienced multiple seizures. Those with hypergraphia display extreme attention to detail in their writing. Some such patients keep diaries recording meticulous details about their everyday lives. In certain cases, these writings demonstrate extreme interest in religious topics. These individuals also tend to have poor penmanship. The great Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky, known to suffer from epilepsy, showed signs of Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia. In some cases hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing. Drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes morphing writing with drawing. =Hyperreligiosity= Some individuals may exhibit hyperreligiosity, characterized by increased, usually intense, religious feelings and philosophical interests, and partial (temporal lobe) epilepsy patients experiencing frequent auras, perceived as numinous in character, exhibit greater ictal and interictal spirituality. Some auras include ecstatic experiences. It has been reported that many religious leaders exhibit this form of epilepsy. These religious feelings can motivate beliefs within any religion, including voodoun, Christianity, Islam, and others. Furthermore, \\"in someone from a strongly religious background hyperreligiosity might appear as deeply felt atheism\\". There are reports of patients converting between religions. A few patients internalize their religious feelings: when asked if they are religious they say they are not. One reviewer concluded that the evidence for a link between temporal lobe epilepsy and hyperreligiosity \\"isn't terribly compelling\\". =Atypical sexuality= People with Geschwind syndrome reported higher rates of atypical or altered sexuality. In approximately half of affected individuals hyposexuality is reported. Less commonly, cases of hypersexuality have been reported. =Circumstantiality= Individuals that demonstrate circumstantiality (or viscosity) tend to continue conversations for a long time and talk receptively. =Intensified mental life= Individuals may demonstrate an intensified mental life, including deepened cognitive and emotional responses. This tendency may pair with hypergraphia, leading to prolific creative output and a tendency toward intense, solitary pursuits.

Independent psychic First living in Callas in the South of France, then traveling extensively, \\"Maria Duval\\" was able to build a growing reputation as a psychic throughout the 1970s and 1980s, doing consultations and horoscope newspaper columns. She did media interviews and appeared on the cover of Vogue Paris. Old newspaper clippings she keeps in her home indicate she brushed shoulders with celebrities, although her claim to have psychically found Brigitte Bardot's lost dog was debunked by Bardot herself. Gamba has a son, named Antoine Palfroy. Face of giant mail scam operation In the mid-1990s, Gamba sold the rights to the name Maria Duval to a group of scammers, who used the name to sell astrology charts. The scam quickly changed form, as sick and elderly people started receiving letters promising the psychic help of \\"Maria Duval\\" for $40 per mail consultation. The scam would quickly take gigantic proportions and generate some $200 million in revenues for the fraudsters running it. It appears only a very small portion of that money made its way to Gamba. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice shut down the North American arm of the ‚ÄúPsychic‚Äù Mail Fraud scheme. Gamba made several public appearances over the years, including a news conference in Moscow in 2008. She left Callas in the late 1990s, although retaining ownership of the property. She moved back in 2008. She was still residing there in 2018 when French police searched her home and when an investigating team from CNN visited her.

It was known anciently as \\"Balantrodach\\", from the Scottish Gaelic Baile nan Trodach, which means \\"town of the warriors\\", again a reference to the Knights Templar. History =Pre-Reformation= Historically the Parish of Temple was divided into three portions, the ancient parish of Clerkington, and the chapelries of Moorfoot and Balantrodach. Clerkington was a parsonage held by the monks of Newbattle Abbey, Moorfoot was a chapelry founded by monks from the same institution. Balantrodach on the other hand, was a chapelry of the Knights Templar. Knights Templar Temple Church Temple Midlothian In 1128, Hugues de Payens, the first Grand Master, met with David I in Scotland and was granted the lands of Balantrodach.Transactions of the Scottish Ecclesiological Society, Volume 4, page 13 (Scottish Ecclesiological Society, 1913) In 1128, the Council of Troyes formally recognized the Order. Balantrodach became their principal Templar seat and preceptory in Scotland until the suppression of the order between 1307 and 1312. As Temple, being just to the south of the Firth of Forth, was an area of the country occupied by England at this time, knights were prosecuted, but not all were found guilty. Nearby to the north, politics was even more on their side ‚Äì Robert the Bruce had been excommunicated, and so was not required to follow papal commands , and at war with England, it has been suggested that he may have been welcoming to powerful and desperate allies.http://heritage.scotsman.com/timelines.cfm?cid=1&id;=41752005 Following 1312 and the Papal bull (edict) entitled Ad providam, King Edward II of England abolished the Templars in both England and Scotland. According to the edict, all Knight Templar property was to be seized and handed over to the control of the Knights Hospitaller, who had a preceptory at Torphichen in West Lothian. Although he was located in Scotia, north of the Firth of Forth, Robert the Bruce, being under interdict at the time, was reluctant to do so. Many Templar Knights may have assimilated within the Hospitallers. But it's not necessarily the case that the Templars everywhere immediately ceased to be. Indeed, North of the Firth, in Scotland the Order combined with the Hospitallers and continued as The Order of St John and the Temple until the reformation.Scottish Knights Templar \\"Legend has it that treasure of the Knights Templar was removed secretly from Paris, to be hidden in Temple. A local legend states: 'Twixt the oak and the elm tree/You will find buried the millions free.' French legends about the Templar treasure apparently also state that the treasure was taken to Scotland, with the knights landing on the Isle of May, the first island they would encounter in the Firth of Forth. Geographically, this would take them to the mouth of the river Esk, which could take them on to Rosslyn...\\" =Post-Reformation= Following the Reformation the present parish was formed from the three older divisions. In 1618, it took its name Temple from the preceptory chapel which had by then become the parish kirk. In the following centuries Temple became a bustling agricultural village, but in recent years it has become a dormitory village for nearby Edinburgh. The current Church was funded by Thomas Creak whose family were leading figures in Temple in the 1820/30s and earlier.

Dowling (18 May 1844 ‚Äì 13 August 1911) was an American preacher who authored The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ (1908). Life He was born in Bellville, Ohio. His father, of Scots and Welsh descent, was a pioneer preacher among the Disciples of Christ. At the age of thirteen, in his first public debate, he took the negative side against a Presbyterian elder on \\"The Everlasting Punishment of the Wicked.\\" in Levi began preaching at the age of sixteen; and at the age of eighteen was pastor of a small church. He entered the United States Army at the age of twenty, as a chaplain, and served in this capacity to the end of the Civil War. In 1866‚Äì1867, he was a student at Northwestern Christian University at Indianapolis, Indiana. The next year he began publishing Sunday school literature, issuing Sunday school lesson papers, song books, and a children's Sunday school paper. Dowling preached President Lincoln's funeral service to Union troops in Illinois. He was the author of two spiritual healing books Self-Culture and Biopneuma: The Science of the Great Breath. The publisher's introduction to Biopneuma says that Levi taught chemistry, toxicology, physiology, histology, and lectured on the use of electricity in medicine. Much of his time was devoted to the cause of prohibition. He was a graduate of two medical colleges, and practiced medicine for a number of years. He retired from the medical profession to resume literary work. Even as a child, he was impressed with the sensitiveness of the finer ethers, and believed that in some manner they were sensitized plates on which sounds, even thoughts, were recorded. He studied etheric vibration , determined to solve the great mysteries of the heavens for himself. Forty years he spent in study and silent meditation, and allegedly eventually he found himself in that stage of spiritual consciousness that permitted him to enter the domain of these superfine ethers, and become familiar with their mysteries. During the meditation, it was claimed that he was able to repeat events, as many times as necessary, in order to produce a perfect transcript. He spent many months transcribing the events he supposedly witnessed ‚Äì in \\"The Book of God's Remembrance\\" also known as the akashic records. His transcription is commonly known as \\"The Aquarian Gospel.\\" He allegedly learned that the imaginings of his boyhood days were founded upon veritable facts, and that every thought of every living thing is there recorded. He claimed that as a boy, he also had a vision in which he was told that he was to \\"build a white city.\\" and this vision was repeated three times over a period of years. The building of the \\"white city\\" was The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ. In 1904, west of Los Angeles, \\"Mount Carmel-by-the-Sea,\\" planned for 40 years as a self-contained community was being built on 800 acres purchased between Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach by the Mount Carmel company for about $65,000 from the Hermosa Beach company. Members received 1 acre lots for housing in the core section called the \\"White City of the Mystic Initiates,\\" home of the Gnostic people. Dowling was to be the head instructor in their polytechnic high school called \\"Temple of Resplendent Light.\\" Businesses, factories, water, power, streets, parks, and a top university would follow. The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ Dowling wrote The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ (full title: The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ: The Philosophic and Practical Basis of the Religion of the Aquarian Age of the World and of the Church Universal) in the late 19th century and published it in 1908. He claimed it was the true story of the life of Jesus, including \\"the 'lost' eighteen years silent in the New Testament.\\" Dowling claimed to have transcribed it from the akashic records in the early morning hours from two to six - the absolutely \\"quiet hours\\". The Aquarian Age denotes the human race as standing on the cusp of the Piscean-Aquarian Ages. Aquarius is an air sign and the New Age is already noted for remarkable inventions for the use of air, electricity, magnetism, etc. Men navigate the air as fish do the sea, and send their thoughts spinning around the world with the speed of lightning. The word Aquarius is derived from the Latin word aqua, meaning water. Aquarius is, however, the water bearer, and the symbol of the sign, which is the, eleventh sign of the Zodiac, is a man carrying in his right hand a pitcher of water. in Legacy The Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (ACCU) is a denomination founded on the teachings found in The Aquarian Gospel and other writings by Levi H. Dowling. These include Self-culture and Biopneuma: The Science of the Holy Breath. The church also incorporates other New Age teachings. It is similar to the \\"I AM\\" movement and the Ascended Master Teachings. In a biographical sketch included in the original publication of Self-culture, Levi is said to have taught and lectured medical students in the use of electricity in medicine. The Aquarian Christine Church considers Dowling an Ascended Master.

It won the Nestl√© Children's Book Prize Silver Award and was shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal.Nestl√© Children's Book Prize The CILIP Carnegie Medal & Kate Greenaway Children's Book Awards  Setting  The story takes place over a year in the Austro-Hungarian and German empires in the early 20th century. Certain events are discussed, however, that are set in the 19th century or other parts of Europe. Though the story is fictional some people and events from actual history are discussed (such as Emperor Franz-Josef and the founding of the German empire). The author, with ancestry from Vienna herself, dedicates the second chapter of the book to discussing life there at that time. Plot summary The story opens with two Viennese servants, Ellie and Sigrid, who, on their day off, discover a newborn baby girl left behind in a church of the alpine village of Pettelsdorf. With the infant is a note asking for her to be taken to a nunnery in Vienna, but when Ellie and Sigrid find that the nunnery is in quarantine for typhus, they decide to take the baby home and raise her as their own. They name her Annika after Ellie's mother and decide not to give her away after the typhus quarantine is over. Twelve years pass and it is now 1908. For Annika, life in Vienna is perfect. She attends a local school whilst helping the adult maids with the day-to-day duties of running the household, has her friends, Pauline and Stefan, and loves her adopted family (Ellie and Sigrid, and the three professors who they all work for) very much. Annika is asked by Loremarie Egghart, a snobby rich girl whom Annika despises, to read to her great-aunt. Annika does so and the two (Annika and Loremarie's great aunt) become friends, telling each other about their lives. Loremarie's great aunt was a famous theatre personality who went by the stage name La Rondine. They become so close that the great-aunt leaves Annika her jewels when she dies, having been told that the jewels are pastings of the real ones which she had sold through a jeweler. Annika is delighted but sometimes wonders about the missing piece of the puzzle: the mystery of her real mother and why she was abandoned. When the beautiful, rich Frau Edeltraut von Tannenberg comes to the professors household and announces she is Annika‚Äôs long lost mother, Annika is delighted. Her mother takes her to Spittal, the family's estate in Germany, and she meets her brother Hermann, her uncle Oswald, and her cousin Gudrun, but she doesn‚Äôt enjoy it. The mansion is derelict and gloomy, the walls are crumbling, and the paint peeling. Due to her newfound membership of the aristocracy, she is forbidden from attending the village school or helping with domestic chores. She meets a friendly Romany/gypsy boy called Zed who works on the farm and cares for Hermann's horse Rocco. Although her friends back in Vienna are pleased for Annika they can't help but feel uneasy about the whole thing - especially Ellie. Annika's mother asks her to sign some important documents without really explaining them, and then goes to Zurich. Annika has actually signed over La Rondine's jewels, including her famous Star of Kazan, but is unaware of what she has done. When her mother comes back, she says a relative died and left them much money, but in fact she sold some of Annika's jewels so Hermann can go to the army school that he wants to attend, and Annika can have galoshes, which her mother buys a size too small. One day while Annika is walking with Zed and Hector, the dog, Hector discovers some remnants of La Rondine's trunk in the lake, but there is no sign of the jewels. Upon asking Frau Edeltraut of the trunk's mysterious appearance, she retorts that Zed must have stolen it. Afraid of being arrested, Zed flees Spittal with Rocco and arrives in Vienna to tell the professors his suspicions about Annika's mother. Annika is then sent away to a very harsh boarding school for young ladies called Grossenfluss, but the professors, Ellie, and Stefan manage to rescue her after discovering that a pupil died by committing suicide, but the police were not allowed to investigate and were told that it was an accident. Annika manages to escape back home to Vienna, and those she loves. However, Frau Edeltraut hears of the incident at Grossenfluss and visits Vienna to collect Annika. Pauline, upset from the proceedings, decides to spend her time on her hobby of collecting news articles of heroic deeds, but spots a piece stating that the lawyer who signed the birth certificate that Frau Edeltraut had of Annika's was imprisoned. This spurs Pauline to visit the midwife in Pettelsdorf, only to discover that the women had a stroke twenty years beforehand and can only sign her name. With this knowledge Pauline returns to Vienna and informs everyone about the forgery of the birth certificate. By this time, Annika is already on the boat with Frau Edeltraut and about to set off on the voyage, but fortunately Herr Egghart has arrived in his motor car, and they speed to the river Danube. They manage to alert Annika and inform her that Frau Edeltraut is not her mother, which Annika instantly acknowledges and jumps into the river to evade her. With Frau Edeltraut discredited, Annika splits the wealth of the jewel sales with the Eggharts and proceeds to live a content life with her friends, Zed and the professors and Sigrid and Ellie, who she now recognises as her mother. Characters Some of the main characters are: Professor Emil, Professor Gertrude, Professor Julius, Zed, Stefan, Pauline, Gudrun, Loremarie, Hermann, Rocco, Edeltraut von Tannenberg, and of course Annika. =Zedekiah (Zed)= Zed is a friendly gypsy boy who works for Edeltraut von Tannenberg. He is the son of a horse dealer and is descended from gypsies. His mother is dead and his father died trying to stop a fight when Zed was very little. Edeltraut von Tannenberg's father, and the master at the time, had ordered a horse from Zed's father before the father‚Äôs death so when the horse was delivered, Zed came with it. The master gave Zed a job and sent him to school. The horse, Rocco, was bought for the master's grandson, Hermann, but always preferred Zed, so the Master decided to get his grandson another horse and just before he had his stroke he left the horse to him. =Stefan= Stefan Bodek is the son of a poor washerwoman. His father is a groundsman in the Prater. He is the third of six brothers and the strongest. He wants to be an engineer but fears that he can't afford to study. = Annika = Annika is the protagonist of the story. A foundling, she is found and taken in by Sigrid and Ellie =Ellie= Ellie has worked for the professors as their cook since she was 14 years old. She is a very good cook like her mother and grandmother before her. Ellie often goes on walks in the countryside with Sigrid on their days off from work. =Sigrid= Sigrid works for the professors as a housemaid. She works well, but can be a little 'snappy' at times. Sigrid is very good friends with Ellie and is a hardworking role model for Annika. =Pauline= Pauline is Annika and Stefan's friend who lives with her grandfather and helps him look after his bookshop. She is a thin girl with frizzy black hair. She loves reading books and keeps a book with newspaper clippings about heroic people. She suffers from agoraphobia. =The Professors= The professors are all siblings and have lived in the same house all their lives. None of them are married and are unlikely to be any time soon. Professor Gertrude is the youngest and the only woman. She plays the harp and always smells of lavender water. She suffers from cold feet and needs a hot water bottle to sleep. She is sometimes very anxious, doesn't smile much, and always has bits of food on her skirt. Professor Emil is the middle child. He has a \\"sensitive stomach\\" and cannot cope with spicy foods. He is an art expert and is able to tell who painted a picture by looking at the feet of its main subjects. Professor Julius, who specialises in geology, is the eldest. He was once engaged but his bride died before they could be wed. He has a picture of her in his room and has Annika pick out and arrange flowers in front of the picture every Saturday morning. = Edeltraut von Tannenberg = Frau Edeltraut von Tannenberg comes forward as Annika's mother. Edeltraut has one sister, whose husband helps Edeltraut steal Annika's jewels. Edeltraut‚Äôs husband gambles away all their money and flees to America, leaving Edeltraut to take care of their son, Hermann, and the family estate until Hermann comes of age. =Hermann= Hermann is Edeltraut's son, and heir to the family estate. He is a couple of years younger than Annika and obsessed with all things marshal. Hoping for a future military career, he follows the timetable of the officer school he dreams of attending each day. = Loremarie = Loremarie is a snobby little girl whose father is very rich. She never really cared for her great aunt, known in the theater as La Rondine. =Hector= Hector is a water spaniel who was bought for Hermann by his grandfather. Zed told Annika that Hermann wanted to train Hector to be an army dog and to not be scared of guns of explosions, so Hermann tied firecrackers onto Hector's leg and tail. Hector was blinded in one eye and lost one of his legs and most of his tail because of this. Edeltraut wanted Hector put down but Zed saved him. Hector is described by Zed as being able to swim like a fish even with only three legs. Hector likes to collect items from the lake, including his favorite sock suspender. =Gudrun= Gudrun is a rather pathetic looking girl who is the daughter of Edeltraut von Tannenberg's sister and cousin to Hermann, whom she worships as a hero. She always wants whatever Hermann desires. Her most rebellious scene is when she ignores her mother and tells Ellie and the professors that Annika has been sent to Grossenfluss. Gudrun is not as evil as her mother. =Rocco= Rocco is a gentle, quarter-Lipizzaner breed bay-coloured horse belonging to Zed. Although the Master bought him originally for Hermann, he changed his mind and left Rocco to Zed after having a stroke. =La Rondine= La Rondine is the Loremarie's great-aunt. Annika used to read to her because Loremarie was disgusted by her. La Rondine told Annika about her life and how she used to be a great actress. She had a chest of jewels she thought to be fake, and as she died without knowing that they were real, she bequeathed them to Annika in her will.

On 8 May 2008 the colloquium of specialists in Portuguese maritime history, \\"Os Portugueses na Austr√°lia\\", was held at the Science Museum of the University of Coimbra in Portugal, to discuss Beyond Capricorn. The consensus of the experts was expressed by the chair of the colloquium, Francisco Domingues, who said: \\"the Portuguese went to Australia but Australia did not at all interest them\\", and \\"the Portuguese went to Australia; the English discovered it (in the sense of having given to it a place in the community of nations)\\". In 2013 the essays, opinions and discussions presented on the colloquium were collected in a book entitled \\"Portugueses na Austr√°lia\\", published by Coimbra University Press.  Synopsis  The Terra Java section of the Vallard atlas, which is identified by Peter Trickett as the east coast of Australia. South is at the top. The title of the book refers to the sixteenth century Dieppe maps of France which in part show land in a continent extending south of the Tropic of Capricorn that is in the area of Australia. Trickett claims that the Portuguese were the first Europeans to discover Australia, between 1519‚Äì23, well before the first recognised landfall of Europeans in Australia in 1606 by Willem Janszoon. According to Trickett, a 1520 expedition searching for gold and led by Diogo Pacheco (a relative of Duarte Pacheco), may have been the first Europeans to sight Australia, in the present-day Kimberley region of Western Australia. Using an account from Jo√£o de Barros's D√©cadas da √Åsia, a 1786 history of the Portuguese empire in Asia, Trickett argues Pacheco was killed at Napier Broome Bay, in a battle with Aborigines.Trickett, P. (2007) pps 37-70 Trickett claims the Carronade Island cannons originate from this voyage.Trickett, P. (2007) pps 39-48. Trickett dismisses the 1980s research into the Carronade Island Cannons by Jeremy Green, see footnote on pps353-355. For Green's 2006 publication on the cannons, which Trickett apparently did not consult, see \\"An investigation of one of the two bronze guns from Carronade Island, Western Australia\\" Most of the book, however, focuses on the claimed voyage of a fleet of four ships commanded by Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa, along the eastern and southern coasts of Australia then to New Zealand shortly afterwards, and another Portuguese voyage along the west coast. Trickett uses one of the Dieppe maps in the highly decorated \\"Vallard\\" atlas of 1547 to demonstrate this. Trickett claims that Mendon√ßa travelled down the east coast of Australia, sailing into Botany Bay and then around Wilsons Promontory to Kangaroo Island, before returning to Portuguese-controlled Malacca via the North Island of New Zealand. He also claims the Portuguese charted the Western Australian coast, as far south as the southwest tip of Australia. Trickett claims that the French Vallard maps were composed of several portolan charts that were incorrectly assembled from now lost Portuguese charts. Trickett adjusts parts of the Vallard maps by rotating them 90 degrees, giving what he claims is a remarkably accurate depiction of Australia's eastern, southern, and western coasts. Trickett goes through almost every written location on the Vallard maps, giving an English translation and explaining where he believes the place is located. He also mentions the Mahogany Ship, the ruins at Bittangabee Bay on the south coast of New South Wales, various Aboriginal legends and alleged linguistic similarities, and various artefacts found in Queensland and New Zealand which he claims pre-date known European exploration, as further evidence of a Portuguese discovery of Australia and New Zealand.  An example: Botany Bay  Baia Neve, which is claimed in the book to be Botany Bay Trickett's adjusted Vallard map, with the southern section rotated 90 degrees. Wilsons Promontory is depicted some 2,000 kilometres south of its actual position. In the publicity campaign surrounding the release of the book, several media reports mentioned Trickett's claim that the Vallard map accurately showed Botany Bay to the point where Sydney Airport runways could be drawn on it. Reuters report by Michael Perry. Widely copied by other sources on the web. Trickett's Botany Bay is \\"Baia Neve\\" on the Vallard Map, and on p. 155 Trickett provides a sketch map of the bay with Sydney Airport runways drawn on it to the same scale. He acknowledges the bay is \\"too large to be Botany Bay in relation to the scale of the Vallard map as a whole\\".Trickett, P. (2007) p.154-7 He explains that sixteenth century map-makers \\"enlarge(d) ‚Ä¶ important sections of their charts,\\"Trickett. P. (2007) p. 154 such as this bay, hence its exaggerated size. The Vallard map original also shows two large islands in the bay and seven islands just outside the mouth of the bay. Trickett identified the islands inside the bay as Bare Island and a large mudflat, drying out at low tide, which he believed appeared as a large island to the Portuguese explorers. The seven islands outside the bay he identifies as a misplacing of the Five Islands Group (50 km away near Wollongong); a representation of the North Head of Sydney Harbour and a representation of Cape Three Points (now Boudi, 70 km away near Broken Bay). Criticism of Trickett's theories Following its initial reception online and in the popular press, a number of criticisms of the book have appeared, by scholars including Associate Professor (Spanish and Portuguese) W.A.R. \\"Bill\\" Richardson. Trickett repeatedly criticises \\"orthodox academics\\" for ignoring or denigrating the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia,Trickett, P (2007) p.4-5 while acknowledging that the book is \\"not written as an academic treatise‚Äîit is aimed at a wider audience\\".Trickett, P. (2007) p.7 Trickett's approach of using only one Dieppe map as the basis for his book, without significant reference to any of the other existing Dieppe maps, has been questioned. The Vallard map of 1547 is not the first of the Dieppe maps, and Richardson argues Trickett incorrectly \\"assumes the unknown Vallard cartographer had access to much more information\\" because it contains more place names. Richardson adds that \\"the hybrid inscriptions [of the Vallard] are in an astonishing jumble of languages\\", many of which Trickett misreads or misinterprets; suggesting, for example, that the island Illa do Aljofar may have Polynesian origins.Trickett, P. (2007) p.256Richardson points out the word is Portuguese, of Arabic origin, meaning 'pearl' and thus strongly connecting it to Hainan island. Trickett also reproduces a number of sketch maps, comparing Terra Java/Jave La Grande of the A3-sized pages of the Vallard atlas with modern detailed knowledge of the Australian coast, but without showing any scale. Richardson argues this practice misleads the reader, and he previously argued Kenneth McIntyre's comparative sketches also misled in the same way.Richardson, W.A.R. (2006) Was Australia Charted before 1606? The Jave La Grande Inscriptions. National Library of Australia. pp. 48‚Äì51 The issues in providing such sketch maps for comparison purposes are highlighted in Trickett's sketch map copy of Illa Do Magna, which he compares to a rough sketch map of New Zealand's North Island.Trickett, P. (2007) p.232. Compare the sketch of Illa Do Magna, its scale and orientation, and the treatment of the \\"Taranaki\\" section, with the Vallard original Richardson adds that the lack of scale used in Beyond Capricorn's sketch maps causes the reader \\"to fail to realise that [Trickett‚Äôs adjusted] 'Wilsons Promontory' is some 17 degrees, nearly 2,000 kilometres, south of the real Wilsons Promontory.\\" Commenting in 1985 on other writers who compared Australia's coast with the Dieppe Maps, Richardson wrote, \\"it is difficult not to express admiration for the extreme ingenuity exercised in their endeavours to 'correct' the Jave La Grande outline in order to compel it to conform more closely to the known outline of Australia.\\"Richardson, W.A.R, (1985) Another Gospel on our discovery by the Portuguese. The Age, 5 January 1985. Writing in 2007 for an Australian mapmaking journal, he suggested Trickett has also taken an approach of \\"if evidence does not suit a theory, one solution is to alter it.\\" In an article in The Globe in 2009, Robert J. King refers to Beyond Capricorn, arguing that Jave la Grande is a theoretical construction, an artifact of 16th century cosmography. He points out that the geographers and map makers of the Renaissance struggled to bridge the gap from the world view inherited from Graeco-Roman antiquity, as set out in Claudius Ptolemy's Geography, and a map of the world that would take account of the new geographical information obtained during the Age of Discoveries. The Dieppe world maps reflected the state of geographical knowledge of their time, both actual and theoretical. Accordingly, Java Major, or Jave la Grande, was shown as a promontory of the undiscovered Antarctic continent of Terra Australis. King argues that Jave la Grande on the Dieppe maps represents one of Marco Polo's pair of Javas (Major or Minor), misplaced far to the south of its actual location and attached to a greatly enlarged Terra Australis; it does not represent Australia, discovered by unknown Portuguese voyagers.Robert J. King, \\"The Jagiellonian Globe, a Key to the Puzzle of Jave la Grande\\", The Globe: Journal of the Australian Map Circle, no.62, 2009, pp.1-50. http://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=991081461781028;res=IELHSS See also *History of Australia *History of New Zealand  References  External links * Images of the Vallard atlas (1547) at the Huntington Library * CNN News - Author: Map proves Portuguese discovered Australia * News.com.au Map 'shows Cook wasn't first * Reuters, Map proves Portuguese discovered Australia: new book Category:2007 books Category:European exploration of Australia Category:Portuguese exploration in the Age of Discovery Category:Pre-1606 contact with Australia Category:Controversies in Australia Category:Pseudoarchaeological texts ","title":"Beyond Capricorn"},{"id":"10701063","text":"Nils Arvid Birger Holmberg (10 October 1886 ‚Äì 11 September 1958) was a Swedish gymnast.

It is particularly associated with Wild West shows or Western arts in the United States. The lasso is a well- known tool of American cowboys, who developed rope spinning and throwing skills in using lassos to catch animals. Cowboys developed various tricks to show off their prowess with the lasso and demonstrations of these tricks evolved into entertainment and competitive disciplines. The well-established repertoire of tricks can be divided into three fundamental categories: \\"flat loop\\", \\"vertical loop\\", and \\"butterfly\\". In addition, thrown-loop tricks and tricks that involve the use of two ropes are used. Among the vertical loop tricks is the \\"Texas Skip\\", which involves the performer spinning the lasso in a wide loop in a vertical plane and jumping through the loop from one side to the other on each rotation. Well-known trick ropers include: *Texas Jack Omohundro was the first performer to introduce roping acts to the American stage. *Montie Montana had a 60-year career as a trick roper, and appeared in several John Wayne movies. *Actor and humorist Will Rogers, known for his roles as a cowboy, was an expert at trick roping. Rogers' rope tricks were showcased in the 1922 silent film The Ropin' Fool. *Vince Bruce (b. April 4, 1955, d. September 24, 2011) was internationally acclaimed as one of the best Western acts in the world; Bruce made his Broadway debut in 1991, in the Tony Award-winning musical The Will Rogers Follies ‚Äî A Life in Revue. Appearing as the trick-roping star and portraying Rogers in this tribute to the cowboy and vaudeville star, Bruce remained with the show for two and a half years at New York‚Äôs Palace Theatre. For his act, he performed a spin with two ropes, a feat first devised 60 years earlier by Will Rogers himself. On July 21, 1991, at the Empire State Building, Vince set a new world record ‚Äî 4,011 ‚Äî for ‚ÄúTexas Skips‚Äù. *Flores LaDue (1883-1951) was the only cowgirl to claim three world championships for trick and fancy roping; Flores remained undefeated in the event. Flores and her husband, Guy Weadick, also a trick roper, organized and produced the first Calgary Stampede. Flores Ladue is reputed to have been the first trick roper to perform the Texas Skip. *Horse trainer Buck Brannaman began his career in a child trick roping act with his brother.

Some SLR lenses themselves offer control over things such as aperture, reducing the need for mode support in the camera body. Location of the dial On most dSLRs and SLR-like bridge cameras, the mode dial is located at the top of the camera, to one side of the flash/viewfinder hump. On point-and-shoot cameras, however, the mode dial's location is less standard. On many models, it is found on top like dSLRs. On other point-and-shoots, particularly those with a thin body, the dial is found on the back of the camera, often coupled with a menu-navigation button. Some thin cameras use a slide switch rather than a dial. Modes Various camera types and specific cameras have different modes. The simpler dial in the top illustration has: * Manual modes: Manual (M), Program (P), Shutter priority (S), Aperture priority (A). * Automatic modes: Auto, Action, Portrait, Night portrait, Landscape, Macro. Most dSLRs have a few manual settings and a small sample of automatic modes. Most SLR-like cameras have manual modes and several automatic scene modes. On point-and-shoot cameras, all manual control may be condensed into one mode (e.g. ASP, for Aperture priority, Shutter priority, Program) or may be completely absent. Many compact cameras show a large array of scene modes. Point-and-shoot and SLR-like digital cameras usually have a movie mode to capture videos, and many modern dSLRs also support movie modes. Detailed information found by users on the modes supported by digital cameras are to be found in the ongoing list of digital camera modes. =Manual modes= Manual modes include: * P: Program mode offers the photographer partial control over shutter speed and aperture. * A or Av: Aperture priority AKA \\"Aperture value\\" allows the photographer to control the aperture, while the shutter speed and ISO sensitivity are calculated by the camera. * S or Tv: Shutter priority AKA \\"Time value\\" allows the photographer to control the shutter speed, while the aperture and ISO sensitivity are calculated by the camera. * Sv: Sensitivity value allows the photographer to control the ISO sensitivity, while aperture and shutter speed are calculated by the camera (this is a Pentax DSLR feature) * M: Manual mode allows the photographer to control shutter speed, aperture and ISO independently. * U: User mode (like program with preset) =Automatic scene modes= In automatic modes the camera determines all aspects of exposure, choosing exposure parameters according to the application within the constraints of correct exposure, including exposure, aperture, focussing, light metering, white balance, and equivalent sensitivity. For example in portrait mode the camera would use a wider aperture to render the background out of focus, and would seek out and focus on a human face rather than other image content. In the same light conditions a smaller aperture would be used for a landscape, and recognition of faces would not be enabled for focussing. Some cameras have tens of modes, showing the majority only in the menu rather than on the dial. Many cameras do not document exactly what their many modes do; for full mastery of the camera one must experiment with them. In general: * Action or sport mode increases ISO and uses a fast shutter speed to capture action. * Landscape mode uses a small aperture to gain depth of field. * Portrait mode widens the aperture to throw the background out of focus. The camera may recognise and focus on a human face. * Night portrait mode uses an exposure long enough to capture background detail, with fill-in flash to illuminate a nearby subject. Other scene modes found on many cameras include Fireworks, Snow, Natural light/Night snapshot, Macro/Close-up, and Movie mode.

Video decoders commonly allow programmable control over video characteristics such as hue, contrast, and saturation. A video decoder performs the inverse function of a video encoder, which converts raw (uncompressed) digital video to analog video. Video decoders are commonly used in video capture devices and frame grabbers. Signals The input signal to a video decoder is analog video that conforms to a standard format. For example, a standard definition (SD) decoder accepts (composite or S-Video) that conforms to SD formats such as NTSC or PAL. High definition (HD) decoders accept analog HD formats such as AHD, HD- TVI, or HD-CVI. The output digital video may be formatted in various ways, such as 8-bit or 16-bit 4:2:2, 12-bit 4:1:1, BT.656 (SD) or BT.1120 (HD). Usually, in addition to the digital video output bus, a video decoder will also generate a clock signal and other signals such as: * Sync ‚Äî indicates the beginning of a video frame * Blanking ‚Äî indicates video blanking interval * Field ‚Äî indicates whether the current video field is even or odd (applies to interlaced formats) * Lock ‚Äî indicates the decoder has detected and is locked (synchronized) to a valid analog input video signal Functional blocks The main functional blocks of a video decoder typically include these: * Analog processors * Y/C (luminance/chrominance) separation * Chrominance processor * Luminance processor * Clock/timing processor * A/D converters for Y/C * Output formatter * Host communication interface Process Video decoding involves several processing steps. First the analog signal is digitized by an analog- to-digital converter to produce a raw, digital data stream. In the case of composite video, the luminance and chrominance are then separated; this is not necessary for S-Video sources. Next, the chrominance is demodulated to produce color difference video data. At this point, the data may be modified so as to adjust brightness, contrast, saturation and hue. Finally, the data is transformed by a color space converter to generate data in conformance with any of several color space standards, such as RGB and YCbCr. Together, these steps constitute video decoding because they \\"decode\\" an analog video format such as NTSC or PAL.

It is set in Three Oaks, Michigan, where town exteriors were filmed. Filming also occurred at the Old Republic House in New Carlisle, Indiana, La Porte, Indiana, and at Starved Rock State Park in Utica, Illinois. The film was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, Prancer Returns, released by USA Home Entertainment in 2001. Plot Eight-year-old Jessica Riggs is raised by her older brother, Steve, and widowed father, John. Their apple farm has fallen on hard times. John is temporarily being helped by his sister-in-law, Sarah. While walking home after a school Christmas pageant, Jessica witnesses a plastic reindeer fall from a Christmas decoration being hung above the main street in town. She concludes that it was Prancer from the order given in the poem \\"A Visit from St. Nicholas\\" (a.k.a. \\"The Night Before Christmas\\"). Afraid he will be unable to provide for Jessica, John discusses a plan for Sarah to take her in to raise temporarily. She overhears this, but initially does not know the full details. She and her best friend, Carol, go sledding and knock down some flowers at a house owned by a reclusive widow, Mrs. McFarland. While walking home, Jessica encounters a live reindeer in the woods. It runs away, disappearing into the darkness. Later, while walking home from school, she finds reindeer tracks and follows them into the woods once more. She hears a gunshot, and continues to walk. John eventually finds her, but almost hits the reindeer who is now standing in the road. Noticing it is wounded, he grabs his rifle, intending to shoot it. As Jessica pleads for him not to do so, it disappears. Later while dreaming of Prancer, Jessica is startled awake by the scene of the plastic reindeer falling from earlier. She hears a noise and sees the window to the barn outside is open. Investigating, she finds the reindeer is now inside among the other animals. Afraid John will find him, she moves him to a shed. Certain that he is the \\"real\\" Prancer, she takes it upon herself to nurse him back to health. She calls a veterinarian who initially refuses, but comes over to find him. Jessica later tells a mall Santa that she has Prancer, and gives him a Polaroid picture along with a letter to give to the real Santa before Christmas Eve. He takes them to the editor of the local newspaper. Eventually, Jessica apologizes to Mrs. McFarland, and asks her if she can have a job to help pay for oats for the reindeer. Mrs. McFarland agrees to pay her if she cleans a room in the house, and they become friends. The newspaper editor, inspired by Jessica's faith, writes an article which is then read by the local pastor in the middle of his sermon, which makes Jessica find out that she has been outed to the entire town. She becomes mad at Carol, who she thinks squealed. She then terminates her friendship with Carol, and later finds the article in the paper. John, meanwhile, is reading the paper. Before he finds the article, he discovers Prancer has let all the other animals out of the barn. While he tries to round them up, Prancer goes inside the house and wrecks it. Townspeople begin to converge on the farm, wanting to see him. John grabs his rifle, threatening to shoot him when a local butcher stops him, offering to buy Prancer. Jessica, afraid the butcher will kill him, runs away in the night determined to rescue him. The butcher keeps him as a sales tool for his Christmas tree lot. Steve runs after her, telling her that he loves her even though they fight. She attempts to open Prancer's cage but falls, injuring her head. Jessica stays in her bedroom, becoming despondent. John goes to her and she asks him to read a passage from \\"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\\". He tells her that times may continue to be hard for a long time but while he could bear losing the farm, he will not lose her. He changes his mind about sending her away. He suggests they take Prancer to Antler Ridge, which would be the perfect place for Santa to pick him up. The townspeople gather outside her window and begin singing to cheer her up. Prancer is taken to Antler Ridge where he runs out of sight. Following his tracks, John and Jessica notice that they vanish at the edge of a cliff. The faint sound of sleigh bells can be heard, and a streak of light is seen rising to meet Santa's sleigh. Jessica bids Prancer farewell, and to always remember her. The sleigh flies across the full moon and over the town towards the Riggs farm‚Äîits very first stop.

The critical consensus reads, \\"Prancer's good-natured holiday cheer -- and a terrific performance from its young star -- are enough to make this yuletide adventure a moderately rewarding watch\\". The film's young lead actress, Rebecca Harrell, garnered a nomination for a Young Artist Award for Best Young Actress Starring in a Motion Picture for her performance, but lost to Winona Ryder for her role in Great Balls of Fire!. Movie critic Roger Ebert highlighted Harrell's performance, saying: > And what really redeems the movie, taking it out of the category of kiddie > picture and giving it a heart and gumption, is the performance by a young > actress named Rebecca Harrell, as Jessica. She's something. She has a > troublemaker's look in her eye, and a round, pixie face that's filled with > mischief. And she's smart -- a plucky schemer who figures out things for > herself and isn't afraid to act on her convictions. =Home media= The film was released on DVD by MGM Home Video with several re-packagings in 2003 and 2004, and a newer release on October 7, 2014.

History All the abbey's documents were destroyed in the fire of 840, leaving its foundation and earlier history obscure. It seems likely that it began as a foundation of Dagobert I for monks under the Rule of Saint Columbanus. It was certainly in existence by 780 under Fleido as abbot, later Bishop of Speyer. In 840 the monastery burnt down and the request of the monks for funds for its re-building, addressed to Otkar, Archbishop of Mainz, previously abbot of Klingenm√ºnster, constitutes the first direct documentary evidence. It was an Imperial abbey by the time of Hatto I, in the 9th century.It is not clear however whether Hatto was in office before or after the fire of 840 In the 11th century a monk of Klingenm√ºnster, Gottschalk, brought the abbey to prominence by his appointment as notary to Emperor Henry IV in the Imperial chancery between 1071 and 1084. In the 12th century Abbot Stephan (in office from 1094 to 1114), originally from Ebersheim Abbey and also abbot of Weissenburg, Selz and Limburg Abbeys before in addition becoming abbot of Klingenm√ºnster, significantly increased the abbey's possessions by attracting donations and grants of land and by advantageous land purchases, which in turn increased the abbey's standing and influence. In 1115 Adalbert, Count of Saarbr√ºcken and Archbishop of Mainz, freed the abbey of all royal, episcopal and advocatial services and impositions. This seems however to have been with a view to removing obstacles to the easy advancement of Adalbert's own kindred within the abbey. By the beginning of the 13th century most of its territories and possessions had been transferred into the hands of his relatives, the Counts of Leiningen and Zweibr√ºcken. In 1223 Pope Honorius III placed the abbey under direct papal protection, but its position was irretrievably lost. It now served as a place of accommodation for the younger sons of the local nobility, and by the latter half of the 15th century had lost any semblance of discipline or adherence to any Rule. Repeated warnings from various bishops failed to bring about the necessary reforms or halt the decline. By 1490 the community contained only four members and on 18 November 1490 Pope Innocent VIII ordered its conversion into a secular collegiate foundation (Stift). The last abbot, Eucharius von Weingarten, became the first prior. It suffered considerable loss in the time of Johann, the third prior (from 1499 to 1506) from a Bavarian feud and the Landshut War of Succession, and in order to stave off financial ruin much of its remaining property had to be mortgaged. Despite an Imperial writ of protection, the Stift was sacked in the German Peasants' War of 1525 by the peasantry of Pleisweiler and Oberhofen. Finally, when the Reformation was introduced into the Electorate of the Palatinate between 1565 and 1567, Klingenm√ºnster was secularised and its few remaining assets transferred to the Elector. The premises were demolished except for the church, which remains as the parish church of St. Michael and was re-modelled in the 18th century in the Baroque style.

The publication is entirely student-run and funded mostly through its own advertising revenue. It has published continuously since 1909, and its current circulation is about 4,500. The Index publishes about 14 issues per academic term for a total of 28 per year, on Thursdays, and does not publish when classes are not in session. An issue usually includes 20 pages. Membership Staff members of the Index attend conferences sponsored by the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) and College Media Advisers, Inc. and many belong to the Truman chapter of SPJ. Recognition The Index has won regional and national awards through SPJ and CMA, including the nationwide Apple Award by College Media Advisers in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009 in its category of best non-daily broadsheet newspaper and national Best in Show award, given by the CMA, in 2006. Truman Today The Index has been named a Pacemaker finalist, one of the most prestigious honors bestowed on collegiate media, by the Associated Collegiate Press seven of the last 10 years, in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005. ACP - Contests 2007's finalists will be announced in the fall. Individual staff members claimed 26 awards at the Missouri CMA conference in April 2007, which earned the Index the sweepstakes award, and 10 Mark of Excellence awards at the regional SPJ conference, also in April. Society of Professional Journalists: SPJ News Competition Although the Index is published in the same micropolitan area as the Kirksville Daily Express and they are therefore in nominal competition, the two newspapers often feature different content and focus. The Daily Express is published six times per week, its staff is smaller and it relies on wire content. The Daily Express also publishes stories relating to high school sports and other local events, while the Index tends to focus on events that relate to the University community. Quality standards The Index follows AP style and has developed its own Index stylebook so that references to campus and community events, places and traditions are standardized. Its staff is highly trained and expected to maintain the ethical standards of any professional media outlet. The online version of The Index is hosted by College Publisher. In addition to viewing each week's stories and accessing an archive, readers can check for updates for breaking news.

With the outbreak of the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the company ceased to exist in 1992. The studio was completely destroyed along with all master recordings Background Company History  Diskoton the record company was formally established in 1972 in Sarajevo at the instigation of Asim Haveriƒá, then an employee of Beograd Disk, later to become Jugodisk, a record label. He persuaded Jovo Beatoviƒá, manager of the city public utility company Park in Sarajevo, to organize a record production company within his enterprise. Record production began in 1973 and Diskoton operated as a subsidiary of Park until 1977 when it became independent. Diskoton premises were located in Pionirska dolina, a popular city park and zoo maintained by Park company. The label acquired its name through a public call advertized by a popular magazine Ven, opting to pick a name suggested by young musician Brano Likiƒá, later the founder and leader of the band Rezonansa. Diskoton label on Ansambl Branka Milenoviƒáa vinyl record. Diskoton's first equipment were French-made automatic press machines Materiel Applications Plastiques (MAP) for 7‚Äù record manufacturing. In the earliest months of operation, due to unskilled staff, a large quantity of PVC was wasted because the machines turned out defected records, which were then trashed. Diskoton could manufacture only singles and EP records until the late 1975, when they acquired the equipment for manufacturing LP records as well as cassettes. Starting from 1980 Diskoton began occasionally using the service pressing of Jugoton pressing plant, while it became almost entirely dependent on the service pressing of PGP RTB pressing plant by the late 1980s. The most prominent A&R; executives of Diskoton were Vajo Milo≈°eviƒá and Slobodan Vujoviƒá, the latter being formerly the leader of the band Ambasadori. With the outbreak of the Bosnian War, the company ceased to exist in 1992. The studio was completely destroyed along with all master recordings, meaning that most albums are unavailable in master quality (apart from the few that were released in the short time that Diskoton were producing CDs before its literal collapse). Artists Diskoton is notable for signing numerous eminent former Yugoslav pop and rock, as well as folk acts.

It is in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester, 2 miles (3.2 km) north-east of Frodsham. According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, it had a population of 495 and a total land area of 3,198 sq metres (m2) (thousands). The village has 206 Households with some of the main industries of the village being Wholesale and Retail Trade, Human Health and Social Work Activities and Manufacturing; These three sectors alone account for 36.5% of Occupational Share. In the 1870s, Sutton Weaver was described as: :\\"SUTTON, a township in Runcorn parish, Cheshire; at Runcorn-Road r. station, 2 miles NE of Frodsham. It has a post-office under Preston-Brook. Acres, 1,181. Real property, ¬£2,719. Pop., 356. Houses, 63. The manor belongs to the representatives of the late Sir A. J. Aston.\\" ‚Äì John Marius Wilson (1870‚Äì72) Population Sutton Weaver Time Series 1881‚Äì2011 The first recorded census had occurred in 1881 with the population of Sutton Weaver being 337. A census was then carried out every ten years up until 1961. Information and statistics were available on total population, population change, gender and area throughout the time the census were being carried out. However, there were no records for the census in 1941 due to the Second World War. There is no great change in population from 1881 to 1931, after which time 1951 and 1961 there was a large increase in the population up to a total of 733, almost double the first record in 1881. Some of this may have been from the result of the post‚ÄìWorld War II baby boom (1946‚Äì1964). When the census starts up again in 2001, the population is back down to 457, which was around the same 80 years before. This is mainly due to the boundary changes in the Parish. Transport Within Sutton Weaver lie a total of 340 vehicles; with 54.4% of its population accounting for 2 Cars or Vans in each household, 12 households do not own a car or van. There is one bus (X30) that runs through the parish Monday to Saturday and a further three others skirting Sutton Weaver.

Sutton Weaver Swing Bridge from the east The Sutton Weaver Swing Bridge is situated on the A56 between the village of Sutton Weaver and the town of Frodsham. The present bridge was constructed in 1926 and is a vital transport link across the River Weaver. The 90-year-old structure which carries an estimated 20,000 vehicles per day has been granted the go ahead for ¬£4.5m upgrade. Cheshire West And Chester Council (CWAC) is expected to pay the ¬£3.5m with British Waterways to foot the remaining ¬£1m. Work is estimated to take 10 months. It will remain open to pedestrians but the road will reduce to a single lane controlled by traffic lights. Although it used to have its own railway station which opened on the 1 April 1869 and was situated on the east side of Station Road near to the railway bridge. The station closed to passengers in 1931 and completely closed in 1942. The nearest train station to Sutton Weaver is Runcorn East railway station, which is located 2.1 miles North-East.

He was the son of notable Presbyterian lay leader Thomas Brash, and the father of National party opposition leader and Governor of the Reserve Bank, Don Brash. Early years Alan Anderson Brash was born in Wellington on 5 June 1913, the fourth child of Thomas Cuddie Brash and Margaret Henrietta Brash (n√©e Allan). His father Thomas was a leading figure in New Zealand's dairy industry and one of only four lay Moderators of the General Assembly in the history of the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand.Minutes of the General Assembly 2002: Session 2 , Monday, 23 September 2002 Education Brash was raised in Miramar in Wellington, and raised in the Presbyterian Church under the teaching of Rev. James Gibb and Dr. John Allan.NZine: Interview With The Very Reverend Dr. Alan Brash, 23 July 1999 Brash underwent primary and secondary education in Wellington, before completing a MA in philosophy at the University of Otago. He then went to New College, Edinburgh, to study theology. While in the UK he represented the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand at the 1937 Faith and Order Conference in Edinburgh and the Life and Work conference in Oxford. Also in attendance was his future wife, Eljean Hill. These conferences became the springboard for the worldwide ecumenical movement and the platform for the World Council of Churches, and as a result Brash became a strong supporter of both. Parish ministry and family Brash returned to New Zealand in 1938, and was appointed minister of St. Andrews parish in Wanganui. While in Wanganui he married Eljean Hill, and they had two children; Donald and Lynette. They also adopted an orphan boy from Edinburgh when the orphanage was closed by the war, and for a year they housed a refugee from Europe. Ecumenism Brash's pacifist convictions made his ministerial duties difficult during the war years following his appointment. However his vision and leadership skills were quickly recognised, and in 1947 he was appointed General Secretary of the National Council of Churches in NZ, a position he held until 1964. From 1952 to 1956 he carried out these duties alongside a position in parish ministry at St Giles, Christchurch. However his zeal for the ecumenical movement led to his being appointed one of three professional staff members of the East Asian Christian Conference (now the Christian Conference of Asia) in 1957, and in 1964 he and his wife Eljean moved to Singapore to work full-time with the EACC. In this role he visited every country in Asia, apart from China, and did much to raise the profile of Asia within the church in New Zealand, and within the country generally, and for this he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1962 New Year Honours. In 1968, he moved to London where he was appointed Director of Christian Aid for the British Council of Churches. Then in 1970 he moved to Geneva to work as head of the World Council of Churches Division on Inter-Church Aid, Refugee, and World Service. In 1974 he was appointed Deputy General Secretary of the World Council of Churches. In 1978 Brash retired from the World Council of Churches, and he and Eljean returned to New Zealand where Alan was elected to be Moderator of the General Assembly for a year. Later years Through the 1980s Brash worked half time at the Auckland branch office of the National Council of Churches, continued to preach regularly, and was actively involved in the Mairangi Bay parish. In the early 1980s Brash was prominent in protests against Waitangi Day celebrations, which he felt ignored the many breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi.Ecumenical Coalition for Justice website: http://www.socialjustice.org.nz/?sid=14&id;=30 Eljean died in 1991, and Alan moved to Christchurch to live next door to his daughter Lynette. Death and legacy Alan Brash died on 24 August 2002. The Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa summed up the life of The Very Rev Alan Anderson Brash as follows: A concern for justice for all people; a conviction that the Church should never forget that it is called to serve the poor of the world; an unwavering commitment to pacifism and the search for peace; and a life-long commitment to ecumenism and the unity of the Church were the hallmarks of Alan Brash's life. He saw these as challenges that should confront all who confess to follow Jesus Christ and he was absolute and fearless in his resolve to walk in that way.

Kwong was elected chairperson of the Anglican Consultative Council on 15 April 2016 during the Lambeth Conference, succeeding James Tengatenga, then Bishop of Southern Malawi. Prior to this appointment, he has served as the ACC Standing Committee since 2012. He was also awarded Dean's Cross for Servant Leadership in Church and Society Award by Virginia Theological Seminary on 13 November 2016, making him the first non-American to receive the honor. In 2017, he was enthroned as Episcopal Canon of St. George's Cathedral, Jerusalem. Upon Kwong's retirement in January 2021, Matthias Der, Dean of St John‚Äôs Cathedral, will succeed him as the bishop of Hong Kong Island and Andrew Chan, Bishop of Western Kowloon, will succeed as Archbishop of Hong Kong.  Political views  Paul Kwong has been known for his staunch pro-Beijing stance in Hong Kong. During an interview with the reporters of Echo, official newspaper published by the Province, Kwong stated that a universal suffrage would not be \\"panacea\\", numerous social issues in Hong Kong would still exist even after its implementation. He also voiced objection to civil disobedience as a means to strive for democracy in Hong Kong and expressed his reservations about the Occupy Central movement in the same interview.  Controversy  = Pro- Beijing homily = In a homily he gave to the faithful in St. Paul's Church on 6 July 2014, Paul Kwong ridiculed the 511 protesters who were arrested during a sit-in protest following the annual July 1 rally, suggesting they should \\"bring along their Filipino maids to the march\\". He also criticized their lack of critical thinking ability and expressed his perplexity over why some Hong Kong people \\"have to speak up so much\\" in that homily. Kwong then quoted several verses in Book of Isaiah to support his claim that Jesus remained silent in the face of crucifixion, saying, \\"Jesus remained silent in the face of Pilate. He was like a lamb awaiting slaughter.\\" He further added, \\"[s]ometimes we don't have to say anything. Silence is better than saying anything.\\" Kwong also condemned some lawmakers for being \\"irrational and violent\\" when expressing opinion in meetings of the Legislative Council, saying, \\"I don't think he would act like a few councilors we have now, throwing everything around. I don't think that if Jesus was in the streets today, he would use such humiliating words to scold government officials and other people. I don't think that Jesus would express himself with such irrational violence.\\" Kwong later mentioned a church member's opposition to the government's proposed developments in northeastern New Territories, quoting the church member's assertion that Hong Kong is losing its autonomy. He rebutted the idea, expressing his disbelief that mainlanders would be \\"given all new flats\\". Kwong further added, \\"Hong Kong's autonomy is just partial autonomy, not full autonomy.\\" Kwong's comments soon sparked controversy among pan-democrats as well as church members. Wu Chi-wai, pastor from Christian and Missionary Alliance, responded that it would be \\"unfair to use Jesus to fit some personal values and orientation\\". He also challenged Kwong's claim that Jesus remained silent in contempt of crucifixion. Emily Lau, then-chairwoman of the Democratic Party, criticized him for being too cynical, expressing her disappointment that Kwong \\"had lashed out at the students\\". Chan Kin-man, co-organizer of Occupy Central movement, queried Kwong's attitude, saying, \\"[b]elievers and society expected religious leaders to speak up to manifest the value of their belief.\\"  Bibliography  * * Kwong, Paul (2013). \\"The Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui.\\" In The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to the Anglican Communion, edited by Ian S.

It is located in the northwest area of the CUHK campus, facing Tolo Harbour. History The college is named after its patron, Sir Run Run Shaw, who donated five hundred million Hong Kong dollars toward its establishment in May 1985. In the same year, the university established a task force to prepare for its establishment. The foundation of the college was enabled by the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Declaration of Shaw College) Ordinance passed by the Legislative Council in July 1986. The foundation stone was laid on 12 January 1987 in a ceremony officiated by Run Run Shaw and Acting Governor David Akers- Jones. This is considered the school anniversary, and is celebrated each year through student events. The college was officially opened in March 1990 by Run Run Shaw and Governor David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn. Facilities and activities The college has two student residences: Kuo Mou Hall and Student Hostel II. Kou Mou Hall, called Student Hostel I until it was renamed in 1998, was opened in September 1990 and comprises a ten storey high block and a three-storey low block. It provides 576 dorm spaces for both males and females. Student Hostel II opened in 1992 and was subsequently expanded. It now provides 635 living places in two blocks. The high block was named Yat Sen Hall in 2010. The college also hosts a guesthouse and one administration building including computer labs, conference rooms and a self-learning centre. Other amenities include a student canteen and an indoor sport facility (including a fitness room, squash courts and an indoor basketball facility). The school is also equipped with a standard outdoor basketball court as well as a barbecue area. The college provides a wide variety of extra-curricular activities for every student to explore. In addition, tremendous financial aids are offered each year to students with outstanding performances in either academic, social voluntary activities, or sports events. The motto, ‰øÆÂæ∑Ë¨õÂ≠∏ (Jyutping: sau1 dak1 gong2 hok6), is derived from a work of Confucius.

Her brother was married to Catherine Charlotte De la Gardie and the brother-in-law of the royal favorite Hedvig Taube.Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon Herman Hofberg et al., 1906. p. 234Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon Herman Hofberg et al., 1906. p. 492 In 1740, Eva married at the age of 16 the riksr√•d count Claes Claesson Ekeblad, and became the mother of seven children; one son and six daughters, Claes Julius Ekeblad (1742‚Äì1808) and Hedda Piper among them. Their spouses belonged to the elite of the Swedish nobility. Upon her marriage, her father, Julius De la Gardie, gave Eva the estates Mariedal Castle and Lindholmen Castle, V√§sterg√∂tland.Erdmann, Nils, Vid hovet och p√• adelsgodsen i 1700-talets Sverige: en tidskr√∂nika, Wahlstr√∂ms, Stockholm, 1926 Her husband, additionally, owned the Stola Manor estate as well as a residence in the capital of Stockholm. Because of the frequent absence of her husband on business, Eva Ekeblad was given the responsibility of the management of the three estates, including the tasks of supervising the bailiffs and presiding at the country-assemblies of the parishes of the estates.Gatunamn med historia ‚Äì Ekebladsv√§gen ‚Äì Tore Hartung, sept 2001 She is described as imposing and temperamental with great authority: fair toward the peasantry, whom she protected against abuse from the bailiffs in return for obedience, and as someone who did not hesitate to rectify and punish wrongdoings during conflicts with local dignitaries. She also had a leading role in the local aristocracy, and Stola manor was renowned for its good order. In the Ekeblad residence in Stockholm, she hosted a cultural salon and was described by the wife of the Spanish Ambassador de marquis de Puentefuerte as \\"one of few aristocratic ladies whose honor was considered untainted\\". The first concert performances of the mass music of Johan Helmich Roman were performed in her salon at the Ekeblad House.Riksarkivet Band 30 (1998‚Äì2000), p. 292 ‚Äì Johan Helmich Roman She was on friendly terms with queen Louisa Ulrika. After the death of her husband in 1771, she retired to the countryside. Mariedal and Lindholmen estates served as her dower estates, the former being her personal residence. She initially also kept control of her son's estate Stola, he being also absent from his estates like his father because of his career. In 1775, her son Claes Julius Ekeblad (1742‚Äì1808) married Brita Horn, and three years afterwards Stola manor was granted to her daughter-in-law as a dower. In November 1778, Eva Ekeblad attended the royal court by making use of her rank in her capacity as riksr√•dinna (wife or widow of a riksr√•d) and was present as a witness at the birth of the future Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. She stayed in the capital for two years, during which time she was much celebrated. She was offered to succeed Ulrika Str√∂mfelt as √∂verhovm√§starinna (chief lady-in- waiting) to the queen, as well as offered the position of royal governess for the Crown Prince. However, though she was reportedly flattered, she was forced to refuse the offers of a position at court because her hitherto good health was affected by an illness that year which left her much weakened and made her periodically bedridden for her remaining eight years. She spent her last six years in Mariedal Castle, where she continued to be celebrated by the local aristocracy until she died. =Scientific work= In 1746, Ekeblad wrote to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on her discoveries of how to make flour and alcohol out of potatoes. Potatoes had been introduced into Sweden in 1658, but had been cultivated only in the greenhouses of the aristocracy. Ekeblad's work turned potatoes into a staple food in Sweden, and increased the supply of wheat, rye and barley available for making bread, since potatoes could be used instead to make alcohol. This greatly improved the country's eating habits and reduced the frequency of famines. She also discovered a method of bleaching cotton textile and yarn with soap in 1751, and of replacing the dangerous ingredients in cosmetics of the time by using potato flour (1752); she is said to have advertised the plant by using its flowers as hair ornaments. In 1748, Eva Ekeblad became the first woman elected to Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. There are no records of her ever having participated in the meetings of the Academy. In 1751, the Academy came to refer to her as an honorary rather than a full member, as the statutes confined membership to men.

The method has been independently introduced by several parties under various names, including method of reassignment, remapping, time-frequency reassignment, and modified moving-window method. In the case of the spectrogram or the short- time Fourier transform, the method of reassignment sharpens blurry time- frequency data by relocating the data according to local estimates of instantaneous frequency and group delay. This mapping to reassigned time- frequency coordinates is very precise for signals that are separable in time and frequency with respect to the analysis window.  Introduction  thumb400px Reassigned spectral surface for the onset of an acoustic bass tone having a sharp pluck and a fundamental frequency of approximately 73.4 Hz. Sharp spectral ridges representing the harmonics are evident, as is the abrupt onset of the tone. The spectrogram was computed using a 65.7 ms Kaiser window with a shaping parameter of 12. Many signals of interest have a distribution of energy that varies in time and frequency. For example, any sound signal having a beginning or an end has an energy distribution that varies in time, and most sounds exhibit considerable variation in both time and frequency over their duration. Time-frequency representations are commonly used to analyze or characterize such signals. They map the one-dimensional time-domain signal into a two-dimensional function of time and frequency. A time-frequency representation describes the variation of spectral energy distribution over time, much as a musical score describes the variation of musical pitch over time. In audio signal analysis, the spectrogram is the most commonly used time-frequency representation, probably because it is well understood, and immune to so-called \\"cross-terms\\" that sometimes make other time-frequency representations difficult to interpret. But the windowing operation required in spectrogram computation introduces an unsavory tradeoff between time resolution and frequency resolution, so spectrograms provide a time-frequency representation that is blurred in time, in frequency, or in both dimensions. The method of time-frequency reassignment is a technique for refocussing time-frequency data in a blurred representation like the spectrogram by mapping the data to time-frequency coordinates that are nearer to the true region of support of the analyzed signal.  The spectrogram as a time-frequency representation  One of the best-known time-frequency representations is the spectrogram, defined as the squared magnitude of the short-time Fourier transform. Though the short-time phase spectrum is known to contain important temporal information about the signal, this information is difficult to interpret, so typically, only the short-time magnitude spectrum is considered in short-time spectral analysis. As a time-frequency representation, the spectrogram has relatively poor resolution. Time and frequency resolution are governed by the choice of analysis window and greater concentration in one domain is accompanied by greater smearing in the other. A time-frequency representation having improved resolution, relative to the spectrogram, is the Wigner-Ville distribution, which may be interpreted as a short-time Fourier transform with a window function that is perfectly matched to the signal. The Wigner-Ville distribution is highly concentrated in time and frequency, but it is also highly nonlinear and non-local. Consequently, this distribution is very sensitive to noise, and generates cross-components that often mask the components of interest, making it difficult to extract useful information concerning the distribution of energy in multi-component signals. Cohen's class of bilinear time-frequency representations is a class of \\"smoothed\\" Wigner-Ville distributions, employing a smoothing kernel that can reduce sensitivity of the distribution to noise and suppresses cross- components, at the expense of smearing the distribution in time and frequency. This smearing causes the distribution to be non-zero in regions where the true Wigner-Ville distribution shows no energy. The spectrogram is a member of Cohen's class. It is a smoothed Wigner-Ville distribution with the smoothing kernel equal to the Wigner-Ville distribution of the analysis window. The method of reassignment smooths the Wigner-Ville distribution, but then refocuses the distribution back to the true regions of support of the signal components. The method has been shown to reduce time and frequency smearing of any member of Cohen's class .P. Flandrin, F. Auger, and E. Chassande-Mottin, Time-frequency reassignment: From principles to algorithms, in Applications in Time-Frequency Signal Processing (A. Papandreou-Suppappola, ed.), ch. 5, pp. 179 ‚Äì 203, CRC Press, 2003. In the case of the reassigned spectrogram, the short-time phase spectrum is used to correct the nominal time and frequency coordinates of the spectral data, and map it back nearer to the true regions of support of the analyzed signal.  The method of reassignment  Pioneering work on the method of reassignment was published by Kodera, Gendrin, and de Villedary under the name of Modified Moving Window Method Their technique enhances the resolution in time and frequency of the classical Moving Window Method (equivalent to the spectrogram) by assigning to each data point a new time-frequency coordinate that better-reflects the distribution of energy in the analyzed signal. In the classical moving window method, a time-domain signal, x(t) is decomposed into a set of coefficients, \\\\epsilon( t, \\\\omega ), based on a set of elementary signals, h_{\\\\omega}(t), defined :h_{\\\\omega}(t) = h(t) e^{j \\\\omega t} where h(t) is a (real-valued) lowpass kernel function, like the window function in the short-time Fourier transform. The coefficients in this decomposition are defined :\\\\begin{align} \\\\epsilon( t, \\\\omega ) &= \\\\int x(\\\\tau) h( t - \\\\tau ) e^{ -j \\\\omega \\\\left[ \\\\tau - t \\\\right]} d\\\\tau  &= e^{ j \\\\omega t} \\\\int x(\\\\tau) h( t - \\\\tau ) e^{ -j \\\\omega \\\\tau } d\\\\tau  &= e^{ j \\\\omega t} X(t, \\\\omega)  &= X_{t}(\\\\omega)  &= M_{t}(\\\\omega) e^{j \\\\phi_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega)} \\\\end{align} where M_{t}(\\\\omega) is the magnitude, and \\\\phi_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega) the phase, of X_{t}(\\\\omega), the Fourier transform of the signal x(t) shifted in time by t and windowed by h(t). x(t) can be reconstructed from the moving window coefficients by :\\\\begin{align} x(t) & = \\\\iint X_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega) h^{*}_{\\\\omega}(\\\\tau - t) d\\\\omega d\\\\tau  & = \\\\iint X_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega) h( \\\\tau - t ) e^{ -j \\\\omega \\\\left[ \\\\tau - t \\\\right]} d\\\\omega d\\\\tau  &= \\\\iint M_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega) e^{j \\\\phi_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega)} h( \\\\tau - t ) e^{ -j \\\\omega \\\\left[ \\\\tau - t \\\\right]} d\\\\omega d\\\\tau  &= \\\\iint M_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega) h( \\\\tau - t ) e^{ j \\\\left[ \\\\phi_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega) - \\\\omega \\\\tau+ \\\\omega t \\\\right] } d\\\\omega d\\\\tau \\\\end{align} For signals having magnitude spectra, M(t,\\\\omega), whose time variation is slow relative to the phase variation, the maximum contribution to the reconstruction integral comes from the vicinity of the point t,\\\\omega satisfying the phase stationarity condition :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\omega} \\\\left[ \\\\phi_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega) - \\\\omega \\\\tau + \\\\omega t\\\\right] & = 0  \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\left[ \\\\phi_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega) - \\\\omega \\\\tau + \\\\omega t \\\\right] & = 0 \\\\end{align} or equivalently, around the point \\\\hat{t}, \\\\hat{\\\\omega} defined by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{t}(\\\\tau, \\\\omega) & = \\\\tau - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega)}{\\\\partial \\\\omega} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi(\\\\tau, \\\\omega)}{\\\\partial \\\\omega}  \\\\hat{\\\\omega}(\\\\tau, \\\\omega) & = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi_{\\\\tau}(\\\\omega)}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} = \\\\omega + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi(\\\\tau, \\\\omega)}{\\\\partial \\\\tau} \\\\end{align} This phenomenon is known in such fields as optics as the principle of stationary phase, which states that for periodic or quasi-periodic signals, the variation of the Fourier phase spectrum not attributable to periodic oscillation is slow with respect to time in the vicinity of the frequency of oscillation, and in surrounding regions the variation is relatively rapid. Analogously, for impulsive signals, that are concentrated in time, the variation of the phase spectrum is slow with respect to frequency near the time of the impulse, and in surrounding regions the variation is relatively rapid. In reconstruction, positive and negative contributions to the synthesized waveform cancel, due to destructive interference, in frequency regions of rapid phase variation. Only regions of slow phase variation (stationary phase) will contribute significantly to the reconstruction, and the maximum contribution (center of gravity) occurs at the point where the phase is changing most slowly with respect to time and frequency. The time- frequency coordinates thus computed are equal to the local group delay, \\\\hat{t}_{g}(t,\\\\omega), and local instantaneous frequency, \\\\hat{\\\\omega}_{i}(t,\\\\omega), and are computed from the phase of the short-time Fourier transform, which is normally ignored when constructing the spectrogram. These quantities are local in the sense that they represent a windowed and filtered signal that is localized in time and frequency, and are not global properties of the signal under analysis. The modified moving window method, or method of reassignment, changes (reassigns) the point of attribution of \\\\epsilon(t,\\\\omega) to this point of maximum contribution \\\\hat{t}(t,\\\\omega), \\\\hat{\\\\omega}(t,\\\\omega), rather than to the point t,\\\\omega at which it is computed. This point is sometimes called the center of gravity of the distribution, by way of analogy to a mass distribution. This analogy is a useful reminder that the attribution of spectral energy to the center of gravity of its distribution only makes sense when there is energy to attribute, so the method of reassignment has no meaning at points where the spectrogram is zero-valued.  Efficient computation of reassigned times and frequencies  In digital signal processing, it is most common to sample the time and frequency domains. The discrete Fourier transform is used to compute samples X(k) of the Fourier transform from samples x(n) of a time domain signal. The reassignment operations proposed by Kodera et al. cannot be applied directly to the discrete short-time Fourier transform data, because partial derivatives cannot be computed directly on data that is discrete in time and frequency, and it has been suggested that this difficulty has been the primary barrier to wider use of the method of reassignment. It is possible to approximate the partial derivatives using finite differences. For example, the phase spectrum can be evaluated at two nearby times, and the partial derivative with respect to time be approximated as the difference between the two values divided by the time difference, as in :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi(t, \\\\omega)}{\\\\partial t} & \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta t} \\\\left[ \\\\phi \\\\left (t + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}, \\\\omega \\\\right ) - \\\\phi \\\\left (t - \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}, \\\\omega \\\\right ) \\\\right]  \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi(t, \\\\omega)}{\\\\partial \\\\omega} & \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta \\\\omega}\\\\left[ \\\\phi \\\\left (t, \\\\omega+ \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\omega}{2} \\\\right ) - \\\\phi \\\\left (t, \\\\omega-\\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\omega}{2} \\\\right ) \\\\right] \\\\end{align} For sufficiently small values of \\\\Delta t and \\\\Delta \\\\omega, and provided that the phase difference is appropriately \\"unwrapped\\", this finite-difference method yields good approximations to the partial derivatives of phase, because in regions of the spectrum in which the evolution of the phase is dominated by rotation due to sinusoidal oscillation of a single, nearby component, the phase is a linear function. Independently of Kodera et al., Nelson arrived at a similar method for improving the time- frequency precision of short-time spectral data from partial derivatives of the short-time phase spectrum. It is easily shown that Nelson's cross spectral surfaces compute an approximation of the derivatives that is equivalent to the finite differences method. Auger and Flandrin showed that the method of reassignment, proposed in the context of the spectrogram by Kodera et al., could be extended to any member of Cohen's class of time-frequency representations by generalizing the reassignment operations to :\\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{t} (t,\\\\omega) &= t - \\\\frac{\\\\iint \\\\tau \\\\cdot W_{x}(t-\\\\tau,\\\\omega - u) \\\\cdot \\\\Phi(\\\\tau, u) d\\\\tau d u} {\\\\iint W_{x} \\\\left (t-\\\\tau,\\\\omega - u \\\\right ) \\\\cdot \\\\Phi (\\\\tau, u) d\\\\tau d u }  \\\\hat{\\\\omega} (t,\\\\omega) & = \\\\omega - \\\\frac{\\\\iint u \\\\cdot W_{x}(t-\\\\tau,\\\\omega - u) \\\\cdot \\\\Phi(\\\\tau, u) d\\\\tau d u} {\\\\iint W_{x}(t-\\\\tau,\\\\omega - u) \\\\cdot \\\\Phi(\\\\tau, u) d\\\\tau d u} \\\\end{align} where W_{x}(t,\\\\omega) is the Wigner-Ville distribution of x(t), and \\\\Phi(t,\\\\omega) is the kernel function that defines the distribution. They further described an efficient method for computing the times and frequencies for the reassigned spectrogram efficiently and accurately without explicitly computing the partial derivatives of phase. In the case of the spectrogram, the reassignment operations can be computed by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{t} (t,\\\\omega) & = t - \\\\Re \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{ X_{\\\\mathcal{T}h}(t,\\\\omega) \\\\cdot X^*(t,\\\\omega) }{  X(t,\\\\omega) ^2 } \\\\right \\\\\\\\}  \\\\hat{\\\\omega}(t,\\\\omega) & = \\\\omega + \\\\Im \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{ X_{\\\\mathcal{D}h}(t,\\\\omega) \\\\cdot X^*(t,\\\\omega) }{  X(t,\\\\omega) ^2 } \\\\right \\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} where X(t,\\\\omega) is the short- time Fourier transform computed using an analysis window h(t), X_{\\\\mathcal{T}h}(t,\\\\omega) is the short-time Fourier transform computed using a time-weighted analysis window h_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(t) = t \\\\cdot h(t) and X_{\\\\mathcal{D}h}(t,\\\\omega) is the short-time Fourier transform computed using a time-derivative analysis window h_{\\\\mathcal{D}}(t) = \\\\tfrac{d}{dt}h(t). Using the auxiliary window functions h_{\\\\mathcal{T}}(t) and h_{\\\\mathcal{D}}(t), the reassignment operations can be computed at any time- frequency coordinate t,\\\\omega from an algebraic combination of three Fourier transforms evaluated at t,\\\\omega. Since these algorithms operate only on short-time spectral data evaluated at a single time and frequency, and do not explicitly compute any derivatives, this gives an efficient method of computing the reassigned discrete short-time Fourier transform. One constraint in this method of computation is that the  X(t,\\\\omega) ^2 must be non-zero. This is not much of a restriction, since the reassignment operation itself implies that there is some energy to reassign, and has no meaning when the distribution is zero-valued. Separability The short-time Fourier transform can often be used to estimate the amplitudes and phases of the individual components in a multi-component signal, such as a quasi-harmonic musical instrument tone. Moreover, the time and frequency reassignment operations can be used to sharpen the representation by attributing the spectral energy reported by the short-time Fourier transform to the point that is the local center of gravity of the complex energy distribution. For a signal consisting of a single component, the instantaneous frequency can be estimated from the partial derivatives of phase of any short-time Fourier transform channel that passes the component. If the signal is to be decomposed into many components, :x(t) = \\\\sum_{n} A_{n}(t) e^{j \\\\theta_{n}(t)} and the instantaneous frequency of each component is defined as the derivative of its phase with respect to time, that is, :\\\\omega_{n}(t) = \\\\frac{d \\\\theta_{n}(t)}{d t}, then the instantaneous frequency of each individual component can be computed from the phase of the response of a filter that passes that component, provided that no more than one component lies in the passband of the filter. This is the property, in the frequency domain, that Nelson called separability and is required of all signals so analyzed. If this property is not met, then the desired multi-component decomposition cannot be achieved, because the parameters of individual components cannot be estimated from the short-time Fourier transform. In such cases, a different analysis window must be chosen so that the separability criterion is satisfied. If the components of a signal are separable in frequency with respect to a particular short-time spectral analysis window, then the output of each short-time Fourier transform filter is a filtered version of, at most, a single dominant (having significant energy) component, and so the derivative, with respect to time, of the phase of the X(t,\\\\omega_0) is equal to the derivative with respect to time, of the phase of the dominant component at \\\\omega_0. Therefore, if a component, x_n(t), having instantaneous frequency \\\\omega_{n}(t) is the dominant component in the vicinity of \\\\omega_0, then the instantaneous frequency of that component can be computed from the phase of the short-time Fourier transform evaluated at \\\\omega_0. That is, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\omega_{n}(t) &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\arg\\\\\\\\{ x_{n}(t) \\\\\\\\}  &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial t} \\\\arg\\\\\\\\{ X(t,\\\\omega_{0}) \\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} thumb400pxLong-window reassigned spectrogram of the word \\"open\\", computed using a 54.4 ms Kaiser window with a shaping parameter of 9, emphasizing harmonics. thumb400pxShort-window reassigned spectrogram of the word \\"open\\", computed using a 13.6 ms Kaiser window with a shaping parameter of 9, emphasizing formants and glottal pulses. Just as each bandpass filter in the short-time Fourier transform filterbank may pass at most a single complex exponential component, two temporal events must be sufficiently separated in time that they do not lie in the same windowed segment of the input signal. This is the property of separability in the time domain, and is equivalent to requiring that the time between two events be greater than the length of the impulse response of the short-time Fourier transform filters, the span of non-zero samples in h(t). In general, there is an infinite number of equally valid decompositions for a multi-component signal. The separability property must be considered in the context of the desired decomposition. For example, in the analysis of a speech signal, an analysis window that is long relative to the time between glottal pulses is sufficient to separate harmonics, but the individual glottal pulses will be smeared, because many pulses are covered by each window (that is, the individual pulses are not separable, in time, by the chosen analysis window). An analysis window that is much shorter than the time between glottal pulses may resolve the glottal pulses, because no window spans more than one pulse, but the harmonic frequencies are smeared together, because the main lobe of the analysis window spectrum is wider than the spacing between the harmonics (that is, the harmonics are not separable, in frequency, by the chosen analysis window).

He also appeared in first-class cricket for The Players (1924‚Äì1928), the North of England (1928) and Sir L Parkinson's XI (1933). Born in Low Valley, Wombwell, Yorkshire, England, Kilner was a tough, professional right-handed batsman who scored 1,253 runs for Yorkshire at 18.98, with two centuries to his name. He fared better after his move to Edgbaston, scoring 16,075 runs for Warwickshire at 31.89. Overall, in 403 first-class matches, he scored 17,522 runs at 30.36, with 25 centuries and a best score of 228 at New Road, Worcester in 1935, during which he scored a hundred before lunch. A fine fielder, he took 184 catches, and one wicket for 83 runs with his eccentric bowling. He once bowled three balls of an over right-handed, and three balls of it with his left. His brother, Roy Kilner played Test cricket for England whilst his nephew, Irving Washington, also played for Yorkshire as a left-handed bat. Kilner was a familiar figure at Edgbaston after his retirement, often commenting on the match in his broad Yorkshire accent, in company with Tiger Smith. Kilner died in April 1979 in Alum Rock, Birmingham, Warwickshire, aged 83.

The school offers classes and degree programs in Public Policy and Leadership. The school, established in 2007, is closely aligned with many of the University's schools, including the architecture, business, education, engineering, law, and medicine schools, as well as with programs in politics, economics, and applied ethics. History 1860s statue of Thomas Jefferson in the Rotunda at the University of Virginia The Frank Batten School, located in Charlottesville, Virginia was established in 2007 by a $100 million gift from University of Virginia alumnus, Frank Batten. A part of the University's strategic plan, the Batten School was designed to be an expression of U.Va.'s Jeffersonian heritage. Frank Batten's vision for the school was to create an institution that \\"focused on developing leaders who understand the responsibilities and opportunities of public life and have a bias for action.\\" The school is housed at the center of the University's grounds in Garrett Hall, next to Thomas Jefferson's Rotunda and The Lawn. Harry Harding, previously the dean of the George Washington University Elliott School of International Affairs, was selected as the school's founding dean in January 2009. Garrett Hall went through a multimillion-dollar renovation while under Dean Harding. The project was completed in the summer of 2011. In May 2014, the University announced that University of Michigan professor and national security and international relations policy expert, Allan Stam, was slated to become Batten's second dean. Stam began his term July 1 of that year. Academics Teaching and research is overseen by the Academic Affairs Office, headed by Dean Christopher Ruhm. The Assistant Dean meets regularly with students and in addition each student is assigned a faculty mentor. The Batten School adheres to the University of Virginia's Honor System and enforces strict consequences for instances of lying, cheating, and stealing within the school. =Degrees= Master of Public PolicyMaster of Public Policy (MPP) Batten's core curriculum requires Master of Public Policy students to take classes in four main areas: 1) concepts and tools of problem solving and policy analysis, 2) leadership, 3) context of public policy, and 4) applied, experiential learning. Students also must take electives, complete an internship, and present an Applied Policy Project‚Äîwhere students must conduct a professional study for an outside client. Optional one-credit short classes are also offered. MPP student summer internships are offered at various consulting, federal contractor and Federal Government, state and local governments, and NGO/Nonprofit organizations in Virginia and nationally. MPP candidates must take a minimum of 12 credits and a maximum of 17 credits, permission from the Assistant Dean is required to enroll in over 17 credits. Accelerated Master of Public Policy Program The Accelerated Bachelor/Master of Public Policy Program allows current University of Virginia undergraduates to complete both a Bachelor's and their Master's degree in five years, one year earlier than the average six. Eligible students apply for the program their third year at U.Va. and must complete three Batten courses per semester their first year at the school. The core curriculum is the same as the MPP program. Dual-degree programs The Batten School offers five dual-degree programs where students may earn a degree from another graduate school at the University of Virginia and at Batten in conjunction. The school offers student several degree options. Bachelor in Public Policy The school started offering a Bachelor of Arts degree in leadership and public policy in 2012, with a focus on global and domestic policy. To complete the degree students must complete the core curriculum required by the University of Virginia as well as an additional 40 credit hours of Batten classes. =Academic honors and awards= upright The Batten School and the University of Virginia offer two annual Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant awards, given at the end of the academic year. In addition to these teaching awards, Batten also awards efforts in policy analysis. The Outstanding Applied Policy Project Award is given to an MPP student annually, honorable mentions are occasionally awarded as well. Students are also eligible for the Dean's List and commencement awards. =Centers and collaborations= Center on Education Policy and Workforce Competitiveness Founded in 2011, the Center is a collaboration between the Curry School of Education and Batten. The Center aims to draw scholars from the University of Virginia and from around the state to conduct research and data development on educational policy. The interdisciplinary Center also conducts a seminar series on educational policy. Center for Health Policy This center is the result of a collaboration between Batten and the School of Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences. It conducts research on health and the public and seeks to find better ways to address health policy issues and educate the public. The Center is open to University of Virginia faculty, as well a visiting scholars and researchers. Working Group on Leadership The Miller Center at the University of Virginia, speaker Harvie Wilkinsonupright The group brings together representatives of leadership programs from eight of the University of Virginia's eleven schools, with thirty faculty members from the politics department, the Darden School of Business, Miller Center of Public Affairs, and many others. Their goal is to identify best practices in leadership education as well as host guest speakers and forums. =Social entrepreneurship at U.Va.= The subject of social entrepreneurship is a fairly new development in public policy curriculum, in 2013 Batten Professor Christine Mahoney and two students received a grant from the Jefferson Trust to fund classes, competitions, field work, and faculty. Social Entrepreneurship @ U.Va. (SE@UVA) is a pan-university interdisciplinary program that seeks to engage students in thought about social change through entrepreneurship in non-profits, NGOs, and government institutions. With a focus on creating value for multiple parties, not just focusing on shareholders, SE @ U.Va. features numerous classes for both graduate and undergraduate students at Batten, including a startup class open to all students, regardless of major or School. The program also sponsors student competitions and hosts lecture series. It centers on developing student skills in interdisciplinary fields, along with finance, policymaking, nonprofits, and international development, and focuses on enacting those skills in real life ventures. SE @ U.Va.'s projects are located in countries across the world, including Brazil, Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia, and the Philippines. Classes are cross-listed in the Batten School, as well as in the Curry School of Education and the University of Virginia College of Arts and Sciences. It also works closely with the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Darden School of Business, and the McIntire School of Commerce. Its four guiding pillars are 1) cross-disciplinary curriculum, 2) experiential education, 3) research and scholarship, and 4) leadership development. =Public Policy MOOC= Launched in February 2015, Batten offers a class called \\"Public Policy Challenges in the 21st Century\\" on Coursera. The massive open online course (MOOC) is offered to all ages and is accessible internationally. It offers faculty lectures and covers U.S.-China relations, health policy, defense policy, and issues of federalism. The course also allows students to converse with policymakers, including senators, former congressmen, and White House press secretaries. The course operates from the view that policy is not only shaped by governmental organizations, but also by leaders in the private sector and NGOs and aims to bring together lawmakers and corporate leaders, seeking to bridge the divide and increase transparency. Student life The Rotunda at the University of Virginia The Batten School has its own thriving student life with a close connection to the University of Virginia's as well. At the start of the school year, the Leadership Retreat draws Batten students, faculty, and staff together for a retreat in the West Virginian Appalachian mountains. It features leadership and team building activities, hosts key note speakers, and culminates with a white water rafting trip. =Student groups= Students are encouraged to join a number of organizations. Both the Undergraduate and Graduate programs have a Council of student leaders, elected to run community outreach, events, professional development activities, and head external, internal, and social committees. Batten Builds is a group that brings students, faculty, and staff together to support nonprofits in the Charlottesville and Albemarle County area. Previous nonprofits the group has helped include Habitat for Humanity, the Ronald McDonald House, Albemarle Housing Improvement Program, Senior Center, Inc., and others. Batten Speaks! is a public speaking club with monthly meetings that cover networking, public speaking, and presentational skills. The Batten Umbrella Mentorship Program (BUMP) offers membership for any MPP student the semester of their admission to the school. These students receive mentorship from upperclassmen and an introduction to life at Batten. The group hosts Round-Table Discussions monthly, as well as dinners, Jeopardy!-like competitions, field days, etc. Highly involved members can also become eligible for research assistant or internship positions. Formative Change Group (FCG) Consulting is a pro-bono consulting group that lends the services of its members to non-profits in the area. It was launched in 2012 as a part of the Clinton Global Initiative commitment. The students apply their policy analysis skills to their clients' real world problems and provide the necessary knowledge and support to the organizations so they can carry out their core mission. Foreign Policy Club introduces students to issues of foreign and domestic policy with discussion meetings, guest speakers, and speaker debates. The Women in Policy Club provides a forum for members to unpack news coverage of women through a policy lens, using their background and training in the area. The Virginia Policy Review (VPR) is an independent, student run publication based out of the Batten School. Through opinion pieces, research, book reviews, and other works the group seeks to foster discussion around issues of public policy and promote the work of Batten graduate students. In addition to their bi-annual publication, VPR also hosts a blog, The Third Rail with more timely content. The Batten Latinx Network (BLN) is a student organization that aims to form a community of Latinx students at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. Through this organization, the organization hopes to welcome/recruit prospective undergraduate and graduate Latinx students, to host professional development events for prospective and current students, and to maintain relationships with Latinx alumni. https://latinxhistoryatuva.org/directory/2-batten-latinx-network https://www.facebook.com/battenlatinxnetwork/ Notable people *Malcolm Brogdon *James Childress *Marc Ferzan * Harry Harding *Frederick Hitz *Charles A.

It was chartered in 1855, received its first interment in 1857. Almost 78,000 individuals are buried at the cemetery. It contains a public mausoleum and 15 private mausoleums. The property was acquired in 1854, and the first interment took place in April 1857. The Cemetery is an active, non-sectarian burial ground, and the property contains 15 private mausoleums. The historic gatehouse, constructed in 1901, was razed in 2010. The public mausoleum, which was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Lovell & Lovell, was completed in 1929 and has been expanded twice. The cemetery once grew to over but has since retracted to its present size of 223 acres. The property includes six and a half miles of winding driveways. The cemetery is the final resting place for nearly 78,000 individuals from the Peoria area. The property is not fully developed, and as a result, the Cemetery can accommodate another 50,000 burials. The Cemetery permits traditional burial in the ground, entombment in the mausoleum, inurnment of cremated remains in crypts and in burial lots, and a scattering garden. The Cemetery is actively planning for green burial. History Interment in the cemetery began in April 1857 after the Illinois State Legislature granted the managers the authority to accept pre-payment for interment services and trust funds for perpetual care. The cemetery remained in private ownership until 1999 at which time Illinois Comptroller Dan Hynes seized control the property due to improper management and neglected maintenance. A receiver was appointed to act on behalf of the Comptroller, and in September 2002, the publicly appointed Springdale Cemetery Management Authority was established to manage the Cemetery following the signing of an intergovernmental agreement between the City of Peoria (the property owner), the County of Peoria, the Peoria Park District, and the Springdale Historic Preservation Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization. Individuals interred in the Cemetery include Octave Chanute, the father of American aviation; Lucie (Brotherson) Tyng, founder of the Women's Christian Temperance Union; Lydia (Moss) Bradley, founder of Bradley Polytechnic Institute (now Bradley University); former Illinois Governor Thomas Ford (1842-1846); American artist Hedley Waycott; Anastase Robin, a member of Napoleon's Imperial Guard; and others who are prominent in the establishment of Peoria as well as common men and women who made the city their home. Approximately 900 military veterans lie buried on the grounds (including Frank Wilbur \\"Spig\\" Wead, a U.S. Navy aviator who helped promote United States Naval aviation from its inception) in both a designated Soldiers' Hill (established in 1862) as well as in private lots. Springdale Cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district December 10, 2004. The district contains 53 properties, just three of which are classified as non-contributing members to the historic district. The contributing properties within the district include 3 buildings, one site, 17 structures and 29 objects.Property Information Report - Springdale Cemetery, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, HAARGIS Database.

It combines advantages of the short-time Fourier transform and the continuous wavelet transform. It can be expressed in terms of repeated Fourier transforms, and its discrete analogue can be computed efficiently using a fast Fourier transform algorithm.  Harmonic wavelets  The transform uses a family of \\"harmonic\\" wavelets indexed by two integers j (the \\"level\\" or \\"order\\") and k (the \\"translation\\"), given by w(2^j t - k) \\\\\\\\!, where :w(t) = \\\\frac{e^{i4\\\\pi t} - e^{i 2\\\\pi t}}{i 2\\\\pi t} . These functions are orthogonal, and their Fourier transforms are a square window function (constant in a certain octave band and zero elsewhere). In particular, they satisfy: :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty w^*(2^j t - k) \\\\cdot w(2^{j'} t - k') \\\\, dt = \\\\frac{1}{2^j} \\\\delta_{j,j'} \\\\delta_{k,k'} :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty w(2^j t - k) \\\\cdot w(2^{j'} t - k') \\\\, dt = 0 where \\"*\\" denotes complex conjugation and \\\\delta is Kronecker's delta. As the order j increases, these wavelets become more localized in Fourier space (frequency) and in higher frequency bands, and conversely become less localized in time (t). Hence, when they are used as a basis for expanding an arbitrary function, they represent behaviors of the function on different timescales (and at different time offsets for different k). However, it is possible to combine all of the negative orders (j < 0) together into a single family of \\"scaling\\" functions \\\\varphi(t - k) where :\\\\varphi(t) = \\\\frac{e^{i2\\\\pi t} - 1}{i 2\\\\pi t}. The function œÜ is orthogonal to itself for different k and is also orthogonal to the wavelet functions for non-negative j: :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\varphi^*(t - k) \\\\cdot \\\\varphi(t - k') \\\\, dt = \\\\delta_{k,k'} :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty w^*(2^j t - k) \\\\cdot \\\\varphi(t - k') \\\\, dt = 0\\\\text{ for }j \\\\geq 0 :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\varphi(t - k) \\\\cdot \\\\varphi(t - k') \\\\, dt = 0 :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty w(2^j t - k) \\\\cdot \\\\varphi(t - k') \\\\, dt = 0\\\\text{ for }j \\\\geq 0. In the harmonic wavelet transform, therefore, an arbitrary real- or complex-valued function f(t) (in L2) is expanded in the basis of the harmonic wavelets (for all integers j) and their complex conjugates: :f(t) = \\\\sum_{j=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left[ a_{j,k} w(2^j t - k) + \\\\tilde{a}_{j,k} w^*(2^j t - k)\\\\right], or alternatively in the basis of the wavelets for non-negative j supplemented by the scaling functions œÜ: :f(t) = \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left[ a_k \\\\varphi(t - k) + \\\\tilde{a}_k \\\\varphi^*(t - k) \\\\right] + \\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left[ a_{j,k} w(2^j t - k) + \\\\tilde{a}_{j,k} w^*(2^j t - k)\\\\right] . The expansion coefficients can then, in principle, be computed using the orthogonality relationships: : \\\\begin{align} a_{j,k} & {} = 2^j \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(t) \\\\cdot w^*(2^j t - k) \\\\, dt  \\\\tilde{a}_{j,k} & {} = 2^j \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(t) \\\\cdot w(2^j t - k) \\\\, dt  a_k & {} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(t) \\\\cdot \\\\varphi^*(t - k) \\\\, dt  \\\\tilde{a}_k & {} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(t) \\\\cdot \\\\varphi(t - k) \\\\, dt. \\\\end{align} For a real-valued function f(t), \\\\tilde{a}_{j,k} = a_{j,k}^* and \\\\tilde{a}_k = a_k^* so one can cut the number of independent expansion coefficients in half. This expansion has the property, analogous to Parseval's theorem, that: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\sum_{j=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty 2^{-j} \\\\left( a_{j,k}^2 + \\\\tilde{a}_{j,k}^2 \\\\right)  & {} = \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\left( a_k^2 + \\\\tilde{a}_k^2 \\\\right) + \\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty 2^{-j} \\\\left( a_{j,k}^2 + \\\\tilde{a}_{j,k}^2 \\\\right)  & {} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x)^2 \\\\, dx. \\\\end{align} Rather than computing the expansion coefficients directly from the orthogonality relationships, however, it is possible to do so using a sequence of Fourier transforms. This is much more efficient in the discrete analogue of this transform (discrete t), where it can exploit fast Fourier transform algorithms.  References  * David E.

He was the son of Charles Vintcent, a South African cricketer.  Early life  Nevill Vintcent, a South African, born in 1902, entered Osborne in 1916, proceeded to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and served in HMS Temeraire for a few months during the Great War. In 1920 he went to the Royal Air Force College Cranwell with the first course, was commissioned in the RAF in 1922, and served in Kurdistan, Transjordania, Egypt, and Iraq, where he won the DFC in unusual circumstances when he, with a brother officer, had made a forced landing in hostile country. To enable his co-pilot to fire the guns of the aeroplane and beat off the attacks of Arab horsemen, he carried the tail of the aeroplane on his shoulder, and throughout a prolonged engagement swung the aircraft into position for firing until help arrived.  Pilot  For a time he served as a pilot at the RAF Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;) at Martlesham Heath. Convinced of the great future of civil aviation, he left the RAF in 1926 and engaged in air survey work in India, Burma, the Federated Malay States and Borneo, and he flew the first air mail from Borneo to the Straits Settlements.  India  In 1928 he, with a partner, undertook one of the early long-distance pioneer flights, when they flew two de Havilland DH.9 aeroplanes from England to India. For two years he was engaged with spreading the gospel of aviation in India, and his contact with Mr. J.R.D. Tata, of Tata Sons Ltd, gave birth to Tata Airlines. Nevill Vintcent and J.R.D. Tata together pioneered the air mail service from London to the sub-continent. On 8 October 1932, an Imperial Airways aircraft flew from London to Karachi. J R D Tata, in a de Havilland Puss Moth took the mail on to Bombay, where Nevill Vintcent then took over for the leg to Madras, arriving on 16 October. The first westbound flight left Madras the following day. On 25 February 1935 Vintcent made an inaugural flight from Bombay to Nagpur to Jamshedpur and on to Calcutta with a de Havilland Fox Moth. They built one of the two air transport companies which, before the 1939-45 war, built the foundation of air transport in India, and during the war rendered invaluable assistance to the RAF in operating scheduled air transport services and in such operations as the carriage of troops to Iraq, the evacuation of women and children from Habbaniyah, and later from Burma.  Own flight  For his work in the organization of air transport in India he was made an O.B.E. in 1938. The approach of war in Europe impressed upon Vintcent and others the strategic need for an aircraft factory in India, and thereafter to that end his mind and activities were more and more concentrated. In 1940, simultaneously with the Government of India's decision to establish the Hindustan aircraft factory at Bangalore with American assistance, Vintcent visited the United States and England and obtained the promise of a contract for the construction of training aircraft in India as an initial programme for the Tata aircraft factory. Shipping and other difficulties, however, delayed the building, equipping, and manning of an aircraft factory in India. But in 1941 Vintcent flew to England at the request of Lord Beaverbrook, then Minister of Aircraft Production and obtained a contract for the construction of troop-carrying gliders, and set about the organization of the company and the building of the factory at Poona. Vintcent, anxious to lose no time, set out on his return to India on 29 January 1942. With the irony of fate, of all the numerous personnel who were sent to India by air and sea to establish this enterprise, he alone was lost on the way out. The outbreak of war with Japan revealed how invaluable an established aircraft industry in India, even on a small scale, would then have been; but it was too late for India to make any contribution in the production of aircraft. The Tata aircraft factories as well as the Hindustan aircraft factory were switched over to the repair and overhaul of aircraft for the air forces. In 1942, Vintcent set out on a flight to India to put into effect a plan for which he had fought long and tenaciously - the establishment of an aircraft factory in India. The RAF Hudson in which he had been given a place in the crew to expedite his return disappeared without trace after taking off from a Cornish aerodrome. While officially there was no further information, it is known that other RAF aircraft were attacked by enemy aircraft in the mouth of the English Channel that day, and among his friends it was presumed that Vintcent was shot down in that vicinity.

One was privately constructed in Brisbane, Australia. History The ANEC I and II, designed by W.S Shackleton, were amongst the earliest ultralight aircraft; they were very small, wooden, strut braced high- wing monoplanes. The first ANEC I, registered G-EBHR, first flew at Brooklands on 21 August 1923. It was the first aircraft with an inverted engine, a 696 cc Blackburne Tomtit, to fly in the United Kingdom. The ANEC I was designed to the rules of the 1923 Lympne light aircraft trials, principally an engine capacity limit of 750 cc, and the two aircraft completed that August took part. The main prizes were for fuel economy and the second ANEC I G-EBIL, flown by Jimmy James, shared half of the ¬£1,500 prize with an English Electric Wren for flights of 87.5 miles (141 km) on one gallon (4.54 L) of petrol. He later reached an altitude of 14,000 ft (4,267 m) in it. G-EBIL was evaluated by the Air Ministry in 1924, briefly carrying the RAF serial J7506. Afterwards it was modified with a wingspan greatly reduced from 32 ft to 18 ft 4 in (9.75 m to 5.59 m) and re-engined with a 1,000 cc Anzani engine for entry in the 1925 Lympne August Bank Holiday Races, designated the ANEC IA. Only one more ANEC I was constructed. It was built in Australia by George Beohm, who went on to design the Genairco Biplane, and Horrie Miller. E. W. Beckman, the owner of the aircraft, intended to enter it in the Low-Powered Aeroplane Competition held at Richmond in December 1924, but it was not completed until the following year. The first of the two built in the United Kingdom in 1923, G-EBHR, was exported to Australia in the second half of 1924. The ANEC II was an enlarged version of the ANEC I built for the 1924 Lympne light aircraft trials competition. Following the revised competition rules, it was a two- seater and its more powerful 1,100 cc Anzani inverted V twin-cylinder had the greatest capacity allowed. The wing area was increased by 28% to accommodate the extra weight by a 5 ft 2 in (1.57 m) span extension. It was also longer by almost the same amount. Engine problems kept it from flying in the competition and out of the Grosvenor Trophy race that immediately followed. In 1927 a new owner refitted it with a 32 hp (24 kW) Bristol Cherub III flat twin engine, a larger rudder, and a more conventional undercarriage with larger wheels mounted on a cross axle attached to the lower fuselage with a pair of V-struts. In 1931 another new owner fitted a heavier 30 hp (22 kW) ABC Scorpion engine, another flat twin and, to keep the weight down, reworked it as a single seater. It was in this condition when it was acquired by Richard Shuttleworth in about 1937.

Originally published in French by MultiSim in 1998 under the name Meurtre √† l'Abbaye (Murder at the Abbey), Faidutti's game was republished as Mystery of the Abbey by Days of Wonder with new graphic design in 2003. In Mystery of the Abbey, each player plays the role of a monk seeking to solve a murder in an abbey along the lines of The Name of the Rose. The game is similar to Cluedo in that the objective is to identify a murderer by process of elimination by moving from room to room in a monastery and asking questions of other players in order to force them to reveal information that will disqualify potential suspects. Unlike Cluedo, a player, on his turn, can ask any question to any player provided the response would not include a suspect's name. The person being asked the question may choose to answer or otherwise refuse by putting a finger to his lips (i.e. taking a vow of silence). If the player does elect to answer the question, he then has the right to immediately ask his own question to the first player. Players use the suspects' characteristics to help identify the murderer. The 24 suspects are differentiated by their association with one of three religious orders (Franciscan, Benedictine and Templar), their title (Father, Brother and Novice), whether they are wearing a hood, whether they have a beard, and whether they are fat or thin. Game rules, special cards and other elements are designed around the theme of the monastery and monastic life. Although most of these can directly impact the outcome of the game, some are intended to simply add an element of fun and atmosphere (for example, one card calls for all questions in the next round to be asked in Gregorian chant).

SCT offers an explanation for the appearance of a group's cohesiveness, consisting of shared emotions, motives, and meanings. Through SCT, individuals can build a community or a group consciousness which grows stronger if they share a cluster of fantasy themes. Symbolic convergence theory provides a description of the dynamic tendencies within systems of social interaction that cause communicative practices and forms to evolve. This theory allows theorists and practitioners to anticipate or predict what will happen and explain what did happen. One thing SCT does not do is allow for control of human communication. It attempts to explain how communication can create and sustain group consciousness through the sharing of narratives or fantasies. To foster this cohesiveness, dramatizing or using fantasy stories are significant types of communication involved in SCT. SCT explains that meanings, emotions, values, and the motives for action are in the communication contexts by people trying to make sense out of a common experience. It explores the human tendency of trying to understand events in terms of the people involved, who have certain personality traits and motivations, and have agency over how the events unfold. SCT was first proposed by Ernest Bormann in the Quarterly Journal of Speech in 1972. Bormann and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota introduced SCT as a framework for discovering, describing, and explaining the dynamic process by which humans come to share symbolic reality. Bormann defines the basic communicative dynamic of symbolic convergence theory as, \\"the sharing of group fantasies which bring about symbolic convergence for the participants\\" (p. 4). It is a process through which collectives create and share a consciousness and develop a common symbolic reality. Symbolic Convergence Theory is related to attribution theory in that it deals with the human tendency to attribute meaning to signs and objects in order to make sense of them. The process of symbolic convergence resembles empathic communication. SCT has a three-part structure: # elucidation of the recurring forms of communication involved in a shared group consciousness # illustration of why group consciousness begins, rises, and is maintained # explanation of the process of how an individual begins to share (or stops sharing) a common symbolic reality  Anatomy  =Basic concepts=  Fantasy themes  Unlike the traditional ideas of what fantasy means, Bormann uses the word to refer to \\"the creative and imaginative interpretation of events that fulfills a psychological or rhetorical need.\\" Fantasy themes are used to construct a rhetorical vision or to dramatize messages embraced by the whole group. They are the means through which interpretation is accomplished through communication. SCT isn't concerned with finding truth, but the reaction from the group when these fantasies are shared. Fantasy themes exist in the form of a word, a phrase, or a statement, which attempt to define past events, predict future events, or illustrate present events that are chronologically or spatially removed from the actual activities of the group. Most of the time, these fantasies trigger a chain reaction within the group where they will contribute more and more to the conversation or fantasy. Bormann sees these fantasy themes fulfilling a psychological or rhetorical need through creative and organized interpretations of events. Fantasy themes are broken down into the following three forms: # Setting themes depicting where either the action takes place or where the characters act out their roles # Character themes describing the agents or actors in the drama, assigning qualities and motives to them, implying that they have certain characteristics # Action themes or plot lines dealing with the action of the drama  Symbolic cues  A symbolic cue is a word, phrase, slogan, or a nonverbal sign or gesture that works to trigger previously shared fantasies and emotions. Images, symbols, dramatizations, and narratives can draw people into a shared symbolic world. An example of a symbolic cue would be a bumper sticker, which actuates the observer into a larger shared reality. Symbolic cues can also heighten a group's cohesiveness.  Fantasy types  A fantasy type is a fantasy theme that has currency across a large number of rhetorical visions. By providing known references, they help make sense out of a new phenomenon. An example of a fantasy type would be when Richard Nixon was campaigning through his home state of California in 1952. A fund was put together by some wealthy Southern California businessman on behalf of Nixon. The newspapers picked this up and ran headlines such as \\"Secret Rich Men's Trust Fund Keeps Nixon in Style Far Beyond His Salary\\". The purpose of this fund was to help Nixon pay for expenses that he could not otherwise pay for out of his income. National newspapers were two to one in the favor of dropping Nixon from the ticket after this and his only hope was to find a way to regain public trust and support. Six days after the crisis, Nixon addressed the public by radio to respond to the charges against him. A fantasy theme emerging from this story would be Nixon presenting himself as the American dream. During his speech over the radio, he emphasized how he made his own way in the world and had to work for living. He also said, \\"How does a candidate pay for political expenses not covered by the government? First, is to be a rich man, which I am not. I feel that it is essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can run for President.\\" He offers autobiographical references which allow him to appear as the average man. This is an appropriate fantasy theme because it developed a response to the allegations that he is not a rich man who is getting money from everyone, but a hard working man who started from the ground and worked upwards.  Saga  A saga is the telling and re- telling of the accomplishments and events in the life of an individual, group, organization, or larger entity such as a nation. For instance, examples of American sagas include \\"the spirit of entrepreneurship\\" and \\"the power of the ballot box.\\" Symbolic convergence theorists argue that the Soviet Union had difficulty maintaining cohesion of the fifteen republics due to the weakening of the communist rhetorical vision and dwindling sagas. = Structural concepts =  Rhetorical vision  A rhetorical vision is a composite drama that unifies people in a common symbolic reality. A rhetorical vision has five elements: # Dramatis personae ‚Äì the actors and players who give life to the rhetorical vision # Plotline ‚Äì provides the action of the rhetorical vision # Scene ‚Äì details the location of the rhetorical vision # Sanctioning agent ‚Äì legitimizes the rhetorical vision # Master analogue ‚Äì the reflection of a deeper structure within the rhetorical vision = Critical evaluation concepts =  Shared group consciousness  A shared group consciousness must exist within a rhetorical community in order for a fantasy theme to chain out, a rhetorical vision to develop, a saga to exist, or a symbolic cue to imbue meaning. Some terms that portray a shared group consciousness are a common ground, mutual understanding, created social reality, meeting of minds and empathic communication. Once a group has reached shared group consciousness, they no longer think in terms of \\"I\\" or \\"me\\" but in terms of \\"us\\" and \\"we.\\" After all, communication is the drive that allows groups of people to move towards their goal. A shared group consciousness also reduces uncertainty by allowing groups to develop an identity that shapes their culture. By shaping their own culture, this can influence norms, roles and even decision making.  Rhetorical vision reality link  A rhetorical vision reality link allows for a viable rhetorical vision that chronicles an authentic account of the phenomena along with tangible evidence. The lack of a rhetorical vision reality link, with no clear observational impressions of the facts, may lead to disprovable fantasies, characterized by rumor, innuendo, gossip, and even paranoia.  Fantasy theme artistry  Fantasy theme artistry is the rhetorical ability to present situations in a form that appears attractive to people so that they will share them. By presenting situations in a form that appears attractive to an audience, or showing that you have an understanding of the stories that group shares, you can speak to their stories and turn their opinions into your favor.  Life cycle  = Stage 1: Emergence or creation = A dramatic event or series of events leads to uncertainty and a need to develop rhetoric to explain the current state of reality. In the case of the Cold War, the emergence of a fantasy-vision was necessary after Stalin's speech made clear his belief that capitalism and communism were incompatible and that war was inevitable. With the Truman Doctrine speech, emerging fantasies of Red Fascism (e.g., communism vs. democracy), Power Politics (e.g., containment strategy), and the Hot War vision (e.g., make the world safe for democracy), crystallized into the yet unknown concept of \\"the Cold War.\\" = Stage 2: Consciousness-raising = Fantasies begin to chain out among a collectivity of people over a common interest. As they co-create a new vision, their lives take on new meaning and emotion and their behavior changes. The principle of critical mass, when a rhetorical vision begins a period of rapid growth, is central to consciousness-raising. Also key to this stage is the principle of dedication, which asserts that when planned events inspire individuals to act according to the key emotions present in the rhetorical vision their consciousness is raised. = Stage 3: Consciousness-sustaining = At this stage, communication is focused on maintaining the commitment of people who have shared the rhetorical vision. The principle of shielding asserts that visions often remain fundamentally unchanged by containing motivation to quash counter messages. The principle of rededication asserts that visions may be sustained through severe criticism of counter-rhetoric and strategic positive dramatizations to maintain the visions vitality. The principle of reiteration asserts that rhetorical visions may be sustained by restating the key fantasy themes and types in new manners that fit within the dramatic structure of the vision, along with framing new information within the old rhetorical forms to maintain explanatory power. = Stage 4: Vision-declining = Situations in a rhetorical community can change so rapidly that the vision cannot adapt successfully. The principle of explanatory deficiency assert that when a rhetorical vision loses its explanatory power, it begins to decline. Another possible reason for decline is explained by the principle of exploding free speech, where a significant period of censorship is followed by a deluge of counter-rhetoric. Along similar lines, the principle of resurfacing competitive rhetorical visions asserts that with opened channels of communication, competition from alternate rhetorical visions increases. = Stage 5: Terminus = The end of a rhetorical vision. The principle of rapid implosion asserts that an inflexible rhetorical vision will not decline incrementally, but will implode on itself when the combination of problems, inability to explain rapid change, and contradictory motives become too much for the vision to deal with.  Real world uses  Symbolic Convergence Theory has been used to study movements such as the Puritans, the Knights of Columbus, American communism, and the Women's movement. It has been used to study political visions such as the Cold War, the New South, and Vietnam war decision making, amongst others. The Cold War rhetorical vision allowed theorists to mesh findings of previous SCT studies to discern, understand, and explicate more fully the intricate life-cycle of a rhetorical vision. Therefore, one set of studies, written by Bormann and others recommended that rhetorical visions can encompass the gamut of shared consciousness from all parts of the political, social, artistic, military, economic and cultural spectrum. Basically, through this study on the Cold War, they see how unrelated rhetorical visions may be combined in to a masterful rhetorical vision providing rhetorical continuity over time. SCT can also be applied in corporate strategic planning through guiding corporate positioning, market segmentation, and advertising and sales message testing. There are relevant cases consolidating the SCT theory-method-message complex combining with the strategic planning process and other implications.  Criticism  Ernest G. Bormann, the theorist behind Symbolic Convergence Theory, a past professor of communication at University Minnesota, claimed that SCT is both objective and interpretive theory. The methods of determining fantasy themes, types, and visions create a humanistic approach that is interpretive. SCT is often praised and even considered a bit unusual because it meets both criteria for being both objective and interpretive. Ernest G. Bormann, John F. Cragan, & Donald C. Shields responded to initial criticisms in 1994. Bormann noted that one point that SCT lacks is to allow for predication and control of human communication in 1982. Em Griffen puts forward arguments that Symbolic Convergence Theory is an objective theory. Symbolic Convergence Theory is objective because it focuses on sharing group fantasies that create symbolic convergence which is framed as a universal principle that holds true for all people regardless of the time, culture, and communication context. Below are four of the tests that can be interpreted for SCT on an objective side. # A good objective theory explains what occurs and why it happens. This theory gives a great explanation of what makes sense to a group discussion and how. It can help us make sense of a chaotic group discussion when group members speak at one time or go off on verbal tangents.However, Boston College communication professor James Olufowote doesn't believe Bormann's explanation goes far enough. In a sympathetic critique aimed at making the theory better, he contends that \\"SCT does not sufficiently explain why humans are predisposed to dramatizing reality and sharing fantasy in the first place. Although SCT covers most of this critique, Bormann says, \\"SCT does not sufficiently explain why humans are predisposed to dramatizing reality and sharing fantasy in the first place.\\" # A good objective theory predict what's going to happen. SCT clearly achieves this portion of qualifying to be an objective theory. SCT can predict that when a fantasy chain erupts among members, symbolic convergence will occurs as well. Without this chain eruption, there will no be cohesiveness within the group. Although SCT can predict a fantasies will happen, it cannot predict when dramatizing message will trigger a chain reaction. Bormann compared SCT as similar to Darwin's biological theory of evolution in that respect.The theory even suggests that without shared fantasies, there will be no cohesiveness. An evolutionary theory can explain the way modern humans evolved but cannot predict the further path of evolution. SCT involves a group consciousness through time and include a description of the dynamic forces that provide an explanation to discovered communication patterns but not when they will happen. # A good interpretive theory clarifies people's values. SCT highlights the values of rhetorical community by creating a common ground, meeting of minds and empathic communication. This theory does not explain what happens when someone that is ignored is left out or excluded from the group because people don't mesh well when they are ignored. # A good interpretive theory offers a new understanding of people. The SCT method does a great job of directing rhetorical critics to focus on symbolic language. Fantasy theme analyst focus on the rhetorical visions within varied communities such as a feminist critique looking for patterns of male dominance and how pro-eating disorder messages influence those in that community. In 2003 Joshua Gunn delivered a sophisticated criticism of what he considered Bormann's outdated conception of SCT involving a humanist construct of conscious human actors working with agency. In contrast, Gunn proposed a post-modernist construct working in unconscious, and critiqued Bormann's work as a passing era prior to Michael McGee taking rhetorical study onto issues of ideology. Bormann, Cragan, & Shields responded the same year refuting or dismissing Gunn's criticisms. A supporting argument that SCT is a measure of conscious human agency can be seen in the intentional use of rhetoric to create a crafted convergence of a group's perceptions by a religious advocacy group in order to address a specific problem.  Why Symbolic Convergence Theory is useful  These stories, or fantasies, can help businesses, corporations or politicians guide the positive and negative feedback directly back to those in power. Because SCT is a general theory built on the method of natural sciences, it can be applied to many different cultures and timelines. It has been used to account for the communicative processes, created by a group, used to foster the creation and sustenance of the group's so-called \\"consciousness.\\" Below are a few points of how and why SCT can be useful in everyday situations. Determining communication malfunctions. A question that happens a lot within SCT is, \\"Why do some fantasy themes spark a chain of sharing while other fail?\\" Groups fate as a part of a group have common experiences that predispose them to share fantasies which relate to their concerns. Therefore, these groups will have successful fantasy chains because they have more in common and are able to share more. When issues of power, sexism, role conflict, social rejection and other touchy topics come into play, groups members often find the direct confrontation of such issues to be unsettling. These fantasy chains may begin, but often do not last very long. Assessing communication efforts and persuasive campaigns. This theory can provide insight within small groups, meetings, lectures and speeches, but it provides a greater use of assessing effects within the media. It is most heavily used within political campaigns. In the 1976 campaign, the investigators included the relationship between the media messages and the audience effects in their study. These studies analyzed the extent to which actual voting behavior can be anticipated by participation. By being able to predict the voting behaviors, political representatives could carefully craft their messages for different groups of people before giving their speeches and lectures to best benefit themselves. The role of consciousness. Within fantasy chains there are three phases that keep the chains going. They are consciousness creating, consciousness raising and consciousness sustaining. In the first phase, people to come to create a commonality among their group. If the groups shares this common fantasy, consciousness raising will often fall in line next. And lastly, the two first points combined will create a sustaining fantasy chain that will last.  A Dangerous Phenomenon  An important element of Symbolic Convergence Theory is the propensity of the phenomenon it illustrates to be used against the public good. Whether unintentionally or intentionally, SCT can be seen at work in revisionist history. The intentional malevolent use of SCT principles against the public good can be seen in the rash of \\"Fake News\\" campaigns in which false perceptions are feed to society in order to create a false, but widely believed, consensus (convergence) of belief. This is tantamount to intentionally creating false representation on the walls of Plato's cave.(See Plato's Allegory of the Cave above) Conversely, unintended convergence of negative social ideas are illustrated by Jonathan Haidt describing the formation of American social and political tribalism.  Similar Theories  Dramatism (Burke) Dramatism is an attempt to understand the world through the construct of drama. The Dramatism construct allows the analyst to give purpose to life by giving individuals agency as actors within the drama, ties events and locations into the perception of the world as a stage, and as all stories have a plot Dramatism gives existence and humanity purpose. Dramatism provides groups of individuals conceptual tools on which to build a social convergent perception of reality. Social Judgement Theory (Sherif, Sherif and Hovland) A self-persuasion theory defined by the perception and evaluation of an idea by comparing it with current attitudes. Persuasion occurs at the end of the process when a person understands a position and then compares the position it advocates to the other person‚Äôs position on the issue. The closer the other person‚Äôs position comes to a person‚Äôs latitude of acceptance, that position will seem closer than it actually is Social Exchange Theory (Thibaut and Kelley) The major force in interpersonal relationships is the satisfaction of both people's self-interest. Self-interest is not necessarily bad and can actually enhance relationships. Interpersonal exchanges are analogous to economic exchanges where people are satisfied when they receive a fair return on their expenditures. Social Construction of Communication Technology (Fulk) Communication technology use is influenced by workgroup attitudes and behaviors. Social influence is greater when individuals are more attractive to their work group. Fantasy Theme Analysis (Bormann) This theory is a form of rhetorical criticism. It takes the shared fantasies of a group of people, perhaps the audience for a business presentation or a public speech, and examines them for inside jokes and other cues to a shared consciousness.

Rahman for the film of the same name directed by S. Shankar and produced by AVM Productions. Development As Sivaji became a major anticipated project, several false rumours about the soundtrack of the film were disseminated to websites and magazines. Despite the fact that early on during the project, Vairamuthu confirmed he had written a song called \\"Vaa..ji Vaa..ji Sivaji\\", no other major details about any other song was mentioned. Rumours went around that certain singers had sung in the project, including Rajinikanth. However, on 11 October 2006, the source, Behindwoods.com, mentioned that they had received credible information that Sivaji contained seven songs, five of which were set to be in the audio, with the other two being situational songs. Surprisingly, they also mentioned the five songs which were in the album. \\"Vaa...ji Vaa...ji Sivaji\\" was mentioned to be the opening song of the film. They also reported that a philosophical song titled \\"Unpeyar Ennada\\" was in the film, as per usual Rajinikanth films since Baba. Another song titled \\"Jee Boom Ba\\" was mentioned as its picturization was to be filmed in either foreign locations or in Karnataka featuring the lead pair. A song called \\"Talla Dimi Takka Dimi Pucha\\" was apparently supposed to contain Japanese lyrics and was set to be filmed in Japan, however the Sivaji crew did not travel to Japan for any purposes during the shoot. The final song mentioned was \\"Adaal Udan Pesadha Di... En Salangaiku Bhadil Solladi\\" and it was mentioned as a remix from another film titled Vanjikottai Valiban. Behindwoods.com claimed that this song was set to come in the climax. However none of these possible songs, barring \\"Vaaji Vaaji\\", were in the final album. Before the official audio release, on 12 April 2007, a dilemma arose over the illegal release of three preliminary tracks onto the internet. Songs titled, Vaa..ji Vaa..ji En Jeevan Nee Sivaji, sung by Hariharan and Madhushree Sahana Saaral Thoovudho sung by Udit Narayan and Sujatha and finally a song titled, Oru Koodai Sunlight rendered by Tanvi Shah, Shaggy and Blaaze became available on the internet. However, despite the uproar these songs caused, they were dismissed as scratchings for the picturization. Later the tracks were officially released with Chinmayi instead of Sujatha, in Sahana and Suresh Peters added to the group of singers in Style (Oru Koodai Sunlight). The official audio of Sivaji released in India and overseas on 25 April 2007. Unlike other major films, no pooja was held for the event and the album hit the stands straight away. The original audio cassette cover had an image of four Rajinikanths on its cover, while the CD version had an image of the lead pair on its cover. The first song in the album is \\"Balleilakka,\\" which features Rajinikanth dancing with Nayanthara, who makes a guest appearance in the film. It picturizes him dancing and singing while returning to Tamil Nadu from the United States of America, with a backdrop of paddy fields. Over four hundred dancing extras were used in the song, including Pulikali artistes from Kerala. The song's lyrics were penned by Na. Muthukumar and the song was sung by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. The other singers are Rahman's elder sister Reihana and Benny Dayal. The second song in the album is entitled \\"Style\\" and is sung by Ravi \\"Rags\\" Khote, Tanvi, Blaaze and Suresh Peters. The song was previously titled \\"Oru Koodai Sunlight\\" and was picturized in Bilbao, Spain. The song praises Rajinikanth's style and hero qualities. The lyrics were penned by Pa. Vijay. The third song is \\"Vaaji Vaaji\\" and was picturized at Hyderabad's Ramoji Film City, with sets at a cost of three Indian Crores. Reports claim the song picturizes Rajinikanth in knee-length warrior clothing as the King of Egypt and Shriya Saran as Queen. The song, penned by Vairamuthu, has singers Hariharan and Madhushree singing. The fourth song in the album is \\"Athiradee\\" and is sung by A. R. Rahman and Sayonara, with lyrics written by Vaali. The fifth and sixth songs of the album are titled \\"Sahana\\" and \\"Sahara\\" ‚Äî one being an upbeat rendition and the other being a soulful rendition of the same number. Singing the upbeat rendition is singer Udit Narayan with Chinmayi while the soulful rendition singers are Vijay Yesudas and Gomathishree. Both songs have lyrics written by Vairamuthu, who was praised by Rajinikanth personally for his effort. The final song in the album is a situational theme song entitled \\"The Boss\\", sung by Naresh Iyer, Blaaze and Raqueeb Alam, with lyrics from Na. Muthukumar and Blaaze. Rahman worked with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and choral singers in Prague for the score. Release and reception The audio of Sivaji, which opened on 25 April 2007, saw the biggest response to an Indian soundtrack since the Rajiv Menon multistarrer, Kandukondain Kandukondain, which also had music by A. R. Rahman. There was a pre-order of about 105,000 CDs and 90,000 cassettes before the release in Tamil Nadu, India. Repeat orders were received even by the close of the first day and many retail outlets reported stock outs. By the end of 2 April, the total CD sales had increased to about 140,000 and cassettes had reached 108,000 sales. On the overseas front, the sales of CDs in Malaysia and Singapore reportedly set new records for Tamil films in terms of the amount of tracks sold. Within the first three days of the release of the Sivaji audio, over 150,000 phone treats (ringtones, truetones and wallpapers) had been downloaded. Over Rs. 5,000,000 ($117,000) was made from this. In the ringtone department, 200,000 ring tones had been downloaded as of 12 April 2007. Ringtones of the song \\"Athiradee\\" were the most popular, followed by \\"Vaaji Vaaji\\" and \\"Style\\" finishing a close third. Ethan Sperry arranged \\"Balleilakka\\" for SATB Chorus and Percussion (shaker, tambourine, djembe, and floor tom). The arrangement was published by earthsongs in 2010 as part of its \\"Global Rhythms\\" series.Rahman, A. R. (Composer) & Sperry, E. (Arranger). (2010). Balleilakka [Sheet music].

Initially, hallmarks consisted of the goldsmiths' proper mark which was the maker's mark originally used to identify the silversmith or goldsmith responsible for making the article. The fineness mark, the crowned harp, was applied to 22 carat gold and sterling silver, which was silver of a standard of 925 parts of fine silver in each 1000. In 1638 a date letter system was introduced and used in conjunction with the above marks. This date letter denotes the year in which the piece was made or hallmarked and is changed on January 1 each year. A new mark in the form of Hibernia was introduced on March 25, 1730 to indicate that a duty had been paid on all articles manufactured on or after that date. The Hibernia mark is used on all articles of Irish manufacture hallmarked at the Dublin Assay Office. Up until 1923, the Dublin Assay Office was subjected to the same laws governing silver production in England and Scotland, and thus marked its wares in a similar manner. The formation of the Irish Free State in 1922 meant that the laws were made and governed from Dublin, but the system of hallmarking has largely stayed the same. Dublin Company of Goldsmiths (Guild of All Saints) The Dublin Assay Office continues to be run by the Company of Goldsmiths, one of only two extant direct successors of medieval guilds in Dublin; the other is the Company of Apothecaries' Hall of Ireland (the direct successor of the Guild of St Luke). The Guild of Goldsmiths (of All Saints) was known to have existed prior to 1557 when a replacement of its medieval charter was sought. When it was re-incorporated as a Company in 1637, it was 16th in order of precedence of the Dublin guilds. It included watch and clock makers. The guild colours were red, yellow and white (1767). Location In 1696, it is known to have met in the London Stone Tavern, but in 1709 Goldsmiths' Hall was built in Werburgh Street (the Hall being the source of 'hallmarks'). In 1812, the Goldsmiths‚Äô Company moved to 22 Golden Lane, and in 1838 to the basement of the Custom House. After the Custom House burned down in 1921, the Goldsmiths - and the Assay Office - moved to Dublin Castle in 1925 from where they continue to exercise scrutiny and control over gold and silver ware throughout Ireland, subject to various Acts of Parliament over the years, often relating to duties imposed.

It is named after the River Gowthami, a tributary to the River Godavari. It runs with train numbers as 12737/12738. History Gowthami superfast Express was introduced on 3/10/1987 and is considered as a sister train to Godavari Express which runs between Visakhapatnam and Hyderabad. It was considered to be one of the most prestigious trains of the South Central Railway (SCR), and connects the Telangana state capital city of Hyderabad with the port city Kakinada The Gowthami superfast express is considered to be one of the best ways to commute to the state capital, in united Andhra Pradesh, now the capital of Telangana Hyderabad from Delta districts of Andhra Pradesh. People of Kakinada, Rajahmundry, Tadepalligudem, and Eluru prefer the Gowthami Express to travel to Secunderabad. It was upgraded to superfast category in July 2007. It is operated with 12737 / 12738 as train numbers; it used to be 7047 / 7048 prior to being upgraded. It is one of the longest trains running with 24 coaches and also runs with full capacity throughout the year. Currently, it has two first class cum second class air conditioned coaches, two second class air conditioned coaches, two third class air conditioned coaches, 13 sleeper class, three second class general compartments and two luggage cum brake vans. In total it has six air conditioned coaches. It was the first train in South Central Railway to run with two first class cum second class air conditioned coaches. It has such a huge patronage such that a supplementary train, Cocanada AC Express, a fully air conditioned train, was introduced between Kakinada and Lingampalli in 2012 to cater to the rush. Both these trains run jam packed almost throughout the year. Gowthami Express is expected to run with 26 coaches very soon, and it will be the first train in SCoR and one among very few in Indian Railways to do so. It is also known for best maintenance of coaches and it was considered as a model rake of South Central Railway, Vijayawada Division (but now it is in SCoR). Gowthami Express has been diverted from Vijayawada Junction to Rayanapadu railway station bypass from 13 April 2019 to ease bottle necks at Vijayawada Junction. Stoppage at Vijayawada junction has been officially removed from time table of the train. Loco Links The train is regularly hauled by a Lalaguda based WAP 7 locomotive from COA. There is no loco reversal, since this train is taking a bypass route near BZA. Incidents In July, 2008 Gowthami Express supposedly was short-circuited and fire accident broke out during the night. Those wakened by the sounds escaped by pulling the emergency chain to slow down the train. 40 people died in this incident. It occurred while the train crossed Kesamudram station in Warangal district of Telangana at around 01:07.

Bottom row from left: economist John Maynard Keynes, leader of the British negotiators; Lord Halifax, British Ambassador to the US; James F. Byrnes, United States Secretary of State; and Fred M. Vinson, United States Secretary of the Treasury. Future US Secretary of State Dean Acheson stands third from right in the back row. The Anglo-American Loan Agreement was a post‚ÄìWorld War II loan made to the United Kingdom by the United States on 15 July 1946, enabling its battered economy to keep afloat. The loan was negotiated by British economist John Maynard Keynes and American diplomat William L. Clayton. Problems arose on the American side, with many in Congress reluctant, and with sharp differences between the treasury and state departments. The loan was for $3.75 billion (US$57 billion in 2015) at a low 2% interest rate; Canada loaned an additional US$1.19 billion. The British economy in 1947 was hurt by a provision that called for convertibility into dollars of the wartime sterling balances the British had borrowed from India and others, but by 1948 Marshall Plan money was flowing that did not have to be repaid. The entire loan was paid off in 2006, after it was extended six years. Background At the start of the war, Britain had spent the money that they did have in normal payments for materiel under the \\"US cash-and- carry\\" scheme. Basing rights were also traded for equipment, e.g., the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, but by 1941 Britain was no longer able to finance cash payments and Lend-Lease was introduced. Lend Lease aid did not have to be paid back, but the other loans did. Large quantities of goods were in Britain or in transit when Washington suddenly and unexpectedly terminated Lend-Lease on 21 August 1945. The British economy had been heavily geared towards war production (around 55% GDP) and had drastically reduced its exports. The UK therefore relied on Lend-Lease imports to obtain essential consumer commodities such as food while it could no longer afford to pay for these items using export profits. The end of lend-lease thus came as a great economic shock. Britain needed to retain some of this equipment in the immediate post war period. As a result, the Anglo-American loan came about. Lend-lease items retained were sold to Britain at the knockdown price of about 10 cents on the dollar giving an initial value of ¬£1.075 billion. Agreement =Terms= John Maynard Keynes, then in poor health and shortly before his death, was sent by the United Kingdom to the United States and Canada to obtain more funds.Robert Skidelsky, John Maynard Keynes. Vol. 3: Fighting for Freedom, 1937‚Äì1946 (2001) pp. 403‚Äì58 British politicians expected that in view of the United Kingdom's contribution to the war effort, especially for the lives lost before the United States entered the fight in 1941, America would offer favorable terms. Instead of a grant or a gift, however, Keynes was offered a loan on favorable terms. Historian Alan Sked has commented that, \\"the U.S. didn't seem to realize that Britain was bankrupt\\", and that the loan was \\"denounced in the House of Lords, but in the end the country had no choice.\\" America offered $US 3.75bn (US$ billion in ) and Canada contributed another US$1.19 bn (US$ billion in ), both at the rate of 2% annual interest.Philip A. Grant Jr., \\"President Harry S. Truman and the British Loan Act of 1946,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly, (Summer 1995) 25#3 pp. 489‚Äì96 The total amount repaid, including interest, was $7.5bn (¬£3.8bn) to the US and US$2bn (¬£1bn) to Canada. The loan was made subject to conditions, the most damaging of which was the convertibility of sterling. Though not the intention, the effect of convertibility was to worsen British post-war economic problems. International sterling balances became convertible one year after the loan was ratified, on 15 July 1947. Within a month, nations with sterling balances (e.g. pounds which they had earned from buying British exports, and which they were now permitted to sell to Britain in exchange for dollars) had drawn almost a billion dollars from British dollar reserves, forcing the British government to suspend convertibility and to begin immediate drastic cuts in domestic and overseas expenditure. The rapid loss of dollar reserves also highlighted the weakness of sterling, which was duly devalued in 1949 from $4.02 to $2.80.Documentary evidence can be found at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers, see CAB128/10. For a good account of the convertibility crisis, see Alec Cairncross, Years of Recovery: British Economic Policy, 1945‚Äì1951, (London, 1985), pp.121-164. In later years, the term of 2% interest was rather less than the prevailing market interest rates, resulting in it being described as a \\"very advantageous loan\\" by members of the British government, as elaborated below. = Loan spending = Much of the loan had been earmarked for foreign military spending to maintain the United Kingdom's empire and payments to British allies prior to its passage, which had been concealed in negotiations through to the summer of 1946. Keynes had noted that a failure to pass the loan agreement would cause Britain to abandon its military outposts in the Middle Eastern, Asian and Mediterranean regions, as the alternative of reducing British standards of living was politically unfeasible.Woods, p 375 =Repayment= The last payment was made on 29 December 2006 for the sum of about $83m USD (¬£45.5m) to the United States, and about $23.6m USD (¬£12m) to Canada; the 29th was chosen as it was the last working day of the year. The final payment was actually six years late, the British Government having suspended payments due in the years 1956, 1957, 1964, 1965, 1968 and 1976 because the exchange rates were seen as impractical. After this final payment Britain's Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Ed Balls, formally thanked the US for its wartime support. In television Sir Christopher Meyer presented a history of the loan and its effects in the BBC series Mortgaged to the Yanks.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature three times. Biography Born in Florence, Pratolini worked at various jobs before entering the literary world thanks to his acquaintance with Elio Vittorini. In 1938 he founded, together with Alfonso Gatto, the magazine Campo di Marte. His work is based on firm political principles and much of it is rooted in the ordinary life and sentiments of ordinary, modest working-class people in Florence. During World War II he fought with the Italian partisans against the German occupation. After the war he also worked in the cinema, collaborating as screenwriter to films such as Luchino Visconti's Rocco e i suoi fratelli , Roberto Rossellini's Pais√† and Nanni Loy's Le quattro giornate di Napoli. In 1954 and 1961 Valerio Zurlini turned two of his novels, Le ragazze di San Frediano and Cronaca familiare, into films.

They are self-contained, low-capacity, floating nuclear power plants. Rosatom plans to mass-produce the stations at shipbuilding facilities and then tow them to ports near locations that require electricity. The work on such a concept dates back to the MH-1A in the United States, which was built in the 1960s into the hull of a World War II Liberty Ship; however, the Rosatom project is the first floating nuclear power plant intended for mass production. The initial plan was to manufacture at least seven of the vessels by 2015. On 14 September 2019, Russia‚Äôs first-floating nuclear power plant, Akademik Lomonosov, arrived to its permanent location in the Chukotka region. It started operation on 19 December 2019. History The project for a floating nuclear power station began in 2000, when the Ministry for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation (Rosatom) chose Severodvinsk in Arkhangelsk Oblast as the construction site, Sevmash was appointed as general contractor. Construction of the first power station, the Akademik Lomonosov, started on 15 April 2007 at the Sevmash Submarine-Building Plant in Severodvinsk. In August 2008 construction works were transferred to the Baltic Shipyard in Saint Petersburg, which is also responsible for the construction of future vessels. Akademik Lomonosov was launched on 1 July 2010, at an estimated cost of 6 billion rubles (232 m$). In 2015 construction of a second vessel starting in 2019 was announced by Russia's state nuclear corporation Rosatom. Licensing Makers of mobile nuclear power plants need to obtain a manufacturing license. This allows the producer to create at a shipyard office various flatboat mounted atomic power plants of a similar structure which are to be worked at unassigned destinations by service organizations. The attributes of the locales at which the plants are to work are determined by the producer as a site-related instruction. Since seaward atomic power plants are profoundly exposed to various covering administrative purviews, steps have been taken to structure the interagency coordination. Technical characteristics The floating nuclear power station is a non-self propelled vessel. It has length of , width of , height of , and draught of . The vessel has a displacement of 21,500 tonnes and a crew of 69 people. Each vessel of this type has two modified KLT-40 naval propulsion reactors together providing up to 70 MW of electricity or 300 MW of heat, or cogeneration of electricity and heat for district heating, enough for a city with a population of 200,000 people. Because of its ability to float and be assembled in extreme weather conditions, it can provide heat and power to areas that do not have easy access to these amenities because of their geographic location. It could also be modified as a desalination plant producing 240,000 cubic meters of fresh water a day. Smaller modification of the plant can be fitted with two ABV-6M reactors with the electrical power around 18 MWe (megawatts of electricity). The much larger VBER-300 917 MW thermal or 325 MWe and the slightly larger RITM-200 55 MWe reactors have both been considered as a potential energy source for these floating nuclear power stations. The station also incorporates a floating unit (FPU), waterworks, guaranteeing solid establishment, separation FPU and transmitting created power and heat on the banks, inland offices for accepting and transmitting the produced power to outside systems for circulation to purchasers. Objectives The primary goal of the venture is to give increasing energy needs of the area, effective energy investigation and advancement of gold and rest of the different fields in Chaun-Bilibino energy arrangement of the industrial group, guaranteeing adjustment of taxes for electric and heat energy for the populace and modern customers, and the making of a solid energy base for monetary and social improvement of the locale. Contractors The hull and sections of vessels are built by the Baltic Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. Reactors are designed by OKBM Afrikantov and assembled by Nizhniy Novgorod Research and Development Institute Atomenergoproekt (both part of Atomenergoprom). The reactor vessels are produced by Izhorskiye Zavody. Kaluga Turbine Plant supplies the turbo- generators. Fueling The floating power stations need to be refueled every three years while saving up to 200,000 metric tons of coal and 100,000 tons of fuel oil a year. The reactors are supposed to have a lifespan of 40 years. Every 12 years, the whole plant will be towed home and overhauled at the wharf where it was constructed. The manufacturer will arrange for the disposal of the nuclear waste and maintenance is provided by the infrastructure of the Russian nuclear industry. Thus, virtually no radiation traces are expected at the place where the power station produced its energy. Safety The safety systems of the KLT-40S are designed according to the reactor design itself, physical successive systems of protection and containment, self-activating active and passive safety systems, self-diagnostic automatic systems, reliable diagnostics relating to equipment and systems status, and provisioned methods regarding accident control. Additionally, the safety systems on board operate independently of the plant‚Äôs power supply. Environmental groups and citizens are concerned that floating plants will be more vulnerable to accidents, natural disasters specific to oceans, and terrorism than land-based stations. They point to a history of naval and nuclear accidents in Russia and the former Soviet Union, including the Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Russia does have 50 years of experience operating a fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers that are also used for scientific and Arctic tourism expeditions. However earlier incidents (Lenin, 1957, and Taymyr, 2011) involving radioactive leaking from such vessels also contribute to safety concerns for FNPPs. Commercialization of floating nuclear power plants in the United States have failed due to high costs and safety concerns. Environmental concerns around the health and safety of the project have arisen. Radioactive steam may be produced, negatively impacting people living nearby. Earthquake activity is common in the area and there are fears that a tsunami wave could damage the facility and release radioactive substances and waste. Being on the water exposes it to natural forces, according to environmental groups. Environmental impacts In resemblance to terrestrial nuclear powerplants, coastal atomic power plants may incite similar consequences for the ocean‚Äôs environment. Although the surrounding seawall might result in an unnatural reef and facilitate an advantageous environment for several marine life forms, the potential catastrophic effects of the floating nuclear power plant process on animal and plant life near the shore would perhaps be the intrusion of young and adult fish along with increased mortality in aquatic and marine life caused by damages suffered during entrainment. Because of the narrow area of the thermal plume compared to the area of accessible water for the aquatic life, the thermal impact on the plants and animals in the ocean would be of secondary value. Winter shutdown of the plant may result in fish kills; However, this impact can be mitigated in multiple-united stations by avoiding simultaneous shutdowns of more than one unit. The breakwater will constitute an artificial island of appreciable size. Locations Floating nuclear power stations are planned to be used mainly in the Russian Arctic. Five of these are planned to be used by Gazprom for offshore oil and gas field development and for operations on the Kola and Yamal peninsulas. Other locations include Dudinka on the Taymyr Peninsula, Vilyuchinsk on the Kamchatka Peninsula and Pevek on the Chukchi Peninsula. In 2007, Rosatom signed an agreement with the Sakha Republic to build a floating plant for its northern parts, using smaller ABV reactors. According to Rosatom, 15 countries, including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Algeria, Sudan, Namibia, Cape Verde, and Argentina, have shown interest in hiring such a device. It has been estimated that 75% of the world's population live within 100 miles of a port city.

Background Anne was originally from the province of Brittany in France.Ulrike Klausmann, Marion Meinzerin, Gabriel Kuhn: Women pirates and the politics of the Jolly Roger Black Rose Books, 1997 She was possibly deported to French Tortuga as a criminal. She reportedly arrived on Tortuga during the reign of Bertrand d'Ogeron de la Bou√´re, who was governor of the island in 1665-1668 and 1669-1675. In 1684, she married buccaneer Pierre Lelong, who was killed in a fight 15 July 1690. With him, she had one child, Marie Marguerite Yvonne Lelong (1688-1774). In 1691, she married Joseph Cherel, who in turn died in June 1693. With him she had another child: Jean-Fran√ßois Ch√©rel (1692-1732). In March 1693, she met and married the famous buccaneer Laurens de Graaf. He agreed to marry her after she threatened to shoot him for insulting her.Blood and Silver: A History of Piracy in the Caribbean and Central America by Kris E. Lane (Signal Books, 1999) According to Vaissi√®re, the two were married in 1693 and their daughter was recorded as twelve years old in 1704. According to the traditional description of the event, Anne challenged de Graff to a duel to avenge the death of her late spouse. While Laurens drew his sword, Anne drew her gun, after which Laurens succumbed by saying he would not fight a female. He then proposed to her in admiration of her courage.Pierre Margry, Relations et m√©moires in√©dits pour servir √† l'histoire de la France sous les Pays d'outre- mer tir√©s des archives du minist√®re de la marine et des colonies, Challamel, 1867 Anne and Laurens de Graaf married 28 July 1693. During her marriage she had two children, a daughter, Marie Catherine de Graff (1694-1743), and a son who died as a child (1700-1705) Anne God-Wants Anne Dieu-Le-Veut is referred to as a pirate because she supposedly accompanied Laurens de Graaf on his pirate ship during his acts of piracy. Usually, it was considered bad luck to have a woman on board a ship, but Anne was instead regarded as a mascot and a good luck charm.Jean-Jacques Seymour, Les chemins des proies: une histoire de la flibuste, Ibis Rouge √âd., 2010, 299 p. It is claimed that she actively participated in his piracy and fought by his side during acts of piracy, sharing his work and the command on his ship in the same fashion as Anne Bonny did with Calico Jack, though unlike Bonny she did not hide her sex. The stories about her attracted attention and she has been described as brave, stern and ruthless. Apparently, it was during these years her name Anne Dieu- Le-Veut (\\"Anne God-Wants\\") became known. In 1693, Laurens de Graaf raided English Jamaica. As recognition, he was given the noble title of Chevalier and the position of Major Lieutenant and the commission of Ile-a-Vache. The English retaliated in May 1695 with an attack on Port-de-Paix at Saint Domingue, where they sacked the town and captured Anne and her children.Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the New World, 1492 to the Present by David Marley (ABC-CLIO, 1998) They were kept as hostages for three years, despite the attempts made by France to release them. In 1698, she was released and reunited with her spouse. With the exception of her death date, her release is the last year in which she is mentioned. The later life of her, as well as Laurens de Graff, is not well known, though their death dates are known. According to some legends, they eventually settled in Louisiana. de Graaf died in 1704 in Santo Domingo, and Dieu-le-Veut followed in 1710. One of her daughters eventually became known for having performed a duel with a man, which was then said to have made her a worthy daughter of her mother. Legend and Reality There were several stories and legends concerning Anne. There is one legend depicting Anne becoming a widow. As Anne and Laurens attacked a Spanish ship, a cannonball took the life of Laurens. Anne took his place as commander of his ship, as she had done before, hurled their crew of pirates on with fury in the fight against the Spaniards. However, the pirates were outnumbered, and they were all captured and taken first to Veracruz in Mexico, and then to Cartagena in Colombia, both of which were cities earlier sacked by Laurens, to be judged. Anne's fame was so great that when the French Marine Secretary of Pontchartrain heard of this, he wrote to Louis XIV of France and asked him to make the king of Spain intervene. Anne was then freed as a special service between kings, and she was never heard of again. This story is not confirmed. If Laurens and Anne settled in Louisiana after 1698 as have been suggested, it would not have prevented them from continuing their career of piracy. If historical, it would have happened in 1704, which was the year of Laurens' death. As Tortuga was closed as a pirate base in 1697, Mississippi would have been a better base for such activity, and piracy toward Spain could have been supported by the French crown the Spanish War of Succession in 1700-1714. If so, an intervention by an official from Pontchartrain in French Louisiana would not have been illogical. As one of the rivaling Spanish kings during that period was a French prince, it would have made it easy to receive a Spanish royal pardon by way of the French monarch. Period sources show that de Graaf and Dieu-le-Veut were married, but they do not mention her sailing with de Graaf or accompanying him on his buccaneering raids, which were behind him by the time they were married.

Distributed for most of its run by United Feature Syndicate, the daily version was launched June 1, 1925, and a Sunday page followed two years later. It was discontinued on December 2, 1961. Chris Crusty ran above Ella Cinders as a topper strip from July 5, 1931 to July 6, 1941.  Publication history  Ella Cinders was launched in 1925 by the Metropolitan Newspaper Service (MNS). In the summer of 1925, Max Elser, Jr., the president of MNS, introduced Ella Cinders and Conselman to the readers of Cartoons & Movies magazine: United Features acquired MNS in 1930, taking over syndication of Ella Cinders. The credited artists on the strip were creator Charles Plumb (June 1, 1925 - May 13, 1950), Fred Fox (May 15, 1950 - 1960) and Roger Armstrong of Scamp (1960 - December 2, 1961). However, the comic strip had numerous ghost writers and ghost artists. Comic strip historian Allan Holtz notes, \\"Very seldom did the credited writer or artist perform the task claimed - though they were usually involved in some capacity.\\" The ghosts included children's book author Hardie Gramatky, Morton Traylor, Henry Formhals (of Freckles and His Friends) and Texas artist Jack W. McGuire. His son, Jack W. McGuire, Jr., recalled: : His first strip was Jane Arden in 1934, followed by Bullet Benton, a cowboy boxer similar to Joe Palooka; then the Red Knight. After the Red Knight in 1943, Dad began drawing Ella Cinders as a ghost artist for the original artist, Charles Plumb. He drew this strip until he died in December 1945.Red Knight Characters and story Initially, as the name implies, the strip presented a variation on the classic Cinderella story, but then it diverged into other plotlines, as noted by comics historian Don Markstein: Film adaptation The prolific Alfred E. Green directed the film adaptation Ella Cinders, starring Colleen Moore, produced by Moore's husband John McCormick, and released by First National Pictures on June 6, 1926. In the house of her late father, Ella Cinders (Moore) works for her stepmother and two stepsisters, Prissy Pill (Emily Gerdes) and Lotta Pill (Doris Baker), finding support from the local iceman, Waite Lifter (Lloyd Hughes). The Gem Film Company has a contest in which the winner gets an all-expense-paid trip to Hollywood and a movie role. A photograph is needed to enter, so Ella spends three nights babysitting to raise $3 for the photo session. However, the photographer unwittingly take a picture of her looking cross-eyed at a fly on her nose which turns out to be the photo entered in the contest. Entrants must go to a Town Hall ball, but Ella's stepmother and stepsisters won't allow her to go. Waite sees her crying on the front steps and tells her he will take her to the ball. She says she has nothing to wear, so he convinces her to use one of her stepsisters' dresses. At the judges' table, her stepsisters react violently when they see the dress. The embarrassed Ella flees the ball, losing one of her slippers. Later, the judges come to the house and tell Ella that she is the winner because they were amused by the cross-eyed photo. Ella heads for Hollywood, where she is disappointed to discover the contest was a fraud. She nevertheless manages to land a movie contract. Waite turns out to be wealthy football hero George Waite, and the two are reunited. The characters were introduced in the first Ella Cinders strip (June 1, 1925). Books Ella also turned up in Big Little Books and comic books, including early issues of Tip Top and Sparkler Comics, plus her own title in 1948‚Äì1949.
