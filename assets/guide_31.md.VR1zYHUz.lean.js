It is not a well studied phenomenon, but it is known to occur in certain types of cyanobacteria, whose endogenous cycles, or circadian rhythm, \\"resonates\\" or aligns with their environment. It is known to occur in plants also, suggesting that any organism which is able to attune its natural growth cycles with its environment will have a competitive advantage over those that do not. Circadian advantage may also refer to sporting teams gaining an advantage by acclimatizing to the time zone where a match is played.  In organisms  In the context of bacterial circadian rhythms, specifically in cyanobacteria, circadian advantage refers to the improved survival of strains of cyanobacteria whose endogenous cycles \\"resonate\\" or align with the environmental circadian rhythm. For example, consider a strain with a free-running period (FRP) of 24 hours that is co- cultured with a strain that has a free-running period (FRP) of 30 hours in a light-dark cycle of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark (LD 12:12). The strain that has a 24 hour FRP will out-compete the 30 hour strain over time. Competition studies in plants provide another example of circadian advantage. These studies have shown that an endogenous clock that resonates with environmental cycles leads to a competitive advantage in Arabidopsis thaliana. Experiments with wild type, short circadian period mutants, and long circadian period mutants demonstrated that plants with a circadian period that is optimally synchronized to the environment grew fastest. The same study also showed that photosynthetic carbon fixation was directly correlated to ‚Äúcircadian resonance‚Äù. A different study discovered that genes involved in photosynthetic reactions of A. thaliana are under clock control. mRNAs that encode chlorophyll binding proteins and the enzyme protoporphyrin IX magnesium chelatase involved in chlorophyll synthesis were cycling. The ‚Äúcircadian resonance‚Äù increase in productivity may arise from appropriate anticipation of sunrise and sunset, allowing for timely synthesis of light-harvesting complex proteins and chlorophyll. Therefore, the competitive advantage in A. thaliana further supports the idea that anticipation of environmental changes leads to enhanced fitness. Rhodopseudomonas palustris is another example of the advantage in having a biological timing system that interacts with the environmental cycles. While the only prokaryotic group with a well-known circadian timekeeping mechanism is the cyanobacteria, recent discoveries involving R. palustris have suggested alternative timekeeping mechanisms among the prokaryotes. R. palustris is a purple non-sulfur bacterium that has KaiB and KaiC genes and exhibit adaptive kaiC-dependent growth in 24h cyclic environments. However, R. palustris was reported to show a poorly self- sustained intrinsic rhythm, and kaiC-dependent growth enhancement was not present under constant conditions. The R. palustris system was proposed as a ‚Äúproto‚Äù circadian timekeeper that exhibit some parts of circadian systems (kaiB and kaiC homologs), but not all. Likewise, research on the endogenous circadian timekeeping mechanisms in mice further supports that ‚Äúcircadian resonance‚Äù is evolutionarily adaptive. One study in particular compared the fitness of wild-type mice with mutant mice which had a short free-running circadian cycle. These mice had a mutation in the casein kinase 1∆ê gene, which encodes an enzyme that is integral in controlling circadian cycle length. A mixed group of wild-type and mutant mice were then released in an outdoor experimental enclosure and, following a fourteen month timespan, the mice were monitored. The wild-type mice both survived longer and reproduced at a greater rate than the mutant mice. In fact, the mutant genotype was strongly selected against, thereby suggesting natural selection towards those genotypes that are resonant with the natural LD cycle. It is possible that circadian clocks play a role in the gut microbiota behavior. These microorganisms experience daily changes correlated with daily light/dark and temperature cycles. This occurs through behaviors such as eating rhythms on a daily routine (consumption in the day for diurnal animals and in the night for nocturnal animals). The presence of a daily timekeeper might give those bacteria a competitive advantage over others. By allowing the bacteria to sense resources coming from the host in order to prepare and metabolize them faster. There are bacteria that have daily timekeepers, and it may be possible that the microbiota have endogenous clocks which communicate with biological clocks of the host. For instance, if there are some time-keeping qualities of the microorganisms within the intestines, it might be possible that they can affect the circadian system of the host. An endogenous clock may be present in some microbial species, and the presence of such an intrinsic timekeeper could be beneficial both in the gut (which experiences daily changes in nutrient availability) and the environment outside of the host (which experiences daily cycles of light and temperature).  In sport  In competitive sport, a circadian advantage is a team's advantage over another by virtue of its relative degree of acclimation to a time zone versus their opponent. While this concept was explored by researchers at Stanford in 1997, and at the University of Massachusetts, the term was coined in 2004 by Dr. W. Christopher Winter, a sleep specialist and neurologist studying the effects of travel between time zones on Major League Baseball (MLB) performance. This study was expanded into a ten-year retrospective study with a grant through MLB that was completed by Dr. Winter and his research assistant Noah H. Green, then an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia. The work was presented in 2008 at the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies in Baltimore, Maryland. Using the convention that for every time zone crossed, synchronization to that time zone requires one day, teams can be analyzed during a season to see where they are in terms of being acclimated to their time zone of play. For example, consider the Washington Nationals. If they have been competing at home for the last 3 days or more, they would be completely acclimated to Eastern Standard Time (EST). If they were to travel to Los Angeles, upon arrival they would be 3 hours off, because they traveled 3 time zones west. Every 24 hours spent on the west coast, would bring them 1 hour closer to acclimation. So after 24 hours in Los Angeles, they would be 2 hours off. After 48 hours, they would be 1 hour off, and after 72 hours, they would be acclimated to west coast time and would stay that way until they left their time zone. Unlike home field advantage which is present any time two teams play a game that is not held in a neutral site, circadian advantage does not apply to all games. In a typical MLB season, it applies to approximately 20% of games played with the other 80% featuring teams at equal circadian advantage. In sports that allow more time between games, it may apply to significantly fewer games. Circadian advantage is much more of an issue in sports that feature significant international travel. Circadian advantage is most significant when a team holds a 3-hour advantage (or more) over another. This matchup is only encountered after very long flights where the traveling team plays soon after arrival, most commonly coast-to-coast flights in major North American and Australian leagues. As the magnitude of time zone differences between two teams becomes smaller, so too does circadian advantage. In 2018, pilot data collected by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, was presented at the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's annual SLEEP meeting suggested National Football League teams perform better at night versus the day as a result of circadian advantage. It also indicated that teams had fewer turnovers at night.

History Since the end of World War II, Italian intelligence agencies have been reorganized many times: * SIM 1900‚Äì49, * SIFAR 1949‚Äì65, * SIOS 1949‚Äì97, * SID 1965‚Äì77, * SISMI (military branch) , and SISDE (civil branch), Executive Committee for Intelligence and Security (CESIS) 1977‚Äì2007 in an attempt to increase their effectiveness and bring them more fully under civilian control. AISE was founded in 2007 with the reform of the intelligence agencies provided by the Italian 3 August 2007, n. 124 law: new agencies were formed as the Department of Information Security (DIS) and the Homeland Security and Information Agency (AISI). The reform drastically changed the structure of Italian intelligence, as compared to the 24 October 1977, n. 801 law, it now does not divide the responsibilities between civilian and military structures (i.e. SISDE and SISMI), but along territorial spheres of competence: * AISI only within Italy and * AISE only abroad, * DIS (Dipartimento delle Informazioni per la Sicurezza - \\"Department of Security Information\\") aligning Italy with how other countries arrange their services. By law, it is a similar case with the Central Intelligence Agency in the U.S. Tasks The Agency as provided by Article 6 of law 124/2007, has the task of researching and developing all the necessary information to defend the independence, integrity and security of Italy from threats from abroad, including in implementation of international agreements. AISE also performs activities in the field of counter- proliferation of nuclear materials or materials found to be strategic, and information activities for security outside Italian national territory, to protect Italian political, military, economic, scientific and industrial interests, as well as detecting outside the national territory espionage activities directed against Italy and activities aimed at damaging national interests. Territorial jurisdiction AISE can perform operations only outside Italian national territory, as well as Italian embassies abroad. In fact, law expressly forbids AISE to operate in Italy, except if this is strictly necessary for the conduct of its operations. In this case, the rule requires that the operations in the country are only to be done in collaboration with the AISI and the Director General of the DIS shall ensure the necessary forms of coordination and linkage information in order to avoid overlapping of functions or territory. Organization 124/2007 provides that AISE responds to the President of the Council of Ministers, as the authority entrusted with senior management and overall responsibility for information policy for Italian security. Nevertheless, the AISE shall promptly and continuously work with the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior. AISE is run by a Director appointed by the President of the Council of Ministers. The appointment has the maximum duration of four years and is renewable only once. The Director of AISE consistently refers to the President on the activities of the Council of Ministers or to a delegated authority, if this is established, through the Director General of the DIS. It reports directly to the President of the Council of Ministers in cases of urgency, or where other special circumstances so require, informing the Director General of the DIS without delay. The Director of AISE is flanked by one or more deputy directors, appointed and dismissed by the President of the Council of Ministers after consultation with the Director. The other positions within the Agency are appointed by the Director of AISE.

Plot Late December 1937,The story focuses on a family, a Chinese doctor, his pregnant Japanese wife and their two children, who escaped the Battle of Shanghai hoping to seek refuge in the capital where the doctor was born. Being Japanese, the wife must hide her origins to the Chinese citizens, but soon upon their arrival, the city is invaded by the Imperial Japanese Army and this time, it is the father who tries to hide his identity as the family tries to reach the safety zone established by the International Committee for Nanking Safety Zone. Among historical characters such as John Rabe and Minnie Vautrin, the film also features an out-of-context excerpt of the infamous Contest to kill 100 people using a sword between Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyochi Noda.

Due to electric field screening the potential energy becomes much more sharply (exponentially) peaked around the equilibrium position of the atom and electrons become localized and can no longer conduct a current. Conceptual explanation In a semiconductor at low temperatures, each 'site' (atom or group of atoms) contains a certain number of electrons and is electrically neutral. For an electron to move away from a site requires a certain amount of energy, as the electron is normally pulled back toward the (now positively charged) site by Coulomb forces. If the temperature is high enough that \\\\tfrac 1 2 k_B T of energy is available per site, the Boltzmann distribution predicts that a significant fraction of electrons will have enough energy to escape their site, leaving an electron hole behind and becoming conduction electrons that conduct current. The result is that at low temperatures a material is insulating, and at high temperatures the material conducts. While the conduction in an n- (p-) type doped semiconductor sets in at high temperatures because the conduction (valence) band is partially filled with electrons (holes) with the original band structure being unchanged, the situation is different in the case of the Mott transition where the band structure itself changes. Mott argued that the transition must be sudden, occurring when the density of free electrons N and the Bohr radius a_H satisfies N^{1/3} a_H \\\\simeq 0.2. Simply put, a Mott Transition is a change in a material's behavior from insulating to metallic due to various factors. This transition is known to exist in various systems: mercury metal vapor-liquid, metal NH3 solutions, transition metal chalcogenides and transition metal oxides. In the case of transition metal oxides, the material typically switches from being a good electrical insulator to a good electrical conductor. The insulator-metal transition can also be modified by changes in temperature, pressure or composition (doping). As observed by Mott in his 1949 publication on Ni-oxide, the origin of this behavior is correlations between electrons and the close relationship this phenomenon has to magnetism. The physical origin of the Mott transition is the interplay between the Coulomb repulsion of electrons and their degree of localization (band width). Once the carrier density becomes too high (e.g. due to doping), the energy of the system can be lowered by the localization of the formerly conducting electrons (band width reduction), leading to the formation of a band gap, e.g. by pressure (i.e. a semiconductor/insulator). In a semiconductor, the doping level also affects the Mott transition. It has been observed that higher dopant concentrations in a semiconductor creates internal stresses that increase the free energy (acting as a change in pressure) of the system, thus reducing the ionization energy. The reduced barrier causes easier transfer by tunneling or by thermal emission from donor to its adjacent donor. The effect is enhanced when pressure is applied for the reason stated previously. When the transport of carriers overcomes a minute activation energy, the semiconductor has undergone a Mott transition and become metallic. Other examples of metal‚Äìinsulator transition include: * Peierls transition /Charge density wave. Changes in the material symmetry leads to the formation of a band gap at Brillouin zone boundaries. * Excitonic insulators exhibit very high exciton binding energies driving the transition to the gapped state. * A Mott‚ÄìHubbard transition. Ti- doped V2O3 undergoes a transition from antiferromagnetic insulator to disordered magnetic conducting state. * A band crossing transition. EuO orders ferromagnetically from a paramagnetic semiconducting state on cooling below its Curie temperature. Below Tc, europium‚Äôs valence electrons have enough energy to cross the trap levels due to vacancies on the oxygen sites. This transfer of electrons transforms EuO into the metallic state. * The Mott transition in doped semiconductors, e.g., Si:P, Si:As, Si:B, Si:Ga, etc. Such transitions have been investigated and demonstrated using electronic Raman scattering. History The theory was first proposed by Nevill Francis Mott in a 1949 paper. Mott also wrote a review of the subject (with a good overview) in 1968.

When was 11, a photograph he took at the Seattle World's Fair was published in the September, 1962 issue of National Geographic. Grosvenor subsequently worked as a freelance photographer, completing 23 assignments for the magazine and its book division in such countries as Belize, France, Iceland, Spain, Tonga, and Turkey. On several assignments, he was the photographer for articles written by his father on sailing in Canada, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the Aegean and Ionian Islands in Greece, which were \\"thoroughly and ably documented with photographs by [Edwin Grosvenor], the clan‚Äôs newest photographic talent,\\" according to Bob Poole in his history of the National Geographic. Publishing and Internet In 1979, Grosvenor launched the fine arts magazine Portfolio. \\"Since no magazine was going to hire a 27-year-old to be editor in chief, the only solution was to start my own,\\" he told a reporter for the Palm Beach Post. In 1983, Portfolio was a Finalist for a National Magazine Award in the General Excellence category. In 1992, Grosvenor founded the literary magazine Current Books, which included 20-25 excerpts of recent books in each issue. It published an eclectic mix of writing by such authors as Martin Amis, E.L. Doctorow, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Jane Goodall, Stephen Hawking, Richard Leakey, John McPhee, Bill Moyers, Joyce Carol Oates, George Plimpton, Salman Rushdie, and John Updike. Although Current Books published for only three years, it claimed to be \\"the most widely distributed book publication in bookstores\\" at the time with copies for sale in 3,840 stores. The magazine was widely regarded in the literary community and in 1995 Grosvenor was asked to serve on the NEA's Literary Publishing Panel. Its members elected him as the Chairman of the panel. In 1996, Grosvenor founded KnowledgeMax, an online bookseller and elearning company, which merged with Sideware Systems in 2000.\\"Sideware Systems and KnowledgeMax Agree to Merge; Sideware To Reincorporate in the United States and To Adopt the KnowledgeMax Name,\\" PRNewsire, December 7, 2000.

American Heritage In 2007 Grosvenor led a group of investors who purchased American Heritage from Forbes. Grosvenor said, ‚ÄúWhen I read in The New York Times that American Heritage had folded, I said, 'We just can‚Äôt let this happen,‚Äô \\" Grosvenor told an interview in 2009. \\"I contacted the Forbes family and said, 'This is like intellectual preservation. It‚Äôs important to save battlefields and historic homes, but this is the magazine that writes about the battlefields and the historic homes.‚Äô And luckily the Forbes family agreed with me and we formed a new company to save it.‚Äù Although American Heritage suspended print publication in 2012, it continues in digital form. In 2012 and 2013, Grosvenor led a team developing Fourscore (4score.org), an educational website offering thousands of essays and documents for teaching American history and government. Although American Heritage was forced to stop print publication in 2012, Grosvenor led a group of volunteers that relaunched a digital version of the magazine in June 2017.

Dates Campbell was the eldest son of Walter Campbell of Skipnish, and was born about 1671. In many books of reference he is stated to have been born in 1696 and to have died in 1777, the former date being that of his son John Campbell's birth, and the latter that of his grandson Daniel Campbell's death. Merchant At the age of 22 he set up business in New England, before settling in Glasgow, where he traded tobacco for iron ore. He also engaged in the slave trade and in finance. He was very successful as a merchant, and in 1707 purchased the estate of Shawfield or Schawfield, in Rutherglen, from Sir James Hamilton. He also came to possess the valuable estate of Woodhall, near Holytown. Member of Parliament A follower of the Duke of Argyll, he represented Inverary in the Scottish parliament from 1702 till the union, and was one of the commissioners who signed the treaty. He also sat in the first Parliament of Great Britain, 1707-8, and represented the Glasgow burghs from 1716 to 1734. In 1711 he built, for his town residence in Glasgow, Shawfield mansion, which became famous in connection with the Shawfield riots in 1725. The Shawfield Riots and the purchase of Islay tumults which happened in that city. Campbell had voted for the imposition of the malt tax in Scotland, and on this account the mob, after taking possession of the city and preventing the officers of excise from collecting it, proceeded to the Shawfield mansion and completely demolished the interior. The provost and magistrates were arrested on the ground of having favoured the mob, and Campbell received ¬£9,000 from the city as compensation for the damages caused by the riot. Soon afterwards he purchased the island of Islay, the sum obtained from the city forming a large part of the money paid for it. Family Campbell died on 8 June 1753, aged 82. By his first marriage to Margaret Leckie (the daughter of John Leckie of Newlands) he had three sons and three daughters, and by his second to Catherine Denham one daughter. On his death, having been pre-deceased by his eldest son, he was succeeded by his grandson, Daniel Campbell of Shawfield and Islay (c 1737-1777). Another grandson was Walter Campbell of Shawfield. Campbell died on 8 June 1753, aged 82. \\"By his first marriage to Margaret Leckie (the daughter of John Leckie of Newlands) he had three sons and three daughters. His sons all died before him. After Margaret's death in 1711 he married Katherine Erskine in 1714, herself a widow, and had another daughter.\\" \\"Daniel the Younger inherited the Islay estates from his grandfather in 1753, when he was just 16 years old and legally a minor. Daniel was laird until his death in 1777.\\" \\"The Round Church, Bowmore 1767/68 was built as part of Daniel Campbell's new village at Bowmore.\\" \\"When Daniel the Younger died aged forty, in 1777 his brother Walter inherited the island and continued the process of integration with the mainland and their improvements, begun by great Daniel. The family as a whole worked indefatigably for improvements in education, religion, agriculture, industry and administration.\\"Kilarrow Series (6) THE CAMPBELL HERITAGE by the Rev. J.A.

A person who performs an abortion with the consent of a pregnant woman is subject to imprisonment up to four years; if she or he is a medical practitioner and aborted the child for financial profit, the maximum penalty is six years in prison. If termination of pregnancy is performed without consent of the pregnant woman, the maximum penalty is ten years in prison. If a pregnant woman dies due to an abortion, the maximum penalty is 12 years in prison. Though the law has no explicit exceptions to the prohibition, general criminal law principles of necessity provide a legal basis for abortions to be performed when necessary to save the life of the mother. Women in Andorra who choose to terminate a pregnancy usually go to either neighboring Spain or France. , a movement to legalize abortion in Andorra has prompted Pope Francis to intervene. Because the Bishop of Urgell, Joan Enric Vives Sic√≠lia, is a co-prince of the principality, his approval of legalization would, according to the Pope, result in the co- prince's abdication and withdrawal of support from the Holy See.

It was first published in 1990 by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. in an edition of 1,350 copies, of which 600 copies were signed by the author and the artist, bound in quarter leather and slipcased as a deluxe edition. The novel is expanded from the short novel of the same name that appeared in Straub's collection Houses Without Doors. A trade edition hardcover was issued later. Summary The novel, a modern Gothic, concerns an American professor, William Standish, who is researching the poems of his grandmother Isobel Standish at an English manor, Esswood House, home and estate of the Seneschal family, aristocratic patrons of the literary arts for well over a hundred years. D. H. Lawrence, T. S. Eliot, Ford Madox Ford, and Henry James were amongst those privileged to call themselves guests and Esswood Fellows. We learn that Isobel Standish found in Esswood a respite from the outer world, and in its refined atmosphere an inspiration for her work. There was always talk of a hidden secret in Esswoods past, and the Seneschal children were often pale and sickly. For Prof William Standish, fleeing the unfaithfulness of his wife and her previous abortion, and her second pregnancy, which he believes is the result of an affair she had with an academic rival, Esswood offers him the chance to study Isobel's private manuscripts at close hand, which thrills him beyond his wildest ambitions. At the same time, he finds himself at sea in England with its different customs, and especially at Esswood, a grand Gothic pile, with its meals served by invisible servants, its rococo library, its hidden basements containing bones and giant dollhouses. Drawn into a nightmarish landscape where he is pursued by dead babies, or births of various kinds (one of Isobel's manuscripts is titled 'B.P.' which he interprets as 'Birth of the Past'), he hears faint laughter in the halls, the pitter-pattering of small feet in the night; strange faces appear in the windows of the library. Standish is increasingly unable to distinguish fact from reality as, caught in a vortex of hallucinatory images, he is subject to the unfolding of the dark secrets of Esswood.

The program is a five-week program over the summer for students between their junior and senior years of high school. It is held at three different colleges across the state of Kentucky every year. The program is highly competitive with about a 50% acceptance rate. In order to get accepted, prospective juniors must have high academic achievement, including standardized test scores, and be active in the community. The application prompts students to list their academic, extracurricular, and volunteer achievements. In addition, students must write an essay to be accepted into the program. The program itself consists of various classes and other school activities. The 1,000 seniors that are selected yearly are eligible to receive scholarships to any in-state public university upon completing the program. This incentive is an effort to keep the most intelligent of the state, in Kentucky. Program The Kentucky Governor's Scholars Program (GSP) was established in 1983 by Kentucky leaders to keep its \\"best and brightest\\" interested in furthering education and potentially starting a career in the Commonwealth instead of traveling out of the state to do so. It is a five-week summer program for rising high school seniors. Over 1,000 Kentucky students are selected yearly based on an application process detailing their academic achievement, extracurricular involvement, volunteerism, and personal integrity. Each student that is selected is eligible to receive scholarships to any Kentucky public university, as well as a handful of private institutions. For the duration of the program, located at three local college campuses chosen through a bidding process, scholars have the rare opportunity to experience college life while attending classes daily. The Governor's Scholars Program emphasizes wide-ranging representation of all Kentucky regions, ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds. Participating scholars are granted the opportunity to expand their horizons by forming close relationships with their peers representing all 120 counties in the commonwealth. Funding for the program is largely provided by private donations and state tax revenue. Teachers of these classes are selected through a rigorous process, including a detailed application and an intense interview. Other members of the faculty, commonly known as the \\"RAs,\\" or resident advisers, compete for limited spots through a similar procedure. Prior to 1983, the pilot program, started in 1972, was known as the High School Junior Summer Program, and was run as part of the Honors Program at the University of Kentucky. It was an 8-week-long program, held coincident with the 8 week long summer school session, during which time approximately 12 high school scholars could experience college life living in a college dormitory while also attending college classes. It included twice-weekly colloquium meetings featuring the 13 programmes of the Civilisation series by Kenneth Clark, and also included outdoor classes for discussion of the differences in the cultural backgrounds of the participating high school scholars from around the commonwealth. Scholars typically took two 3-hour college level courses in addition to the zero credit colloquium class, for a total of 6 credit hours of classes. Upon the completion of the summer term at the University of Kentucky, participants could elect either to enter as freshmen in their chosen field of study at the University of Kentucky, or to return to their high schools for their senior year. The majority of participants elected to return to their high school for their senior year, from which they typically then elected to return to the University of Kentucky on a scholarship rather than attending universities outside the commonwealth, upon graduation from high school. Students in this pilot program were not required to stay on campus during the period of the summer school session, but could elect to attend social events on and off campus, in and around Lexington, Kentucky. Application process In order for a student to be eligible for nomination and selection, a student must meet these requirements: # Be in the 11th grade at a Kentucky public or private school at the time of selection and intend to return to a Kentucky school district for the next school term (Students skipping their senior year to enter college are not eligible) # Be a current resident of Kentucky # Have taken the ACT, PSAT, or SAT in the 9th, 10th or 11th grades. To apply, students must fill out an application that is either provided by their school or located online. Before being accepted into the statewide program, students first participate in their school and/or district competition. If selected to represent their district, students will be eligible for the statewide selection process. Out of the 1,900 applications that make it to the statewide selection, over 1,000 scholars are chosen to take part in the Governor's Scholars Program.\\"Eligibility & Requirements.\\" Kentucky Governor's Scholars Program Applicants Apply. Kentucky Government, n.d. Web. 07 May 2014. . =Selection process= Once the applications are received in Frankfort for the state level competition, they are then divided into seven distinct sections. The first section, which contains all of the student's biographical information, is filed separately and tied to the rest of the sections only through the \\"journal number\\" that is used to identify each applicant. This allows each application to be read blindly, without any regard to the student's personal information, and insures fairness in the selection process. The remaining seven sections are divided among the members of the Statewide Selection Committee, a panel consisting of college admission personnel, college and high school teachers, and education leaders from different areas of the state. Each committee member reads and scores only one of the seven different sections. The sections include: * Academic Achievement (30 Points) * Student Profile (30 Points ‚Äì 10 Points per Subsection) ** Extracurricular Activities ** Community Service (Voluntary or Paid) ** Honors and Awards * Writing Entry ‚Äì 500 words (20 Points) * High School Teacher Recommendations (10 Points) * Community Leader Recommendations (10 Points) Residence The Governor's Scholars Program accepts a total of 1,050 students from all 120 counties in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The scholars are divided among the three host Kentucky college campuses and experience dorm life on their given campuses. Among the schools to host, some in past years and the present include, Northern Kentucky University, Eastern Kentucky University, Centre College, Western Kentucky University, Morehead State University, Bellarmine University, Murray State University, and the University of Kentucky. GSP students are required to stay on their given campus for the duration of the program, except for group field trips and service work. Curriculum Scholars attend a selection of three classes during the week: Focus Area, General Studies, and Seminar. Focus Area is a topic within the arts and sciences, assigned based on the scholar's preference. General Studies classes are assigned randomly and could be any topic of the teacher's choice. Seminar is a discussion class in which scholars are encouraged to share their opinions on social and political issues in a diplomatic setting. While most teachers refrain from assigning outside work, classes challenge the scholars' modes of thinking in a variety of arenas. GSP teachers take a creative approach to most subjects, allowing the scholars to contribute with their own interactive and experimental projects. Regular field trips, ranging from the Little Sandy Correctional Complex to the Cincinnati Opera, enhance the GSP experience.\\"A Day in the Life: A GSP Resident Advisor.\\" Kentucky Governor's Scholars Program Jobs RA/Office Positions A Day in the Life.

The students also have opportunities to participate in weekly dances, Classic Film Series viewings, and a Fourth of July Parade. Scholars who wish to continue their religious practices are able to attend a variety of local churches each Sunday, as well as attend bible studies on campus. Additionally, the program encourages scholars to form and publicize their own student-led events and clubs which can meet during free time throughout the day.\\"FAQs.\\" Kentucky Governor's Scholars Program Jobs General Information Frequently Asked Questions.

It is almost always unpowered, though can have auxiliary hydraulics attached in order for adjustments to be made without leaving the seat of the tractor. It is attached to the tractor via the three point hitch. Description Box blades are a variation of the rear blade which has developed into its own implement, with uses that parallel that of a rear blade, but are distinct. They consist of a heavy metal 3 sided box, with the front, top and bottom open. The front has retractable scarifiers which can be used to break up hard ground. The rear has a forward and reverse cutting edge mounted at the bottom, with the reverse cutting edge often gated or floating on more expensive models. Box blades are usually very heavy due to the forces placed on them - even a lightweight one will weigh 500 pounds. The implement works going forward by scraping soil, carrying it forward as it rolls inside the box, and allowing some to work out as the blade passes over low spots. It works going back much like a dozer blade, pushing dirt, which can spill out the bottom or sides. Unlike a dozer blade, box blades are not adjustable relative to the tractor more than a few degrees in any direction, and generally only when the operator dismounts the tractor. Box blades are primarily used for moving dirt, smoothing land, and contouring land. Most major tractor implement manufacturers make box blades, including Cammond, Woods, Gannon, & BushHog. Commercial laser guided models are coming into use which automatically level the blade via reference to an external laser. Three point road graders can be viewed as a specific type of box blade, and are used to grade and maintain dirt and gravel roads. They usually have 2 parallel angled cutting edges, and long, low sidepieces. Manufacturers include Dura- Grader, Road Boss, and RoadRunner.

The building also houses an exhibition space, which focuses on racism and intolerance. Origins By the 1980s, the city of Osnabr√ºck, Germany, had begun to embrace Nussbaum as a native son. An exhibition of his major works was organized at the Jewish Museum in New York in 1985. Soon after, the city's Museum of Cultural History set aside two rooms for a permanent exhibition. In 1991, Osnabr√ºck decided to dedicate a museum to one of its natives, Felix Nussbaum, a Jewish painter murdered in the Holocaust. In 1996, Daniel Libeskind's proposal, titled \\"Museum Without Exit,\\" won the competition to design the building, which was completed in 1998. The new museum was inaugurated by Gerhard Schr√∂der, then prime minister of Lower Saxony and later Chancellor of Germany. The museum was Libeskind's first completed project. Design The museum consists of three intersecting \\"volumes.\\" The oak volume houses Nussbaum's prewar art. The second volume, which slices violently through the first, is made from concrete and contains the paintings Nussbaum made while in hiding from the Nazis. Dubbed \\"Nussbaum Gang,\\" it evokes the cramped quarters in Brussels where Nussbaum painted his last canvasses. The metal volume displays the artist's newly discovered paintings. The interior is labyrinthine and many paths lead to dead ends. The museum's sides face three cities where Nussbaum studied art: Berlin, Rome, and Hamburg. The fourth side faces the concentration camp where he was killed. The galleries house approximately 160 of Nussbaum's paintings. Reaction According to The Times, the museum, whose \\"narrow tunnel and subdued lighting impose an atmosphere of oppression,\\"\\"clearly uses the idiom of displacement, loss and incomprehension.\\" Jonathan Glancey, in The Guardian, calls it \\"a masterpiece...in architectural dialogue with the paintings hung on its walls.\\" Detractors, however, have said that Nussbaum's work is powerful enough on its own that it would have benefitted from being exhibited in a more neutral space.

Perry signed with the New York Giants in 1953, but spent a decade in the club's farm system‚Äînever reaching the major leagues‚Äîuntil the relocated San Francisco Giants sold his contract to the Angels on May 16, 1963. Along the way, Perry had one season of 30 home runs, and four campaigns of 20 or more long balls.

H. Shields. Not quite a year after the British declaration of war at the start of World War I dragged Canada into the war, the younger Shields joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force. As was customary for Canadians entering the military at that time, he filled out an Attestation Paper. The date he joined is filled in next to his signature of \\"W. E. Shields\\" below his oath of allegiance to King George V; it was 25 March 1915. Shields' Attestation Paper.

He had a fair complexion, brown eyes, and light brown hair. Aerial service in the First World War Shields' military service details are unknown before he joined the Royal Flying Corps. His known history begins with his posting to No. 41 Squadron RAF on 20 March 1918. There he joined two other Canadian aces, William Claxton and Frederick McCall.Shores et al 1990, pp. 336-337. Shields was assigned a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a to fly. With it, he began his victory list on 12 June 1918, driving a German Albatros D.V down out of control over Guerbigny, France. It was the start of a victory tally that would make him an ace several times over; he also became proficient at the hazardous mission of balloon busting. By the time Shields scored his final victories on 4 November 1918, a week before war's end, they totaled 24. He was an ace on observation balloons alone, being credited with destroying five of them. He also destroyed 11 enemy fighter planes, and drove down eight out of control. His valour was rewarded with two awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross and the rank of Captain. Post First World War Shields returned to Canada. He married a Miss Nicholson on 22 June 1921 while living in Portage la Prairie. As he was employed by the Dominion's air patrol, he moved to High River, Alberta as the acting sub-station superintendent of this station. His flying duties there included the aerial spotting of forest fires over the eastern Rocky Mountains, including the Red Deer area. The Lethbridge Herald, 1 August 1921. On 1 August 1921, he and wireless operator G. H. Harding were going to fly west of Red Deer. Shields took off at 0737 hours. At an altitude of about 50 feet, the plane side-slipped into a nose- diving crash. Though Harding suffered only minor injuries, Shields died from a fracture to the back of his skull, expiring a few minutes after being pulled from the wreckage.

Mark Wilson's Complete Course In Magic. Courage Books. . Card Magic, pp. 17-171 Close-up magic can combine sleight-of- hand manipulations with card flourishes, and is called cardistry.

Located approximately distant, it is an evolved Am star with a combined apparent magnitude of 6.06, meaning that it can only be seen with the naked eye on dark, clear nights. The star is suspected of variability, possibly varying between magnitudes 6.04 and 6.06. The spectrum of HR 178 has been extensively studied for establishing element abundances in the evolved Am stars. It is given a spectral class of kA5hF1mF2, meaning its spectral type is A5, F1, or F2, depending on the particular spectral lines examined. The evolutionary stage of the star, and its mass determined from comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks, is not precisely determined. However, it is very close to the end of its main sequence evolution and the margin of error in its mass is only about . HR 178 has been suspected of being a binary star since 1938 when its spectrum was interpreted as being composite. The pair were resolved using speckle interferometry in 1983. The companion is modelled to be between 1.5 and 3 magnitudes fainter than the primary star. Although there have since been several failed attempts to resolve the pair, a tentative orbit has been calculated with a period of 21.26 years and an eccentricity of 0.5.

The first branch of Bratniak was created in 1859 at the Jagiellonian University. Thirty years later, in 1889, another branch was opened at the University of Warsaw. History Bratnia Pomoc was originally aimed at helping less affluent students by providing them with loans and scholarships. In addition, its members also organized cheap cafeterias for those who could not afford more expensive food. The Brotherly Help also contributed to the efforts to educate the populations of Polish towns and villages and to hinder their Russification and Germanisation. Another photograph of Bratniak celebrations at the Jagiellonian University in May 1947 In the interbellum period, Bratnia Pomoc maintained offices at most Polish colleges and universities, including University of Warsaw, Jagiellonian University and Jan Kazimierz University of Lw√≥w. Outside of Poland, the organization was also active on the territory of the Free City of Gda≈Ñsk, assisting students of the present day Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology, at the time Technische Hochschule der Freien Stadt Danzig.

Biography The son of Sir Thomas Paul Latham and his wife Florence Clara n√©e Walley, he was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford. Between 1928 and 1934 Latham was a member of the London County Council, representing Lewisham East as a member of the Conservative-backed Municipal Reform Party. At the 1929 general election, he stood as the Conservative candidate in Rotherham, a safe seat for the Labour Party where he was runner-up with 23% of the votes. In April 1931 the standing MP for Scarborough and Whitby, Sidney Herbert, resigned from the House of Commons. Latham was selected as the Conservative candidate for the resulting by-election on 6 May, which he won a majority of 5% of the votes over his Liberal Party opponent. Arrest, attempted suicide and court-martial During World War II, despite being exempt from military service, Latham volunteered to join the army. In 1941, however, he was arrested for \\"improper behaviour\\", a homosexual act, with three gunners and a civilian (letters he had written to those involved had been discovered) while serving as an officer in the Royal Artillery. Latham then tried to kill himself by riding a motorcycle into a tree. He was court-martialled and found guilty of ten charges of indecent conduct and of attempted suicide and was discharged dishonourably and imprisoned for two years without hard labour. Latham's court-martial was the first time a sitting MP who was also in the army had been court-martialled since Lieutenant-General Sir John Murray in 1815. He resigned his seat in Parliament. Family In 1933 Latham married Lady Patricia Doreen Moore, the daughter of Henry Moore, 10th Earl of Drogheda and Kathleen Pelham Burn. She divorced him in 1943 and died in 1947. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by their only son, Richard Thomas Paul Latham, born in April 1934. In 1932 Latham purchased Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex and carried on its restoration.

It is a brick Colonial Revival structure located at the corner of Main and Oak streets, in the downtown section. It was built in 1936, as part of a massive postal construction effort. Its architecture features a high level of detail and ornament for the Colonial Revival style. Only two other post offices in New York in that style share the same level of detail. For this reason it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Building The post office is a one- story, five-by-five-bay steel frame building occupying the corner lot. The ground slopes slightly from the rear to the west-facing front facade (the Hudson River is a short distance in that direction). Thus it was built on a raised foundation. From the rear a three-bay wing projects, giving access to the parking lot. The foundation and exteriors are faced with red brick laid in common bond. The front section, one bay deep, has a roof done in copper with parapeted gables on the end walls. The remainder of the roof is flat. Cast- stone coping outlines the entire roof, and the front has a boxed wood cornice. Bronze lettering above the entrance identifies it as the Dobbs Ferry post office. The entrance centers the entire main facade. It is arched, with flanking wooden pilasters topped with dosserets and a denticulated (toothed) broken-bed pediment. The windows feature splayed brick lintels and capping keystones. Two iron lantern-style lamps frame the door. Inside, the lobby takes an L-shaped form through four of the five bays. It features orange quarry tile and a counter-height dado. The plaster ceiling is coved, and the original wood frames on the bulletin boards and windows, as well as iron grilles on the screenline, remain. History Dobbs Ferry had had a post office under its earlier names of Wickquaequeeck and Greenburgh prior to its incorporation in 1872 and change to its current name a decade later. In 1915 the U.S. Post Office, then under the auspices of the Treasury Department, began to standardize its local branches across the country. This trend reached Dobbs Ferry when it became one of 136 new post offices authorized for New York State under an amendment to the Public Buildings Act of 1931. Congress did not get around to appropriating the money for a new Dobbs Ferry post office until 1934. In November of that year the current property was acquired for $11,700, and an existing store and residence condemned to make way for the new building. Congress then made $95,000 available for construction, and the Summit Brothers firm began work the next year. The new post office opened for business in 1936. The design, by Treasury supervising architect Louis Simon, used a Colonial Revival style, common for many post offices in and out of New York from 1905 onward. Most of these were simple, somewhat spartan structures, and the level of ornamentation at Dobbs Ferry is a departure from the norm. In New York, only the Granville and Hudson Falls post offices share the parapeted gables and window keystones. It has remained largely intact since its construction. Modern aluminum doors have been installed at the entrance, as well as modern lighting inside. The most significant alteration was the replacement of the original double staircase to the front entrance with a wheelchair-accessible ramp, mandated in federal buildings by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

Similar to 2D platformers, Sakura Sakura allows the player to navigate through the dormitory from a profile side-view perspective. Every so often, the player will come to a \\"decision point\\" where he or she is given the chance to choose from options that are displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. Gameplay pauses at these points until the player makes a choice, and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are multiple plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience. To view all of the plot lines, the player will need to replay the game multiple times, access different areas and make different choices to progress the plot in an alternate direction. One of the goals of the gameplay is to view the hentai scenes, depicting one of the protagonists having sexual intercourse with one of the heroines.

There, he meets two residents of the dormitory, Akira Shinden, a short-tempered, aggressive member of the gymnastics club, and Naoki Fuse, an easy-going kendo club member who shows no interests in education, which resulted in him often being referred as a NEET. Both of them attempts to recruit T≈çru into the club they respectively belong to, but is interrupted by Nanako Sakura, a soft-spoken, caring teacher and the dormitory's matron, who falls into T≈çru's arms, while trying to stop the two.

He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929. Life He was born in Stafford gaol, one of the younger sons of William Macclesfield of Chesterton and Maer and Aston, Staffordshire; William Macclesfield was a Catholic recusant, condemned to death in 1587 for harbouring priests, one of whom was his brother Humphrey. His mother was Ursula, daughter of Francis Roos, of Laxton, Nottinghamshire. William Macclesfield is said to have died in prison and is one of the pr√¶termissi as William Maxfield; but, as his death occurred in 1608, this is doubtful. Thomas arrived at the English College at Douai on 16 March 1602-3, but had to return to England 17 May 1610, owing to ill health. In 1614 he went back to Douai, was ordained priest, and in the next year came to London. Within three months of landing he was arrested, and sent to the Gatehouse, Westminster. After about eight months' imprisonment, he tried to escape by a rope let down from the window in his cell, but was captured on reaching the ground. This was at midnight 14‚Äì15 June 1616. For seventy hours he was placed in the stocks in a dungeon at the Gatehouse, and was then on Monday night (17 June) removed to Newgate Jail, where he was amongst criminals. On Wednesday, 26 June, he was brought to the bar at the Old Bailey, and the next day was condemned solely for being a priest, under 27 Eliz., c, 2. The Spanish ambassador did his best to obtain a pardon, or at least a reprieve; but, finding his efforts unavailing, had solemn exposition of the Blessed Sacrament in his chapel during Maxfield's last night on earth. Maxfield was condemned to be executed at Tyburn, London. The procession to Tyburn early on the following morning was joined by many devout Spaniards, who, in spite of mockery, formed a guard of honour. Tyburn-tree itself was found decorated with garlands. Half of Maxfield's relics are now at Downside Abbey, near Bath. See also * Douai Martyrs ReferencesSources *Life and Martyrdom of Mr. Maxfield, Priest 1616, ed.

Reach Out and Read envisions a world where every child is read to every day; where parents have daily, meaningful, language-rich interactions with their children. Reach Out and Read is a national early literacy organization working directly with pediatric care providers to share the lifelong benefits that result from families reading aloud to their children every day. By integrating these experiences into pediatric care and providing the tools and encouragement families need to read aloud together, Reach Out and Read is transforming pediatric care practices and giving children of all backgrounds and means a better start to life. History  Reach Out and Read was founded in 1989 at Boston Medical Center (then Boston City Hospital) by a group of pediatricians and educators including Robert Needlman, MD, FAAP, Professor of Pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine; Pediatrician, MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, OH, and Barry Zuckerman, MD, FAAP, Professor and Chair of Pediatrics and Professor of Public Health at Boston University School of Medicine. This group recognized the profound significance of early childhood in setting the stage for social-emotional health and achievement. To take advantage of this exceptional window of developmental opportunity, where 90% of brain development occurs from birth through age five, they implemented a novel approach: having medical providers empower parents to read to their young children, thereby making reading aloud a \\"doctor-recommended\\" activity. Over three decades, Reach Out and Read has expanded across the country and built its evidence base. Today, more than 6,400 clinical locations nationwide implement the evidence-based model, leveraging the existing health care system for a cost-effective delivery. Their team of 34,000 medical providers distribute 7.4 million new books to 4.8 million children annually. Program and Methods Reach Out and Read strives to improve emergent literacy and social-emotional health during the span of rapid brain growth and development between birth and age five, particularly in economically disadvantaged families who are at risk for adverse outcomes. They do this by partnering with trusted pediatric medical professionals who encourage parents to read aloud regularly with their children, and provide the knowledge and tools families need to nurture early learning and provide the best start for their children. Beginning at birth, pediatric medical teams nationwide coach parents during all infant, toddler and preschool well-child visits about the critical role that reading aloud and telling stories should play in their daily routine with their children. Children also receive a new, age, language and developmentally-appropriate book to bring home and build their home library. Through special initiatives, Reach Out and Read adapts their intervention to serve special populations, creating a more powerful and individualized intervention. These special initiatives include American Indian/Alaska Native Initiative, Leyendo Juntos Initiative (for Spanish-speaking families), Military Families Initiative, Early Math Initiative, and Developmental Disabilities Initiative. Reach Out and Read's unique model of integrating literacy into routine pediatric care is designed to meet families where they are; while less than one-third of children in the United States are enrolled in a childcare setting, more than 90% received a well-child check-up every year. With their unique access to pediatric providers, Reach Out and Read reaches the children whose need is greatest, during the most critical time, the first three years of their lives. Reach Out and Read has demonstrated that reading aloud with infants and toddlers connects to the most significant parts of a child‚Äôs development. Shared reading provides children with a fertile learning environment‚Äîencouraging curiosity and imagination. It also promotes resilience and mitigates toxic stress. Reach Out and Read starts with early literacy, but naturally extends to social-emotional development, motivation, persistence, confidence, and so much more. By making literacy promotion a standard part of pediatric care, Reach Out and Read leverages the child development expertise of pediatric medical teams to prepare at-risk children for academic and life success. No other early literacy organization has both the scale to reach millions of children nationwide and the solid evidence base to support program effectiveness.  Evidence Base  The Reach Out and Read program has been the subject of more than a dozen independent studies, the largest body of scientific research for any psychosocial intervention in pediatrics, showing that children served by Reach Out and Read are read to more often, have more books in their home, and enter kindergarten with larger vocabularies, stronger language skills, and a greater affinity towards books and reading. Endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), in their landmark 2014 policy statement, Literacy Promotion: An Essential Component of Primary Care Pediatric Practice, the AAP cited the body of research on Reach Out and Read in calling on pediatric care providers to promote literacy, beginning in infancy. According to the AAP, ‚ÄúResearch, in summary, shows that in populations at risk, participation in the [Reach Out and Read] intervention is associated with markedly more positive attitudes toward reading aloud, more frequent reading aloud by parents, improved parent-child interactions, improvements in the home literacy environment, and significant increases in expressive and receptive language in early childhood.‚Äù Through the policy statement, the AAP also recommends that literacy promotion be ‚Äúan essential component of primary care pediatric practice.\\" [vi] Reach Out and Read is a proud recipient of New York Times columnist and two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner Nick Kristof‚Äôs 2019 Holiday Impact Prize. The organization was cited in Kristof and wife Sheryl WuDunn's books Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope (2020) and A Path Appears (2014). Krisof and WuDunn cite Reach Out and Read as, ‚Äúan excellent example of a cost-effective, evidence-based program that helps kids in a crucial window of development.‚Äù Other awards include the 2013 American Hospital Association Award of Honor ‚Äúto recognize an exemplary contribution to the health and well-being of the people through leadership on a major health policy or social initiative,‚Äù the 2013 David M.

Built in 1882 by German Jewish immigrants and descendants, it is the oldest synagogue building in Tennessee and one of fewer than one hundred surviving 19th-century synagogues in the country. On January 19, 1979, Temple Adas Israel was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History Brownsville's Jewish community began when two German Ashkenazim immigrants, brothers Joe and Sol Sternberger, founded the Adas Israel Congregation in 1867. As immigrants to the United States, the Sternbergers had brought a Torah written on sheepskin. Led by Isaac Levi, the Orthodox community first met for prayers in the home of Jacob and Karoline Felsenthal. Over the next fifteen years, members of Adas Israel moved toward Reform Judaism and membership grew to 25 families. In 1878, the congregation founded Adas Israel Cemetery, a Jewish burial ground still in use today. The congregation became too large to continue meeting in local homes. They built a 200-seat wooden synagogue in 1882. A large ceremony took place on March 2, 1882 for the synagogue's dedication. Attendees included many of the city's non-Jews as well as members of the congregation. Emil Tamm became the first lay leader of the congregation in its new temple. The Adas Israel congregation has never had a full-time rabbi. Lay leaders have included Abe Sternberger, Morton Felsenthal, Fred Silverstein, and Fred Silverstein, Jr. In the late 1970s, Carolyn Celia Key Raney, great-great-granddaughter of Isaac Levi, served as a lay reader, standing in for Morton Felsenthal during his one-year leave of absence. She re-established the Temple's Sunday school. During the late 20th century, the congregation's membership began to decline as families moved to larger cities. In the early 21st century, about 12 families attend Sabbath services on Friday night at Temple Adas Israel. Architecture Temple Adas Israel is a modest example of Gothic Revival architecture and was modeled after the United Hebrew Congregation Temple in Louisville, Kentucky. It originally featured a small steeple, an extremely rare feature for a synagogue. A particularly beautiful suite of thirteen stained glass windows, arched in Gothic style, were installed in 1910. The window above the Torah ark is unusual in a synagogue as it depicts a large, realistic human eye, similar to the Eye of Providence found on the one-dollar bill and in Masonic iconography. The building underwent a major renovation in the 1920s; the wooden siding was replaced with brick, the steeple was removed, and new pews and an organ were installed.

Vaughan born at Leicester, the son of James Vaughan, a physician, and his wife, Hester n√©e Smalley. His brothers were Sir Henry Halford (Vaughan), who dropped the family name; Sir John Vaughan (1769‚Äì1839), a Baron of the Exchequer; and Peter Vaughan, Warden of Merton College, Oxford. Vaughan was educated at Rugby School, where he entered on 22 January 1788, and at Merton College, Oxford, matriculating on 26 October 1791. He graduated BA in 1796 and MA in 1798, in which year he was also elected a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He intended to follow the medical profession, attending lectures in both Edinburgh and London, and took the degree of MB in 1800. He was, however, elected Radcliffe Travelling Fellow on 4 December 1800, and spent the next three years in Germany, France, and Spain. In 1804, he visited Constantinople, Asia Minor, and Syria. The following year, he made his way from Aleppo to Persia, fell ill near the Caspian Sea, and was indebted perhaps for his life to the kindness of some Russian officers. With them, he sailed for the Volga in November, was shut out by the ice, and had to spend the winter on the desert island of Kulali, but eventually arrived at Astrakhan in April 1806, reaching England by way of St Petersburg on 11 August 1806. In 1808, in a private capacity, Vaughan accompanied Charles Stuart to Spain, and was present at the assembly of the northern juntas at Lugo; thence he went to Madrid, and travelled to Saragossa with Colonel Charles Doyle. On his return to Madrid, he was sent with dispatches relating to the Battle of Tudela to Sir John Moore at Salamanca, and returned to England in December 1808. In 1809, he published his Narrative of the Siege of Zaragoza, which reached a fifth edition within the year. In 1809, Vaughan was also appointed private secretary to Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. On 5 January 1810, he became secretary of legation (later of embassy) in Spain, whither he returned with the minister, Henry Wellesley. He was sent to Britain in 1811 to give information as to the state of politics in Spain. He acted as minister-plenipotentiary during the absence of his chief from August 1815 until December 1816, and his correspondence during these years throws much light on Spanish politics. On 5 April 1820, he went to Paris as secretary of embassy under his old friend Sir Charles Stuart, and on 8 February 1823, became minister-plenipotentiary to the confederated states of Switzerland. He was appointed envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to the United States in 1825, and on 23 March, he was appointed to the Privy Council. Between 11 July and 13 August 1826, he travelled nearly 1800 miles in the United States; three years later he accomplished another long tour. From 1831 to 1833 he was on leave of absence in England, and during this time had a personal conference with the king on American affairs. In 1833 he was appointed a GCH. Ill health caused his retirement from Washington in October 1835. Though, in Sir Charles Webster's view, a man of 'no great ability', he dealt with important matters such as the Canadian boundary, the Latin American republics, the slave trade, and the tariff. On one occasion, he was fiercely reprimanded by Canning for exceeding instructions. Palmerston thought him 'a steady sensible man, though not very showy'. In 1835, Vaughan made a protracted tour of Europe. On 4 March 1837, he was sent on a special mission to Constantinople, and proceeded by way of Malta, where he heard that the mission was no longer required; he therefore went to Venice, and thence travelled home through Italy and Switzerland. In such travel, he spent most of the years that were left to him. He left minute itineraries of his later journeys. He died unmarried in Hertford Street, Mayfair, Westminster, on 15 June 1849. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

Before he completed the second Staatsexamen in 1993 he wrote his doctoral thesis (German title ') under supervision of Peter Lerche. Career Between 1992 and 1994, Vo√ükuhle was a research fellow at the chair for public law in Augsburg. Later, in 1995, he worked as a referent in the Ministry of the Interior of the Free State of Bavaria. Following his habilitation at the University of Augsburg in 1998, he became a full professor at the University of Freiburg in 1999 as well as the head of their institute for political science and the philosophy of law. Additionally, he held various positions including faculty director of the law faculty. Since 2007 he is also an ordinary member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Later, in July 2007, he became the head of the University of Freiburg as well. He started to work in this position in April 2008. In May 2008, Vo√ükuhle became the vice-president of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany and the chairman of its second senate. He was the second choice of the SPD, after their initial candidate, Horst Dreier, was rejected by the CDU because of his position regarding stem cell research and torture.. When the mandate of the former President of the Court, Hans-J√ºrgen Papier ended in 2010, Vo√ükuhle became the youngest President in the history of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. In February 2012, Chancellor Angela Merkel offered Vo√ükuhle the opportunity to succeed Christian Wulff as President of Germany, after the president's resignation. He later declined the offer. The term of office of a judge on the Federal Constitutional Court is 12 years and cannot be extended. Therefore, his term ends on 6 May 2020. Controversy After Norbert Lammert, the President of the Bundestag, criticized the court's 2009 ruling on the Treaty of Lisbon, Vo√ükuhle wrote in an essay for the daily newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung that Lammert's statements were \\"strong words for a non-lawyer\\" and hardly served to \\"foster a culture of respect.\\" Lammert eventually came around and upon \\"second reading\\" declared the court's ruling \\"a brilliant legal concept.\\" Personal life He is married. His wife is Eva Vo√ükuhle. They do not have any children.

Mythology  Alebion attacked Heracles with Dercynus when he passed through their country, Liguria in North-Western Italy, on his way back to Mycenae from Iberia having obtained the Cattle of Geryon as his tenth labour. The battle that followed was fierce; Albion and Dercynus (or Bergion) were supported by a numerous army. Hercules and his army were in a difficult position so he prayed to his father Zeus for help. With the aegis of Zeus, Heracles won the battle, and both brothers were killed.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.5.10Pomponius Mela, 2.5.39 It was this kneeling position of Heracles, when he prayed to his father Zeus, that gave the name Engonasin (·ºòŒ≥Œ≥œåŒΩŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ, derived from ·ºêŒΩ Œ≥œåŒΩŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ), meaning \\"on his knees\\" or \\"the Kneeler\\" to Hercules' constellation.

The seat of the Chamber of Restorers is in the capital of the Slovak Republic, Bratislava and it operates within the whole area of the Slovak Republic. The essential mission of the Chamber of Restorers is to act as public authority in two main areas. * The first area is the authority of the chamber to decide about the ability to execute the liberal profession ‚Äúrestorer‚Äù in the relevant specialisation of restoration and for that purpose to keep the list of its members. The chamber in this area of its activity has the position of public authority which decides about which natural person in which specialisation of restoration will carry out business activities in the area of the Slovak Republic in the field of restoration activity on national cultural heritage and collection items of works of art. * The second area is the realisation of the chamber‚Äôs law duty to continuously monitor that its members carry out their profession in accordance with the professional, expert and ethical principles and rules which are related to the execution of the liberal profession ‚Äúrestorer‚Äù. For this purpose the law entrusted the chamber on one side with the authority to issue internal (corporative/professional) rules which are legally binding for its members and on the other side it accredited the chamber with disciplinary authority over its members, which manifests in the chamber‚Äôs right to impose disciplinary measures on its members (written warning, monetary fine, or deletion from the list of the members of the chamber) in cases when they have committed misconduct fulfilling the features of disciplinary offence. Besides these two areas in which the Chamber of Restorers as the authority of the so-called interest self-government fulfils tasks in the field of public administration from the position of its executor, its duty is also to promote and protect the rights of the professional, social and economic interests of its members, as well as to protect the professional honor of its members. The task of the Chamber of Restorers is also to cooperate with the providers of the university level education with restoration specialisation in the area of the Slovak Republic and to propose measures leading to improvement of the quality of the education in this field and the preparation for the profession restorer. The Chamber of Restorers in the interest of providing the highest possible protection and the widest accessibility of the cultural heritage to the public cooperates with the government bodies, local self-government with the domestic and foreign partner professional chambers and professional associations acting in the field of restoration activity and activities related to the restoration activity. As a result of its long-term activity in the area of cooperation also on the European level the Chamber of Restorers in the year 2005 became a full member of the European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers¬¥ Organisations ‚Äì E.C.C.O. which acts as an international body gathering professional organisations from the member states of the European Union and the EEA which is also a permanent specialised partner of the European Commission and the Council of Europe in the area of the protection and restoration of European objects of cultural heritage.

One of two malls serving the city, it is located on U.S. Highway 23 near downtown Ashland. The mall features more than seventy retailers and restaurants, as well as a food court. The mall's anchor stores are Belk Women and Kid's, TJ Maxx, Ulta Beauty, JCPenney, Kay Jewelers, Belk Men and Home, Jo-Ann Fabrics, and Aspen Dental. The mall is managed by Washington Prime Group. History Ashland Town Center was developed in 1988 as a joint venture of Glimcher Realty Trust (the mall's owner), along with Edward J. Debartolo Corporation (now part of Simon Property Group) and Crown American. The mall opened in 1989 with Walmart, JCPenney, and Hess's as its original anchor stores; Goody's was later added as a fourth anchor. Throughout the 1990s, Ashland Town Center went largely unchanged. In 1993, the Hess's chain sold several of its locations to Alcoa, Tennessee-based Proffitt's, which in turn sold its stores to Belk in 2006. Mid-2000s renovations In 2005, the Walmart anchor was vacated when Walmart relocated to a new Supercenter outside the mall itself. The former Walmart space was then demolished in early 2008 for a newer JCPenney store. Construction on this new store, one of three JCPenney prototype stores in the U.S., began soon afterward. Opened in August 2008, the store is twice the size of the former location, and the largest department store in the state of Kentucky. The existing JCPenney store was vacated, with half of it becoming a Belk Men and Home Store in 2009. This store replaced a Belk Men's Store in the Belk wing, which became a relocated Hibbett Sports in late 2009. In addition to the relocation of JCPenney, Ashland Town Center went through further renovations in 2008 and 2009. The food court was downsized to make room for new retail space, a family restroom was created and the Men's and Women's restrooms were both remodeled. Additional mall tenants were also relocated to create more space in the JCPenney corridor. A Cheddar's Casual Caf√© was also constructed in the parking lot near JCPenney. In 2010, TJ Maxx replaced Goody's as an anchor store and Rax, Panera Bread and The Children's Place also opened new stores in the mall.

The film stars Poul Reichhardt and Tove Ma√´s as young newlyweds who try to save an old family farm by winning a horse race. The Red Horses is the most watched Danish film of all time. Plot Ole Offor (Poul Reichhardt) a young graduate from agricultural college, returns home to discover that rumors about his fianc√© (Lily Broberg) are true‚Äîshe has been cheating on him. Ole rejects her thin denials and decides to move to Canada to start a new life. In the meantime, Ole's father, Hans (Johannes Meyer), meets with an old childhood friend, Munk (Ejner Federspiel), who is seriously ill. Munk owns a beautiful old stud farm called Enekaer, but he has left it nearly bankrupt. Hans promises Munk that he will help. Hans asks Ole to become the manager of Enekaer and see if it can be saved. Munk purchased some fine ponies of a red breed which he had hoped could be trained as winning trotters and save the farm. However, his bad heart left him bed-ridden. Munk's second wife, Zita (Else Jarlbak) has been having an affair with the vicious horse trainer, Willers (J√∏rn Jeppesen). When Munk discovers this, he sues for divorce, but Willers now owns outstanding notes on the farm. Ole arrives and meets Munk's daughter, Bente (Tove Ma√´s). The daughter from Munk's first marriage, Bente is sweet woman with a slightly crippled leg from a horse riding accident. Ole quickly becomes taken with Bente. Willers is paid off by Ole and his father and told to disappear. Munk, on his death bed, tells Ole and Bente that his last wish is for them to marry. Enekaer has one fine stallion named Junker that Munk hoped could win the 15,000 Kroner prize at the trotting derby. But Willers had ruined Junker's nerves. Ole and Bente care for Junker and he regains strength and speed. Ole falls in love with Bente and proposes. They marry but the marriage is uneasy because Bente feels that Ole married her out of charity. One day Zita Munk returns but Ole and Bente refuse her admittance to Enekaer. They are called into court because Zita possesses Munk life insurance which gives her financial control of Enekaer. The court gives Ole and Bente a brief time to raise the money or give up the farm. They are despondent, but after all they have been through, Bente finally has realized that Ole truly loves her. On Derby day, Ole decides to race Junker himself. Everyone at Enekaer bets all of their money on Ole and Junker. Ole races to victory and in happiness, Ole and Bente return to Enekaer.

Still available in the period after World War II, Korch's stories became a gold mine for the smaller ASA Film Company. The Red Horses was seen by more than 2.3 million people and is considered the most popular Danish film ever. It was quickly followed by 16 more films of Korch stories, all filmed at ASA and directed by O'Fredericks. Remakes The film was made in Swedish in 1954 (De R√∂da h√§starna). In 1968, it was remade in Denmark by ASA Film, directed by Annelise Meineche, and again starred Poul Reichhardt, but in the role of the father, Hans Offor.

An alternative break is a trip where a group of college students (usually 10‚Äì12 per trip) engage in volunteer service, typically for a week. Alternative break trips originated with college students in the early 1980s as a counter to \\"traditional\\" spring break trips. These trips are usually led by 2 \\"site leaders\\" who are students that have already participated in an alternative break and have gone through extensive leadership training. Alternative breaks may occur during students‚Äô fall, winter, weekend, or summer school breaks. Each trip has a focus on a particular social issue, such as poverty, education reform, refugee resettlement, the environment, healthcare reform, mental health, immigration, animal care, and much more. Students learn about the social issues and then perform week-long projects with local non-profit organizations. Thus, students have the opportunity to connect and collaborate with different community partners. Some Alternative breaks are also drug and alcohol-free experiences, with a heavy emphasis on group and individual reflection. On the site, students provide necessary services and explore the culture and the history of the area. Students who participate in this program cultivate social responsibility, leadership, and lifelong learning; thereby fostering a generation of leaders committed to positive social change. Alternative breaks challenge students to critically think and react to problems faced by members of the communities they are involved with. Being immersed in diverse environments enables participants to experience, discuss, and understand social issues in a significant way. The intensity of the experience increases the likelihood that participants will transfer their experience on-site back to their own communities even after the alternative break ends. The aim of the experience is to contribute volunteer hours to communities in need and to positively influence the life of the alternative breaker. Breakers are emboldened to take educated steps toward valuing and prioritizing their own communities in life choices such as recycling, donating resources, voting, etc. Many breakers have returned to their college campuses to create a campus organization related to the social issue, have a deeper understanding and commitment to an academic path, execute a fundraiser for the non-profit organization they worked with, organize a letter writing campaign to members of Congress, volunteer in their local community, or commit to an internship or career within the non-profit sector.  History  New Jersey Institute of Technology students work during an Alternative Spring Break trip in Asbury Park, New Jersey. In 1991, Michael Magevney and Laura Mann, two recent graduates who had been very involved in building a successful alternative break program at Vanderbilt University, gained the support of then-Chancellor Joe B. Wyatt and founded a national nonprofit organization called Break Away: The Alternative Break Connection. Their purpose was to gather the resources and best practices for the alternative spring break programs that had been established on multiple campuses across the U.S. Break Away began as a modest resource center for alternative breaks and continues to be the national organization dedicated to developing lifelong active citizenship through quality alternative break programs. Break Away's development and national growth was supported and facilitated by leveraging the national network of campus service programs built by the Campus Outreach Opportunity League. COOL's National Conference provided a great platform to engage college students interested or involved in alternative breaks from all over the nation. Student-led initiatives, now known as alternative breaks, became more prevalent on college campuses in the 1980s and early 1990s \\"as part of an overall surge of interest in institutionalizing community service on college campuses\\". Rather than travel to a traditional spring break location, groups of students came together to form a new community that was immersed in education on social issues, service work, and reflection. For the last two decades, there has been a consistent increase in the number of colleges and universities with alternative break programs. This growth accelerated in the mid-2000s, and has been attributed to two factors: 1) the institutionalization of volunteer service as an integral part of the college experience, 2) the overwhelming interest in service work along the Gulf Coast in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  Motivations  ‚Ä¢ Becoming active citizens ‚Ä¢ Interest in specific social issues addressed by trips ‚Ä¢ Further involvement in student body ‚Ä¢ Previous service experience ‚Ä¢ Lack of service experience ‚Ä¢ Word-of-mouth ‚Ä¢ Interest in new experiences ‚Ä¢ Desire to meet new people within university and external communities ‚Ä¢ Leadership opportunities (alternative breaks are overwhelmingly student-led) ‚Ä¢ College credit through curriculum-based alternative breaks ‚Ä¢ Less expensive than \\"traditional\\" spring breaks ‚Ä¢ Desire for experiences that will inform future career path ‚Ä¢ Resume building  Components  Welcome to Break Away ‚Äì The Alternative Break Connection! Strong Direct Service: Should provide an opportunity for participants to engage in direct or ‚Äúhands on‚Äù projects and activities that address unmet social needs, as determined by the community. Orientation: Alternative breakers learn about the purposes and goals of their community partners with which they will be working. Education: Breakers learn about the complexity of the social issue through reading materials, speaker panels, documentaries, and guest lecturers related to current trends and historical context. A strong educational foundation for the trip will contribute to a meaningful service experience. Training: Breakers are provided with adequate skills necessary to carry out service projects during their trip. This may include learning physical skills, such as construction or maintenance skills, as well as interpersonal communication, such as interacting with children, sensitivity training, working with people with disabilities, trail building, etc. Reflection: During the trip participants process the service work as it connects to the broader social issue. Groups set aside time for reflection to take place individually and as a group. During reflection, site leaders and students discuss critical questions related to the service, themselves, and the world. Reorientation: After students return to campus, reorientation activities allow participants to talk about issues with others on campus, learn about local volunteer and civic involvement opportunities, and brainstorm other means to benefit their local community. Reorientation (the post-trip application of the experience) is the essential purpose of an alternative break ‚Äì to provide a platform for participants to work towards lifelong active citizenship. Diversity and Social Justice: Strong alternative break programs include: 1) diverse representation of students from the campus community and 2) studying the social issue by examining the social justice concepts of power, privilege, and oppression. \\"The trouble around diversity, then, isn't just that people differ from one another. The trouble is produced by a world organized in ways that encourage people to use difference to include or exclude, reward or punish, credit or discredit, elevate or oppress, value or devalue, leave alone or harass.\\" (Privilege, Power, and Difference, 2001, Allan G. Johnson) Alcohol & Drug Free: Alternative breaks are alcohol- and drug-free. Awareness of legality, liability, personal safety, and group cohesion addressed through training prior to the trip.  Difference with \\"voluntourism\\"  ‚ÄúVoluntourism\\" is the integrated combination of voluntary service to a destination with the traditional elements of travel and tourism ‚Äì arts, culture, geography, history, and recreation ‚Äì while in the destination. (cite ‚Äì voluntourism.org) Volunteer vacations are not alternative breaks because participants arrive as individuals with no prior preparation with educational components or group building. Alternative breaks typically involve college students from the same institution, while most groups going on volunteer vacations will meet for the first time when they arrive at the location of the trip. Alternative break groups meet and prepare for their experience up to six months in advance of their departure. During this preparation period, there is an emphasis on learning about the social issues addressed during the trip, learning about the community, becoming oriented with the mission and values of the organization, training for any skills they may need while on the trip, and team building. Some groups even do relevant service in their college communities prior to departure.  Impact  Many students who return from an alternative break experience consider it a life changing event. Alternative break alumni have reported changing their major, increasing their campus involvement, committing to continued community service, actively staying updated on social issues, and joining a service program post-graduation such as AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, or Teach for America. Many return to participate and lead alternative break programs throughout their time as students. An impact analysis conducted in 2001 by Dr. Pushkala Raman and her Marketing Research Class at Florida State University in conjunction with Break Away revealed that there is overwhelming evidence to support the view that alternative breaks are \\"indeed contributing to the creating of active citizens.\\" Some highlights of the study include the following: ‚Ä¢ Participants show stronger intentions of voting after participation ‚Ä¢ Research indicates that alternative break participants are inclined to increase the amount of time they dedicate to serving the community after an alternative break experience. In 2002, Dr. Raman conducted another study measuring the satisfaction of nonprofit organizations that utilize alternative breakers. Her work produced the following insights: ‚Ä¢ 100% of nonprofit organizations that responded and had hosted break groups agreed or strongly agreed that they benefited from the work done by alternative breakers. ‚Ä¢ 100% of the same nonprofit organizations were interested in hosting alternative break groups again in the future.

Cricket is the most popular sport in the Caribbean.http://gocaribbean.about.com/od/beforeyougo/f/FAQCaribbeansports.htm In the sport of cricket, the West Indies is a sporting confederation of fifteen mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries and territories, many of which historically formed the British West Indies. It consists of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, The British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Maarten, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Trinidad & Tobago and the United States Virgin Islands. The governing body for the confederation is the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), which is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC); beneath the WICB are six territorial governing bodies covering different nations and regions of the confederation. The WICB organises the West Indies cricket team, which represents the confederation in international cricket, as well as administering domestic cricket competitions across the West Indies. The West Indies team, nicknamed \\"The Windies\\", are one of the twelve Test cricket teams, having gained Test status in 1928. They were considered amongst the strongest Test teams from the 1960s, ushering a golden age in which they were undisputed champions for the latter part of the 1970s to the mid 1990s. In One Day International cricket, they have won the World Cup twice and the ICC Trophy once. They have also won the World Twenty20 twice. Domestic competitions organised across the whole of the West Indies include the Regional Four Day Competition (First-class), the Regional Super50 (List A) and the Caribbean Premier League (Twenty20). Cricket is also played in other Caribbean territories such as the Cayman Islands, who are associate members of the ICC, whilst the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Belize, Suriname and Cuba are affiliate members. As such, these territories do not form part of the West Indies for cricketing purposes, and field their own separate national teams. Originally introduced to the West Indies by British colonists, cricket's popularity spread to the black population and it is traditionally considered one of the most popular team sport in the West Indies and a major part of West Indian culture, although others sports such as association football and basketball have challenged its popularity from around the 1990s onwards. Major international cricket competitions hosted by the West Indies include the 2007 World Cup and the 2010 World Twenty20. HistoryOrigin= Cricket originally spread to the West Indies via the British military. Military officials established clubs, including St. Annes Garrison Club, and integrated cricket pitches into garrisons in the Caribbean. The first known reference to cricket in the West Indies is believed to be from June 1806, in the Barbados Mercury and Bridgetown Gazette.Malcolm, p. 77. Two years later, a cricket match was held between the officers of the Royal West Indies Rangers and the officers of the Third West India Regiment. It is believed that the military was a major influencing force behind the drive to begin playing cricket porting this, there were known to be cricket pitches located in many garrisons all around the Caribbean.Malcolm, p. ??? Cricket represented a type of warfare between the West Indies and other nations due to the fact that West Indies players felt they needed to prove themselves as a unified nation. Because cricket was used as an instrument of colonisation, a war to free themselves from colonialism was waged, on the cricket pitch. A desire to shed \\"happy go lucky players\\" as well as to assert themselves fuelled the desire to thrive in the English game. =Expansion of cricket= With the continued colonisation of the West Indies by the British Empire came the adoption of many British ideals and activities by many African slaves and their descendants. This adoption was a consequence of constant positive reinforcement from their masters for participating in activities that were familiar such as cricket, and abstaining from those that were perceived as taboo. Eventually, slaves were granted permission to play with military officials, who at one point only played cricket amongst themselves, in restricted roles. Foremost, they were allowed to prepare the wicket before matches, although some were permitted to bowl or retrieve batted balls.Malcolm, p. 78 As official cricket clubs began to form, some black players were given the opportunity to play for white-majority clubs. However, many cricket clubs remained exclusively white, forcing black players to establish their own clubs that would only allow other blacks to join. Clubs such as the Barbados Cricket Committee (BCC), which was established in the late nineteenth century, adhered to the policy of an all-white team, while Jamaica's Melbourne Cricket Club was composed of only coloured professionals. The first inter-island competition took place in 1865 between Demerara and Barbados, at the Garrison Savannah. However, these matches were at first \\"organized and played almost exclusively by whites.\\" Over time, inter-racial games became more and more common, as black and white teams competed at first in an attempt to prove their dominance over the other territories. Some segregation still occurred, for instance black players were excluded \\"from clubhouse refreshment breaks during and after the game\\". Gradually, blacks began to be employed on professional teams, marking the start of the decline of segregation in the sport. =Societal impact= Cricket is traditionally the most popular sport in the West Indies, despite their independence from the United Kingdom. Games between England and West Indies teams during the post- colonization period were fraught with underlying political tension. The inclusion of black players in the West Indies team marked a moment of democratic integration in society. The talented West Indies players helped to overturn an existing idea of racial supremacy.Malcolm, p. 83. The societal impact of cricket in the West Indies is an example of the effects and complicated nature of class and race relations on the development of this imperial game, as well as the conflicting use of cricket as both a tool of imperial unity, as well as a medium to assert equality and independence for the West Indian countries. Before slavery was abolished in 1839, cricket was considered a ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù past time for blacks. In that same time period, it was also considered a way for the white elite to exhibit their loyalty to the Crown.Malcolm, p. 78. As explained in Expansion of cricket above, after the abolition of slavery, cricket would slowly be desegregated until it became the sport we know today. However two individuals worth mentioning are batsman George Headley who became captain of the West Indian cricket team to play England in 1947‚Äì48, and Barbadian, Frank Worrell, who was captain of the West Indies team against Australia in 1960-61. Worrell's appointment in particular was seen as a strong example of the developing nationalism and anti- colonialism of the time, as it was directly reflected in sporting culture.Malcolm, p. 82. The early 1970s to mid-1990s showed a major increase in the dominance of the West Indian cricket team. The general historical consensus is that this is due to an increase in fast bowling, and a strong ‚Äúus‚Äù versus ‚Äúthem‚Äù mentality, where ‚Äúus‚Äù was the black masses, and ‚Äúthem‚Äù was the privileged, dominant culture. The short-pitched fast bowling issue clearly had a racial dimension to it, and the West Indian cricket players of that time exerted a notable influence over the development of the game, and the society that loved it. In this way cricket served as a medium for both incorporation and resistance for West Indian society. Cricket created a sense of ‚Äúnational‚Äù identity, using quotations because the West Indies is composed of many different nations, while simultaneously challenging the traditional balances of power as long established by the colonial history of the region.Malcolm, p. 88. Governing body The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) is the governing body for professional and amateur cricket in the West Indies. It was originally formed in the early 1920s as the West Indies Cricket Board of Control (and is still sometimes referred by that name), but changed its name in 1996. The Board has its headquarters in St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda. The WICB has been a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1926 and is also a member of Americas Cricket Association. It operates the West Indies cricket team and West Indies A cricket team, organising Test tours and one-day internationals with other teams. Domestic competition The West Indies' major domestic competitions are the Regional Four Day Competition (First-class competition) and the NAGICO Regional Super50 (List A one-day competition) and more recently the Caribbean Premier League (domestic Twenty20 competition ‚Äì replacing the Caribbean T20, which in turn replaced the Stanford 20/20 that had been financed and organized by Sir Allen Stanford). Other domestic competitions include the TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge (three-day competition), TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge Limited Overs Series (one-day limited overs competition), CLICO West Indies Under-15 competition and the WIWCF Women's Senior Tournament. One prominent former competition (not originally organized by the WICB) was the Inter-Colonial Tournament.ESPN CricInfo http://www.espncricinfo.com/caribbean-premier- league-2013/content/story/663757.html In the case of the Regional Four Day Competition and the NAGICO Super50 (and formerly in the case of the Caribbean Twenty20) the following first-class domestic teams participate: * Barbados cricket team * Guyana cricket team * Jamaica cricket team * Leeward Islands cricket team * Trinidad and Tobago cricket team * Windward Islands cricket team For the NAGICO Super50, a seventh domestic team still participates: * Combined Campuses and Colleges cricket team For the TCL Under-19 West Indies Challenge (both the three-day and limited overs competitions) it is the Under-19 squads for these teams which participate, while for the CLICO Under-15 West Indies tournament it is the Under-15 squads for these teams which participate. In the 2004 TCL Under-19 Challenge the Under-19 Bermuda cricket team and an Under-19 combined Americas cricket team also took part. In the WIWCF Senior Tournament and in the defunct Stanford 20/20 competition the separate components of the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands compete individually. Additionally for the Stanford 20/20 competition teams from outside the West Indies sporting confederation, but within the Caribbean, also compete including the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Cuba (which was barred from competing in 2008 by the U.S. embargo), the Turks and Caicos Islands (both competing in 2008) as well as the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico (announced for the 2009 edition of the Stanford 20/20). In the Caribbean Premier League there are franchise teams competing, with each franchise currently representing one of the six traditional cricketing territories in the West Indies: * Patriots ‚Äì representing St Kitts and Nevis and the rest of the Leeward Islands * Tridents ‚Äì representing Barbados * Amazon Warriors ‚Äì representing Guyana * Tallawahs ‚Äì representing Jamaica * Zouks ‚Äì representing St. Lucia and the rest of the Windward Islands * Knight Riders ‚Äì representing Trinidad and Tobago Representative teams The West Indies cricket team, also known colloquially as The Windies or The West Indies, is a multi-national cricket team representing a sporting confederation of the West Indies. The \\"Windies\\" is one of the twelve elite international teams that play at the Test match cricket-level. The West Indies women's cricket team made its Test debut in 1976 and its ODI debut in 1979.

The Jagiellonian University's Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy are acclaimed as one of the largest medical academies in Poland. The school was established by King Casimir III of Poland in 1364.  The Jagiellonian University  The founding of the University in 1364 AD, painted by Jan Matejko(1838‚Äì1893). Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, Bishop of Krakow Jagiellonian University is the oldest institution of higher education in Poland. Established in 1364 by King Casimir III the Great, it is the second oldest university in Central-Eastern Europe, preceded by the Charles University in Prague, which was founded in 1348. Called Studium Generale in its early years, it was modeled after the Universities of Bologna and Padua and was initially composed of three faculties: Liberal Arts, Medicine, and Law. After its restoration in 1400, changes to the Academy's statute made it more resemble the Paris Sorbonne. For over 600 years, many prominent Poles and Europeans received their education within the walls of this University. It was here that Nicolaus Copernicus studied and in 1578 Walenty Fontana delivered the first academic lecture based on Copernicus' heliocentric theory, an inconceivable notion to many scholars at the time. In 1938, Karol Wojty≈Ça began his studies in Polish philology at Jagiellonian University, interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, when occupying forces closed the University. During the War, he actively participated in classes organized by the underground university. Upon taking Holy Orders and returning from his doctoral studies in Rome, he received his post-doctoral degree from Jagiellonian University in 1953, continuing to work at the University until 1954. In 1983, already as Pope, he was honored by University authorities with an Honorary Doctorate. After Poland regained independence following World War I, new institutions of higher education were established and older institutions were able to recover their Polish identity. With its already famous University, Krak√≥w already possessed adequate intellectual potential to help these new institutions. Despite numerous challenges, particularly economic, sustained scientific development continued at the University until the outbreak of World War II and Nazi German occupation. On November 6, 1939, in room number 26 at Collegium Novum, the teaching staff was gathered on orders by SS-Sturmbahnfuhrer Bruno Muller, who accused university authorities of illegal activity. On these false changes, all those present were arrested and deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Despite this grievous tragedy and loss of its greatest luminaries of science, on the initiative of Professor Mieczys≈Çaw Ma≈Çecki, Jagiellonian University established an underground university in 1942, the Rector of which was Professor W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szafer. After World War II, notwithstanding a shortage of teaching staff, the University resumed its functioning in 1945. However, despite the good will and sincere enthusiasm of all academic teachers and students, these efforts were soon stifled by ever- increasing political interference. Today Jagiellonian University combines tradition with the challenges of the modern world. In compliance with the principles of the Bologna Process, over 46 000 students study in 15 faculties on all three levels of study: Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral. One may choose to study from nearly a hundred majors. The European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) enables students to combine their studies at Jagiellonian University with coursework from other European universities. Teaching staff includes over 3600 academic instructors, 500 of whom hold the title of Professor. Its young academic staff and doctoral students are yearly awarded more than 10 percent of the prestigious Foundation for Polish Science scholarships. Researchers at Jagiellonian University effectively compete for the grants through European research programs and as many as 6 European Centers of Excellence operate within the University. In recent years, cooperation between scientists at Jagiellonian University and the business community has greatly increased. As a result, a number of research projects, mainly in the field of natural and exact sciences, have been introduced onto Polish and international markets. Jagiellonian University graduates do an excellent job of competing on both the domestic and foreign labor market. The University's legacy makes it not only an important center for scientific research and instruction, but also a center of Polish and European culture. It gathers representatives from all artistic disciplines and continues to inspire both faculty and students alike. The work of those connected with the University continues to influence the world in which we live and remains a part of Europe's humanistic landscape. History of the Medical College Founders of the University thumb Collegium Novum When King Casimir III the Great in 1364 established the University of Krak√≥w, there were initially three faculties. The Faculty of Medicine included two types of professors: Professor of Medicine, or lector ordinarius in medicines, and presumably a Professor of Astronomy, who would lecture on astrology, which for a long time remained an inextricable part of medicine. All lectures took place in the Royal Castle on Wawel Hill. King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, using jewels donated by his wife, Queen Jadwiga, financed the restoration of the University in 1400. Stanis≈Çaw of Skarbimierz, the first Rector of the University, stressed the importance of the Faculty of Medicine already in his inauguration speech. Soon after the restoration process, renowned Polish and foreign scholars began to arrive at the University. Jan Kro of Chociebu≈º (Johannes Kro de Kostebus) was one of its first Professors, as well as the first physician to be chosen as Rector of the University, a position he assumed in 1419. Other notable scholars include Jan of Pawia (Johannes de Saccis de Pavia), who introduced the first statute of the Faculty of Medicine in 1433, Marcin Kr√≥l of ≈ªurawica, and Piotr Gaszowiec of Loƒámierz, who, in addition to medicine, displayed great interest in astronomy and astrology. At the time, each physician who practiced in Krak√≥w, nationality notwithstanding, was obliged to teach as a lecturer of medicine, or lector in medicines. Owing to this fact, already in the 15th century, the teaching staff at the Faculty of Medicine numbered nearly 50 members. Collegium Novum assembly hall Theatrum Anatomicum Collegium Maius One of the greatest personalities of the 16th century was undoubtedly Maciej of Miech√≥w (1457-1523), a historian and physician; he served as Rector of the University for eight terms and is often called the \\"Polish Hippocrates\\". Other eminent scholars include Wojciech Oczko (1537-1599), author of many meticulous works on balneology and syphilology; Sebastian Petrycy of Pilzno (1554-1626), a clinician, philanthropist, and renowned expert on Aristotle; and Josephus Struthius (1510-1568), a critic of Galen and author of Sphygmicae artis libri quinque (1555), a treatise on the human pulse, he went on to lecture in Padua. The 17th and 18th centuries saw a decline in the University, marked mainly by external factors (e.g., the 1655-1660 Swedish invasions), which led to a decrease in the number of students. Those students who decided to stay in Krak√≥w, especially medical students, oftentimes received an incomplete education and had to supplement their studies abroad, mainly in Italy, where they obtained doctoral degrees. The second half of the 18th century saw the condition of the University improve dramatically when, in 1773, the Commission of National Education entrusted Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj with the task of reform, carried out from 1778 to 1780. This reform initiated a new period in the history of the Faculty of Medicine: Professor Andrzej Badurski (1740-1789) worked to establish a clinic, ultimately opened in 1780, and Rafa≈Ç J√≥zef Czerwiakowski (1743-1816) began to teach surgery and, as Professor of Anatomy, was one of the first to perform posthumous examinations in Poland. When Krak√≥w was partitioned as part of the Austrian Empire in 1796, attempts were made at transforming the University into an Austrian institution through the introduction of foreign teachers. Not until 1809, when Krak√≥w was partitioned as part of the Duchy of Warsaw, did the University regain its Polish identity. Jagiellonian Library The University entered into a period of prosperity when Krak√≥w gained political independence in 1815-1846. The university owes its renown to such academics as J√≥zef Brodowicz (1790-1885), Professor of Internal Diseases; Ludwik Bierkowski (1801-1860), Professor of Surgery; and J√≥zef Majer (1808-1899) and Fryderyk Skobel (1806-1878), Professors of theoretical sciences. The 19th century saw a period of further prosperity at the Faculty of Medicine and University, owing to such outstanding scholars and physicians as J√≥zef Dietl (1804-1878); Edward Korczy≈Ñski (1844-1905); Walery Jaworski (1849-1924), in internal diseases; Jan Mikulicz Radecki (1850-1905); and Ludwik Rydygier (1850-1920) and Alfred Obali≈Ñski (1843-1898), in surgery. The beginnings of stomatology date back to the 18th century. Already in 1779, Professor Rafa≈Ç Czerwiakowski included dentistry as part of his university lectures for barbers-surgeons. From 1899, the completion of medical studies also required participation in dentistry lectures. Similar to ophthalmology, orthopedics, or laryngology, dentistry was at first considered a part of surgery, long remaining within this field. Formed at Jagiellonian University in 1902, Poland's first Chair of Dentistry continued the process of establishing dentistry as an independent discipline. This Chair was headed by Professor Wincenty ≈Åepkowski (1866-1935). During World War II, medical studies were secretly organized and run by Professor Stanis≈Çaw Madziarski. In 1950, all Faculties of Medicine in Poland were separated from their universities and transformed into independent institutions, called \\"academies of medicine\\". Notable events during the functioning of the Nicolaus Copernicus Academy of Medicine (i.e., present-day Jagiellonian University Medical College) included the formation of new clinics (e.g., 3rd Clinic of Internal Diseases, 3rd Clinic of Surgery) as well as the Department of Dentistry at the Faculty of Medicine. Established in 1948, the Department of Dentistry grew to include four chairs in preventive dentistry, prosthadontics, dental surgery, and orthodontics. Each newly established department was located in old tenements or post-hospital buildings, as practically no new buildings were being built. Since 1950, the Faculty of Medicine at the Academy of Medicine educated a great number of students, filling deficits in the post-war health service and improving the health of the general population. All of its Chairs and Clinics made great strides in teaching and research, oftentimes gaining worldwide recognition. In 1965, the Institute of Pediatrics, a technological and architectural wonder at the time, was built in Prokocim District. This facility was built thanks to support from the Polish-American community and American government. Located far outside of the old town, it was built in an area which was to also include a future campus and medical center. In the 1970s and 1980s, three student dormitories and a modern Medical Library were built in its immediate vicinity. In September 2000, an Institute of Stomatology was formed. Located on ul. Montelupich (Montelupich Street), it is equipped to 21st century standards and is the site of research and educational activities. In the interest of ensuring the highest quality of teaching, a Conference Center was put into use in 2006. This facility is meant to accommodate student needs and also serves as a venue for conferences and conventions. Faculty of Medicine - School of Medicine in English The School of Medicine in English is a structural unit of the Faculty of Medicine. Its first students were admitted in October 1994. During the 2008/2009 academic year, over 480 students from five continents and twenty countries were enrolled in the School, with the majority coming from Norway, the US, and Canada. The School offers two programs of medicine, taught exclusively in English. This first is a 4-year program for graduates of pre-medical college/university programs in the USA/Canada and the second is a 6-year program for graduates of secondary schools. Graduates of these programs are conferred a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree by the Jagiellonian University Faculty of Medicine. Academic staff include the most experienced scholars and lecturers at Jagiellonian University, as well as foreign academics from the US, England, Germany, and other countries. These English-language programs remain in compliance with Polish and EU standards of teaching, the US Department of Education (Stafford Loan Program), and Medical Board of California. Under agreements with different universities, final year students of the School of Medicine in English have the opportunity to complete elective rotations at the following schools: * University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY * Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA * University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA * University of California, Irvine (UCI), Irvine, CA * University of California, San Diego (UCSD), San Diego, CA * Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLU), Loma Linda, CA * Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland, OH Graduates of both programs are eligible to apply for residency and postgraduate training programs at university teaching hospitals in various countries, including the United States (Illinois, Alabama, Arizona, Michigan, Utah, Vermont, New York, Georgia, New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, West Virginia, Ohio, Louisiana, South Carolina and Washington DC), Canada (Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, Alberta), Australia, United Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, and Poland. Students can compete to win the University Vice- Rector Cup in skiing or take part in a similarly challenging swimming competition. Each academic year begins with a memorable ceremony of the Inauguration Walk, a tradition in which professors, lecturers and students trek from one university building to another. May 12 is the University Day, which commemorates the institution's establishment in 1364. Each year, university students celebrate this (or, more appropriately, their) day called \\"Juvenalia,\\" as they are given a symbolic key to the gates of the city. This signals the beginning of several days of festivities, sometimes lasting into the early hours of the morning. History of Pharmacy The first Chairs of Pharmacy in Poland were formed as a direct result of the disbanding of the Jesuit order in 1773. At the time, this order had complete control over the entire Polish education system. The fact that the Commission of National Education was able to take over Jesuit possessions made education reform all the more possible. The end result was a three-stage secular educational system with elementary schools at the base and two universities (or Main Schools, as they were called) - the Crown School of Krak√≥w and the Lithuanian School of Vilnius. Andrzej Badurski was the major initiator of reform in the teaching of pharmacy. Andrzej Szaser also helped in implementing these reforms. In 1783, the Chair of Pharmacy and Medical Matter was established at the Crown School of Krak√≥w. Its first Professor was Jan Szaster (1746-1793), a Krak√≥w pharmacist and Doctor of Medicine. In 1804, pharmacy training was shortened to one year in all schools of the Austrian monarchy, including the Crown School of Krak√≥w. After the Republic of Krak√≥w was established in 1815, a two-year pharmacy course was introduced into the Krak√≥w School. From 1809, the education of pharmacists took place at two faculties, namely at the Faculty of Medicine, and Philosophy. In 1809, J√≥zef Sawiczewski was appointed Head of the Chair of Pharmacy and Medical Matter. After his death in 1825, this function was entrusted to Florian Sawiczewski, the most outstanding Pharmacy Professor of the time. In 1851, he was named Rector of Jagiellonian University. In 1833, the Chair of Pharmacy was integrated with the Chair of General and Applied Chemistry, later a part of the Faculty of Philosophy, which substantially changed how the teaching of pharmacy was organized. In the period from 1857 to 1920, pharmacy students had their classes conducted by such renowned professors as Edward Janczewski, J√≥zef ≈Åazarski, Emil Czyrnia≈Ñski, Karol Olszewski, Zygmunt Wr√≥blewski, Marian Smoluchowski, Rafa≈Ç Czerwiakowski, J√≥zef Rostafi≈Ñski, and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szajnocha. Amidst nationwide discussion, the teaching of pharmacy was completely reformed after Poland regained independence in 1918. Pharmaceutical departments were transformed into independent faculties of Pharmacy with four year teaching periods. The first Head of the Department of Pharmacy at Jagiellonian University was Professor Karol Dziewo≈Ñski, followed by Professor Tadeusz Estreicher, who took up the post in 1926. On the eve of World War II, the Krakow Department of Pharmacy had five separate units: Applied Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical Botany, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Zoology for Pharmacy, and the Garden of Medical Plants, a part of the Jagiellonian University Botanical Garden. In 1947, the Department of Pharmacy, operating within the Faculty of Philosophy, was transformed into a separate Faculty of Pharmacy. Professor Marek Gatty-Kostyal was appointed as its first dean. The Krak√≥w Faculty of Pharmacy entered a new era on January 1, 1950, when, along with the Faculty of Medicine, it was separated from Jagiellonian University and transformed into the Academy of Medicine. Another milestone in the history of the Krak√≥w Faculty of Pharmacy was the formation of the Department of Medical Analytic. This Department, with a separate 5-year teaching program, began to function during the 1977/1978 academic year. The year in which the Faculties of Pharmacy and Medicine were rejoined with Jagiellonian University was of special importance to the Faculty of Pharmacy. Among others, it was the first time the newly built seat of the Department of Pharmacy on ul. Medyczna (Medyczna Street) was put to use. A modern didactic base and expanding set of research equipment allowed to extend its range of international academic and didactic cooperation as well as actively participate in the activities of the European Association of Faculties of Pharmacy (EAFP), of which the Faculty is a member since 2000. One of the consequences of this change was a considerable increase in the number of elective courses offered. International programs carried out at the Faculty also allow for a constant perfecting of the process of education. In 2006, by decision of the Minister of Science and Higher Education, the Faculty of Pharmacy was classified as a category - A institution. Faculty of Health Sciences Based on the decision of the Jagiellonian University Senate of 26 February 1997, with effect from 1 October 1997 Department of Nursing became the Department of Health. With effect from 1 October 2007 renamed the Department of the Faculty of Health Sciences. Faculty of Health Sciences continues the rich tradition of training nurses. In Poland it was launched in 1911 in Krak√≥w at the School of Nursing, which was transformed in 1925 in the University School of Nurses and Hygienists. Its operation was interrupted by World War II, after which, the School has resumed operations, educating nurses at the level of secondary vocational education. Teaching at the Master's level nurses started in Krak√≥w in 1975 creating a Department of Nursing, Medical University, who as part of the College of Medicine, he returned to Alma Mater in 1993 Jagellonica Institute of Nursing after the creation of the Department continued to teach master's level nurses, and in 1998 began - first in Poland - conducting classes in the two-cycle. Department also continues the tradition of training for midwives, which was launched in Krak√≥w in 1780 in College Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Jagiellonian University School of the Crown. In 1895, midwifery education has been excluded from school and taken over by Imperial Royal College of Midwives, and after independence, the National School of Midwives. In 2005, the Faculty of Health Sciences was held on the first call for obstetric studies degree. In the same year was renamed the Institute of Nursing and Midwifery. The activities of the Department also refers to the idea over a century, and today the interdisciplinary knowledge that is public health. Division continues for the School of Public Health set up in 1991 as an inter-departmental unit of the Medical University and the Jagiellonian University. The first Polish School of Public Health was established with the support of the Ministry of Health and Welfare and with the advice of representatives of the French Ministry of Health. School team in 1991 began an intensive education and a variety of activities aimed at preparing managers for the modern needs of a changing Polish health care system. In 1997, The school became the Institute of Public Health. In subsequent years, the Institute conducted a variety of post-graduate diploma in hospital management, postgraduate studies for people working in managerial positions in health institutions, the pharmaceutical inspectors and studies for those carrying out tasks in the field of health programs. The Institute also conducts training at the direction of public health, specialty health control, as well as international Masters EuroPubHealth. Department of Emergency Medicine by teaching in the field of emergency medical services. Initially, paramedics training takes place under the direction of nursing specialties (the first intake in 2001). Since 2004 the above-mentioned line was pursued in the direction of public health and in 2007 was the first recruitment for medical emergency, as a distinct field of study. 15 January 2009 Department of Emergency Medicine found separated from the structure of the Institute of Public Health and transformed into an independent unit of the Department. The Faculty of Health Sciences since 1998, is also conducted training at the direction of physiotherapy. In connection with the Malopolska Region to improve the quality of education in the medical professions, in 2001 in Krak√≥w is an agreement between the Ma≈Çopolska Voivodship and the Jagiellonian University on joint action to amend the system of education in the profession of physiotherapy techniques. As a result of this agreement led to increased recruitment for the Department faculty, liquidated Medical School No. 4 in Krak√≥w, and education as a whole took the Department to adopt against the study of academic staff. Institute of Physiotherapy focusing unit underlying the teaching and scientific research for this direction was established in 2006. The creation of the Department was responding to a new socio-economic situation in Poland in connection with health care reform and the new labor market. These changes necessitated the establishment of priorities in education. A new look for the training of health workers was the result of several factors: a new management philosophy in health care, the transition from medical care to health promotion and disease prevention, a strong emphasis on primary health care and medical technology development significantly. It was necessary to meet the demand for skilled health workers who had to fill managerial positions of high and middle level, and ensure the supply of specialized medical personnel (nurses, physiotherapists, midwives, emergency workers, sanitary inspectors). This was possible due to set out by the University and the Marshal of Malopolska agreements on joint action concerning changes to education systems in some medical professions education. First, in 1999, involved the training of nurses, the next (described above), 2001 related training of physiotherapists, and the last on the training of midwives was concluded in 2005 Currently, the Department launched the five fields of study: nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy, public health, medical emergency and a specialization in health control, as well as student exchanges are carried out under the Socrates-Erasmus. The structure of the Faculty of Health Sciences consists of three institutes: the Institute of Nursing and Midwifery, Institute of Public Health and the Institute of Physiotherapy. Faculty of Health Sciences as an academic unit, focuses primarily on educating students, creating the possibility of personal, professional and scientific development. Further, leads a broad scientific research activities and its staff act as consultants assisting the health care environment. Division develops activities concerning the dissemination of knowledge including in nursing clinical internship in internal and environmental, obstetrics and gynecological diseases, epidemiology, health promotion, environmental health problems, the case of an emergency in the states of a sudden life-threatening accidents and catastrophes, health psychology and medical education. The Faculty of his scientific activity also takes an interdisciplinary approach to the subject of disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care and rehabilitation. Employees specialize in research on issues of organization and economics of health, economy, pharmaceuticals and medical materials, computerization and dissemination of information problems in health care. The Faculty conducted advanced research in the field of medical biology, including immunology, cell biology, reproductive endocrinology, physiology and pathophysiology of the digestive system, ergonomics and exercise. Further, by scientific and educational cooperation with foreign centers (including universities), including Maastricht (Netherlands), Sheffield (England), Rennes and Lailly-en-Val (France), Granada (Spain), Copenhagen (Denmark), Plzen (Czech Republic), Kaunas (Lithuania) and Kristianstad (Sweden).

Its entry in the Hipparcos catalogue lists a spectral type of K5V, classifying it as a dwarf star. , three extrasolar planets are thought to be orbiting the star. There is currently little information on these planets. The name of this star comes from its identifier in the Henry Draper catalogue.  Planetary system  Orbiting the star are three planets, whose discovery was announced in 2008; the discovery paper was published in 2009. The inner planet has a mass at least 7.5 times that of Earth, and is termed a super-Earth (this classification is based solely on the mass of the planet and should not be taken to imply that the planet could support Earthlike conditions). The middle planet and the outer planet are gas giants. The orbital periods for three planets are 9.3743 days for a 7.56 ME planet, 962 days for a 0.64 MJ planet, and 2172 days for a 0.54 MJ planet. This solution is unstable, more data are required to constrain the orbital position of planet d. Diagram of the (probable) HD 181433 Star System.

Between 1996 and 1998, Street worked as a Research Assistant Professor at the University of South Carolina. Street has said his work was only enjoyable to him \\"for the first several years or so...As I moved up the ranks, however, I was spending more and more of my time writing grant proposals, filling out paperwork and playing departmental politics.\\" Street found that his profession involved \\"a lot of doing the same thing over and over again.\\" Game design career Ensemble Studios, the team behind the real-time strategy series Age of Empires, employed Street as a designer in 1998. With no education or experience in the game industry, Street suspects he was accepted due to his \\"writing and teaching experience, historical breadth, personal hygiene, gudd speling , creativity, [and] my talent at capturing live alligators\\", as well as the user-created scenario for Age of Empires he submitted with his application, which later appeared in Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome. Street helped develop every Age of Empires game from Rise of Rome on, until his departure from the company. At first he designed in-game scenarios and maps, and later graduated to being the team's lead designer. Street was hired by Blizzard Entertainment in February 2008, and was the lead systems designer on the MMORPG World of Warcraft until November 2013. He described his role at Blizzard as, \\"Systems design specifically is everything that is not level, story, quest, PvP or encounter design. My team handles everything from mechanics to items to trade skills to achievements to UI design.\\" On the World of Warcraft message boards, he is known by his user name \\"Ghostcrawler\\". Street worked in a similar capacity with Blizzard as he did with Ensemble as a designer. \\"Game designers are not artists or programmers, but we use the tools developed by the programmers and the assets created by the artists to get content into the game. Programmers make the game run, artists make it beautiful, but it is the designer's job to make it fun.\\" Street became well-known in the World of Warcraft community during the public beta test for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, during which he was frequently communicating with beta testers on the message boards. He was often on the message boards announcing changes to the game or discussing them with players. Because \\"game balance is one of the most controversial aspects of any multiplayer game... I benefit from being able to engage the community directly.\\" Apart from discussions on the Blizzard forums, Street also interacted with the World of Warcraft community regularly via his Twitter account.

He performed and recorded on bass clarinet as well. He had a brief career in music and is revered for his 1966 self-titled free jazz release. He was known also as a sound engineer. Watts played piano early in his life; he did not play music regularly in his teens. He studied at Alabama State College, where he was a founding member of SNCC; this association led to his being forced to leave the state at the behest of the governor of Alabama. He moved to New York, where he lived in a loft building on Cooper Square which also had as a tenant Leroi Jones (later Amiri Baraka), with whom he participated in the Organization of Young Men. Watts returned to college in New York, completing his studies in 1962; he then moved to Paris to study painting at the Sorbonne and began playing saxophone for extra money. Returning to New York in 1963, Watts studied under Don Cherry and played in his loft and around the city with Jiunie Booth, Henry Grimes, J.C. Moses, and others. He also continued painting, producing work strongly influenced by Willem de Kooning. Watts's loft attracted many established and up-and-coming musicians who would hang out there and play at parties, including Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, Don Cherry, Archie Shepp, and Pharoah Sanders. In 1965 he decided to devote himself to music more fully, and moved to Denmark for further study. When he returned to New York in 1966, he recorded an album for ESP-Disk with the assistance of composer Clifford Thornton, and recorded for Savoy Records in 1968. He wrote film scores and did production work for his own films, eventually abandoning music to work in film and record production. Watts moved back and forth between Europe and New York; he taught briefly at Wesleyan University, assisting Sam Rivers and Clifford Thornton. Late in his life he moved to Santa Cruz, California.

It is located on United States Route 42 in Wilberforce, Ohio, in a house purchased by Young in 1907 that was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974. The monument is administered by the National Park Service; the house is open by appointment for tours. Description and history The Charles Young House is located in a rural setting southwest of Wilberforce, on the north side of US 42 between Clifton and Stevenson Roads. The house is an eclectically styled 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof that has deeply overhanging eaves. A T-shaped porch extends across the middle three bays of the five-bay front facade, supported by square posts. A series of ells extend to the rear, giving the building a T shape. Charles Young was born into slavery in Kentucky in 1864. He was the third African American graduate of West Point, the first black U.S. national park superintendent, the first African American military attach√©, and the highest ranking black officer in the United States Army until his death in 1922. He also taught military science at Wilberforce University, during which time he purchased this house, which he called \\"Youngsholm\\". The house was built in 1832, and is reported to have served as a way station on the Underground Railroad. On March 25, 2013, under the Antiquities Act, President Barack Obama designated the house as the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument, a unit of the National Park Service. Operated as a house museum with exhibits about Young and the Buffalo Soldiers, it is currently open for public visitation by appointment.

It was founded in 1968 in an old 16th-century paper mill on the Bystrzyca Dusznicka river.  History  The Paper Mill in Duszniki had been erected prior to 1562 and its first recorded owner was Ambrosius Tepper. During the flood in 1601 the paper mill suffered partial destruction. The contemporary owner, Gregor Kretschmer, reconstructed the plant and resumed the production of paper. On this basis, one may assume that the existing paper mill is one of the oldest preserved and operational structures of its kind in Europe. For the Kretschmer family, paper manufacture became a source of immense wealth and elevated social status, as confirmed in the year 1607 by Emperor Rudolph II Habsburg, who allowed Gregor and Georg Kretschmer to use their own coat of arms, which was followed shortly afterwards by their inclusion among the country‚Äôs nobility. The paper mill was subsequently purchased by the Heller family in 1706 along with the associated privilege to produce handmade paper. In the year 1750, Anton Benedikt Heller received the title of royal papermaker. From 1772 onwards, the mill remained in the hands of the Ossendorf family until its acquisition by the Wiehr family in 1822. It was only in 1939 that the family chose to part with their property, which was acquired by the municipal authorities of the town of Duszniki-Zdr√≥j. The authorities intended to convert the building into a museum; this plan would only reach fruition in 1968, however, when the Papermaking Museum was officially opened to the public. The manufacture of handmade paper was interrupted in 1905, although the production process was later reinstated in 1971, forming a vital part of the museum display. The facility also accepts special orders for this type of paper. The paper mill is situated on the Bystrzyca Dusznicka river bank. The structure consists of three interconnected buildings. The paper mill building itself features a brick ground-floor level section above which rises the upper portion of the building, parts of which feature a wattle-and-daub structure. The entire design is crowned by wooden gables adorned with massive volutes. The eastern side of the building is adjoined by the post-and-beam drying house, its walls clad with weatherboards. Both buildings are covered with tall gable roofs featuring a distinctive multi-stepped design, their surfaces clad with wood shingles. The slatted vents positioned at several levels of the roofs are a distinguishing feature of all paper mills of the period. In the mid-18th century, an octagonal entrance pavilion was added on the northern side of the compound, linked to the paper mill building by a wooden covered walkway which spans the river canal beneath. In the late 18th and early 19th century, the paper mill was redesigned, receiving a highly decorative fa√ßade which sets the complex in Duszniki-Zdr√≥j apart from similar structures surviving in Europe today. The third-storey rooms of the paper mill building are of a highly representational character. Both the walls and the ceiling of this part of the edifice are adorned with painted decorations which were first discovered in 1969 and then subjected to conservation works in the years 1986-87. These wall paintings were executed back in the third quarter of the 18th century at the request of the royal papermaker Johann Joseph Ossendorf and were designed as a trompe l‚Äô≈ìil decoration combining various features of architectural, landscape and figurative painting. One of the paintings portrays an Old Testament scene, with Potiphar‚Äôs wife unsuccessfully attempting to seduce Joseph. This scene is an obvious reference to the man who commissioned the painted decorations as well as to his elevated social status. The use of decorations of this kind inside what was still, in the essence, a manufacturing facility harking back to the era when the industrial revolution was still a long way off is truly unique and has no counterparts anywhere else in Europe. The Paper Mill in Duszniki-Zdr√≥j is one of the dozen surviving paper mills in Western Europe which still engage in the production of traditional, handmade paper. The unique age-old technique, still in constant use at the paper mill, involves the manual draining of fibre solution to form individual sheets of paper. The distinguishing features of typical paper mill compounds, such as the paper mill proper and the drying house, are both still extant and feature a highly distinctive spatial layout. Remnants of the mill-race, which used to provide the energy necessary to propel the equipment inside the paper mill, have also survived to this day. The museum displays mainly exhibitions on the history of paper. Since 2001 the museum has been organizer of \\"≈öwiƒôto Papieru\\" (The Holiday of Paper) ‚Äì a festival promoting the knowledge and importance of paper, print, bookbinding and contemporary art. It is the biggest, two-day event, which has been organised at the last weekend of July ‚Äì the anniversary of the museum establishment. The event promotes the paper mill, the authors of regional products and the active tourism. The assumption of the Paper Festival is providing the visitors‚Äô active participation in the workshops and the possibility of taking the effects of their work home. The setting of stands is designed to enable the visitors to begin with getting to know the materials and paper primary products and then to go through paper making (done on their own), investigating its properties (historic metrological apparatus), getting to know the printing techniques (gravure and relief printing) and the methods of traditional paper ornamentation (marbling, shibori, batik). Additionally, there are numerous competitions with valuable prizes ‚Äì both skill games (such as toilet paper throw) and knowledge games connected with the knowledge about the paper and the Museum of Papermaking. The complement of the attractions are the paper art, craft and regional products stalls. Every year during the Festival, there are also additional exhibitions of paper art. The paper mill is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated October 12, 2011 and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland.  Architecture  The paper mill is one of the most architecturally valuable industrial monuments in Europe. It is characteristic for its shingle roofing trimmed with a baroque volute from the west and the original entrance pavilion and the 17-19th century wall paintings in the interior. The tradition of papermaking in Duszniki dates back to the 16th century; the first record about the paper mill comes from 1562, and tells about the sale of his shares in the moulding room by Ambrosius Tepper to Nicolas Kretschmer. The original paper mill was destroyed in the flood in 1601. The mill was rebuilt and making of paper was resumed in 1605. The museum was opened for visitors on July 26, 1968, and three years later paper production by hand was launched on show. The moulding room soon became an attraction drawing tens of thousands of tourists every year. The flood of 1998 inflicted a great damage on the paper mill. Water washed the foundations of the drying room and deposited tons of mud and debris inside the building. The damage was repaired thanks to the financial assistance from the Polish government. In 2007-2008 due to extensive alterations, the museum was adapted to the needs of disabled visitors.  UNESCO (Tentative List)  In 2019 inscribed on the Polish UNESCO information list (Tenative List)  Permanent exhibition  210px The museum is the only preserved and still running building of this kind in Poland and one of the very few in Central Europe. The current exhibition features: * the beautifully restored, shingle-roofed building of the paper mill ‚Äì a unique monument of technology, * production on show of handmade paper: \\"the hollander\\" for breaking cellulose, moulding vats, moulding frames and presses, etc. * exhibitions on development of papermaking technology including sheets with watermarks and filigrees, historic moulding frames, models of papermaking machines and one of the greatest world-wide collections of historic apparatuses for measuring paper characteristics, * exhibition on the history of painting, * exhibition of original large-size papermaking machines, * garden with fibrous plants used in paper production.

The term (a contraction of the expression ‚Äúwindy winners‚Äù) goes back to the original way of experiencing social success by individuals uninhibited with regards to their own success, not looking as much to reconcile rival existential expectations (such as the bobos, for example) but rather to juxtapose them in a way which is not seeking to constitute a system.

A pair of black Havaianas Top being worn Brazilian team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Havaianas is a Brazilian brand of flip-flop sandals created and patented in 1962. It is currently owned by Brazilian manufacturing company Alpargatas S.A.. Inspired by Japanese zori sandals, Robert Fraser became the first to mass-produce flip-flops out of rubber. The name Havaianas is derived from the feminine form of the Portuguese word for \\"Hawaiians\\", and the pattern on the soles of the sandals is designed to resemble the straw soles of zori. Originally, all Havaianas featured white insoles with colored outsoles and straps. Because of their simplicity and low price, the sandals became popular with Brazil's lowest social classes. A fashion trend starting in the 1990s involved inverting the sole to make the coloured outsole face upwards, creating the appearance of a monochrome sandal. In response, Havaianas released a new line of eight one-colour sandals called Havaianas Top in 1994. Citizens of higher social classes then began to wear Havaianas. In 1998, with the impending FIFA World Cup in France, Havaianas introduced a line of flip- flops featuring a small Brazilian flag on the strap to show support of the Brazilian team. According to Havaianas's Twitter account, the brand \\"embodies Brazil's fun, vibrant & spontaneous way of life.\\"How a Brazilian flip-flop took over the world, Baker, Vicky. Published 16 July 2017. Havaianas flip- flops are the most popular in the world, with 200 million pairs being sold every year. They are often found in surf wear retail and surf apparel stores.  Global expansion  Beginning = In the 1960s, the flip-flop was a practical shoe worn by the working-class and was only made in a blue-and-white design. It became so associated with the poorer sector of society that it was listed as one of the fundamental goods by the Brazilian government, along with other household products. Traveling merchants sold them from the back of their vans. Variations in color and design are claimed to have all started serendipitously in 1969 when one batch of flip-flops came out to be green and suddenly gained popularity. = Marketing techniques = Havaianas officially became a global brand in 2000, despite other brands imitating its style. To branch out to the global market, several marketing strategies were employed. Angela Hirata, the director of foreign trade for Alpargatas S.A. has explained that Havaianas was marketed to both the low-end market and the high-end market for all classes to purchase the shoe. The sandal can be purchased for US$6 to $40 in Brazil, but in the United States, the sandal can range at a more inflated price from US$11 to US$75.Flip-Flop fly: Brazil's best-known beach shoes step out on the feet of jet-setters and peasants alike, Galanternick, Mery. Published 1 July 2003. The hallmark of Havaianas's success is innovation. Creative styles with various colors were manufactured in addition to closed-toed sandals for customers who live in cooler climates. Sandals with embellishments, like Swarovski crystals were also integrated in the new styles to be used for fashion shows and to be worn by models on runways. Another necessity was to invest greatly in sales and advertising of the shoes. Today, more advertising is seen online, but colorful print advertisements were utilized to attract consumers to Havaianas. Several rival brands have also served as a hindrance, such as Crocs, Rip Curl and Quicksilver. To combat these companies, Havaianas attracted new markets. The brand has also responded and remains flexible to changes in the market and consumers' preferences. For example, a drop in sales were noticed when Havaianas were being manufactured outside of Brazil and consequently, a decision was made to build another plant within Brazil. In total, the company has maintained popularity domestically and internationally with the aforementioned marketing strategies. Total revenue from Havaianas has been reported by Alpargatas S.A. to have increased from US$1.7bn in 2008 to US$2.6bn in 2011.How Havaianas Built A Global Brand, Turpin, Dominique. Published 2 September 2013. In 2017 it was announced that they would be sponsoring the Sahara Force India Formula One team.https://www.forceindiaf1.com/partners/havaianas = Brand identity and extension = Brand identity also contributes to Havaianas's global outreach. The company has leveraged Brazil's positive identity to build a successful brand. As a result, advertisements for Havaianas and the shoes themselves are colorful and simple. Entire shops devoted to the brand exist internationally and the shoes are sold in over 80 countries, including those who experience varying climates. Brand extension has been utilized as an effective way to mitigate this seasonality. The brand has extended to include towels, sunglasses, and espadrilles. In most recent years, several ranges have been launched, such as a flat range, a sunglasses range, and a clothing collection. The usage of these techniques has reached people from all classes and from different areas across the globe. Millions of people wear Havaianas, whether it be in the form of flip-flops, apparel, or accessories.  The present  Havaianas flip-flops displayed in a shop in Costa del Sol, Spain. The brand is highly successful and Havaianas are worn by customers around the world. However, Alpargatas S.A., Havaianas's manufacturing company, was previously owned by J&F; Investments. Alleged discussions of bribery took place and has hurt J&F; Investments economically. As of July 2017, Alpargatas is owned by three Brazilian banks.

It was named for Manasseh Cutler, a New England physician, botanist, and minister who wrote the University's charter in 1804. Description and history Originally built in 1816 and the College Edifice, the building did not officially open until 1819 due to a fire. Manasseh Cutler Hall occupies a central position on the Ohio University Campus Green. It is a three-story brick structure, with a gabled roof topped by a wooden tower and cupola. The main facade is nine bays wide, with the main entrance at its center, topped by a semi-oval fanlight. The windows in the floors above the entrance are Palladian in style, that on the second floor topped by a half-round window. The tower has two stages, the first being square with a round window in the front face, and the second octagonal with louvered openings. The hall was completed in 1819, and is the oldest academic building in the historic Northwest Territory. The hall initially housed dormitories and laboratory space, as well as the office of the university president. The roof was raised in 1882 by about three feet. In 1937 the interior of the building underwent a complete modernization, which included the addition of metal staircases and an elevator. The roof was restored to its original roofline in 1949, and the building exterior now looks much as it did when first built. Today's Uses Today, the building houses the Office of the President, the president's cabinet, Office of the Executive Vice President & Provost, Vice President of Student Affairs and other senior administrators and academic administrators. The building is a centerpiece of the University's historic district and often used a photo backdrop for graduating seniors and other professional photography.

Previously known as Lazell, Perkins and Company, by the mid-19th century, the Bridgewater Iron Manufacturing Company was one of the largest iron works in the United States, specializing in heavy castings and forgings. The property was later acquired by the Stanley Works, with the surrounding village still known to this day as Stanley. The location was most recently used for manufacturing by the Bridgewater Foundry Company until 1988. It has since been converted into a small public park, with only the remnants of a stone storehouse remaining. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Site history The industrial history of the site began in 1694, when David Perkins was granted permission to construct a dam across the Town River by the colonial government of Massachusetts. By 1707, Perkins had established a blacksmith shop at the site. In 1785, brothers Isaac and Nathan Lazell built a new slitting mill on the site - the second mill in the country to be erected after the end of the Revolutionary War. (The construction of new iron mills had been prohibited by the British Crown since 1750). A second slitting mill was added in 1793. By 1795, the Lazell brothers were manufacturing over 445 tons of iron per year.David R.

In 1816, Carey died and the company was renamed Lazell, Perkins & Company. In 1825, the company became incorporated as the Bridgewater Iron Manufacturing Company, but continued doing business as Lazell, Perkins & Company for many years after.Leading pursuits and leading men: A treatise on the principal trades and manufactures of the United States; E. Young, 1856 In 1830, the company began manufacturing steam engines and large additions were made to the works. However, this endeavor was discontinued after just a few years, with the firm deciding to concentrate on its iron and foundry businesses, including the machinery used in the production of these goods. In 1835, upon the death of Nathan Lazell, Jr., Nahum Stetson became treasurer. In the years to follow, Stetson, who had been with the firm since 1825, would guide the company through a period of great expansion, surviving the great financial Panics of 1837 and 1857. With his successes in Bridgewater, Stetson would also become associated with several other iron works in the area, including the Weymouth Iron Company in 1841, the Tremont Iron Works in Wareham in 1846, and the Providence Iron Company in 1854. Stetson was also later associated with the Old Colony Iron works in Taunton, as well as numerous other businesses in the region.Representative men and old families of southeastern Massachusetts, J.H. Beers & Co., 1912 In 1845, the Fall River Railroad reached Bridgewater, and the following year, a connection to Boston was completed, allowing the company much easier access to these markets. The company grew rapidly during this time, and by the early 1850s, it employed 250 men and contained about 10 acres devoted to manufacturing. James Ferguson became superintendent of the works in 1856, and would be in charge of the daily operation of the company for several decades.History of Plymouth County, Massachusetts, Part 2; Duane Hamilton Hurd, J.

The section of Bridgewater surrounding the plant soon became known as Stanley. The company operated the site until 1928, when production was shifted to New Britain. The site was then acquired by the George O. Jenkins Company, for storage of scrap paper. The property was heavily damaged by the Hurricane of 1938. Between 1946 and 1988, two buildings on the site were operated by the Bridgewater Foundry Company, which produced grey iron castings. Recent history The property was donated to the Town of Bridgewater in 1994 by the Brousseau and Landner families, the last owners of the foundry.

Built about 1840, it was the residence of suffragette Harriet Taylor Upton (1853-1945) from 1887 to 1931. The house was the headquarters of Upton's National American Woman's Suffrage Association from 1903 to 1905, and was thus an important site in the early 20th century push for women's suffrage. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992. It is owned by a local nonprofit, and is open for tours by appointment. Description and history The Harriet Taylor Upton House is located in downtown Warren, on the northeast side of Mahoning Avenue near the municipal offices, an area known locally as \\"Millionaire's Row\\". It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboarded exterior, and single-story porch across the front. A single story ell extends to the right at a recess, with an open balustraded veranda in front. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the right bay. Windows are long on the first floor and shorter on the second, with projecting cornices above the second-floor windows. The interior has been restored to a turn-of-the-century appearance, after a long period of use as a multiunit residence. The house was built about 1840 by General Simon Perkins for his son Henry. Original carrying Egyptian features, it was at some point given a Greek Revival makeover, the style it had when occupied by Harriet Taylor Upton. It was purchased in 1883 by Congressman Ezra B. Taylor, and given to Upton in 1887. During Upton's term as treasurer of the National Woman Suffrage Association (1894-1910), the organization was headquartered in this house for part of that time (roughly 1903-1909). Upton's leadership of the organization helped keep it afloat during a period in which relatively few gains were made toward women's suffrage, but gave it continuity between its early leaders and the subsequent successful campaigns for the vote. The house was modernized in the 1930s, and served as a community center before being divided into apartments in the 1950s. In 1989, it was purchased by the Upton Association and restored to the period of Upton's occupancy. It opened as a museum in 2009.

As of May, 2008, the First Nation has 1,517 registered people, of which their on-Reserve population was 400.INAC Registered Population for Muskowekwan First Nation  History  Chief Ka-nee-na-wup (Anishinaabe language: Geniinewab, \\"One Who Sits Like an Eagle\\") and his Saulteaux band lived along the Upper Qu'Appelle Lakes prior to signing Treaty 4 on September 15, 1874. When Ka-nee-na-wup died, his son Muscowequan or Muskowekwan (Anishinaabe language: Maskawigwan, \\"Hard Quill\\") became chief. A reserve was surveyed in 1883, incorporating the settlement where they had already started farming. On September 15, 1874, the Government of Canada signed Treaty 4 with ‚Äúthe Cree, Saulteaux and other Indians,‚Äù including Chief Ka-kee-na-wup on behalf of Muskowekwan First Nation. Treaty 4 has also been known as Qu'Appelle Treaty, as its first signings were conducted at Fort Qu'Appelle, North-West Territories, on September 15, 1874. Additional signings or adhesions continued until September 1877. Muskowekwan First Nation occupies the Muskowekwan Reserve which borders on the town of Lestock, Saskatchewan, and covers . At the signing of Treaty 4 on September 15, 1874, there were 66 members present, 1 councillor, and a chief. The Muskowekwan First Nation occupies Indian Reserve No. 85 (IR 85) in southern Saskatchewan. The First Nations language of these people is Western Ojibwa. Treaty 4 was negotiated by the Canadian government in order to gain land for European settlement, agriculture, and industry, as well as for the transcontinental railway that would run through southern Saskatchewan. A key demand of the Cree and the Saulteaux First Nations was for education. Since the buffalo had nearly vanished from the prairies, they wanted to acquire new tools that would ensure a strong and prosperous future. Under Treaty 4, the Cree and Salteaux First Nations relinquished most of current day southern Saskatchewan. In return, they received small parcels of land, as well as long- term government commitments in a number of areas, including education. Treaty 4 signatories from the chiefs as follows: Ka-kii-shi-way (Ochapowace), Pis-qua (Pasqua), Ka-wez-ance (Cowessess), Ka-kee-na-wup (Muskowekwan), Kus-kee-tew- mus-coo-musqua (Little Black Bear), Ka-ne-on-us-ka-tew (Gordon), Can-ah-ha- cha-pew (Peepeekisis), Kii-si-caw-chuck (Day Star), Ka-ra-ca-toose (Kawacatoose), Ka-kii-nis-ta-haw (Kahkewistehaw), Cha-ca-chas (Ochapowace), Wa-pii-moose-too-sus (Star Blanket), Meemay (Cote) Treaty Conditions Reserves of per every 5 persons, Annuities of $25 for chief, plus coat and medal, Headman $15 annuity, Each individual $5 annuity, Chief‚Äôs suit of clothing every three years, Blankets, calicoes, and British flag (once), Powder, shot, and twine annually $750, Per family: 2 hoes, spade, scythe, axe, seed ,Per ten families: 1 plough, 2 harrows, For chief: oxen, bull, 4 cows, carpenter‚Äôs tools, 5 hand saws, 5 augers, crosscut saw, pit saw, and grindstone, School on reserve, No liquor allowed, Hunting, fishing, & trapping Muskowekwan First Nation Potash Mines The Muskowekwan First Nation potash mine project has been accepted by the federal government under the First Nations Commercial and Industrial Development Act (FNCIDA). The Act will enable the federal government to enact regulations that incorporate a provincial regulatory regime to govern commercial and industrial activities within a province. The acceptance of the Muskowekwan project under FNCIDA means that the Government of Canada can begin the process of developing regulations for the First Potash Ventures mine. FNCIDA, which came into effect in 2006, reproduces the provincial rules and regulations that apply to similar large-scale commercial or industrial projects off reserve and applies them to a specific on-reserve project. First Potash Ventures, a joint partnership between Encanto and Muskowekwan Resources Ltd., is working toward developing the mine on the Muskowekwan First Nation, located 100 km northeast of Regina. The mine is expected to produce up to 2.8 million tons of potash annually over a 50-year- plus span. The project will provide real economic opportunities for the Muskowekwan First Nation, as well as the surrounding area, by providing training and employment opportunities during the construction and operation of the mine.  Governance  The Muskowekwan First Nation elect their council on a two-year term under the authority of the Act Electoral System. The current Chairman is Reginald Bellerose; the Councillors are Eric Moise, Ernest Moise, Shawn Moise, Rosalie Pambrun, William Pinacie, Dolores Windigo, Calven Wolfe and Leon Wolfe. The Chief's and Councillors' terms began on March 1, 2007. The Council is a member of Touchwood Tribal Agency Council, a regional Chiefs' Council. = Reserve = In 1993 Muskowekwan's Treaty Land Entitlement Claim was ratified, enabling the First Nation to increase its land holdings to a total of 12,517.3 ha. The First Nation have reserved for themselves the Muskowekwan 85 Indian Reserves, of which the 7,381.7 ha Muskowekwan 85 Indian Reserve, located 64 km northwest of Fort Qu'Appelle, serves as their main Reserve. Other Indian Reserves of the Muskowekwan 85 Indian Reserve series range from 6.1 ha to 776.3 ha in size, totalling to 9,559.3 ha.

There were three types in total, of which two were transferred to the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft as Class 98.3 tank locomotives and even survived to join the Deutsche Bundesbahn fleet after the Second World War. Common to all the variants was the B axle arrangement (European or UIC classification) or 0-4-0 (Whyte notation), the semi- automatic, gravity-feed firing that enabled one-man operation, and platforms with guard rails, front and rear, that enabled safe access to the coaches. The locomotives had a large driver's cab with 3 windows per side that surrounded the entire locomotive boiler as far as the smokebox. This unique feature earned it the nickname Glaskasten (\\"glass box\\") or, in Franconia, Glas-Chaise (\\"glass carriage\\").  1905 version  In both 1905 and 1906 Krauss supplied three locomotives (numbers 4501‚Äì4506) with an inside driving gear arranged inside the frame and between the axles. The three machines built in 1906 had their cylinder diameter increased from 285 to 305 mm. The two axles were driven via a jackshaft and external connecting rods. Unlike the better-known later variants the water tank of this 'ancient glass box' (Ur-Glaskasten) was arranged over the gangway, but in such a way that crossing over to the coaches in the train was still possible. A rival design for this locomotive was the Bavarian ML 2/2 that was built by Maffei. In the Reichsbahn's provisional renumbering plan of 1923, all six locomotives were included as numbers 98 301 - 98 306; they were however taken out of service in the same year. The reason for that was the difficulty of accessing the inside driving gear for maintenance work.  1908 and 1911 versions  Number 98 307, the Glaskasten at the DDM. In 1908 and 1909 Krauss supplied 29 locomotives with a conventional outside driving gear, which nevertheless used a jack shaft between the main axles. They were given locomotive numbers 4507 - 4535. This driving gear enabled the water tank to be located below the boiler in the frame, so that there was more space on the gangways. Three further locomotives of this type were procured by the Prussian state railways in 1910 and were designated as the Prussian Class T 2. In 1911 and 1914 two further batches of nine and four locomotives were supplied to the Royal Bavarian State Railways. On these, the jackshaft was left out and the wheelbase reduced from 3,200 mm to 2,700 mm. These engines were also shorter overall and lighter than the versions built up to 1909. The Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft took over 22 locomotives, numbering them 98 301 - 98 322. Nine of these came from the first series with the jackshaft.  Survivors  Two locomotives were sold to industrial firms in 1942, one was a victim of the Second World War and the engine number 98 304 stayed in Austria after the war. It was designated as Class √ñBB 688.01 by the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñsterreichische Bundesbahn). This engine was taken out of service in 1959. The remaining locomotives entered the Deutsche Bundesbahn, and were mostly withdrawn during the 1950s. Number 98 307 was deployed until 1963 between Spalt and Georgensgm√ºnd and was known as the 'Spalter Goat' (Spalter Bockel). It has been preserved and is kept at the German Steam Locomotive Museum (Deutsches Dampflokomotiv-Museum or DDM) in Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg on loan from the Nuremberg Transport Museum (Verkehrsmuseum N√ºrnberg), but is no longer working. = 4515 = A second engine, numbered \\"4515\\", had been cut in cross- section to explain the internal workings of a steam locomotive. It was an unfortunate victim of the great fire at the Nuremberg Shed in October 2005, but after a successful renovation is now displayed in the DB Museum, Koblenz. = 98 321 = In 1938 locomotive no. 98 321 went via a locomotive dealer and the Lower Saxon State Railway Office to the Verden-Walsrode Railway. They had it modified in 1947 at Krupp's: the armatures were moved to the rear of the outer firebox and housed in a normal driver's cab; gravity-fed firing was converted to normal firing with a firebox door. This work was completed in 1950 in Verden, before it went into service as locomotive no. 298. On the running plate, two former air cylinders were mounted as additional water tanks. Its period of duty was short, however. By early 1956 the locomotive was taken out of service and sold to a scrap merchant.

The ICRG (then known as the NCRG) founded the Institute for Research on Pathological Gambling and Related Disorders (IRPGRD) in 2000. Since the establishment of the organization almost $25 million has been committed to the ICRG. As of 2008, the IRPGRD was dependent on casino funding, channeled through the NCRG. This arrangement has led some critics to question the independence of the IRPGRD's research.Salon article IRPGRD executive director Christine Reilly told Salon.com that the institute's contract with the NCRG stipulates that the industry not interfere with its work. However Salon concluded that: : While NCRG leaders say they fund independent science, it's not a coincidence that the science aligns so well with the interests of the casinos. It's not that gambling executives are tampering with research findings, or scientists are skewing results. Rather, gaming executives are drawing extravagant conclusions from the studies. By trumpeting these conclusions, the gaming industry is helping casinos gain a legal foothold across the country -- and covering up the ways casinos profit from gambling addiction.Salon article Structure The ICRG is overseen by four board officers and nine board of directors. The member board includes representatives from the gaming industry, public health officials as well as regulatory communities. Board Officers: *Chairman-Alan M.

Early life Wright was born in Dulwich, the son of a clergyman of the Church of England, and was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first in physiology. He then proceeded to St Bartholomew's Hospital and qualified as a doctor in 1938. Career After his time at Bart's as a medical registrar, in 1942 Wright joined the Royal Army Medical Corps to work as a pathologist. During the Second World War he was posted to Sierra Leone, and after the war to Singapore, where he organized the reinstatement of medical laboratory services. He rose to the rank of Colonel, and after demobilization continued to work as a pathologist, before joining the Medical Research Council for a new unit at Llandough Hospital studying pneumoconiosis. The unit needed equipment which did not then exist, and Wright developed it himself. To measure lung function, in 1956 he invented the peak flow meter. After the research unit's results were published in 1959, \\"peak flow\\" became a standard measure of respiratory function for most lung diseases. Millions of peak flow meters have since been produced. Wright went on to develop several other medical innovations.

The Douglas Dam was built by the Tennessee Valley Authority at a record pace from February 2, 1942, through February 19, 1943, to provide hydroelectric power and to control flooding downstream in the Tennessee River Valley.TVA: Douglas Reservoir. Tennessee Valley Authority. Retrieved on 2008-06-20. Douglas Dam is located just over upstream from the French Broad River's confluence with the Holston River in Knoxville, to form the Tennessee River. The Douglas Lake reservoir inundates about a stretch of the French Broad River between the Douglas Dam and the Irish Bottoms area near Newport. Small portions of the Nolichucky and Pigeon rivers are also impounded by the lake. During the winter months, the Tennessee Valley Authority lowers the water level to help control flooding, meet power demands, and many other objectives. This is important to know in advance to make plans to stay near the lake. The resort town of Baneberry is located on the northern shores of the lake in Jefferson County. Dandridge, the county seat of Jefferson County, is located mostly on the northern shores with a small portion on the southern.

First published by Hamish Hamilton in 2000, subsequent publications (2001 onwards) have been by Penguin Books. Description The title of the book is a reference to Boethius's magnum opus Consolation of Philosophy, in which philosophy appears as an allegorical figure to Boethius to console him in the year he was imprisoned, leading up to his impending execution. In Consolations, de Botton attempts to console the reader through everyday problems (or at least help them to understand them) by extensively quoting and interpreting a number of philosophers. These are categorised in a number of chapters with one philosopher used in each. * Consolation for Unpopularity (Socrates) * Consolation for Not Having Enough Money (Epicurus) * Consolation for Frustration (Seneca) * Consolation for Inadequacy (Montaigne) * Consolation for a Broken Heart (Schopenhauer) * Consolation for Difficulties (Nietzsche) Critical response The critical reception for Consolations has been primarily positive. It received glowing praise in, among other publications, The New York Review of Books, The Times, The Spectator, The Sunday Telegraph, The Sunday Times, The Irish Times and The Literary Review.The Consolations of Philosophy - Reviews. Retrieved from http://www.alaindebotton.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=116. Humphrey Carpenter in The Sunday Times, (2 April 2000) said, \\"The Consolations of Philosophy is certainly a commentary rather than a work of original thought; but few discussions on the great philosophers can have been so entertaining. De Botton takes us on a brisk, playful tour of the lives and ideas of half-a- dozen of the big names in the history of philosophy.\\" According to Ben Rogers in the Sunday Telegraph, \\"singling these thinkers out and grouping them together is only the smaller part of de Botton‚Äôs achievement. He has also succeeded in bringing each one to life. The lessons that he draws from his sages might, in other hands, have appeared trite. But he writes with such charm and freshness that he somehow avoids the pitfall.\\" Kirkus Reviews writes \\"Congenial, refreshing, original‚Äîand mercifully succinct‚Äîde Botton may well achieve the impossible by making philosophy popular.\\" Alison Lurie in New York Review of Books said, \\"the simplicity of his writing is not the product of a simple mind.\\" A few critics have been negative. Edward Skidelsky of the New Statesman wrote: \\"Comforting, but meaningless. In seeking to popularise philosophy, Alain de Botton has merely trivialised it, smoothing the discipline into a series of silly sound bites. ... [De Botton's The Consolations of Philosophy] is bad because the conception of philosophy that it promotes is a decadent one, and can only mislead readers as to the true nature of the discipline.\\"Skidelsky, Edward (2000-03-27). \\"Comforting, but meaningless.\\" New Statesman, 27 March 2000.

Jonathan Lear, writing in the New York Times said: \\"Academic philosophy in the United States has virtually abandoned the attempt to speak to the culture at large, but philosophy professors are doing something of incredible importance: they are trying to get things right. That is the thread that connects them back to Socrates -- even if they are not willing to follow him into the marketplace -- and that is the thread that The Consolations of Philosophy cuts. ...[L]et's face it, this isn't philosophy.\\"Lear, Jonathan (2000-05-14). \\"The Socratic Method\\".

Born in Halcott Centre, New York, Crosby attended Yale University beginning in 1889; while there, he was a popular student and sportsman. He was a two-year starter on the football team and a backup on the crew team. During his junior year, he was replaced on the football team by freshman Frank Hinkey and never returned to a starting position. The remainder of Crosby's time at Yale was successful and he enrolled at the New York Law School after graduation. Crosby was invited in 1892 to serve as head coach of the United States Naval Academy football program. He accepted the position, and, using unusually rigorous practicing strategies, led the team to a 5‚Äì2 record, culminating in an upset victory over rival Army in the Army‚ÄìNavy Game. He received commendation for the victory, including a gift of a personalized trophy. Following the season's conclusion, Crosby returned to New York to continue his studies, but he was hospitalized after an illness he contracted while coaching worsened shortly after his arrival. He died from typhoid fever in late December, at the age of 24. CareerEarly life and college= Crosby was born on March 22, 1868 in Halcott Centre, Greene County, New York, son of David J. Crosby. As a child, Crosby attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut, the second person in his family to do so; a cousin, James Parkman Crosby, had attended the institution in the early 1870s. Ben Crosby graduated from the school in 1888,Hopkins Grammar School (1902), p. 126 and the following year, he began classes at Yale University. Crosby was popular while at Yale, and was a member of both Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the secret undergraduate society Skull and Bones.Yale Alumni Association (1893), p. 189Millegan (2003), pp. 597‚Äì660 In his sophomore year, Crosby was the starting right end of the Bulldogs football team. The squad finished that season with a thirteen-and-one win-loss record; the sole loss came to the national champion Harvard. Crosby joined the university's crew team as a substitute the following year, and was described by classmates as being \\"quite prominent in athletics\\".Crawford (1893), p. 94The Evening World (December 31, 1893), p. 5 Early in the 1891 season, both Crosby and John A. Hartwell, the other starting end, who later followed Crosby as Navy football coach, were injured in a game. While observing a team practice, Hartwell and Crosby noticed the play of backup end Frank Hinkey. After watching Hinkey for a time, Hartwell decided to return to practicing for fear of losing his starting position; Crosby did not consider this necessary. By the next game, Hinkey had replaced Crosby as the starting end and he did not regain the position.Fox (1912), p. 642Britt (1921), p. 8 The team finished the season with a perfect record and would be retrospectively named national champions.1891 Yale Bulldogs Schedule and Results Crosby remained popular through his senior year at the university, and he was one of three graduates presented with a class award.Wurtenberg & Kenerson (1892), p. 133 Upon graduation from the school, Crosby enrolled in New York Law School and joined a law office in New York City. =Coaching career= In October 1892, shortly after he began attending New York Law School, Crosby was invited by former Yale coach Walter Camp to live in Annapolis, Maryland to serve as the coach for the United States Naval Academy football team; the program was acting in response to the appointment of Crosby's former teammate, Henry L. Williams, as coach for the Army team. Navy had first extended the offer to Camp, who suggested Crosby would fulfil the role more effectively. Crosby accepted the invitation,Jardins (2015), p. 84 and became the second head coach in Navy history and the first who was independent of the program.Clary (1997), pp. 11‚Äì13 The previous coach, Vaulx Carter, attended the academy, and had revived the program.Bealle (1951), pp. 9‚Äì10 Crosby's strategy for practices was one of the most intensive used at the academy during its early years; after classes every day, the team played two 45 minute games against a team of 22 backup players, followed immediately by a long swimming session in a cold pool.Clary (1965), p. 25 Shortly before the season began, Crosby hired former St. John's College, Johns Hopkins, and Lehigh player Paul Dashiell to serve as his assistant coach. An article from alt=A newspaper article about Crosby receiving a trophy The 1892 season commenced on October 12 with a 16‚Äì0 shutout loss against the Penn Quakers in Annapolis. The Quakers finished the season with a 15‚Äì1 record, losing only to national champion Yale. Crosby's team played their next game three days later, against the Princeton Tigers. Navy lost the game in another shutout, by the score of 28‚Äì0. These losses continued a losing streak dating back to November 21 of the previous year.Naval Academy Athletic Association (2005), p. 1541891 Navy Midshipmen Schedule and Results The following week, on October 22, Crosby achieved his first coaching win when Navy defeated the Lafayette Leopards 22‚Äì4. This was followed by a victory the next week over the small Franklin & Marshall College; Navy won in a 24‚Äì0 shutout, their largest such win since the 1890 Army‚ÄìNavy Game. They continued their winning streak into November with a 48‚Äì12 victory against Rutgers, the largest win for Navy since the beginning of the 1890 season. After a week's break, Crosby received his fourth win, a forty-point shutout of nearby Georgetown.1892 Navy Midshipmen Schedule and Results The final game of the season was the annual Army‚ÄìNavy Game against Navy's biggest rivals, the unbeaten Army Cadets. Navy had unexpectedly lost to the Cadets in the previous year's game, and came into the 1892 game as an underdog.Cromartie (1996), p. 19 Despite this, Crosby expected a victory, even telling reporters he was \\"of the opinion that they [Navy] will certainly win\\".The Saint Paul Globe (December 26, 1892), p. 6 Crosby also caught the attention of the press with his scheduling of more frequent practices leading up to the game, including night practices on a lighted field. He closed all press and fan access to the practices, an unusual action at the time, because Navy officials claimed that Army had learned their plays the prior year by observing the practices.Cromartie (1996), p. 18The New York Times (November 26, 1892), p. 3 Crosby's actions proved effective as, on November 26 at West Point, Navy led Army for the entire game and won easily, 12‚Äì4. About a month after the game, in appreciation for his coaching Navy to the win, the team presented Crosby an eight-inch high sterling silver loving cup, produced by the Gorham Manufacturing Company, which was inscribed with the simple message: \\"Benjamin L. Crosby. Jr. ‚Äì From the officers and cadets of the United States Naval Academy, Nov. 26, 1892\\".The New York Times (December 23, 1892), p. 1Cromartie (1996), p. 21 alt=A man with a large mustache, wearing a suit with a bow tie, posing for a picture =Death and legacy= When the season ended, Crosby returned to New York City to continue his studies at the New York Law School. He attended classes only for a brief time, because a serious illness he had contracted in Annapolis continued to worsen. On December 19, while in the classroom, he reportedly \\"succumbed to an attack of typhoid fever\\". He was taken to St. Luke's Hospital, where his condition progressively worsened over the following ten days. Crosby died on December 29, 1892 at the age of 24.Yale Alumni Association (1900), p. 202 Crosby's coaching position was filled by Yale teammate John A. Hartwell, who was subsequently replaced by another Yale teammate, William Wurtenburg. In his one season as a head coach, Crosby amassed a record of 5‚Äì2 and his team outscored their opponents 146‚Äì64. The five wins are tied for the seventh-fewest of any Navy coach, but third-most of single-season coaches. Crosby also has the third-fewest losses among Navy coaches, while his .714 win percentage is tied for the tenth-highest of any Navy coach.Navy Coaching Records Crosby has been largely forgotten outside of Navy football history. One event from his life that was remembered was his replacement as Yale end by Frank Hinkey, which was discussed in magazines until at least the 1920s due to Hinkey's influence on the sport. The most significant impact that Crosby had with Navy was through his hiring of Dashiell. The latter served as assistant until 1903 under the following eight Navy coaches. As head coach from 1904 to 1906, Dashiell brought Navy to national prominence and won 25 games. He later became one of the longest- serving members of the college football Rules Committee, helping to legalize the forward pass and ban the flying wedge, among other things.Clary (1965), p. 26 Head coaching recordReferencesFootnotesBibliography=        * External links * Category:1868 births Category:1892 deaths Category:19th-century players of American football Category:American football ends Category:Navy Midshipmen football coaches Category:New York Law School alumni Category:Yale Bulldogs football players Category:Yale Bulldogs rowers Category:People from Greene County, New York Category:Deaths from typhoid fever ","title":"Ben Crosby"},{"id":"17973614","text":"The 2000 Stella Artois Championships was a men's tennis tournament played on grass courts at the Queen's Club in London, England and was part of the International Series of the 2000 ATP Tour.

Its members come from different towns in eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Members range in age from eight to eighteen.  History of fifes and drums As with other modern fife and drum groups, the Middlesex County 4-H Fife & Drum Corps perpetuates the centuries-old tradition of fife and drum music. With its roots traced back to Switzerland in the 13th century, the military's use of fifes and drums as a means of communication spread to other European countries, finding its way to America as countries such as France and Britain colonized the New World. In the United States, fifes and drums were used through the Civil War, finally being replaced by the bugle as technology and mechanization changed the nature of warfare. Beginning around the United States' centennial, civilian groups picked up and continued the fife and drum tradition in places like New England. In more recent years, the fife and drum tradition has been revived in other parts of the United States such as Virginia, the Midwest, and the West Coast. Today, fife and drum corps can mostly be found on the East Coast from Virginia to New England, with a concentration of groups in Connecticut.  4-H youth Empowerment  Youth leadership is the cornerstone of 4-H. This makes the Middlesex County 4-H Fife & Drum Corps somewhat unusual among youth fife and drum corps, in that the youth members take on most of the leadership roles. They make decisions about music and presentation, they determine the program for each event, and they work with adult event organizers during events. During a performance, the youth leaders make all decisions of when to play, what to play, and where to march, without assistance from adults. Other leadership opportunities include running the fife or drum line, helping teach the beginners, checking uniforms, and mentoring new members. As a teaching group, members learn music, American history, leadership, and are taught to present themselves in a professional and disciplined manner.  Uniforms and instrumentation  The uniform of the corps is green and white, the official colors of the national 4-H organization. The style of the uniform‚Äîcocked hats, relatively short vented waistcoats, fall-front breeches, buttoned haversacks, canteens, and leather garters‚Äîis based on styles worn in New England in the 1770s. The corps uses six hole CoopermanCooperman.com fifes, snare, and bass drums.  Performance  The Middlesex County 4-H Fife & Drum Corps primarily plays music of the 18th century. The corps plays at musters, Military tattoos, and other events, including the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston.

Noren was born in Chicago to parents of Swedish ancestry. He played with Gene Ammons and others in the middle of the 1940s before moving with his family to Sweden in 1946. There he worked as a lumberjack briefly before joining a Swedish jazz band as a replacement for a sick drummer. This led to time spent touring and/or recording with Thore Jederby (1948‚Äì50), Nisse Skoog (1948), Seymour √ñsterwall (1949), Arne Domn√©rus and Rolf Ericson (1950‚Äì52), and Lars Gullin (1951‚Äì53). In addition to playing with Swedish musicians and ensembles such as Reinhold Svensson (1949), G√∂sta T√∂rner (1949), Swede Starband (1950), Expressens Elitorkester (1950, 1952), Leonard Feather's Swinging Swedes (1951) Bengt Hallberg (1952), Putte Wickman (1952), √Öke Persson, and the Scandia All Stars (1953). He also recorded as a vocalist with Jederby (1949), Domn√©rus/Ericson (1951), and the drummer Anders Burman (1952). Noren's reputation in Sweden was such that he was frequently called upon by visiting American musicians, such as James Moody (1949, 1951), Charlie Parker (1950), Zoot Sims (1950), Stan Getz (1951), Lee Konitz (1951), Clifford Brown (1953), and George Wallington (1953). In 1954 Noren returned to Chicago, playing with Eddie Higgins (1958) and Marty Rubenstein (1959‚Äì60). In 1960 he went once more to Sweden, playing with Monica Zetterlund (1960) and Nisse Sandstr√∂m; he also recorded with the radio band of Harry Arnold. After moving back to the United States a few years later, his career dips into obscurity. Jack Noren is survived by his kids and grand kids.

Born and raised in Western New York to German parents, Wurtenburg attended the prestigious Phillips Exeter Academy, where he played football. He enrolled in classes at Yale University in 1886 and soon earned a spot on the school's football team. He played for Yale from 1886 through 1889, and again in 1891; two of those teams were later recognized as national champions. His 35-yard run in a close game in 1887 against rival Harvard earned him some fame. Wurtenburg received his medical degree from Yale's Sheffield Scientific School in 1893. The following year, the United States Naval Academy hired him to coach their football team. He led the squad to a 4‚Äì1‚Äì2 record for the season, including a 1‚Äì1‚Äì1 record against rival schools. He then accepted a coaching job at Dartmouth College, where for the next four years he led them to perfect records against both of their Triangular Football League opponents. They had a winning record the first year and a 5‚Äì2‚Äì1 record the second year. In 1899, his fifth season as coach, his team went 2‚Äì7 and lost both of its conference games. After ending his coaching career, Wurtenburg spent several years acting as a referee for Yale's football team. His final contribution to football was publishing a book about Yale football in the early 20th century. Around 1904, Wurtenburg began pursuing a career as a physician. He set up a medical office near his house in New Haven, Connecticut, and became an ear, nose and throat specialist. Wurtenburg maintained his medical office until at least 1920. He died in 1957 at the age of 93, in New Haven. Early life and college William Wurtenburg was born on December 24, 1863, in Clarksburg, a hamlet in Erie County, New York. He was the son of George M. Wurtenburg and Elizabeth Hochschild, who immigrated from Germany in 1848. William attended primary school in the Clarksville public school system. For secondary schooling he attended the Griffith Institute in Springville, New York and then Forestville Academy before gaining admittance to Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire.White (1967), p. 105 At Phillips Exeter, Wurtenburg competed in field events at the school's spring athletic events. In 1884, he was a well-recognized member of the school's competitive football team.Harrison (1983), \\"Andover and Exeter: Growth of a Rivalry\\" He served as quarterback and team captain in 1885, leading the team to a 29‚Äì11 victory over rival Phillips Academy.The Phillipian (1885), p. 1 In his senior year, 1886, he placed first in standing broad jump with weights and running broad jump, with jumps of about , respectively.The Outing (1886), p. 487 Upon graduation from Phillips Exeter, Wurtenburg entered Yale University. Wurtenburg began taking medical classes on his arrival at Yale, and joined the football team partway through his freshman year. By the following season, he was playing backup halfback to freshman Harmon S. Graves, although he occasionally filled in as a fullback.Welch and Camp (1899), p. 584The Harvard Crimson (October 1887) The 1887 squad, later recognized as the national champion, went 9‚Äì0 and outscored their opponents 515‚Äì12; this included a 106‚Äì0 shutout of Wesleyan.Sports-reference 1887 Yale During this season Wurtenburg made his most famous play: with Yale leading rival Harvard by a score of 11‚Äì8 late in the season's final contest, Wurtenburg made \\"a brilliant run\\" of 35 yards and scored a touchdown, which secured the game for Yale. He was credited as one of the people who made the game \\"undoubtedly the finest ever played in America\\", according to writer Richard Melancthon Hurd.Hurd (1888), p. 75Nicholas (1901), p. 111 Wurtenburg was replaced by alt=A sepia picture of a young man in a sweater with a \\"Y\\" The following year Wurtenburg shifted into his former position at quarterback.

Wurtenburg developed his own unique style at quarterback, regularly attempting \\"long, low, underhand passes\\" to his teammates to help set up scoring plays.Davis (1913), p. 145 That year, the Yale team shut out every single one of its opponents and was later recognized as a national champion.The New York Times (1913) At the same time, Wurtenburg played on the school's baseball team, where he would regularly score three or four runs a game.The Harvard Crimson (May 1887), p. 1The Harvard Crimson (June 1887), p. 2 In September of his graduating year, 1889, Wurtenburg announced that he would be entering the Sheffield Scientific School.Yale Daily News (September 1889), p. 1 At the Exeter Club's first annual banquet, held that year, Wurtenburg was asked to present a toast to represent the club's athletics.The Yale Literary Magazine (1889), p. 284 In 1890, he served as the co-editor of The Yale Banner, one of the school's yearbooks.The Yale Pot-Pourri (1907), p. 231 Wurtenburg played his final season of football at the university in 1891, after apparently giving up his spot on the team following the 1889 season. However, he was thrown out of the final game of the season, against Princeton, and Frank Barbour was given a guaranteed starting-quarterback slot for the rest of the time Wurtenburg was at Yale.Whitney (1891), p. 879The New York Times (1891) Wurtenburg graduated in 1893, when he received his Doctorate in Medicine (M.D.).

This was followed by a loss and a tie, which were succeeded by back-to-back wins. His team dropped two games to Yale and one to Army, but managed to defeat former Triangular Football League opponent MIT. After that, Wurtenburg led his team to three straight victories, including wins over both Triangular Football League opponents. Although the season ended with a loss to Brown, Dartmouth was awarded the Triangular Football League championship.William Wurtenburg coaching record 1895Triangular Football League champions On November 20 of that year, Wurtenburg married Anna Phillips, daughter of Jason W.

He began by leading his team to a 30‚Äì0 shutout of the Worcester Athletic Club on October 3. His team dropped the next two games, both scoreless losses to Penn and Yale, but finished the month with a win. The second half of the season went much better, with Wurtenburg leading his squad to a 3‚Äì1 record, including a 42‚Äì0 total score against conference opponents. The team ended the season with a 5‚Äì2‚Äì1 record and a second consecutive conference championship.William Wurtenburg coaching record 1896 Wurtenburg retained his coaching position the next season, beginning the year with a blowout of Phillips Exeter, which was followed by three consecutive shutout losses. The team turned the season around in November, defeating Amherst and Williams by a combined score of 106‚Äì0 for a third consecutive championship. He ended the season with a 4‚Äì3 record and a secure position as the coach for the next year.William Wurtenburg coaching record 1897 In 1898, Wurtenburg's Dartmouth squad went 5‚Äì6, but outscored their opponents 205‚Äì137. Beginning the season with a win over Phillips Exeter, the team went 4‚Äì1 in October. Wurtenburg's team began the month with a shutout loss to Harvard, but recovered to win four straight games, defeating their conference opponents by a combined score of 74‚Äì12. In November and December, however, his team lost all five matches, managing only 28 points.William Wurtenburg coaching record 1898 In his final year as a coach, Wurtenburg suffered the worst record of his career. After winning the first two games of the season, his team dropped the remaining seven, only able to put up 12 points. He also suffered his first conference losses, falling to opponents Williams and Wesleyan by a combined score of 23‚Äì10.William Wurtenburg coaching record 1899 Wurtenburg was replaced as coach the following year by one of his former players, Frederick E. Jennings.Dartmouth Results, 1900-09 After the conclusion of his coaching career, Wurtenburg opened up his first medical office, operating a short distance from his New Haven home.Price and Lee (1899), p. 749 =1900s and death= Even after the turn of the century, Wurtenburg remained involved with the Yale football program. In 1900, he participated in the annual football team's spring scrimmage, playing on the school's \\"varsity\\" team.The New York Times (September 1900), p. 9 He was repeatedly selected by the university to act as an official in their home games; he was the school's referee in 1900 and 1901,The New York Times (October 1900), p. 9The New York Times (1901) and returned to the position two years later, in 1903.The New York Times (1903), p. 14 He expanded his officiating role in 1904, when he served in three games.The New York Times (October 2, 1904), p. 10The New York Times (October 13, 1904), p. 8 For one of those matches, Wurtenburg moved to the position of umpire.The Washington Post (1904), p. 10 Sometime between 1915 and 1925, Wurtenburg collected a series of newspaper articles and self-published them in a book titled Scrapbook of Newspaper Clippings about Yale Football.Wurtenburg (c.1902-15) At some point around 1904, Wurtenburg began to dedicate himself to a career as a physician. He received official membership in the American Medical Association and the New Haven Medical Society as a physician specializing in otorhinolaryngology, specifically in ear and nose treatment.Pettigrew (1904), p. 56 By 1909, he had shifted his focus to the treatment of ear ailments, and occasionally served well-known locals.The Day (1909), p. 6 He retained his membership with the Connecticut State Medical Society until at least 1920, maintaining his Elm Street office the entire time.Connecticut State Medical Society (1920), p. 63 Wurtenburg died on March 26, 1957, in New Haven, at the age of 93. A year after his death, Yale established the William G. Wurtenberg Scholarship from his bequest. The scholarship \\"is to be awarded to a member of the senior class who demonstrates character, leadership qualities, and promise of future usefulness\\".Yale Scholarships and Special Funds Although rarely acknowledged for his influence on Dartmouth football, Wurtenburg is considered by his Dartmouth peers as having brought the program to prominence. Fred Crolius, captain of Wurtenburg's 1898 team, would later state that: :One man, whose influence more than any other one thing, succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg, who was brought up in the early Yale football school. He had the keenest sense of fundamental football and the greatest intensity of spirit in transmitting his hard earned knowledge. Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway that nothing could stop its growth.Edwards (1916), p. 376 Head coaching recordSee also * * ReferencesNotesFootnotesBibliography= Books    * * Journals   * * Newspapers       Web sources     Category:1863 births Category:1957 deaths Category:19th-century players of American football Category:American football fullbacks Category:American football halfbacks Category:American football quarterbacks Category:College football officials Category:Dartmouth Big Green football coaches Category:Navy Midshipmen football coaches Category:Yale Bulldogs football players Category:Phillips Exeter Academy alumni Category:Physicians from Connecticut Category:Players of American football from New York (state) Category:Sportspeople from Erie County, New York Category:American people of German descent ","title":"William Wurtenburg"},{"id":"17973755","text":"Non-tropic hormones are hormones that directly stimulate target cells to induce effects. This differs from the tropic hormones, which act on another endocrine gland. Non-tropic hormones are those that act directly on targeted tissues or cells, and not on other endocrine gland to stimulate release of other hormones. Many hormones act in a chain reaction. Tropic hormones usually act in the beginning of the reaction stimulating other endocrine gland to eventually release non-tropic hormones. These are the ones that act in the end of the chain reaction on other cells that are not part of other endocrine gland. The Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a perfect example of this chain reaction. The reaction begins in the hypothalamus with a release of corticotropin-releasing hormone/factor (CRH/F; tropic). This stimulates the anterior pituitary and causes it to release Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; tropic) to the adrenal glands. Lastly, cortisol (non-tropic) is secreted from the adrenal glands and goes into the bloodstream where it can have more widespread effects on organs and tissues. Since cortisol is what finally reaches other tissues in the body, it is a non-tropic hormone. CRH and ACTH are tropic hormones because they act on the anterior pituitary gland and adrenal glands, respectively, both of which are endocrine glands. Non-tropic hormones are thus often the last piece of a larger process and chain of hormone secretion. Both tropic and non-tropic hormones are necessary for proper endocrine function. For example, if ACTH (Adrenocorticotropin hormone; a tropic hormone) is inhibited, cortisol can no longer be released because the chain reaction has been interrupted. Some examples of non-tropic hormones are: * Glucocorticoids: secreted from the adrenal glands and released directly into the blood stream where it alters blood glucose levels. Glucocorticoids, including hormones such as cortisol and corticosterone, are highly involved in the stress response, and are often referred to as the stress hormones. In the case of chronic stress, glucocorticoids can be very damaging to memory. * Vasopressin (Antidiuretic hormone; ADH): secreted from the posterior pituitary and acts on the kidneys to maintain water balance in the body. *Oestrogen: secreted from the ovaries and aid in fetal development as well as development of secondary sexual characteristics in females. * Testosterone: secreted from the testes, testosterone influences not only gonadal development, but aggressive behavior, sexual behavior, and masculinization of males. * Oxytocin: secreted from the posterior pituitary and acts on the uterus and mammary glands to produce contractions. It is also involved in pair bonding and sexual selection and behaviors. * Epinephrine and Norepinephrine: secreted from the adrenal medulla and acts on the heart, liver, and blood vessels primarily in acute stress situations. They are key components of the processes involved in the sympathetic nervous system. Since they are involved in arousal, stress, and often physical exercise some of these hormones are also called stress hormones. Most endocrine glands, such as the gonads, pancreas, and adrenal glands, produce non-tropic hormones. Those released from the pituitary gland in the brain include:  See also  * Endocrine system * Tropic hormone  References  Sources  *Biology 12 McGrawHill Ryerson (Textbook) *An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (Textbook)  External links  * https://web.archive.org/web/20110306010841/http://www.mcgrawhill.ca/school/booksites/biology+12/index.php Category:Hormones ","title":"Non-tropic hormone"},{"id":"17973757","text":"Henri Stambouli (born 5 August 1961) is an Algerian former football player and manager.

Born into a powerful southern family, McClung was raised in Memphis, Tennessee until he was accepted into Lehigh University. Immediately establishing himself as a skilled sportsman, McClung participated on both the school's football and baseball teams. He served as captain of the former in 1892 and is credited with turning it into one of the school's best ever football squads. McClung graduated from Lehigh in 1893 with degrees in metallurgy and mining engineering. After graduating, McClung took a position as the coach of the Naval Academy football team. He served for one season, leading the team to a 5-2 record against a mediocre schedule. Following the season, he began a career as a college football referee which would span twelve years.Lehigh Alumni Association (1910), p. 65 Early life and college Matthew McClung was born on December 1, 1868, the fifth of seven children between Matthew McClung Sr. and Julia Frances Anderson. The younger McClung was raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, where both of his parents' families were well established.McClung (1904), pp. 28-29 McClung entered Lehigh University in 1889, majoring in mining engineering and metallurgy; the classes were held by students to be the hardest at the university.The Lehigh Epitome (1898), pp. 222-223 He joined the school's chapter of the Psi Upsilon fraternity, one of nine freshmen to be accepted In Universitate.The Lehigh Epitome (1890), p. 58 He also became a member of one of the school's several clubs, the \\"Aetos Club\\", which he represented in intramural athletics.The Lehigh Epitome (1890), pp. 104, 165 McClung immediately made his athletic presence at the school known, joining the lawn tennis team and the freshman baseball team as a left fielder; he also won the university's baseball- throwing competition.The Lehigh Epitome (1890), pp. 145, 164-168 He was starting catcher for the 1889 baseball team that went 4-7-1 and played in approximately one quarter of a football game.The Lehigh Epitome (1891), pp. 167-171 McClung completed his first year by toasting for the university's fraternities at the year's freshman banquet.The Lehigh Epitome (1895), p. 22 McClung's sophomore year remained largely the same as his freshman one. He maintained membership with the Psi Upsilon and the Aetos Club, but he also joined the university's Southern Club, German club, and its Chemical and Natural History Society.The Lehigh Epitome (1891), pp. 64, 109, 128The Lehigh Epitome (1892), pp. 137, 146 He shifted from being the baseball team's catcher to center fielder, where he played in twelve out of twenty games. McClung had the third worst batting stats of anyone on the team, getting only nine hits on fifty-seven at-bats. He was also named starting quarterback of the school's football team and led the squad to a 6-4 record, which included two wins over rival Lafayette.The Lehigh Epitome (1892), pp. 194-199 Career alt=A yellow-brown map with the words \\"Worden Field\\" in the center =Football coach= Following his graduation, McClung remained at Lehigh, assisting in coaching the school's 1894 season. In 1895, McClung was hired by the United States Naval Academy to replace William Wurtenburg as the head coach of their football program.The Cornell Daily Sun (1895), p. 1 McClung was the fifth football coach for the school in as many years. He took over during a period at the Academy when, according to historian Morris Allison Bealle, \\"football was waning in Annapolis\\" and that \\"there was no climax incentive to steam up players\\".Bealle (1951), p. 44 McClung scheduled seven games for the 1895 season, three of which were simply squads from nearby athletic clubs. He hired Paul Dashiell, a former teammate of his at Lehigh, as his assistant coach for the year.Bealle (1951), p. 45 His team played at home for the entire season, due to restrictions put forth by president Grover Cleveland following the bloody 1893 Army-Navy Game.Nesbit (2000), p. 1Cromartie (1996), p. 27 McClung's squad began the season with wins over two of the athletic clubs by a combined score of 40-0. These wins were followed by consecutive shutouts of Franklin & Marshall and Carlisle. Virginia was the next team on Navy's schedule, but their opponents were forced to forfeit the match after a fire destroyed one of the campus's major structures.Navy Game Results 1895-1899The Cavalier Daily (1982), p. 7 McClung's team finished their season with two consecutive close losses to the Orange Athletic Club and his former team, Lehigh. He did not return to coach the following year's squad; instead, the job went to Princeton dropout Johnny Poe.Edwards (1916), p. 205 Because of McClung's scheduling, the Naval Academy in 1896 banned the football team from playing another athletic club.Jackson (1959), p. 3 =Referee and steelworker= alt=A black-and-white picture of a man observing several football players in a pile Shortly after he left Lehigh, McClung began a career as a college football referee. He began as early as November 1895, when he partnered with Paul Dashiell to officiate a game between Yale and Princeton.The Salt Lake Herald (1895), p. 2 The pairing with Dashiell quickly became regular, with McClung acting as referee and Dashiell as Umpire. Former Princeton guard William \\"Big Bill\\" Edwards stated that \\"within my recollection, for many years the two most prominent, as well as most efficient officials, whose names were always coupled, were McClung, Referee, and Dashiell, Umpire. No two better officials ever worked together and there is as much necessity for team work in officiating as there is in playing\\". Edwards' opinion was often shared by sportswriters and fellow players. After the Yale- Princeton game, a writer for the New York Tribune stated that Dashiell and McClung were \\"excellent\\" at their jobs and \\"that their rulings were just and impartial was admitted everywhere\\".The New York Tribune (1895), p. 3 In the following year, McClung refereed a single game, again between Yale and Princeton.The Norfolk Virginian (1896), p. 1 He was a top candidate for umpiring a contest between Wisconsin and Carlisle in what would be one of the first games played at night, but did not receive the position.The Evening Times (1896), p. 3Pruter (2011), pp. 2-3 McClung refereed two games in 1897 alongside Dashiell. The first game they served was Harvard and Yale's rivalry, The Game. The contest, which ended in a 0-0 tie, was the first time the rivalry was played since a bloody 1894 game led it to be cancelled.Samuels (2011), The Back PageThe Sun (1897), p. 2 Following that work, they officiated a close game between Cornell and Penn.The Saint Paul Globe (1897), p. 1 McClung gained some fame among the football community following the 1897 year, so he was selected to referee in three games the following year. He was chosen before the season to again serve in the Harvard-Yale game, and was likely going to be a referee for the Yale-Princeton contest;Omaha Daily Bee (1898), p. 10Evening Star (1898), p. 7 before the game, however, McClung was replaced by Edgar Wrightington.Presbrey and Moffat (1901), p. 386 The other two games refereed that year were for Penn, their contests with Harvard and Cornell.The Times (1898), p. 8The Scranton Tribune (1898), p. 1 McClung's 1899 season was very similar to his previous year. He was selected before the season to referee the Harvard-Yale game,The Kansas City Journal (1899), p. 5 and officiated a game between Pennsylvania and Harvard.The Saint Paul Globe (1899), p. 10 By 1900, McClung and Dashiell's fame had risen considerably. Two western teams, California and Stanford, asked them to officiate their rivalry game. The San Francisco Call, while covering the rivalry, referred to the two as \\"the two most expert [officials] in America\\".The San Francisco Call (1900), p. 32 McClung ended up only refereeing one game that year, his usual role in the Harvard-Yale game.New-York Daily Tribune (1900), p. 5 He was sought after for another game for Yale, but had to turn down the offer.The Times (1900), p. 3 He officiated two games in 1901. The first was his usual job at the Yale- Harvard game, which ended up being a very cleanly played contest. The second was another game for Harvard, against Penn.Athletic Association of Harvard Graduates (1901), p. 4The San Francisco Call (1901), p. 34 McClung's routine was broken in 1902, when he officiated four games. After beginning the year with a normal game between Columbia and Princeton, McClung refereed a game between Columbia and Penn where, for the first time, Dashiell was not umpiring for him.The Indianapolis Journal (1902), p. 6The Saint Paul Globe (1902), p. 8 The 1903 season saw McClung referee three games, all for Yale. In the season's Yale-Princeton game, he acted as umpire for the first time in his officiating career.The Minneapolis Journal (1903), p. 21 As with the previous year, McClung was selected prior to the 1904 season's beginning as the referee for three games for Yale, against Columbia, Princeton, and Harvard.The Saint Paul Globe (1904), p. 5 The Princeton game led to a minor controversy surrounding McClung, after he decided to shorten the length of the game. He was also chosen by Harvard to officiate their game against Penn,The Times-Dispatch (1904), p. 1 and by Penn in their game with Columbia. In the latter, both teams wanted McClung to umpire; he flatly refused, and decided to shorten the game to 40 minutes.The New-York Tribune (1904), p. 10 alt=A man with a large mustache and nice jacket posing for a picture In 1905, McClung refereed only two games, one of which turned out to be the biggest in his career. The first game of the season was between Harvard and Pennsylvania, which McClung officiated alongside \\"Big Bill\\" Edwards. The pairing was troublesome, since both men had previously served almost always as a referee, which left the position of umpire unfilled. Edwards eventually accepted the umpire role, and remained at the position for the rest of his officiating career following the game.Edwards (1916), p. 391 The Harvard-Yale game was the most controversial game of McClung's career, although most of the issue surrounded Dashiell's umpiring. Late in the game, the teams were tied 0-0. Yale punted the ball to Francis Burr, Harvard's guard, who called a fair catch. However, Burr was hit by two Yale players and fumbled the ball, which set up Yale's winning score. Harvard fans and players believed that Burr had called the fair catch, while Yale claimed he never had and both officials agreed with Yale. After the game, McClung said that \\"[the hit] looked ugly, but was within the rules of the game\\".Reid (1994), pp. 307-318 The officials' decision remained a big problem for college football for some time, and eventually then-president Theodore Roosevelt met with Dashiell to discuss the play. Their reputations as good officials were significantly hurt by the game and Harvard would not allow them to again referee in a game involving their team.Smith (2011), pp. 46-50 Following the season's conclusion, McClung joined other prominent football personnel in selecting that year's All-America team. McClung's selection included seven players who were later recognized as consensus All-Americans, and one of which, Tom Shevlin, would later make the Hall of Fame.Whitney (1906), p. 27 McClung refereed the final game of his career in 1906, when, alongside William Herbert Corbin, he officiated the Army‚ÄìNavy Game. Navy, coached by Paul Dashiell, won the contest 10-0.1906 Navy Midshipmen Schedule and ResultsThe Minneapolis Journal (1906), p. 3 During the time that he was a referee, McClung also pursued a career in steelmaking. His first work was as a chemist at the Carnegie Steel Company's Carrie Furnace in Rankin, Pennsylvania. During that time, he took up residence in Pittsburgh.Packer (1899), P. 175 Sometime in 1898, McClung was hired as the assistant superintendent at the blast furnaces of the Cambria Steel Company. After serving that position for about five years, he was hired by the Illinois Steel Company and was made the superintendent of the company's Joliet iron and steel blast furnaces. McClung would hold the position until his death, five years later. Death and legacy alt=A newspaper article, containing two paragraphs, discussing McClung's death While working at the Joliet Blast Furnaces, McClung developed a severe tooth infection, which eventually gave him blood poisoning. He succumbed to the latter condition on March 3, 1908, at the age of just 39. McClung's death came before those of his parents and all six of his siblings.The Allentown Leader (1908), p. 6The Iron Trade Review (March 12, 1908), p. 498 He was replaced just days after his death by W.J. Moore, a chemist who had worked under him at the plant.The Iron Trade Review (March 19, 1908), p. 534 Following his death, McClung was memorialized by several of his former teammates and officials. When \\"Big Bill\\" Edwards wrote and published his book Football Days, he included McClung in his tribute to deceased college football players. He wrote that: \\"Richard Harding Davis and [McClung] were two Lehigh men whose position in the football world was most prominent. The esteem in which they are held by their Alma Mater is enduring\\".Edwards (1916), pp. 459-460 Edwards also praised McClung and Dashiell's refereeing, stating that \\"Officials come and go. These men have had their day, but no two ever contributed better work. The game of Football was safe in their hands\\".Edwards (1916), p. 387 Paul Dashiell, when interviewed by Edwards' for Football Days, spoke about his relationship with McClung. He said that: : One friendship was made in these years that has been worth more than words can tell. I refer to that of Matthew McClung. To be known as a co- official with McClung was a privilege that only those who knew him can appreciate. I had known him before at Lehigh in his undergraduate days, and had played on the same teams with him[...] Never was there a squarer sportsman, or a fairer, more conscientious and efficient official; nor a truer, more gallant type of real man than he. His early death took out of the game a man of the kind we can ill afford to lose and no tribute that I could pay him would be high enough.Edwards (1916), pp. 389-390 Head coaching recordCollege footballCollege baseball=See also * * ReferencesNotesFootnotesBibliography= ;Books, journals, and yearbooks        * ;Newspapers          * * ;Other * * External links * Category:1868 births Category:1908 deaths Category:19th-century players of American football Category:American football quarterbacks Category:College football officials Category:Lehigh Mountain Hawks football players Category:Lehigh Mountain Hawks baseball coaches Category:Lehigh Mountain Hawks baseball players Category:Navy Midshipmen football coaches Category:Sportspeople from Knoxville, Tennessee Category:Players of American football from Tennessee ","title":"Matthew McClung"},{"id":"17973781","text":"Richard \\"Bill\\" Armstrong (July 16, 1873 ‚Äì August 4, 1938) was the seventh head college football coach for the United States Naval Academy Midshipmen located in Annapolis, Maryland and he held that position for three seasons, from 1897 until 1899.

The cemetery is protected and cared for by the city of Worms, the Jewish community of Mainz-Worms, and the Landesdenkmalamt of Rhineland-Palatinate. The Salomon L. Steinheim-Institute for German-Jewish History at the University of Duisburg-Essen has been documenting and researching it since 2005.  Geography  The Heiliger Sand extends over an approximately triangular area of about 1.6 hectares.I. Spille: City of Worms. 1992, p. 176. It was originally located southwest of the high medieval wall of the city of Worms. When in the 14th century a second rampart was built around Worms, it lay between the two fortifications. The number of gravestones is estimated at about 2500.Epidat: Jewish cemetery Worms. Due to the growth of the city in the second half of the 19th century the cemetery is today located at the edge of the city center, bordered by the Mainz‚ÄìLudwigshafen railway to the west, the Willy-Brandt-Ring to the east and the Andreasstra√üe to the north. = History of development = The oldest preserved gravestones date back to the 11th century. It is not known whether they document the beginning of the occupation of the cemetery or whether it is even older, even though there have been speculations about this time and again.O. B√∂cher: The old Jewish cemetery at Worms. 1992, p. 3. On the oldest preserved gravestone the name of the buried - in any case it is a male person - can no longer be read due to damage. According to today's knowledge it dates from the year 1058/59. Epidat: Jewish cemetery Worms. Inv. no. wrm-9008. For a long time, the gravestone of Jakob haBachur from 1076/77 was considered the oldest.Epidat: Jewish cemetery Worms. Inv. no. wrm-9009.O. B√∂cher: The old Jewish cemetery at Worms. 1992, p. 3, 6. Around 1260 the cemetery was given a solid wall as a fence. In the 15th or 16th century, as part of the new outer fortification, an underground passageway was dug through the cemetery, which connected the inner and outer Andrea Gate, and during its construction many of the gravestones of the cemetery were also walled up. The passage was 36 metres long, 1.50 metres high and 80 centimetres wide. It was excavated in 1930 and the gravestones were recovered. B√∂cher: The old Jewish cemetery at Worms. 1992, p. 4. On other occasions, too, gravestones have been stolen.O. B√∂cher: The old Jewish cemetery at Worms. 1992, p. 5. The route of the funeral processions led around half the city, from the north-east corner, where the Jewish quarter was located, around the inner wall to the south-west of the city, to the cemetery. Since the late Middle Ages, the noble family Dalberg had the right and the duty to protect the funeral processions on the way from the Jewish quarter to the Jewish cemetery. The Jewish community paid a fee for the protection of the Jews, which at the end of the 15th century amounted to 80 Malter. Korn amounted.Friedrich Battenberg: The imperial knightly rule of Dalberg and the Jews. In: Kurt Andermann (ed.): Knights of the Old Reich. The chamberlains of Worms called von Dalberg.

There is a legendary] story about the origin of this convoy, which was handed down by Juspa Schammes. According to it - at least in the 17th century - always two officials of the Dalbergs went with the funeral procession.Juspa Schammes: The story of the Dalberg family. In: F. Reuter, U.

The cemetery shortly after the destruction of the city in 1689; on the right in the picture the damaged tower \\"Luginsland\\" of the inner city wall Also during the pogrom of 1615 the cemetery was the target of vandalism: gravestones were knocked over and damaged.Juspa Schammes: The destruction of the synagogue 1615. In: F. Reuter, U. Sch√§fer: Wundergeschichten. 2005, p. 21-24 (24). The congregation was weakened by the pogrom and in 1618 the Thirty Years' War broke out. In 1620 the southwest corner of the town fortification was reinforced, whereby 2/3 of the cemetery area is said to have been covered by sconce.Juspa Schammes: The entrenchments of the cemetery. In: F. Reuter, U. Sch√§fer: Miracle Stories. 2005, p. 32. After this intervention a comprehensive restoration of the cemetery was done in 1625, which David Oppenheim donated, which he also did during the reconstruction of the Synagogue Worms Synagogue, which was severely damaged in 1615. At that time the entrance area of the cemetery got the entrance gate which is still preserved today as well as the Taharahaus. In addition the enclosure wall was renovated. But already in 1661 it was damaged again.Juspa Schammes: The cemetery. In: F. Reuter, U. Sch√§fer: Miracle Stories. 2005, p. 30. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the new cemetery section on the higher ground was the most frequently documented. This part is a remnant of the outer city fortification, which was destroyed by troops of King Louis XIV of France in 1689 during the Nine Years' War. In the 19th century the gravestones stylistically resembled those of Christian cemeteries, inscriptions were now often written bilingually: Hebrew and German. In 1902 the city of Worms opened the new main cemetery Hochheimer H√∂he. In 1911, immediately afterwards, a new Jewish cemetery was established, since the \\"Heilige Sand\\" no longer had any space and could not be expanded due to the renovation.

It constitutes together with the 83 decentralized libraries of the faculties and institutes the University Library System, which is headed by the director of the University Library. The University Library holds special collections in literature concerning the Palatinate and Baden, egyptology, archeology, the history of art, and South Asia. It holds about 3.2 million books, 10,732 scientific periodicals, and about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes. It holds 6,600 manuscripts (most notably the Codex Manesse), 1,800 incunabula, 110,500 autographs, and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs. The libraries of the faculties and institutes hold another 3.5 million printed books. In 2005, 34,500 active users of the University Library accessed 1.4 million books a year. The conventional book supply is complemented by numerous electronic services, such as 3,000 commercial scientific journals that can be accessed via e-journal. History The historical reading room fell victim to a 'modernization' in 1954 The University Library of today traces its roots back to the purchase of a chest of documents by the first Rector Marsilius von Inghen in 1388, which was stored in the Heiliggeistkirche, then the University Cathedral. Additional foundations of the library were laid through donations from bishops, chancellors, and early professors. Louis III willed his large and valuable collection to the university, as did also the Fugger of Augsburg. Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, combined the university's libraries in the 16th century, thus creating the Bibliotheca Palatina. In the 17th century, the greatest part of the Bibliotheca Palatina was donated to the Vatican in Rome as a loot of the Thirty Years War. Several manuscripts from the 10th to 18th century from the libraries of the secularized monasteries Salem and Petershausen later constituted the basis for the reconstruction. From 1901 to 1905, a richly ornamented four-wing red sandstone building was constructed for the library across from the Church of St. Peter. It was designed by Josef Durm, who adapted the Renaissance style of Heidelberg Castle and added numerous elements of Art Nouveau. The building was expanded several times, lately by enlarged basements under the courtyard of the neighboring New University. The frontage is punctuated with many windows for the sake of natural illumination. The University Library's stocks exceeded one million in 1934. Since 1978, the science branch of the University Library serves the institutes of natural sciences and medicine on the New Campus.

History Hotel Breakers in 1905 Hotel Breakers in 2009 George A. Boeckling, then general manager of Cedar Point, believed that the longer guests stayed at Cedar Point, the more profitable the resort would be. The park's two hotels at that time, the 20-room Bay Shore Hotel and the 125-room White House Hotel, were having trouble meeting the demands of overnight visitors. So, Boeckling made plans to build a massive hotel on the resort's beach. Keeping with Boeckling's vision of Cedar Point as the \\"Queen of American Watering Places\\", he set out to build the resort's grandest hotel. The Hotel Breakers opened on June 12, 1905, featuring 600 rooms, most with a view of Lake Erie. Each room included running water and one hundred had private baths, a rarity for hotels at that time. The hotel's Breakers Cafe seated 400 guests. The hotel was designed by the Knox & Elliott architectural firm and was influenced by chateaus Boeckling had seen while traveling in France. The hotel's lobby featured round seats, which remain a Cedar Point tradition. The ceiling was elaborate pressed tin and included chandeliers crafted by Tiffany artists. The hotel's original amenities included imported wicker furniture, large brass beds, a manicurist, a medical doctor, a tailor, a stenographer, a barbershop, news stand, ice cream parlor and souvenir counter. Adjacent to the lobby was a four-story rotunda featuring four tiers of balconies, which remains in the hotel. Singers from the Metropolitan Opera gave impromptu performances in the rotunda from their balconies during the 1910s and 1920s. A new wing was added to the Breakers in 1917 bringing the number of rooms to more than 700. The 160-room Bon Air wing of the hotel was added to the north side in 1926, bringing the number of rooms to 875. In 1935, the Hotel Breakers was modernized and the Tavern Terrace added near the hotel. The outdoor stage area provided entertainment and served cocktails. In 1995, the hotel added Breakers East, featuring 206 rooms, including 103 regular rooms, 95 suites and eight tower suites. The Breakers East project also featured three conference/meeting rooms and an outdoor pool and spa. Breakers East sits on a five-acre site just east of the Hotel Breakers‚Äô lobby. The 10-story Breakers Tower wing was added to the Hotel Breakers in 1999 with a five-story connecting link that is located just west of the Hotel Breakers‚Äô historic lobby and rotunda. Breakers Tower has a total of 230 rooms and suites, including 17 luxury suites with private balconies. It was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1987 but was altered significantly in 1999 with the demolition of several historic wings. After the demolition the hotel's National Historic Landmark status was removed on August 7, 2001. Cedar Point announced a two-year renovation of the hotel would begin in 2013. The renovations include repainting the hotel, replacing its roof, and a remodel of the interior in the off-season after summer 2014. The renovations are the largest cost project ever at Cedar Point. In 2018, the Bon Air wing of the hotel was replaced with a new 6 story tower (Breakers West) designed in the same style as the original resort, but with modern amenities and connecting rooms for families, as well as its own outdoor pool and jacuzzi. https://sanduskyregister.com/news/17115/hotel-breakers-addition-pays-tribute- to-its-past/ Notable people Over the years notable guests have included: Features The hotel sits on the one mile beach mentioned on Cedar Point's web page.

It is a form of utilization management and forms a medical guideline on treatment. Medicare coverage is limited to items and services that are considered \\"reasonable and necessary\\" for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury (and within the scope of a Medicare benefit category). In the absence of a NCD, an item or service is covered at the discretion of the Medicare contractors based on a local coverage determination (LCD). As of 2015, local coverage determinations only become public on an appeal, and do not set a precedent. What triggers an NCD? NCDs can be requested by external parties who identify an item or service as a potential benefit (or to prevent potential harm) to Medicare beneficiaries. External parties who may request an NCD are Medicare beneficiaries, manufacturers, providers, suppliers, medical professional associations, or health plans. NCDs can also be internally generated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under multiple circumstances. For existing items or services * Stakeholders have raised significant questions about health benefits of currently covered items or services * New evidence, or re-interpretation of previously available evidence indicates that current policies may need to be changed * Local coverage policies are inconsistent or conflicting, to the detriment of beneficiaries For new items or services * The technology represents a substantial clinical advance and is likely to result in significant health benefit if it is available more rapidly to patients for whom it is indicated * More rapid access is likely to have a significant programmatic impact on Medicare policies * Significant uncertainty exists around health benefits, patient selection, or appropriate facility and staffing requirements The NCD decision process The NCD development process generally takes 6‚Äì9 months, depending on the need for external technology assessments or coverage advisory committee reviews. For NCD requests that do not require these assessments/reviews, the entire NCD decision will be made no more than 6 months after the date the request is received. Phases during the first 6 months: * Preliminary Discussions * Benefit Category * National Coverage Request * Staff Review * External Technology Assessment and/or Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee * Staff Review * Draft Decision and Memorandum Posted Phases during last 3 months * Public Comments (30 days) * Final Decision Memorandum and Implementation Instructions (must be completed in 60 days) Relationship of NCDs and LCDs NCD decisions are binding on all Medicare contractors, and LCD policy can be no more restrictive than the NCD, although it can be less restrictive. If an NCD or other coverage provision states that an item is \\"covered for diagnoses/conditions A, B and C\\", contractors should not use that as a basis to develop an LCD to cover only \\"diagnoses/conditions A, B and C\\". When an NCD does not exclude coverage for other diagnoses/conditions, contractors should allow individual consideration, unless the LCD supports automatic denial of some or all of those other diagnoses/conditions. When national policy bases coverage on need assessment by the beneficiary's provider, LCDs should not include prerequisites. Evaluating LCDs for NCD consideration CMS is required (under the MMA) to evaluate LCDs to decide which decisions should be adopted nationally. When new LCDs are developed, a 731 Advisory Group reviews LCD topic submissions to determine which topics are forwarded to the CMS Coverage and Analysis Group (CAG). To promote consistency across LCDs, CMS requires Medicare contractors to: * Consult with other contractors prior to developing a new policy * Adopt or adapt existing LCDs when possible ReferencesExternal links *Medicare Coverage Database - Overview at cms.hhs.gov *NCD at medicarelaw.info *CMS National Coverage Determination Database at cms.gov Category:Medicare and Medicaid (United States) ","title":"National coverage determination"},{"id":"17974025","text":", lead ship of the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project, as seen in 2010 The Canadian Patrol Frigate Project (CPFP) was a procurement project undertaken by the Department of National Defence of Canada beginning in 1975 to find a replacement for the 20 combined ships of the , , , and classes of destroyer escorts. The CPFP was considered a core effort in the fleet modernization of Canada in the 1980s.Milner, p. 287 Facing several contract hurdles, the construction program got underway in 1987. The CPFP became known as the upon the construction of the ships. The Halifax class replaced the destroyer escort classes in the 1990s and remains a core element of the fleet. Background , an Annapolis-class destroyer escort that was replaced by the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project After calls from both internal and external sources for Canada to replace its aging fleet and upgrade its naval capability, the Canadian government announced the Ship Replacement Program.Milner, pp. 271‚Äì272, 276Hadley et al., p. 66 A study written in 1973 called for a frigate design in the 2500-ton range. In 1974, another study suggested a copy of the US . The project settled on a new general purpose design in 1975. In December 1977, the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project was authorized as part of the Ship Replacement Program. The Statement of Requirement was sent out in August 1978. The Statement required a ship with general purpose capability, with its primary function as an anti-submarine warfare platform with secondary capabilities in anti-air and anti-ship warfare. The design would also have to be able to operate a helicopter and have state-of-the-art command and communication equipment.Milner, p. 284 In December 1978, five bids were received and all were larger and more expensive than planned. The project team spent the next few years finding ways to keep the original requirements while cutting costs. The costs were exacerbated by the requirement that the ships be built in Canada, which had political benefits for the Trudeau government that had authorized the program. In 1980, the number of bids were narrowed to two competitors, SCAN Marine Incorporated of Montreal, Quebec and Saint John Shipbuilding (SJS) of Saint John, New Brunswick, and the final proposals were submitted in October 1982.Milner, p. 285 A helicopter replacement program for the CH-124 Sea King was initially tied to the CPFP, but that procurement project was later delayed. Contract award In June 1983, the federal government approved the budget for the design and construction of the first batch of six new frigates.Gimblett, pp. 175‚Äì179 Saint John Shipbuilding bid $1 billion less than SCAN Marine in their proposal. In order to compete, SCAN Marine lowered its bid to match that of Saint John Shipbuilding within 24 hours. This led to the Treasury Board declaring SCAN Marine's bid non- compliant, leaving Saint John Shipbuilding as the sole remaining entry.Milner, p. 289 This led to political divisions within the Trudeau government, with the Quebec Liberal caucus threatening to defect, which would bring down the government. To resolve the situation, the Tribal Refit and Update Modernisation Program (TRUMP) for the s was tied to the CPFP. Saint John Shipbuilding was awarded the contract for the six frigates for $3.9 billion. Quebec companies would get the TRUMP project for $1.4 billion and extras. The construction of three of Saint John Shipbuilding's six frigates would be subcontracted to Marine Industries and Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec. The design of the Halifax-class frigates reflected many advances in ship construction, such as a move to a prefabricated unit construction method, where the ship is assembled from prefabricated units in a drydock instead of the traditional keel-laying. Furthermore, the design of Halifax-class frigates incorporated many new technical improvements. For example, these vessels were the first in the world to be equipped with the Integrated Machinery Control System (IMCS), which allows for a very high degree of computer control for the machinery plant. Construction and delays When the contract was awarded in 1983, the planned delivery of the frigates was to stretch from 1985 to 1990. A series of issues, deriving from the lack of experience of SJS, led to delays. The company that was awarded the contract to design the vessels, Versatile Systems Engineering, financially collapsed and was reorganized. The two Quebec shipyards were consolidated into MIL-Davie Shipbuilding. The cost of replicating all the construction and training directives into French soon raised costs. Following this series of setbacks, SJS sought aid from the US shipyard Bath Iron Works in bringing the program under control. In March 1987, construction of the lead ship of the class, , began. In December 1987, a second batch of six frigates was ordered without tender from SJS.Milner, p. 292 The sole-source contract increased the tension between SJS and MIL-Davie Shipbuilding. This came to a head when SJS sought $1.7 billion in damages from MIL-Davie Shipbuilding. The matter was settled out of court in 1992, with MIL- Davie claiming the cost overruns were caused by the \\"50,000 design changes\\". However, construction continued unabated and the program finished on time. Halifax was accepted by Canada in June 1991. This was followed by a year of sea trials, during which the ship received negative reviews. Changes were made to the design following Halifaxs sea trials and were incorporated into all the following construction. By the time Halifax had commissioned in June 1992, the rest of Batch 1 had launched and two ships of Batch 2 were building.Milner, p. 301 Legacy Twelve ships in the class were completed for the program, the last entering service in September 1996.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 294 In total, the project cost $9.54 billion and created 3,000 jobs.Curran, p. 3 Named after Canadian communities, the majority of the ships in the class continued names from vessels that fought during the Second World War. A third batch of frigates was cancelled in an effort by the Canadian Forces to acquire nuclear-powered submarines in the late 1980s.Milner, p. 293 One of the purposes of the CPFP was to develop shipbuilding in Canada. Saint John Shipbuilding spent $340‚Äì360 million upgrading the shipyard in Saint John. However, the shipyard was unable to attract further government contracts and closed in 2003. MIL-Davie Shipbuilding entered receivership after failing to receive further government contracts. The program failed in that regard. The vessels of the class were considered world class upon their delivery. The Halifax class underwent the Frigate Life Extension program between 2010 and 2016/17. The frigates will continue to be the backbone of the fleet until the Single Class Surface Combatant replaces them in the 2020s.

He was one of the last original silent film accompanists, having accompanied films from 1924 to 1928. Mitchell revived the art from 1992 until his death in 2009, usually to wild acclaim. During the 1930s, he organized the Robert Mitchell Boys Choir, who were cast in many films from the 1930s to the 1960s. Early life and career Mitchell's Victorian era mother found the new art form of silent film \\"cheap and vulgar\\". However, as an avid music lover, she allowed him to take music lessons with the reasoning he could accompany church services. At the age of 12 he was allowed to take a stint at The Strand Theatre in Pasadena, California to play Christmas carols between showings of films. However, he did not stop playing once the film started, and his career as an accompanist began. He played for four years until the arrival of talkies made accompanists irrelevant. At age 18 in 1930, Mitchell became the youngest person to become a Fellow of the American Guild of Organists (AGO), the highest level of professional certification awarded by the organization. In 1932 Mitchell won a scholarship to the Eastman School of Music, where he studied piano. He stayed in New York City performing gigs that varied from church accompaniment to speakeasies and radio. Robert Mitchell Boys Choir Returning to Los Angeles, he started the Mitchell Singing Boys (also known as the St. Brendan's Church Boys Choir, Bob Mitchell's Singing Boys or simply Mitchell Boyschoir, from 1934‚Äì2000). The choir performed in over 100 films, including 1944's Best Picture winner Going My Way with Bing Crosby, Carefree with Fred Astaire, Angels with Dirty Faces with Pat O'Brien, and The Bishop's Wife with Cary Grant. Noted film composer Dimitri Tiomkin said of them, \\"Bob Mitchell‚Äôs boys represent the unusual combination of musicianship, artistry and versatility. Bob Mitchell‚Äôs genius is ever present. It was a great pleasure to have them sing and appear in The Great Waltz.\\" Tony Butala, the founder of The Lettermen, was Mitchell's most notable student. Mitchell and the choir were featured in a special short documentary film, Forty Boys and a Song (1941), which described the choir and showed the students rehearsing at their school desks as Mitchell provided instruction. The film was nominated for an Academy Award (for Best Short Subject, One-reel). In December 1949 Mitchell was honored on the television series, This Is Your Life, for his work with the choir.http://www.classictvinfo.com/ThisIsYourLife/TIYLEpisodeList.htm On Christmas Eve 1953, the choir appeared on Where's Raymond?, an American Broadcasting Company sitcom starring Ray Bolger. On Christmas night 1954, the choir appeared as the only guest on NBC's The Donald O'Connor Show and in December, 1971, they were reunited with Bing Crosby on the crooner's televised Christmas special, Bing Crosby and the Sounds of Christmas. A directory of the film soundtracks that incorporated performances of the boys' choir lists 70 films from That Girl from Paris (1936) through All Night Long (1981). The Choir itself appears in at least six of these films. Other work From 1962 to 1966 Mitchell played the organ for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Mitchell was musical director for several churches: St. Ann, St. Brendan, St. Kevin, and St. Peter in Los Angeles, and The Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Silent movie revival From 1992 until his death in 2009 Mitchell regularly accompanied silent films in revival houses, particularly in California. He performed at The Orpheum and played a weekly stint at The Silent Movie Theatre, playing some of the original scores he had in the 1920s. True to his art Mitchell noted, \\"I never play anything that wasn't published before the picture was made,\\" he says, \\"but I don't know how many people would actually know that.\\" Mitchell's accompaniments were well known, and he received wild acclaim for his performances. Mitchell performed until May 2009. After a bout with pneumonia his health began to decline. Mitchell hated missing a performance and according to a friend he tried to check himself out of the hospital weeks before his death so he could perform. The Silent Movie Theatre noted, \\"You don't really replace somebody like Bob Mitchell.\\" Surrounded by a few close friends and listening to a recording of one of his performances, Mitchell died on July 4, 2009 at the age of 96. His funeral was held at Christ the King Roman Catholic Church in Los Angeles on July 10, 2009. He is buried at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Awards Mitchell received many awards during his lifetime. He received the Silver Medal awarded at the Royal Palace in Monte Carlo by Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco. He also received a Silver Beaver Award, the highest honor awarded volunteers by local councils of the Boy Scouts of America. The American Melkite Archimandrite acclaimed Mitchell as a \\"Knight of Malta\\" with a medal. He also received an Honorary Plaque in the Amphitheater of Temple Ahavat Shalom, Northridge, California, as well as the \\"Pro Papa et Ecclesia\\" Certificate from Pope John Paul II.

The cathedral, built on the site of an earlier basilica, is dedicated to the patron saint of the city, the martyr Felician of Foligno (San Feliciano), who was buried here in 251 AD. It is the seat of the Bishop of Foligno.  History  The church was built in Romanesque style in the period 1133‚Äì1201. Bishop Marco began the construction in 1133. The renewed church was consecrated in 1149 by Cardinal Giulio di San Marcello. The cathedral has two fa√ßades, the principal fa√ßade, or west front, facing the Piazza Grande, and the secondary fa√ßade facing the Piazza della Repubblica. The north transept and the secondary fa√ßade were commissioned in 1204 by Bishop Anselmo degli Atti, as attested by an inscription on the fa√ßade. The south transept was opened in 1513, giving the church its present Latin cross configuration.  Fa√ßade  Mosaic on top of the fa√ßade The principal fa√ßade was built in 1133, soon after Foligno had become a bishop. The upper tympanum is an addition from the 16th century. This fa√ßade was restored in 1904, when the mosaic in the tympanum, made in the workshop of the Vatican, was added. It shows Christ enthroned between Saints Felician and Messalina, with Pope Leo XIII, who had commissioned the mosaic, praying on his knees. The corners of the square around the rose window are decorated with the evangelistic symbols. The bronze door is flanked by two stone lions. The secondary fa√ßade on the Piazza della Repubblica dates from 1201. It was commissioned by bishop Anselmo and is the work of the sculptors and architects Rodolfo and Binello. The upper part was finished by Ugolino III Trinci in the 14th century. It was enlarged in the 15th century and restored to something resembling the original in 1904 by the architect Vincenzo Benvenuti. It has multiple arches and three rose windows, of which the centre one, with its double pillars on the outside and twisted pillars on the inside, is among the most beautiful in Umbria. The two stone griffins underneath were sculpted to commemorate the victory of Foligno over Perugia. The carved wooden door is surrounded by five Romanesque arches decorated with bas-reliefs, representing Frederick Barbarossa and Pope Innocent III. The innermost arch is decorated with the signs of the zodiac, the stars, the sun, the moon, the hours and the attributes of the Four Evangelists. An inscription in the keystone of the upper arch says that \\"the stars, the sun, and the moon revealed a time of purity‚Äù. A new epoch of harmony was expected to begin between the Church and the Holy Roman Empire, as Pope Innocent III had just recognized Otto of Brunswick as Emperor Otto IV of the Holy Roman Empire. The Gothic building on the left of the main fa√ßade is the baptistery of the cathedral. The steps next to it lead to the Palazzo delle Canoniche (Palace of the Canons).  Interior  The interior of the cathedral has been redesigned and restored on several occasions. Its present grandiose interior is Neoclassical. The nave was enlarged in 1513 in the form of a Latin cross, and modified in the 16th century. The present appearance of the cathedral is attributable to the reconstruction by architect Giuseppe Piermarini (1734‚Äì1808) who removed earlier alterations. This local architect worked from the plans drawn by the architect and engineer Luigi Vanvitelli. Of the ancient Romanesque church, only the crypt remains. The cathedral was modified again at the beginning of the 20th century. Among the most important works of art in the cathedral is the Chapel of the Sacrament by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger (1527). Vespasiano Strada and Baldassare Croce painted in this chapel two large frescoes depicting the life of San Feliciano. This saint is also represented by an elaborate silver statue. The canvases on the side walls date from the 13th - 19th centuries. The large fresco of Angela of Foligno in the apse dates from 1719 and is the work of Francesco Mancini (1679‚Äì1758). Among the other works of art are a Crucifixion, painted on wood by Niccol√≤ Alunno and two busts of Roscioli spouses by the great Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Baldacchino over altar. The gilded Baroque baldachin over the main altar, built in the 18th century by Antonio Calcioni for the benefit of the family Salvi Roscioli, is a faithful reproduction of Bernini's baldacchino in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The arms of the Roscioli family appear at the base of the columns. Twenty-six stucco statues of saints, the work of Brunelli and Ottaviani, are ranged in niches along the walls along with a new work by Cody Swanson depicting Saint Emygdius. This modern addition was commissioned by Giuseppe Betori, Cardinal of Florence, as a gift to replace an earlier version destroyed during the Second World War. The elegant dome was added to the cathedral during the period 1543-1548 by the architect and woodworker Giuliano di Baccio d'Agnolo and Cola di Caprarola. The upper part of the bell tower of the cathedral was renovated in 1847 by the architect Vitali, while the lower part is still original. Inside the campanile is the cell where the Blessed Pietro Crisci lived, decorated with frescoes from the 15th century. It was in this cathedral that Angela of Foligno made her confession to the Franciscan Brother Arnaldo. This was a turning point in her life, as she embarked on the way of penance. Brother Arnaldo later became the writer of her revelations in the Book of Visions and Instructions. During the 1997 earthquake, the cathedral suffered heavy damage, including the detachment of the fa√ßade, and was reopened in 1999. Damaged again during the 2016 earthquake, it is now closed and waiting for new works.

Norsk Hydro announced in July 2017 that it would take full ownership of the 50/50 joint venture Sapa AS by buying the remaining 50 percent stake from conglomerate Orkla Group. The transaction was completed and Sapa was brought into Hydro ASA on October 2, 2017. According to Bloomberg, Sapa \\"falsified thousands of certifications for aluminum parts over 19 years for hundreds of customers, including NASA.\\" In Extruded Solutions, Hydro has the largest global aluminium extrusion-based solutions operation in the world, counting 100 production sites in more than 40 countries, and has 22,400 employees. Hydro's head office is located in Oslo, Norway.  History  Skandinaviska Aluminiumprofiler AB (Scandinavian Aluminum Profiles) set up its first extrusion plant in Vetlanda in 1963, with sales of aluminum profiles from the Swedish plant beginning in 1967. The Norwegian corporation Orkla Group acquired Sapa in 2005 and delisted the company from the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Sapa and Alcoa engaged in a joint venture in 2007, making it one of the world's largest extrusion companies. One year later, in December 2008, Alcoa and Orkla executed an asset swap transaction. In this transaction, Orkla took over Alcoa's soft aluminium alloy extrusion business, which was then organized under the Sapa name, and became the sole owner of Sapa In 2009 the company acquired 10 North American extrusion plants that belonged to Indalex. At the time of the purchase, Indalex was under bankruptcy protection. The acquisition covered six plants in the United States and four in Canada. In October 2012, Orkla and the Norwegian company Norsk Hydro announced that they had agreed to combine the aluminium extrusion businesses of Sapa and Hydro into a new 50/50 joint venture, which would keep the Sapa name. After having received approvals from all relevant authorities, the joint venture transaction was closed and a new company, Sapa AS, was established on September 1, 2013. Hydro ASA acquired Sapa in October 2017, when Sapa was renamed Hydro Extruded Solutions and organized as a new business area. In 2019 a NASA investigation of two Minotaur-C launch failures determined the root cause was the use of defective parts manufactured and allegedly fraudulently certified by Sapa Profiles, Inc. (SPI).  Organization  Internally, Hydro Extruded Solutions has four business units. Two of them, organized geographically, are within Extrusions. The other two are Precision Tubing and Building Systems. In fact, one of the aluminium building systems brands has retained the former company name, Sapa. In total, Hydro Extruded Solutions operates some 100 production sites in more than 40 countries. The business area has about 22,400 employees across the world.https://www.sapagroup.com/contentassets/b0a41f16c64646399740413278eb863c/sapa- annual-report-2016.pdf?showInContext=1323 = Extrusions = Extrusions is a producer of extruded aluminium profiles. Sites also handle cutting, bending, CNC processing, hydroforming, fusion welding, friction stir welding, electromagnetic pulse forming, electromagnetic pulse welding anodizing and painting. Extrusions is organized internally with two business units, covering North America and Europe. Its extrusion activities in Asia and South America are organized within the Precision Tubing unit. = Building Systems = Building Systems develops and sells aluminium-based window, door and facade products.

The business unit also is responsible for Hydro's general extrusion operations in Asia and South America.  Sustainability  Hydro's move toward a circular economy involves an emphasis on recycling aluminium. Aluminium can be recycled and reused over and over without any reduction in quality, consuming only 5 percent of the energy that was required in the primary aluminium production. In 2017, more than half of the aluminium used in Hydro Extruded Solutions' production stemmed from internal scrap recycling and billets of remelted aluminium provided by external suppliers, according to Sapa's.Sustainability Report of 2016  References  Category:Manufacturing companies of Norway Category:Aluminium companies of Norway Category:Companies based in Oslo Category:Companies established in 1963 ","title":"Hydro Extruded Solutions"},{"id":"17974170","text":"Higher education policy refers to education policy for higher education institutions such as universities, specifically how they are organised, funded, and operated in a society.

It is designed to offer \\"public and professional recognition for teachers' learning, development and improvement work\\". Teachers can work on their projects ether individually or collaboratively. They can also work inside of their school or across counties. Six core dimensions At the heart of the TLA are six core dimensions, based on research relating to professional development for teachers. These dimensions are, engaging with the knowledge base, coaching and mentoring, planning your learning, carrying out your plan, sharing your learning and influencing practice and evaluating your learning and its impact. Structure Since 2011, the structure has been divided into four main categories: =Affiliate of the Teaching and Learning Academy (ATLA)= These members simply have access to the TLA's online resources. =Associate Member of the Teaching and Learning Academy (AMTLA)= Associate Membership is divided into two categories. At TLA Recognition 1, the Associate Member takes on a personal development activity. At TLA Recognition 2, the Associate Member takes on a reflective activity that impacts on people beyond his/herself. =Member of the Teaching and Learning Academy (MTLA)= These members are taking part in TLA Accreditation, which aligns to Levels 4-8 of the National Qualifications Framework. =Fellow of the Teaching and Learning Academy (FTLA)= A Fellowship is awarded to those who have had a significant impact on others. =Previous structure (2004-2011)= 375px Until 2011, the Academy was structured with four stages of recognition that incorporated the six core dimensions. Teachers could choose to produce work at one of the four stages. At Stage One the expectation was that the impact of the teacher's work would predominantly be seen in their own classroom. This could be using \\"an area of interest, teaching strategy or new initiative\\". Stage one was expected to be carried out for a short period of time (from two weeks to a half term). Stage Two required the ‚Äúsphere of influence‚Äù to be extended so the teacher's learning affected their colleagues. Stage Two presentations required evidence of reflection whereas Stage One was simply a descriptive account of the learning; this was done through a ‚Äúlearning breakthrough‚Äù. Stage One was expected to last no more than half a term, but the more in-depth Stage Two took between one and two terms. The presentation demands were increased at Stage Two; a teacher was required to complete a learning breakthrough. In Stage Three, teachers were expected to partake in a sustained piece of professional development. This was expected to last for between two and three terms. They were also expected to be familiar with the core dimensions for this stage. Stages One, Two and Three are equivalent to the new Associate Member of the Teaching & Learning Academy. Stage Four was intended to have a much larger effect. The impact of the work reached into the regional or national areas. This stage was also to provide recognition for those who make significant contributions to the knowledge base. Stage Four is equivalent to the new Fellow of the Teaching and Learning Academy. Achieving a TLA Stage Teachers are able to achieve a TLA stage in a wide variety of ways, for example: * Outlining a change in their teaching practice * Describing the effect of a teaching initiative, for example, BBC News School Report. History The Teaching & Learning Academy was originally launched as the Teacher Learning Academy. It was established by the General Teaching Council for England (GTC(E)) in 2004. The TLA was originally run in house by the GTC(E), before being contracted out to Cambridge Education in September 2008.http://www.theassignmentreport.com/articles/20080802_9/print From June 2009, a partnership with the College of Teachers allowed TLA submissions to be awarded accreditation by the College, as well as the TLA.http://www.collegeofteachers.ac.uk/press-release/the-college-of-teachers- and-teacher-learning-academy-join- forces-164http://www.collegeofteachers.ac.uk/tla/ In anticipation of the GTC(E) being abolished, the TLA suspended activities in March 2011 and was put up for sale by the GTC(E). It was subsequently bought by the Cathedrals Group. In November 2011, the Teacher Learning Academy was relaunched as the Teaching & Learning Academy, with a modified structure.

The first venue was 4 Loerie Street, Somerset West, Western Cape, South Africa. By the end of the year there were 26 students in the school. The original name of the school was Helderberg Private School. As there are other schools that use \\"Helderberg\\" in their names the Western Cape Education Department asked the owners to change the name of the school.Western Cape Education Department Since 2000 the school has been known as False Bay High School.History of Strand During January 2000 the school moved to 5 Almeida Street, Strand, Western Cape when the owners of the school bought the new venue. As the city council did not give permission to use this address as a school the school moved to a rented venue at 79 Andries Pretorius Street in January 2003. The school moved to 37 Edison Street in September 2004. Once again the school had to move. The plot had a clause in the title deed against running any business from it and the minister of environmental affairs of the Western Cape was not prepared to give permission to lift this clause. The school then moved to 27 Van der Merwe Street, Strand in January 2007. The city council approved this venue. The founder of the school and his wife bought this big house from the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk Suider-Strand. The church used this house as a rectory. The founder of the school lived in this rectory for thirteen years as a child. His father was the minister of this church until 1977. The youngest son of the headmaster, Ian Janse van Rensburg,PC Place designed the first website of the school while he was still a student of the school.

The car was designed by Eyston and E A D Eldridge, then built by the father of Tom Delaney It was powered by an unsupercharged version of the V-12 Rolls-Royce Kestrel aero engine. The car was too large and heavy for circuit racing and was already underpowered by the standards of the absolute speed record breakers. This car was designed for endurance, more than peak power. Running a supercharged engine with the fuel and materials technology of the day would never have lasted the duration. This particular engine was obtained second-hand from Rolls-Royce, where it had previously powered an airflow fan in an engine test cell. Having always been intended for long-term use at ground level, it had been built without the Kestrel's usual supercharger. For streamlining, distinctive features of the car are the two small \\"nostrils\\", headlights and air inlets in the nose. These produced less drag than a typical inlet and flat honeycomb radiator. The engine was cooled instead by a surface radiator wrapped around the top of the bodywork, just in front of the driver. During testing, the car appears to have run, although not competitively, at either Brooklands or Montlhery.  Records  Speed of the Wind was built for long-duration speed records, which were the domain of Ab Jenkins and the Bonneville salt flats of Utah. Jenkins was fond of competition and was instrumental in encouraging British teams to travel to Bonneville. = 1935 = After setting the 24 hour record In September 1935, shortly after Campbell's 300 mph record with Blue Bird, Eyston broke Jenkins' 24-hour record and raised it to = 1936 = For the 1936 season, Jenkins created the Mormon Meteor by fitting a Curtiss Conqueror V12 into his previous Duesenberg chassis. Eyston returned, with E A D Eldridge as team manager, and his colleague from Brooklands, John Cobb in the Napier-Railton as another competitor. (photo of the Napier-Railton at Bonneville) Eyston set the first records, averaging for 24 hours and over 48 hours. The Mormon Meteor made its first attempt, beating the average speed to 12 hours at , but retiring with a driveshaft failure. John Cobb then took Eyston‚Äôs 24 hour record at , but didn't attempt 48.

A native of Knoxville, Tennessee, Broome was a founding member of The Wilderness Society,Sutter, p. 3 for which he served as president from 1957 until his death in 1968, and played a key role in the establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The Tennessee Chapter of the Sierra Club is named the \\"Harvey Broome Group\\" in his honor. Early life and career Broome was born in Knoxville to George W. and Adeline Broome on July 15, 1902. During his childhood, he frequently visited his grandparents' farm in Fountain City (now a suburb of Knoxville). Located 40 miles north of the Great Smoky Mountains, it was here that Broome developed his love of the outdoors. At the age of fifteen, his father took him on his first camping trip, to Silers Bald in the Smokies.\\"Harvey Broom\\". The Wilderness Society website. Retrieved on January 26, 2010. After graduating from Knoxville High School in 1919, Broome attended the University of Tennessee, graduating in 1923. Three years later, he earned a law degree from Harvard University. Although he began his law career as a clerk, he eventually entered into private practice with a law firm in Oak Ridge, Tennessee called Kramer, Dye, McNabb and Greenwood. Realizing after several years that the life of a clerk had provided him with more time to spend in the outdoors, Broome left the firm to return to his former position. He clerked for federal district court judge Xen Hicks from 1930 to 1949, and for Judge Robert L. Taylor from 1958 to 1968. Conservation Four founders of The Wilderness Society: (l-r) Bernard Frank, Harvey Broome, Bob Marshall, and Benton MacKaye In October 1934, while attending a forestry conference in the Smokies, Broome met fellow conservationists Bob Marshall, Benton MacKaye and Bernard Frank, all of whom shared a common interest in the need for an organization to protect America's wilderness areas. Three months later, The Wilderness Society was created; Broome would be heavily involved in the Society for the remainder of his life. Among his achievements was his work alongside Society executive director Howard Zahniser in persuading the United States Congress to create the National Wilderness Preservation System, which occurred in 1964 when Congress passed the Wilderness Act. Broome was present among other conservationists when President Lyndon Johnson signed the bill into law on September 3, 1964. He also wrote a letter detailing his predictions of the future of forest preservation, which is to be opened by the President of the United States on October 24, 1964. In the mid-1930s, Broome was director of the Great Smoky Mountains Conservation Association. While he advocated the creation of the park, he disagreed with Park Commission president David C. Chapman, who wanted to develop the park as a tourist attraction. Broome wanted the park strictly preserved as a wilderness, with access provided via hiking trails.Mark Banker, Appalachians All: East Tennesseans and the Elusive History of an American Region (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2010), p. 288. In 1954, Broome was one of several conservationists (among them Justice William O. Douglas) to hike the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath in protest of plans to convert the towpath into a road. In the mid-1960s, he helped establish the Save-Our-Smokies campaign, mainly to oppose the construction of a trans-mountain road through the park. Broome published his first article, \\"Great Smoky Mountain Trails,\\" in Mountain magazine in 1928.Anne Broome, \\"Harvey Broome,\\" An Encyclopedia of East Tennessee (Oak Ridge, Tenn.: Children's Museum of Oak Ridge, 1981), pp. 66-67. In subsequent years, he contributed numerous articles to various publications, including Living Wilderness (The Wilderness Society's publication), National Parks Magazine, and Nature, among others. Three of his books were published posthumously: Out Under the Skies in the Great Smoky Mountains, Faces of the Wilderness, and Harvey Broome: Earth Man. Broome served as president of the East Tennessee Historical Society from 1945 to 1947. During this period, the Society published its first comprehensive history of Knoxville and Knox County, The French Broad-Holston County: A History of Knox County, Tennessee, which was edited by Lawson McGhee librarian Mary Rothrock. Broome provided three chapters for the book detailing the history of Knox County's government. Personal life Broome married his wife Anna, who shared his love of the outdoors, in 1937. They lived in a house that the couple relocated from Broome's grandfather's farm to Knoxville; they also owned a cabin in the Smokies. Harvey Broome died of a heart attack on March 8, 1968, while building a birdhouse out of a hollow log. NotesReferences= *Sutter, Paul. 2002.

Built in 1823, it was the law office of Joshua Reed Giddings (1795-1864), a prominent abolitionist who served as a US Representative from 1838 to 1859. The building was recognized as a National Historic Landmark for Giddings' role in the slavery debates preceding the American Civil War. It is now owned by the local historical society, and is a museum open by appointment. Description and history The Joshua Read Giddings Law Office is located east of downtown Jefferson, on the south side of East Jefferson Street, across from the Jefferson Baptist Church and next to a small public park called Giddings Park. It is a small single-story wood- frame structure, covered by a gabled roof and finished in wooden clapboards. The front facade has the main entrance on the right and a window on the left; a similar arrangement is on the back as well. The doorway is flanked by slender pilasters and topped by a corniced entablature. The building has simple corner boards, which rise to a narrow entablature; the gable above is fully pedimented. The interior of the building consists of a single chamber. The building was constructed in 1823. From 1838 to 1859 it served as the law office of Joshua Reed Giddings. Giddings was a vocal abolitionist, who pressed debates on slavery during his service in the United States House of Representatives. His radical pronouncements earned him the censure of Congress for violating the body's gag rule forbidding discussion of slavery. Giddings is believed to a significant effect on the antislavery stance of President Abraham Lincoln. The building is now a museum owned and operated by the Ashtabula County Historical Society. Originally located next to Giddings' house on North Chestnut Street, it was moved to its present location in 2013.

He remained in Seattle until the fall of 1908. Owsley returned to Connecticut in November 1908 to help the Yale football team prepare for its game against Princeton. Owsley married Helen Blanche Hall in November 1908 at New Haven, Connecticut. Her father, John M. Hall, was the president of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. Owsley and his wife had two daughters, Julia, born November 27, 1913, and Helen, born August 18, 1920. From 1908 until at least 1910, Owsley continued to work in the logging business, buying and selling lumber for people in the East. He lived in Seattle and made occasional short trips to the East. In December 1915, Owsley became employed by Marlin-Rockwell Corporation, the largest producers of machine guns in the world. On January 7, 1918, the company sent a letter in support of a passport application to allow Owsley, then holding the position of assistant general manager, to travel to France to investigate the use of machine guns in aircraft. The letter noted that Owsley was given the charge \\"to observe the requirements of the airplane program in France as it may apply to the Marlin Aircraft Guns, and return to our organization with the practical information that will enable us to co-operate with the Government in manufacture and shipment to best advantage of all concerned.\\"U.S. Passport Application for John E.

Owsley had developed a reputation as \\"a wartime production authority in New England\\" based on his service with Marlin-Rockwell during World War I. In 1940, Owsley helped organize High Standard Manufacturing Company, an armaments company based in New Haven, Connecticut. In October 1940, Owsley secured a $12 million order from the British Purchasing Commission for machine guns to be mounted on airplanes for the Royal Air Force. In 1941 and 1942, Owsley was included on a list compiled by the Treasury Department of the top salary earners in the United States. His salary in 1942 was reported as $421,206, a reduction of $122,000 from his 1941 salary. Owsley served as High Standard's vice president until 1945, continuing thereafter as a director until his retirement in approximately 1948. In a draft registration card completed at the time of World War II, Owsley indicated that he was living at 300 Prospect Street, New Haven, Connecticut, with his wife Helen Hall Owsley, and that he was working for the High Standard Mfg.

It was named after Turkish mathematician Selman Akbulut.A.Scorpan, The wild world of 4-manifolds (p.90), AMS Pub. A compact contractible Stein 4-manifold C with involution F on its boundary is called an Akbulut cork, if F extends to a self- homeomorphism but cannot extend to a self-diffeomorphism inside (hence a cork is an exotic copy of itself relative to its boundary). A cork (C,F) is called a cork of a smooth 4-manifold X, if removing C from X and re-gluing it via F changes the smooth structure of X (this operation is called \\"cork twisting\\"). Any exotic copy X' of a closed simply connected 4-manifold X differs from X by a single cork twist. The basic idea of the Akbulut cork is that when attempting to use the h-corbodism theorem in four dimensions, the cork is the sub-cobordism that contains all the exotic properties of the spaces connected with the cobordism, and when removed the two spaces become trivially h-cobordant and smooth. This shows that in four dimensions, although the theorem does not tell us that two manifolds are diffeomorphic (only homeomorphic), they are \\"not far\\" from being diffeomorphic.Asselmeyer-Maluga and Brans, 2007, Exotic Smoothness and Physics To illustrate this (without proof), consider a smooth h-cobordism W^5 between two 4-manifolds M and N.

Boston, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 283 (1849),. were two similar cases, argued together before the United States Supreme Court, which decided 5-4 that states do not have the right to impose a tax that is determined by the number of passengers of a designated category on board a ship and/or disembarking into the State. The cases are sometimes called the Passenger Case or Passenger Cases. The Court did not produce a majority opinion. Eight Justices authored separate opinions, and the respective stances on various issues did not always align with other Justices in their concurrences or dissents. The issues addressed in the various opinions included the following: *Whether the Commerce Clause exclusively commits the power to regulate foreign commerce, interstate commerce and commerce with the Indian tribes to the federal government and thus makes state regulation concerning foreign commerce an unconstitutional violation of the Commerce Clause, or whether the states were free to regulate until such regulation conflicted with a valid federal regulation or involved an area that could be regulated only on a uniform basis. *Whether regulation of migration of free individuals (as distinct from slaves) was included in the meaning of \\"commerce\\" covered by the Commerce Clause. *Whether states had an absolute right to determine who could enter its geographical domain that could not be compromised, even by ratification of a foreign treaty, by the federal government except with respect to federal officials, employees and agents, and foreign diplomats. *Whether the federal government had any constitutional authority to regulate immigration from foreign nations (as distinct from its acknowledged power to determine which immigrants could be naturalized). *Whether such laws violated the requirement of the introductory clause of Article I, Section 8, of the US Constitution, mandating any imposts to be \\"uniform throughout the United States. *Whether Article I, Section 9, of the Constitution, making 1808 a watershed date regarding congressional power over \\"Such Persons as any of the States now existing should think proper to admit,\\" referred only to the slave trade or also to immigration of free persons. *Whether the nature of the New York and the Massachusetts laws imposed a tax on the passengers or on the ships, and the implications of this distinction with respect to the nature of the taxation power of the states; and for those Justices concurring in the judgment of the Court; and the status and meaning of City of New York vs. Miln.34 U.S. (11 Pet.) 85 (1835). The Passengers Case is of historical interest. It portrays a diversity of views on several constitutional questions, especially whether the Commerce Clause prohibits any state regulation of interstate and foreign commerce in the absence of federal law or treaty. A bitter personal attack on Chief Justice Taney by Justice Wayne also provided a glimpse of the personal dynamics of the fractious court. However, the failure of the court to produce a majority opinion significantly diminished the value of the Passengers Case as formal legal precedent. Background In each case, a state imposed a tax to be collected from the master of a ship entering a harbor of that state. In each case, the captain of a British ship challenged the constitutionality of the state law. Other facts varied between the two cases. =Smith v. Turner= The State of New York imposed a tax on the passenger and the crew of each ship entering the Port of New York at the following rates: *If the vessel traveled from Connecticut, New Jersey or Rhode Island, the tax would be 25 cents for each person on board on the first occasion of each month such ship entered the Port of New York. *If the vessel traveled from another state, the tax would be 25 cents for each person on board with respect to each voyage including an entry into the Port of New York. *If the vessel traveled from a foreign port, the tax would be $1.50 for the master of the ship, $1.50 for each passenger of cabin class, $1.00 for each other crew member, and $1.00 for each passenger of steerage class. The revenues collected would be first directed to cover expenses of a marine hospital to care for those who arrived in a sickened state at the Port of New York. Excess revenues not needed for the maintenance of the marine hospital were redirected to the Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents in the City of New York, a charitable organization caring for and confining delinquent boys. Smith was the master of Henry Bliss a British ship. It sailed from Liverpool, England, and entered the Port of New York in June 1841. Steerage-class passengers, 295 in number, disembarked in New York City. Smith refused to pay the portion of the New York State tax that was measured by these steerage-class passengers. Turner, the Health Commissioner of the Port of New York, sued Smith for $295 in taxes due under New York State law. =Norris v. City of Boston= Massachusetts had a law that required an appropriate official to board each ship that had alien passengers on board and had entered one of its port of that State. The official was to examine each alien passenger and determine which of them, if any, were a lunatic, an idiot, maimed, aged, an infirm person, an incompetent, or a current or former pauper or who had been a pauper. Such a passenger would be permitted to disembark only upon the posting of a bond for $1000. Other alien passengers would be permitted to disembark upon the payment of a tax by the master, owner, consignee, or agent of such vessel amounting to the sum of $2.00 for each such passenger so disembarking. The revenue collected would be directed to a fund to pay for the support of aliens who had become paupers in Massachusetts. Norris was the master of the Union Jack, a schooner from St. John, of the Province of New Brunswick, then part of the British Empire. It sailed from St. John and arrived in the Boston harbor on June 26, 1837. Norris was compelled by Bailey, an official of Boston, to pay $38.00 before the 19 alien passengers, none of whom being in such a state or hving such a history requiring the posting of a bond, were permitted to disembark. Norris sued the City of Boston to recover the $38.00 as having been improperly compelled. Decision In each case, the Supreme Court held 5-4 that part of the respective State statute to be unconstitutional. A federal constitutional principle, known as \\"standing,\\" precludes the giving of an advisory opinion, a pronouncement of a decision that goes beyond the facts and record of the particular case. Thus, parts of the respective statutes not implicated by the specific facts of the case are not supposed to be ruled upon until a case involving a contest over such matters is actually presented to the court. In Smith v. Turner, the portion of the New York statute concerning the collection of a tax measured by the number of steerage-class passengers from ships arriving from a foreign port was declared unconstitutional. In Norris v. City of Boston, that portion of the Massachusetts law imposing a tax measured by the number of alien passengers allowed to disembark without a bond was struck down as unconstitutional. =Concurring opinions= Justices McLean, Wayne, Catron, McKinley and Grier all concurred with the judgment of the United States Supreme Court in both cases. All five of the concurring Justices wrote a concurring opinion. The opinions of McLean and Wayne addressed the various issues that they considered to be implicated in both cases. Catron's opinion addressed only the Smith (New York) case; Grier's opinion addressed only the Norris (Massachusetts) case. Catron and Grier unequivocally joined each other's respective opinions. Wayne also endorsed Catron's and Grier's opinions. McKinley's opinion was limited to a discussion of the first clause of Article I, Section 9 of the US Constitution. (McKinley's opinion on that topic was also endorsed by Wayne.) McKinley may be deemed to be joining Grier's opinion (concerning the Norris case), as he stated that such opinion had expressed their \\"joint views in the cause coming up from Massachusetts\\" and that the writing of such opinion by Grier \\"has been done to [McKinley's] entire satisfaction.\\"48 U.S. at 452. McKinley remarked that he had \\"examined the opinions of... McLean and... Catron, and concur with the whole reasoning upon the main question.\\" What McKinley viewed as that \\"main question\\" is not explained but probably referred to the apparently harmonious views of McLean and Catron concerning the nature of the Commerce Clause and its implications with respect to the reserved taxation and police powers of the states. The sequence in which the concurring opinions appear in the official reports follows the seniority of the respective concurring Justices who authored each opinion. =McLean's opinion= Justice McLean, the most senior member of the Court at the time, began his opinion by weighing in on the debate concerning the nature of the Commerce Clause. He asserted thar the Commerce Clause \\"is exclusively vested in Congress.\\"48 U.S. at 400. Therefore, if the federal government does not regulate a particular area of foreign or interstate commerce, the omission is not an invitation to the states to provide interim regulation but is an expression of federal policy that the area should remain unregulated. McLean derived that interpretation of the Commerce Clause from a fundamental rejection of the concept of concurrent power. Only one authority can exercise any given power, and the judicial task is to determine whether a particular subject falls within a power delegated to the federal government or within a power reserved to the states. McLean denied that a power may be exercised by the states unless the federal government chooses to exercise the same power when state regulation is trumped by the federal action. Although he recognized that both Congress and the states may impose a tax on the same object, he insisted that the respective taxations result from the exercise of distinct powers and do not represent any concurrent exercise of the same power. It is unclear what role the Supremacy Clause had in McLean's constitutional theory since he apparently viewed each level of government as supreme in its own legitimate and distinct sphere of operations. One of the key debates in the Passenger Cases concerned the question whether the transport of free persons, as distinct from goods and slaves, was to be included or excluded from the concept of \\"commerce\\" for purposes of the Commerce Clause. McLean construed the Commerce Clause to include the transport of free persons within its scope. In support, McLean cited the following passage from Gibbons v. Ogden: \\"the power to regulate commerce applies equally to the regulation of vessels employed in transporting men who pass from place to place voluntarily, and to those who pass involuntarily.\\"48 U.S. at 401, quoting from 22 U.S. at 216-217. McLean wrote in his opinion, \\"A state cannot regulate foreign commerce, but it may do many things which more or less affect it.\\"48 U.S. at 402. Thus, the next judicial task was to discern whether the New York tax was a regulation of foreign and interstate commerce or merely an exercise of legitimate state authority having an incidental effect on foreign and interstate commerce. McLean did not consider attempts on the part of a State to defend itself from the introduction of harm to be a regulation of commerce. Thus, McLean viewed exclusion of infectious people from the state as a quarantine measure and part of the state's reserved right to protect the health of its citizens and in no sense a regulation of foreign or interstate commerce. He further acknowledged that a state may charge a fee reflecting the actual cost of the inspection for disease. He also acknowledged a right for states to prevent the entry of paupers to prevent the imposition of an economic burden. However, McLean did not recognize an unqualified right of the states to screen new entrants: \\"Except to guard its citizens against diseases and paupers, the municipal power of a state cannot prohibit the introduction of foreigners brought to this country under the authority of Congress.\\"48 U.S. at 406. McLean rejected the characterization of the New York statute as a health measure. Although the revenues were applied in the first instance to a hospital, surplus revenues were diverted to a charitable society in New York City caring for delinquent boys. To McLean, a law that demanded payment beyond a fee for actual cost of inspection was a revenue measure, with no principled limitation that could be placed on the state as to the use of that revenue. McLean insisted that the law imposed a tax on passengers and crew and that if a tax of $1.00 per passenger could be extracted by New York, a higher tax could also be imposed, including in an amount that would completely stifle the commercial activity of transporting passengers into the Port of New York. McLean thus concluded that the New York statute at bar was a regulation of commerce and an intrinsic violation of the Commerce Clause. McLean also considered the New York law a violation of Article I, Section 8, of the US Constitution, requiring all duties, imposts, and excises to be uniform throughout the United States. McLean considered the clause to be enforceable against the states as well as Congress and considered a tax on passengers entering the United States to be an \\"impost\\" and a state tax on such passengers to have the effect of making such imposts non-uniform. He went beyond the facts of the case to comment (as dictum\\"Dictum\\" refers to judicial comments that are superfluous to those necessary to decide the case at bar. The antonym is \\"desideratum,\\" referring to reasoning that was essential or necessary to produce the judgment. Strictly speaking, dictum, even when it appears in a majority decision of the United States Supreme Court, is not binding precedent on lower courts.) that the tax, when applied to the crew and passengers of coastal vessels traveling from other states, violated the sixth clause of Article I, Section 9, prohibiting the imposition of duties on vessels traveling from one state to another. McLean commented that under the Commerce Clause, the Massachusetts tax on immigrant passengers was unconstitutional. McLean did not refer to his views regarding uniformity of imposts in his short discussion of the latter case. McLean did not join the vituperative debate concerning the manner in which the majority opinion in City of New York v. Miln11 U.S. 1 was adopted, but he reconciled his assent to the majority opinion in the Miln decision with his opinion in the Passenger Cases by noting that the Miln case involved no question concerning the validity of a tax but only the validity of a reporting requirement. =Wayne's opinion= Justice Wayne's concurrence with the judgment, although referring to several particular provisions of the US Constitution, was apparently derived from a holistic understanding of the general impact of all of its provisions on commerce as well as the nature of commerce as it exists, even in the absence of formal documents such as the Constitution or the preceding Articles of Confederation. His analysis was formed from a consideration of many provisions of Article I of theConstitution, including the proviso of the first clause of its Section 8 on the uniformity of \\"Duties, Imposts and Excises;\\" the passages of the third clause of Section 8 authorizing Congress to \\"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States\\" (the Commerce Clause); the passage of the fourth clause of Section 8 authorizing Congress to \\"establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization!;\\" and the passage of the clauseWayne labeled this clause the \\"fifth\\" clause of Section 9, 48 U.S. at 420, even though many scholars treat this particular clause as the sixth clause of Section 9. prohibiting any \\"Preference\\" with respect to any \\"Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another;\\" the provision of the first clause of Section 10, prohibiting the states from entering into any treaty; the provisions of the second clause of Section 10 prohibiting the states from laying, without the consent of Congress, any \\"imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's inspection Laws;\\" and the provisions of the Third Clause of Section 10, prohibiting the States, again without the consent of Congress, from laying any duty of tonnage, or entering into any \\"Agreement or Compact with another State.\\" To Wayne, one has to examine the nature of commerce to understand the meaning of the Commerce Clause, which authorizes Congress to \\"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States....\\" Wayne noted that even without explication in a formal document such as a constitution, nations, at least in Europe, had recognized traditions of regulating their commerce in ways that varied between peacetime and wartime conditions. Under the European tradition \\"[a] nation is... fully authorized to prohibit the entry or exportation of certain merchandise, to institute customs and to augment them at pleasure, to prescribe the manner in which the commerce with its dominions shall be carried on, to point out the places where it shall be carried on, or to exempt from it certain parts of its dominions, to exercise freely its sovereign power over the foreigners living in its territories, [and] to make whatever distinctions between the nations with whom it trades it may find conducive to its interests.\\"48 U.S. at 416, quoting from \\"Summary of the Laws of Nations\\" by Martens. According to Wayne, the very nature of commerce, as experienced in the European tradition and brought forth into the Commerce Clause, had to be a matter for the regulation of the nation as a whole: \\"Keeping, then, in mind what commerce is, and how far a nation may legally limit her own commercial transactions with another state,The term \\"state\\" refers here not to one of the States of the United States but to a foreign state or nations. we cannot be at a loss to determine, from the subject matter of the clauseClause 3 of Section 8 of Article I in the Constitution, that the meaning of the terms used in it is to exclude the statesThe term \\"states\\" here refers to the various States of the United States, not to foreign states or nations. from regulating commerce in any way, except their own internal trade, and to confide its legislative regulation completely and entirely to Congress.\\"48 U.S. at 417. Wayne did not recapitulate the various ways in which Congress, by treaty and statute, actually regulates that foreign commerce on immigrants and other alien passengers from abroad, particularly from Britain, preferring to incorporate by reference the detailed treatment of these measures by Catron. Notwithstanding the firmness of his opinion regarding the right of Congress, to the complete exclusion of state prerogative, to regulate foreign and interstate commerce, and even his view that the exclusivity principle had been authoritatively established by prior precedent of the Supreme Court, Wayne criticized a parallel discussion of Justice McLean and announced that he and the other Justices concurring in the judgment \\"do not think it necessary in these cases to reaffirm,... what this Court has long since decided, that the constitutional power to regulate 'commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states and with the Indian tribes,' is exclusively vested in Congress and that no part of it can be exercised by a state.\\"48 U.S. at 411. He reasoned that even those who take the position that the states have the right to regulate foreign and interstate commerce in the absence of federal regulation readily admit that when the federal government actively regulates some aspect of foreign or interstate commerce, the states are prohibited by the Supremacy ClauseThe second clause of Article VI of the U.S. Constitution. from enacting or enforcing any law inconsistent with the federal law. He deemed that the federal government had engaged in regulating foreign commerce regarding passengers arriving from Britain when it entered into a series of treaties with that country. Wayne declared that the New York and Massachusetts statutes \\"conflict with treaty stipulations existing between the United States and Great Britain, permitting the inhabitants of the two countries 'freely and securely to come, with their ships and cargoes, to all places, ports, and rivers in the territories of each country to which other foreigners are permitted to come, to enter into the same, and to remain and reside in any parts of said territories, respectively;....'\\"48 U.S. at 413.The first commercial treaty between the United States and Great Britain was adopted in 1794. That particular treaty was abrogated by the War of 1812. However, similar treaty provisions were renewed in a subsequent treaty between the United States and Britain adopted in 1815, the second article of which contains the language quoted. To Wayne, taxes represent a cost, which may be imposed on some item, person, activity, or status that is already within or relates to what or who is already within the jurisdiction of the taxing authority. Duties and imposts are levied upon items and/or persons coming into the jurisdiction of the levying authority. Wayne also observes a distinction between commerce, which concerns an exchange or transportation of persons, goods, documents, or information, on the one hand, and police powers, which concern the regulation of the conduct of persons and the condition of persons/or items within the jurisdiction, on the other hand. Wayne recognized that states have very broad powers of taxation but insisted that some of that power of taxation was yielded with the adoption of the Constitution. The general principle that he adopted was that if a power is delegated to Congress or to the national government, so much of the power of taxation that might interfere with the prerogatives of Congress and the federal government are constrained in service of the federal system. Specifically, the exclusive federal control over immigration and naturalization precludes any state taxation that would interfere with federal policy in those areas. Wayne, like all other Justices, recognized states as the primary repository of \\"police powers.\\" (The federal government can exercise \\"police powers\\" only in territory that is federal: District of Columbia, territories, and federal enclaves in the States, such as military bases and federal buildings.) \\"Police powers\\" encompass the various measures taken to assure the safety and well- being of people at the local level. Thus, the police power of a state to protect the health of its residents includes the right to exclude from its territory diseased people. A curious example of police power, recognized by all of the Justices involved in the Passenger Case, was the right of slave States to exclude free citizens from Sub-Saharan Africa, for fear that they might help organize slave rebellions. However, the police power that was most critical, especially to part of the Massachusetts statute, was the right of a state to protect its economy and social fabric from an onslaught of paupers. The judgment in Norris technically did not strike down the portion of the statute concerning paupers. However, Wayne insisted that analysis of the various views of the five Justices concurring in the judgment establishes the willingness of a majority of the Supreme Court to strike down state taxation of immigrant paupers or the shipping companies that bring them to shore. To Wayne the goal of rebuffing paupers was legitimate, but taxation was an unconstitutional means. He counseled states to examine immigrants and expel those found to be diseased, paupers, fugitives from criminal justice, or those otherwise unworthy of admission for other reasons related to the welfare of the citizens and residents of the state. Wayne even commented in dictum that if Congress ever exercised its power of regulating immigration to compel states to accept such persons, that the United States Supreme Court would readily strike down such a federal statute as unconstitutional. The clause of Section 9 of Article I of the Constitution prohibiting any \\"Preference\\" with respect to \\"Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another\\" is not limited to federal action but also precludes any action by the states that would result in such a preference. Wayne deems a tax of the nature imposed by the New York and Massachusetts statutes to create a \\"Preference\\" between ports, in violation of the Constitution. Wayne construed the clause to even prohibit implicityly a state from creating a situation that would disadvantage the usage of its own port if that had the consequence of creating a preference for shippers in favor of the ports of other states. Wayne used a parallel logic in construing the first clause of Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution, which qualified the authority of Congress to \\"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises\\" with a provision that \\"all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.\\" Again, although Article I concerns Congress and Section 9 concerns an authority expressly granted to Congress, Wayne construed uniformity as not only placing a limitation on the exercise of Congressional power but also imposing on the states the duty not to compromise the uniformity of \\"Duties, Imposts and Excises\\" collected \\"throughout the United States.\\" In addition to Wayne's discussion of the constitutional issues, he expounded at length on the alleged history and imputed status of Miln.36 U.S. 102. According to Wayne, the opinion authored by Justice Barbour, which purports to be the official opinion of the Supreme Court in that case, \\"had not at any time the concurrence of a majority of its members.\\"48 U.S. at 429. He also bitterly accused Chief Justice Taney of knowingly disregarding that supposed fact and thus creating a false precedent in the official reports. =Catron's opinion= As noted above, Justice Catron's opinion ostensibly addressed only the New York case. However, its discussion of congressional statutes and treaties applaud to both the New York and the Massachusetts cases. Catron discussed federal law on naturalization of immigrants as American citizens. The Declaration of Independence had included in the offenses of the British King that he had \\"endeavored to prevent the population of the colonies by obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners, and refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither.\\"That language is the paraphrasing of Justice Catron, 48 U.S. at 440, not a quote from the Declaration of Independence. The US Constitution commits to Congress the power \\"to establish a uniform rule of naturalization.\\"First Provision of the Fourth Clause of Section 8 of Article I. Catron discussed congressional implementation of its jurisdiction over naturalization. On March 26, 1790 Congress enacted legislation, permitting any immigrant alien who was a \\"free white person\\" to become a naturalized United States citizen after only two years of residence in the United States.1 Stat. at L. 103, \\"An act to establish an uniform rule of naturalization.\\" Congress later (April 14, 1802)Catron misstated the date as April 26, 1802. 48 U.S. at 440. amended the naturalization statute to require five years of residence.2 Stat. at L. 153, \\"An act to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and to repeal the acts heretofore passed on that subject.\\" Catron waxed regarding the benefits that promoting immigration had conferred on the United States: :Under these laws have been admitted such numbers, that they and their descendants constitute a great part of our population. Every department of science, of labor, occupation, and pursuit, is filled up, more or less, by naturalized citizens and their numerous offspring. From the first day of our separate existence to this time has the policy of drawing hither aliens, to the end of becoming citizens, been a favorite policy of the United States; it has been cherished by Congress with rare steadiness and vigor. By this policy our extensive and fertile country has been, to a considerable extent, filled up by a respectable population, both physically and mentally, one that is easily governed and usually of approved patriotism.\\"48 U.S. at 440. Catron had no doubt that the 295 immigrants aboard the Henry Bliss whom New York State proposed to tax were responding to that federal policy: :We have invited to come to our country from other lands all free white persons, of every grade and of every religious belief, and when here to enjoy our protection, and at the end of five years to enjoy all our rights, except that of becoming President of the United States. Pursuant to this notorious and long established policy, the two hundred and ninety-five passengers in the Henry Bliss arrived at the port of New York.\\" Catron observed that the states may not tax goods or possessions of immigrant passengers and cited both a federal statuteCatron referred to Section 46 of a federal law, which he called the \\"General Collection Act of 2 March 1799.\\" 48 U.S. at 441. The official title of that act was \\"An Act to regulate the collection of imports and tonnage.\\" 1 Stat. at Large 627. The portion of Section 46 to which Catron referred and the excerpt that he quoted is found at 1 Stat. at Large 661. and the Supreme Court opinion of Brown v. Maryland.25 U.S. 419. He then posed the question as to whether the result should be any different with respect to taxation based on the passengers themselves.

Rawle, Francis; Bouvier, John. (1914) Bouvier's Law Dictionary and Concise Encyclopedia Extinguishment. Pp. 1166-1167. 3rd revision (being the 8th ed.) Vernon Law Book Co. ; St. Paul, Minnesota. Publisher: West Publishing Company. 3 vols. If the subject of the contract is destroyed (such as through merging the contract subject and the contract obligation), then the contract may be made void. Extinguishment occurs in a variety of contracts, such as land contracts (common, copyhold), debts, rents, and right of ways. A right may be extinguished by nullifying that right or, in the case of a debt, discharged by payment in full or through settlement.Dictionary.com (2008) Extinguishment. Accessed June 16, 2008 An extinguishment may be by matter of fact and by matter of law. If a creditor receives satisfaction and full payment of a debt and the creditor releases the debtor, then that is express extinguishment by matter of fact. If a person is renting land and subsequently becomes the owner of that same land by purchase or descent, the rent is extinguished through implied extinguishment by matter of fact. There are numerous situations where a claim is extinguished by operation of law. If two persons are jointly but not severally liable for a simple contract debt, a judgment at common law obtained against only one of the debtors works as an extinguishment of the claim on the other debtor as a matter of law. A conveyance of mortgaged land by the mortgagor to the mortgagee extinguishes the mortgage. However taking a promissory note for the amount due on the mortgage does not deprive the mortgage holder of a right to a lien, but merely suspends its enforcement until the note is payable. Extinguishment of common Common land (a common), in England and Wales and the United States, is a piece of land owned by one person, but over which other people can exercise certain traditional rights, such as allowing their livestock to graze upon it. If the owner of the common right becomes the owner of the fee simple estate, then the common right becomes extinguished. If the crop or other item over which there is a common right is severed from the land, then the common right becomes extinguished. Other situations in which the common right becomes extinguished include legal release and approvement (improvement of common lands, by inclosing and converting them to the uses of husbandry for the advantage of the lord of the manor.) Extinguishment of copyhold A copyhold was a parcel of land tenure granted to a peasant by the lord of the manor in return for services, such as agricultural services. Such grants/servitude was not always in the best interest of the peasant and the copyhold could be extinguished by an act of the tenant showing an intention not to hold the land any longer. Copyholds may be extinguished by the union of the copyhold and the freehold in the same person. Copyholds were gradually enfranchised (turned into ordinary holdings of land--either freehold or 999-year leasehold) during the 19th century. Legislation in the 1920s finally extinguished the last of them. Extinguishment of a debt Debts may be extinguished by the creditor accepting a higher security. If the creditor recovers a judgment, the original debt is extinguished. However, a trust deed given to secure the payment of a bond is not extinguished by a judgment on the bond since the original debt is not merged by the trust deed. A debt evidenced by a note may be extinguished by a surrender of the note Extinguishment of rent A union of the title to the lands and the rent in the same person will extinguish the rent. In Pennsylvania, a ground rent (rent of unimproved land) is extinguished by a conveyance from the ground rent owner to the tenant. Extinguishment of ways Right of ways include the right to use the land of another for a special purpose, such as a passageway. If the owner of the right of way purchases the close over which the right of way lies, the right of way is extinguished. NotesReferences * Rawle, Francis; Bouvier, John.

Since 1913, the company, which is a division of Weir Group PLC, has been headquartered in Portland, Oregon, USA, and has manufacturing sites throughout the world. The company designs and manufactures a host of products including ground engaging tools (GET) for mining, construction products, conveying, rigging, dredging and other industrial applications.  History  ladle in an ESCO Portland foundry ESCO was founded in 1913 by Oregon businessman Charles (C.F.) Swigert as a local source of steel castings. The Electric Steel Foundry Company was founded on property once occupied by the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. The foundry used an unusual modern furnace that was fired by electricity rather than coke, making it the first of its kind in the western United States. During its first 30 years, ESCO was mainly a regional supplier of cast steel alloy products for the logging, construction, and pulp and paper industry throughout the Pacific Northwest. In the 1920s, the company expanded production to include cast steel alloy products like the Bardon choker hook, widely used in forestry. Further growth was sparked by the use of Hadfield manganese steel and the production of dragline excavator buckets. The ESCO trademark was first used in 1926 and eventually became the company‚Äôs new name. ESCO survived the Great Depression primarily as a jobbing foundry, making castings for sawmills, pulp and paper mills. In 1932, ESCO opened its first stainless steel industrial service center. During the 1940s, ESCO added new products to meet demand for supply valves, pump bodies, anchor chains and other components for warships and tanks. In 1946, ESCO developed the two piece tooth system and, in 1948, the company entered the cable excavator bucket market. Due to the growing mining and construction markets after the war, ESCO launched new products and opened additional plants, sales offices, subsidiaries and licensees, including a midwest distribution facility in Danville, Illinois and a foundry in British Columbia. The company also adopted new manufacturing, inspection and metallurgical methods. During the 1960s and 1970s, ESCO expanded the manufacture of dragline and shovel dipper buckets and teeth. The company also launched a two-piece Conical tooth system and began using the argon oxygen decarburization (AOD) and vacuum molding processes. During the 1970s, ESCO opened an automated foundry in Newton, Mississippi and a second Canadian foundry in Ontario. During the early 1980s, ESCO launched its Helilok pin and lock system and also acquired Gray-Syracuse and Concorde Castings‚Äîinvestment casting facilities serving the aerospace and power generation industries. In 1983 ESCO bought Hyster Company, and then sold it in 1989 to NACCO Industries. During the 1990s, ESCO expanded operations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada and entered a joint venture to manufacture products in China. The company also acquired Heflin Steel, producing wear liners and armor plate. ESCO also introduced the Super V tooth system. Additional acquisitions like Quality Steel are targeted to serve the oil sands market. ESCO has also added aerospace and power generation facilities in Belgium and Slovakia and built new facilities in Mexico and Xuzhou, China. In 2008, ESCO introduced the SV2 tooth system, the Whisler Plus hammerless locking system, and the Ultralok hammerless tooth system. In 2006 and 2008, ESCO was named among Oregon's most admired manufacturing companies, according to a Portland Business Journal survey of more than 2,000 Oregon CEOs. The company announced plans for an initial public offering in May 2011 that could raise as much as $175 million. The company canceled plans for an IPO in May 2013. On December 28, 2012 Esco Corporation sold Turbine Technologies Group (Esco-TTG) to Consolidated Precision Products (CPP). Sale consisted of Esco TT Belgium, Esco TT Cleveland, Esco TT Mexico, Esco TT Syracuse, Slovakia Plant, Esco Tempe Machining Facility and NY‚Äôs Oriscany Steel Treaters. CPP is a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus. ESCO announced the acquisition of Texas-based Ulterra Drilling Technologies L.P. in August 2012 in a deal estimated at $325 million. In 2014, ESCO acquired another Texas-based company, Stabiltec Downhole Tools, LLC., further adding to the company's oil and gas portfolio. On April 19, 2018 ESCO entered into an agreement to be acquired by The Weir Group PLC, one of the world‚Äôs leading engineering businesses, for an enterprise value of $1.285 billion.https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/04/19/1481404/0/en/ESCO- Corporation-to-Join-Leading-Global-Engineering-Company-Weir.html The acquisition was completed on July 12, 2018.  Plant closures and violation of U.S. trade sanction with Cuba  Commencing in 2013, ESCO has closed multiple manufacturing and service facilities in recent years, citing a protracted downturn and declining customer demand for their products. In January 2013, ESCO closed the Northgate, Australia foundry they purchased in 2010. In September, 2014 ESCO closed another foundry located in Guisborough, England. In February 2015, ESCO announced the closure of a large foundry in Nisku, Canada. ESCO laid off an estimated 25% of their manufacturing work force at their Port Hope, Canada facility in 2014 and made further cuts in 2015. ESCO announced the closure of another foundry in Dunedin, New Zealand in September, 2015. In November 2015, ESCO announced that they would be eliminating 247 employees when closing the main production plant that adjoins the North American headquarters. In 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported that ESCO Corporation agreed to pay a $2.1 Million fine for violating U.S. sanctions imposed on Cuba. In the official penalty notice, the U.S. Treasury Department concluded that ESCO acted with \\"reckless disregard\\" and \\"caused significant harm\\" to the U.S. sanctions program on Cuba by conducting large-volume and high-value transactions in products made from Cuban-origin nickel, \\"which were ultimately sourced\\" from people on the U.S. blacklist.

Several of the projects are related to improving or adding control devices to capture particulate matter and metal emissions. It also includes projects related to chemical substitution to reduce organic compound emissions, and projects requiring additional or modified procedures or operations to improve emission capture.

The film was directed by Takashi Miike with a screenplay by Sh≈çgo Mut≈ç, and stars Shun Oguri, Ky≈çsuke Yabe, Meisa Kuroki, and Takayuki Yamada. The plot serves as a prequel to the manga, and focuses on the power struggle between gangs of students at Suzuran All-Boys High School. The film was released in Japan on October 27, 2007. It has spawned two sequels, Crows Zero 2 and Crows Explode, as well as a manga adaptation released November 13, 2008.  Plot  Newly transferred high school senior Genji Takiya (Shun Oguri) arrives at Suzuran All-Boys High School, an institution infamous for its population of violent delinquents. During the freshman orientation assembly, yakuza arrive at the school seeking vengeance on third-year Serizawa Tamao (Takayuki Yamada) for assaulting some members of their gang. The thugs mistake Genji for their target and a brawl ensues on the school field. Meanwhile, Serizawa is visiting his best friend Tatsukawa Tokio (Kenta Kiritani), who has just been discharged from a hospital. Upon returning to the school, Serizawa witnesses Genji defeat the last of the yakuza. That night, Genji goes a nightclub he frequents and meets R&B; singer Aizawa Ruka (Meisa Kuroki). He then goes to see his father, yakuza boss Takiya Hideo (Goro Kishitani), to whom he proclaims his ambition to conquer Suzuran, a feat which Hideo himself had attempted in his youth, but failed. Genji makes Hideo promise to acknowledge him as his successor should he succeed. The next day, Genji challenges Serizawa to a fight, but is halted by Tokio. He tells Genji that if he really wants to make an impression he should begin by defeating Rindaman, a legendary fighter at the school. After Rindaman refuses his challenge, Genji encounters Katagiri Ken (Kyosuke Yabe), one of the yakuza who'd come to the school the previous day. He attacks Genji in retaliation for getting his gang arrested, but is taken down with a single punch. Humbled, Ken goes with Genji to the club where they discuss the latter's plans for Suzuran. Following advice from Ken, Genji begins building his army, called \\"Genji Perfect Seiha\\" (a.k.a. \\"GPS\\"). Anticipating the brewing conflict, Serizawa also begins recruiting factions for his own cause. Genji succeeds in rallying several strong members, including Tamura Ch≈´ta, Makise Takashi, and Izaki Shun. Serizawa is alarmed by Genji's rapid rise to power, but chooses not to take action. One of Serizawa's lieutenants, Tokaji Y≈´ji, is not so ambivalent and begins covertly attacking members of the GPS, severely beating Ch≈´ta and putting Izaki in the hospital. The provocations cause tensions between the two armies to rise drastically, but Genji is prevented from acting by Makise. One night, Tokio and Serizawa visit the nightclub and encounter Genji. As Tokio runs interference between the opposing leaders, he suffers a seizure and is rushed to a hospital, where he learns that he has a cerebral aneurysm which requires surgery. Despite initial hesitation about the procedure's 30% success rate, Tokio agrees to the operation. Tokaji approaches Band≈ç Hideto, leader of \\"The Front of Armament\\" biker gang, with a plan to kidnap Ruka and further aggravate Genji. Elsewhere, yakuza boss Yazaki J≈çji orders Ken to kill Genji, disregarding the fact that doing so will incite a war between the yakuza organizations. The task proves to be too much for Ken, who has grown fond of Genji and begins lamenting his decision to become a yakuza in the first place. He decides to inform Takiya Hideo of the plot to kill his son. Genji gets a call from Ruka, who tells him that she is being held hostage by men with skulls on their jackets, and that her captors mentioned the name \\"Band≈ç\\". Surmising that her captors are The Armament, Genji gathers the GPS and proceeds to the biker gang's headquarters. A fight ensues, but Genji soon realizes that the men they are fighting are missing their trademark skull patches. Band≈ç demands an end to fight, revealing that he'd ordered the skulls be removed after part of The Armament aligned with Tokaji. After locating Tokaji and saving Ruka, Genji decides it's finally time for war against Serizawa. They decide to fight at 5:00pm the following day, at the same time that Tokio will undergo his operation, with Serizawa believing it will allow him to fight alongside Tokio. The next day, as the battle begins, the tide seems to be in Serizawa's favor, but after Band≈ç's faction of The Armament arrives and joins the GPS, the odds are evened out. The fighting continues until only Serizawa and Genji are left standing. Meanwhile, Ken is taken to the harbor to be executed for disobeying the order to kill Genji. Yazaki gives Ken his coat as a parting gift before shooting him in the back. He falls into the water and begins to sink. Genji and Serizawa fight well into the night, and though injured and exhausted, Genji eventually gains the upper hand and triumphs. Clinging to consciousness, Serizawa receives a call from the hospital informing him that Tokio's operation was a success. Back at the docks, Ken suddenly recovers and swims to the surface. He discovers that the coat Yazaki had given to him was bulletproof, and that his \\"execution\\" was a ploy to allow him to leave the organization and live a different life. Several days later, Genji again challenges Rindaman, the final obstacle on his path to ruling Suzuran. Rindaman expresses his belief that Suzuran can never be truly conquered, and that there will always be someone left to fight. The film ends as the skirmish between Genji and Rindaman begins.

Najib Zulfikar of Total Film gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, stating, \\"Miike amps it all up to 11 in his inimitable style, as impossibly coiffured pretty boys duke it out and the Yakuza take an interest in the outcome. Sadly, the story‚Äôs so overpopulated it‚Äôs hard to care who‚Äôll survive to graduate.\\" Similarly, David Brook of Blueprint Review gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars indicating, \\"Teenage boys will lap up every minute of it (other than the songs which probably won‚Äôt appeal to many Westerners) and the lack of obviously ‚Äòbad‚Äô and ‚Äògood‚Äô guys means the conclusion wasn't always going to be clear cut (after an hour or so you can see where its heading though).\\" Sequels and adaptations The film was followed by two sequels: Crows Zero 2 (also directed by Miike) in 2009 and Crows Explode in 2014.

It was named after the nearest town: Gibeon. History The meteorite was discovered by the Nama people and used by them to make tools and weapons. In 1836 the English captain J. E. Alexander collected samples of the meteorite in the vicinity of the Fish River and sent them to London. There John Herschel analyzed them and confirmed for the first time the extraterrestrial nature of the material. Between 1911 and 1913, 33 fragments of the meteorite were collected in the vicinity of Gibeon and brought to the capital Windhoek. They weighed between and were first stored, then displayed at Zoo Park as a single heap. In 1975 a public fountain displaying the meteorite fragments was planned. The pieces were removed and stored at Alte Feste, where two of the fragments were stolen. The fountain was erected in Post Street Mall, with two empty pillars for the missing fragments. Since then, two more fragments were removed from the fountain, so that it displays only 29 today. The collection displayed on the fountain in Windhoek's Central Business District was proclaimed a National Monument (Category: geology) on 15 February 1950. Additionally, all meteorites found in Namibia are automatically protected as National Monuments and must not be removed from where they have been found, nor damaged in any way. Strewn field The fragments of the meteorite in the strewn field are dispersed over an elliptical area long and wide. The core of this area is situated near the village of Gibeon in Namibia's Hardap Region. About 100‚Äì150 different fragments have been collected over time, and additional pieces are found occasionally. Composition and classification The term Gibeon encompasses the whole meteoritic material fallen from the sky during this fall. This material is classified as iron meteorite belonging to the chemical group IVA. Gibeon meteorites are composed of an iron-nickel alloy containing significant amounts of cobalt and phosphorus. The crystal structure of this meteorite provides a classic example of fine octahedrite and the Widmanst√§tten pattern is appreciated for its beauty both by collectors and designers of jewelry.

Reality Show sold 30,000 copies in its first week. Slant Magazine commented, \\"Despite what the rasp in her voice might suggest, Sullivan clearly sees herself as something other than R&B;'s next great queen of pain. Her central themes‚Äîlove and self-image‚Äîdon't stray far from genre convention, but her musical versatility and keenly observed characters make her one of the most captivating artists in R&B; today.\\" The album earned Sullivan three Grammy Award nominations for Best R&B; Album and Best Traditional R&B; Performance (\\"Let It Burn\\"). In 2016, Sullivan was featured in the visual album \\"Endless\\" by Frank Ocean. Sullivan lent her vocals to four songs from the album: \\"Alabama\\", \\"Wither\\", \\"Hublots\\", and \\"Rushes\\". Sullivan was the lead writer for these four songs on Mary J. Blige's album Strength of a Woman, and sang backup vocals on the first three of them: \\"Thick of It\\", \\"Set Me Free\\", \\"Glow Up\\", and \\"Thank You.\\" (\\"Strength of a Woman\\" album liner notes). She in partnership with fellow American singer Bryson Tiller released \\"Insecure\\" for the soundtrack for the second season of the HBO series of the same title. In 2019, Sullivan was featured on Pentatonix's Christmas collection The Best of Pentatonix Christmas on the group‚Äôs cover of \\"Joyful, Joyful\\". On August 27, 2020, Sullivan announced the release of a new song titled \\"Lost One\\", marking her return to music. Within hours of the announcement, the phrase \\"New Jazmine\\" trended on Twitter across the United States. The song was released the next day along with the confirmation of her upcoming extended play (EP). Musical style and artistry Sonically, Sullivan's voice alternates between \\"modern productions\\" and a \\"1980s-influenced sound\\" which music critics say gives her \\"old-school hip hop sound\\". Her vocal range is identified as mezzo-soprano. Her voice has a solid agility in all registers and is well connected between an A2 and a G5. InStyle said that she has a \\"raspy voice\\". She describes her writing style as \\"flashbacks\\", in reference to her songs about failed relationships that were both physically and emotionally abusive. Her music displays her responses to these relationships famously with her song \\"Bust Your Windows\\". She likes to write about how she is feeling, which in turn, taking a day or up to a month to complete. During the recording of the album Reality Show, Sullivan spent so much time revising and re-recording, that the producers had to force her to release the album to prevent a delayed release. Sullivan is well known for writing her own songs which amplifies her universal critical acclaim from critics and fans.  Awards and achievements  At the 51st Annual Grammy Awards in 2009, Sullivan was nominated for awards in the categories of Best New Artist, Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance, Best Traditional R&B; Performance, Best R&B; Song and Best Contemporary R&B; Album. The success of her debut album Fearless saw Sullivan nominated for three BET Awards in the categories of Best New Artist, Best Female R&B; Artist and the Centric Award, but only winning the Centric Award. She was also nominated for the Outstanding New Artist award at the NAACP Image Awards. At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Sullivan was nominated for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance and Best R&B; Song for her song, \\"Lions, Tigers & Bears\\". In 2010, Sullivan won the Rising Star award at the Billboard Women in Music. At the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, \\"Holding You Down (Goin' in Circles)\\", the lead single from her second studio album Love Me Back, earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance in 2011. Released in 2015, Sullivan's third album, Reality Show, sold thirty thousand copies in the first week. Reality Show earned her three Grammy nominations and two NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Female Artist and Outstanding Song for \\"Let It Burn\\". At the 49th NAACP Image Awards, Sullivan was nominated for Outstanding Song for \\"Insecure\\", a song that she and Bryson Tiller collaborated on for the soundtrack of the second season of the HBO series of the same name. Sullivan's most notable song \\"Bust Your Windows\\" was listed at number 137 on National Public Radio's list of The 200 Greatest Songs By 21st Century Women. Personal life On May 11, 2020, Sullivan announced that her mother Pam had been diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer in October 2019. In the Instagram post, she wrote: \\"If being your daughter has taught me one thing it is how to work w something ugly, painful even, and make it a work of art\\".

A variety of barrel, stock, and receiver designs have been invented to facilitate takedown. For example, the hinged design of many break-action firearms allows takedown. Some regular firearms can be modified to allow takedown after custom gunsmithing. Rifles American gun manufacturers including Marlin, Savage, and Winchester have made takedown rifles since the late 1800s. Some early examples include the Browning 22 Semi-Auto rifle, Remington Model 24 and Remington Model 8 made by Fabrique Nationale and Remington Arms. Shotguns Most single barrel and double barrel shotguns readily break down into separate buttstock, barrel and forestock and are often transported cased as takedown guns. Among repeating shotguns, the Winchester Model 97 and Model 12 shotguns were factory made as takedown guns. Savage also makes a series of takedown over/under rifle/shotgun combination guns.  Survival guns  Survival guns such as the ArmaLite AR-7 may be disassembled and its barrel, action and magazines stored within its plastic butt-stock. This lightweight 2.5 pound, .22 caliber, semi-automatic rifle measures 35 inches overall when assembled, 16 inches when disassembled and can even float.

After the war, Prof. Furry continued teaching at Harvard, later becoming a full professor and serving for three years as chairman of the Physics Department from 1965 to 1968. After several years of half-time partial retirement he accepted full retirement in 1977.Wendell Hinkle Furry, Memorial Minute adopted by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University, November 18, 1986 McCarthyism In 1953, Furry was subpoenaed several times as a suspected communist by the House Unamerican Activities Committee and by US Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, and invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege in refusing to answer questions about his past membership in the Communist Party. In early 1954 he dropped the Fifth Amendment defense in a nationally televised hearing before Senator McCarthy and answered questions about himself but refused to name others. Because of that refusal, he was indicted for contempt of Congress but the case was dropped several years later.Lewis, Lionel S.

It first appeared as a six-part serial in Argosy Weekly from January 9 to February 13, 1937 under the title Seven Worlds to Conquer. It was first published in book form in hardcover by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. in September, 1937 under the present title, and has been reissued a number of times since by various publishers. Plot summary The story reveals the fate of Wilhelm von Horst, the lost member of the previous book's outer world expedition to Pellucidar, which had been led by Jason Gridley and Tarzan to rescue Pellucidarian emperor David Innes from the Korsars. The action begins by recapping the incident in which Gridley, von Horst, and Tarzan's Waziri warriors, led by Muviro, are caught up in and separated by a horde of saber-toothed tigers‚Äô cooperative hunt. Now on his own, von Horst quickly becomes lost, links up again with the Waziri by accident, and gets lost again when he foolishly goes out hunting on his own. First paperback edition of Back to the Stone Age In the most powerful sequence in the book, von Horst becomes prey himself when a Trodon, or pterodactyl, carries him off to its nest in the crater of a dead volcano. The explorer is left poisoned and paralyzed together with other victims, all of them intended as a living larder to feed the creature's young as its eggs hatch. Von Horst passes the time by getting to know a fellow paralytic, the native warrior Dangar of Sari, a member-tribe of Innes' empire. From him, the outer worlder gradually learns the Pellucidarian language. Von Horst's clothing prevented him from receiving a full dose of venom, and he recovers from his paralysis in time to save Dangar from the next hatchling. Shooting the immature trodon, he makes a long strap from its hide, lassos the parent on its next return, and after allowing it to fly off just past the lip of the crater, shoots it in turn. After securing the free end of the strap to the still paralyzed Dangar, he uses it to climb out of the trap, pulling his companion up after him. In the forest at the foot of the mountain he constructs a treehouse to serve them as a secure base while Dangar recovers. Subsequently, von Horst rescues another native, Skruf of Basti, from a hyaenodon; Skruf is on a quest to kill a tarag (saber-toothed tiger), the head of which he needs as bride-price to secure a mate. As he knows the country, von Horst and Dangar accompany him once the latter has recovered. In due course they encounter the desired beast, from which Skruf hides in fear while his companions make the kill. Despite his cowardice Skruf takes the trophy, and the three continue on to the cliff- village of Basti. But once there he turns traitor, not only claiming the deed as his own but betraying his companions into slavery. Von Horst and Dangar are put to work with other slaves of Basti digging new caves into the cliff. Von Horst becomes enamored of La-ja of Lo-har, a fellow captive, and in defending her touches off a general slave revolt. He leads all the slaves to freedom, whereupon they separate to return to their native tribes. Von Horst elects to accompany La-ja to Lo-har rather than continue to Sari with Dangar. The plot of the novel continues to unfold in its pattern of liberty, capture and escape, with the protagonist's goal imperceptibly altering from rejoining his outer world comrades to romance with La-ja. The feelings of the principals, while plain to the reader, are masked from their objects of affection by culturally-based misunderstanding, as is typical of Burroughs‚Äô novels, postponing the ultimate resolution nearly to the end of the story. The initial path of von Horst and La-ja takes them through the ill-reputed Forest of Death. Within the forest are the labyrinthine caves of the Gorbuses, cannibalistic albinos who, in an eerie touch, are intimated to be murderers from the outer world, reincarnated in Pellucidar and consigned to this place as punishment. This is Burroughs‚Äô sole nod toward the notion that his interior world might relate in any way to the concept of a subterranean hell. Falling prey to the Gorbuses, von Horst and La-ja are soon joined as captives by the Bastians Skruf and Frug, who have been trailing them. The four set aside their differences to effect their escape, but afterwards the Bastians betray the others‚Äô trust, kidnapping La-ja. Von Horst pursues the kidnappers, incidentally coming to the aid of a tandor (mammoth) wounded by sharp stakes of bamboo, which, Androcles-like, he removes. He overtakes his quarry, but before matters can be settled, he and Frug are taken by the Mammoth Men, a native tribe utilizing mammoths as mounts; Skruf and La-ja elude the interlopers. Boarded on the family of a tribal warrior, von Horst once again commences plotting to escape, aided by dissatisfied locals, whose support he enlists, and the friendship of Thorek, a member of the tribe who had shared his earlier captivity in Basti. His opportunity comes when he and other prisoners are pitted against each other, sabertooths, and mammoths in a gladiatorial-like contest. One of the mammoths proves to be Old White, the beast he had aided previously; joining forces, they survive the melee and make a successful break for freedom. Once again von Horst happens on Skruf and La- ja, intervening as they are attacked by the Ganaks, or bison-men. While able to kill a few of these he ultimately falls captive to them, this time in the company of La-ja. Their escape is aided by Old White, after which they are separated again, but von Horst falls in with another from La-ja's country, Gaj, a fellow former-prisoner of the Mammoth Men. Gaj's guidance enables him to follow La-ja to Lo-har. There he saves her from Gaz, an unwanted suitor, and he and La-ja finally acknowledge their love for each other. Their union results in him becoming chief of Lo-har, his new bride being the daughter of the Lo-harians‚Äô former ruler Brun, who is absent searching for her. The remaining plot threads are tied up by the arrival of a party from Sari led by David Innes, accompanied by Brun. Innes, it turns out, has taken up the pledge of Jason Gridley at the end of the previous book to rescue the missing von Horst‚ÄîGridley himself, anti-climatically, is revealed to have let himself be persuaded by other members of the expedition from the outer world to leave Pellucidar with them instead. Von Horst declines Innes‚Äô offer take him back to Sari and what passes for civilization in the inner world, electing to remain in Lo-har with La-ja.

It is a topographic map with extra details to help the competitor navigate through the competition area. These maps are much more detailed than general-purpose topographic maps, and incorporate a standard symbology that is designed to be useful to anyone, regardless of native language. In addition to indicating the topography of the terrain with contour lines, orienteering maps also show forest density, water features, clearings, trails and roads, earthen banks and rock walls, ditches, wells and pits, fences and power lines, buildings, boulders, and other features of the terrain. Orienteering maps are 1:15 000 or 1:10 000 scale.Zentai, L√°szl√≥, ed. (2000). International Drawing Specifications for Orienteering Maps (ISOM2000). International Orienteering Federation. The International Orienteering Federation (IOF) publishes the standard for orienteering maps, including: * ISOM (International Specification for Orienteering Maps), used for FootO forest maps. * ISSOM (International Specification for Sprint Orienteering Maps), used for FootO sprint and TrailO maps. * ISSkiOM (International Specification for Ski Orienteering Maps), used for SkiO maps. * ISMTBOM (International Specification for Mountain Bike Orienteering Maps), used for MTBO maps. Orienteering map (not to IOF standard) marked for amateur radio direction finding, with a triangle at Start, large and small concentric circles at Finish, and two of five control points (hidden radio beacons). Beacon control points are shown for post-competition analysis; ARDF competitors must find the beacons. Purpose An orienteering map, and a compass, are the primary aids for the competitor to complete an orienteering course of control points as quickly as possible. A map that is reliable and accurate is essential so that a course can be provided which will test the navigational skills of the competitor. The map also needs to be relevant to the needs of the competitor showing the terrain in neither too much nor too little detail. Because the competition must test the navigational skills of the competitor, areas are sought which have a terrain that is rich in usable features. In addition, the area should be attractive and interesting. Notable examples in the US include Pawtuckaway State Park, New Hampshire and Valles Caldera, New Mexico, both having many boulders and boulder fields, and a wide variety of other terrain types. Orienteering maps are produced by local orienteering clubs and are a valuable resource for the club. Orienteering maps are expensive to produce and the principal costs are: the fieldwork, drawing (cartography), and printing. Each of these can use up valuable resources of a club, be it in manpower or financial costs. Established clubs with good resources e.g. maps and manpower are usually able to host more events. History Orienteering map In the early days of orienteering, competitors used whatever maps were available; these were typically topographic maps from the national mapping agency. While national mapping agencies update their topographic maps on a regular basis, they are usually not sufficiently up to date for orienteering purposes. Gradually, specially drawn maps have been provided to meet the specific requirements of orienteering. Maps produced specifically for orienteering show a more detailed and up-to-date description of terrain features. For example, large rocks above the soil surface do not normally appear on topographic maps but can be important features on many orienteering maps. New features such as fence lines can be important navigational aids and may also affect route choice. Orienteering maps include these new features. Cartographer Jan Martin Larsen was a pioneer in the development of the specialized orienteering map. Map content The map scale depends on the purpose of the competition and also the standard used, for example, a map used in a foot orienteering long distance event has a scale of 1:15000. The map is printed in six base colours,ISOM 2017, page 10 which cover the main groups: Land forms, rock and boulders, water and marsh, vegetation, and man-made features, and an extra colour for overprinting symbols. Example of different land forms =Brown: Land forms= Land forms are shown using contour lines. The contour interval is normally 5 metres, but other interval such as 2 or 2.5 metres may be used in sprint maps. Additional symbols are provided to show e.g. earth bank, knoll, depression, small depression, pit, broken ground etc. =Black: Rock features= This group covers cliffs, boulders, boulder fields, and boulder clusters etc. =Blue: Water features= This group covers lakes, ponds, rivers, water channels, marshes, and wells etc. Vegetation: White colour is forest, yellow is open area, and green indicates reduced runability. =Green/Yellow: Vegetation= This group covers vegetation. White is typically open runnable forest. Green means a forest of low visibility with reduced running speed, being graded from slow running, through difficult running, to impassable. Yellow colour shows open areas. Green vertical stripes are used to indicate undergrowth (slow or difficult running) but otherwise with good visibility. =Black: Man-made features= Man-made features include roads, tracks, paths, power lines, stone walls, fences, buildings, etc. =Technical symbols= Two technical symbols are required on all maps: Magnetic north lines printed in blue, and register crosses (these show that the printed colours are coincident). =Other map information= Other information is required to be on the printed map although the presentation is not specified, e.g. scale, contour interval and scale bar. Good practice requires information such as date of survey, survey scale, copyright information, and proper credit for the people who produced the map (surveyor, cartographer). Course =Purple or Red: Overprinting symbols= Symbols are specified so that a course can be overprinted on the map. It includes symbols for the start, control points, control numbers, lines between control points, and finish. Extra symbols are available so that information relating to that event may be shown e.g. crossing points, forbidden route, first aid post, and refreshment point etc. These are not permanent features and cannot be included when the map is printed. =Related activities= The International Specification for Orienteering Maps sets out the specifications for orienteering maps for use in foot orienteering, together with specifications for the other sports governed by the International Orienteering Federation (IOF) i.e. mountain bike orienteering, ski orienteering, and trail orienteering. The specifications are mostly the same but with a few sport specific symbols e.g. ski-o needs to distinguish snow-covered roads from cleared roads. Mapping process The mapping process has four main stages: Creation of the base map, field-work, drawing, and printing. =Base map= The base map can be a topographic map made for other purposes e.g. mapping from the National Mapping Agency, or a photogrammetric plot produced from an aerial survey. As LIDAR-surveying advances, base maps consisting of 1 meter contours and other data derived from the LIDAR data get more common. As these base maps contain large amounts of information the cartographic generalization becomes important in creating a readable map.Turka, Janeta (2010). Using Laserscanning in Latvia . 14th International Conference on Orienteering Mapping. =Magnetic north= Cartographers use a projection to project the curved surface of the earth onto a flat surface. This generates a grid that is used as a base for national topographic mapping. The projection introduces a distortion so that grid north differs from true north; magnetic north is a natural feature that differs from both. As an example: at 52¬∞ 35' N 1¬∞ 10' E (approx 7 km west of Norwich, England) true north is 2¬∞ 33' west of grid north, and magnetic north is about 7¬∞ west of grid north. Magnetic north varies continually and in this example (1986) was reducing by about ¬∞ in four years.[United Kingdom] Ordnance Survey, 1:50 000 Landranger Series, sheet 144, 1984 Orienteering maps are printed using magnetic north and this requires an adjustment to be made to the base map. =Field-work= Field-work is carried out using a small part of the base map fixed to a survey board, covered with a piece of draughting film, and drawn with pencils. The final map needs to be drawn with sufficient accuracy so that a feature shown on the map can be identified clearly on the ground by the competitor, thus, field-workers need to locate features with a high level of accuracy, to ensure consistency between map and terrain. Where the map and terrain are inconsistent, the feature becomes unusable: no control point can be placed there. Periodic corrections to the map may be necessary, typically vegetation changes in forested areas. =Drawing (cartography)= Corrected topographic maps The earliest orienteering maps used existing topographic maps e.g. United Kingdom Ordnance Survey 1:25 000 plans. These were cut down to a suitable size, corrected by hand, and then copied. Hand-drawn orienteering maps =Hand-drawn maps= These were initially drawn by hand on tracing paper using one sheet for each of the five colours; the various dot or line screens being added using dry transfer screens, for example Letratone manufactured by Letraset in the UK. The map was drawn at twice final map scale, and photographically reduced to produce the five film positives for printing. This was a simple process that required very few specialist tools. Draughting film has replaced tracing paper. This is a plastic waterproof material etched on one side so that the ink will hold. =Scribed maps= This is the standard process used by National Mapping Agencies. It uses a plastic film, which is coated on one side with a photo- opaque film. The layer is removed with a scribing tool or scalpel to produce a negative image. One sheet of film is needed for each solid colour, and one for each screen, usually requiring about ten sheets of film altogether. The map is drawn at final map scale, and the negatives are printed with high quality dot screens to produce the five film positives for printing. The process makes it easy to produce high quality maps, but it does require a number of specialist tools. Computer aided maps (digital cartography) Computer software is available to aid in the drawing of digital maps. OCAD is the leading provider. Another one is opensource OpenOrienteering Mapper application, created by community as free alternative to OCAD.OpenOrienteering Mapper ICOM Presentation Other computer software is available that will link with OCAD, or with the digital map files, so that courses can be incorporated into the map ready for printing. =Printing= Colour maps were sent to commercial printers for printing in five colours, with the overprinting being added after the map had been printed. This process was chosen as it gave a higher quality for the fine line-work than the industry standard four-colour process (CMYK). As computer and software technology has advanced, and the cost reduced, many clubs are now in a position to print their own maps. This enables clubs to print the six colours together (map and overprinting symbols) using that same four-colour process, but with a reduction in quality over traditional printing. Printing costs can be minimised by using standard stock sizes of paper e.g. A4 or Letter. It is important to use the correct type of paper: both the weight and the coating affect the usability of the final map. Map accuracy and map quality Map accuracy refers to the work of the surveyor (field-worker) and relates not so much to the positional accuracy of the survey but rather to its utility for the competitor. Map quality refers to the quality of the artwork. Many national bodies have a competition in which awards are made to cartographers after assessment by a national panel.

Background Craig Armstrong was the arranger for Massive Attack, a band director Louis Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film Unleashed. Armstrong was his first choice, which surprised Marvel, not knowing if he had scored an action film (he did compose 2001's Kiss of the Dragon). Even the temp track consisted of Armstrong's work and similar music by others. The Hulk, alongside the Green Lantern, was one of Armstrong's favorite comics as a child, although he did not see Ang Lee's Hulk. Armstrong began composing in his home in Glasgow, Scotland with three sequences; the Hulk and Betty in the cave; the Abomination and the Hulk's alley fight; and Bruce and Betty's reunion. The majority was composed in a few weeks in Los Angeles, California, which was very intense for the director and composer. The score was recorded over four days during late 2007 in a chapel in Bastyr University, located in Kenmore, Washington. Pete Lockett played ethnic instruments in the score, which were recorded in London and mixed together with the orchestra and electronics. The score was orchestrated by Matt Dunkley, Tony Blondal, Stephen Coleman, David Butterworth, and Kaz Boyle. Leterrier suggested the score be released on two discs, which Armstrong believed to be a joke. Only when he compiled the album ‚Äì and Marvel asked why they were only given one disc ‚Äì did he realize they were serious. The Hulk and the Abomination both have two themes, representing their human and monstrous forms. The Hulk's theme was meant to be iconic and simple, like Jaws (1975), with string glissandos on a bass C note. Banner's theme is tragic and includes parts of Joe Harnell's \\"The Lonely Man\\" theme from the television series. Armstrong played the piano for one scene featuring that piece. Blonsky has a dark theme, which becomes aggressive when he transforms. Armstrong inter played the Hulk and the Abomination's themes during their battle, and found scoring the action sequences similar to a dance. There is also a suspenseful theme, and a love theme.

This value is used as a key factor in determining profitability, and in some stock market theories it is used in establishing the value of stock holding. Forms Cost prices appear in several forms, such as actual cost, last cost, average cost, and net realizable value. =Cost price= Cost price is also known as CP. cost price is the original price of an item. The cost is the total outlay required to produce a product or carry out a service. Cost price is used in establishing profitability in the following ways: * Selling price (excluding tax) less cost results in the profit in money terms. * Profit / selling price (excluding tax) when expressed as a percentage produces (gross profit) or GP%. * Expense / net sales yields a percentage that when used as the target margin will produce gross profit. =Actual cost= In calculating actual or landed cost, all expenses incurred in acquiring an item are added to the cost of items in order to establish what the goods actually cost. Additions usually include freight, duty, etc. =Last Cost= This is the actual value of the item when last purchased, normally expressed in units. =Average cost= When new stock is combined with old stock, the new price often overstates the value of stock holding. The better method is to combine the total value of investment in stock, old and new, and divide by the total number of units to calculate the average cost. This is a very accurate method of establishing stock holding. Moving average cost Moving average cost (MAC) is a slight permutation of the above, with the average being calculated from the previous average and new price. =Net realizable value= The net realizable value normally indicates the average value of an item in the marketplace. Often this cost is interchangeable with replacement cost.

He thrice rebelled against the government of Buenos Aires and was defeated in each attempt. Beginnings L√≥pez Jord√°n was born in Paysand√∫, in present-day Uruguay, in August 1822, son of the Argentine general of the same name, a former governor of the Argentine province of Entre R√≠os who found himself living in Paysand√∫ as an exile. Young Ricardo Ram√≥n L√≥pez Jord√°n's uncle Francisco Ram√≠rez, another political strongman, was also active in the life of the region. The father returned to Entre R√≠os with his son in 1824, but in 1827 was again obliged to seek refuge in Uruguay. When, in 1830, the father tried (with the support of fellow strongman Juan Lavalle) again to recover power in the province, he sent Ricardo to study at the Colegio San Ignacio in Buenos Aires. Ricardo L√≥pez Jord√°n, Sr., whose pro-autonomy sentiment led to his exile and was instilled in his son. At the end of 1841, as part of the continuing Argentine civil wars, L√≥pez Jord√°n was brought into the army of the governor Justo Jos√© de Urquiza in the defense of his province against an invasion from the Argentine province of Corrientes. On December 6, 1842, L√≥pez Jord√°n fought in the battle of Arroyo Grande under the command of the Uruguayan general Manuel Oribe, against the forces of Fructuoso Rivera; he was sent to Buenos Aires with news of Oribe's victory. L√≥pez Jord√°n spent the following months in convincing Juan Manuel de Rosas to free his father, the erstwhile governor of Entre Rios, who complied with his son's promise to Rosas that he would not involve himself in politics again. L√≥pez Jord√°n accompanied Urquiza in his campaign in Uruguay (where he fought in the battle of India Muerta) and in the campaign in the Argentine province of Corrientes (fighting in the battles of Laguna Limpia, against Jos√© Mar√≠a Paz on February 14, 1846, and Vences). In 1849, L√≥pez Jord√°n was named military commandant of Concepci√≥n del Uruguay, the home town of his family, of his uncle Francisco Ram√≠rez, and of Urquiza. After Urquiza's pronouncement against the Argentine dictator, Juan Manuel de Rosas, on May 1, 1851, and the invasion of Uruguay, Urquiza sent L√≥pez Jord√°n, now a captain, to receive the surrender of Manuel Oribe, who with Rosas's support had for eight years besieged the Uruguayan capital, Montevideo (it was in this city that Amadeo Gras painted L√≥pez Jord√°n's portrait in oils). As a soldier in the \\"Great Army\\" that Urquiza formed, L√≥pez Jord√°n took part in the victorious campaign that ended with Rosas's overthrow at the Battle of Caseros, in which he fought as one of the commanders of the cavalry. He then returned to his post as commandant of Concepci√≥n del Uruguay. On November 21, 1852, after the revolution of September 11, the province of Buenos Aires invaded Entre Rios from two directions. The column under command of General Manuel Hornos landed at the river town of Gualeguaych√∫ and managed to defeat a Colonel Galarza of the army of Entre Rios. The invaders then reached the outskirts of Concepci√≥n del Uruguay, where they were defeated by L√≥pez Jord√°n's forces, principally comprising students at the Colegio (secondary school) of the city. In 1858, L√≥pez Jord√°n made a brief incursion into Uruguay in order to protect the Uruguayan government from an invasion supported from Buenos Aires. That same year, he was elected deputy to the national legislature and moved to the city of Paran√°. He again took up his post as commandant of Concepci√≥n del Uruguay at the end of 1859 and took no part in the Battle of Cepeda, having been left in charge of the defense of the border formed by the Uruguay River. After the battle, Urquiza advanced toward Buenos Aires and signed the Treaty of San Jos√© de Flores, in which the dissident province of Buenos Aires strongly conditioned its reluctant reincorporation into the Argentine republic. In this moment, L√≥pez Jord√°n began to doubt the firmness of his chief; the situation led inevitably toward a new confrontation. When Urquiza left the presidency of Argentina and resumed the governorship of Entre R√≠os, he made L√≥pez Jord√°n one of his ministers on May 1, 1860. During this time, L√≥pez Jord√°n bought a ranch, Arroyo Grande, near the Uruguay River. Enmity toward Urquiza In 1861, Argentine president Santiago Derqui named L√≥pez Jord√°n chief of one of the two cavalry columns that fought in Battle of Pav√≥n on September 17 of that year. In the battle, L√≥pez Jord√°n, Juan Sa√°, and Benjam√≠n Virasoro completely defeated the cavalry of the city of Buenos Aires, while the Federalist infantry was repulsed. But Urquiza, without putting his whole army into action, retired with all his infantry, artillery, and reserves. All the Federalists thought that Urquiza had passed to the side of Buenos Aires, which is fairly certain: he appears to have come to a tacit accord with Bartolom√© Mitre, a future president of Argentina, to permit Urquiza to control his own province without interference while abandoning the Confederation to its fate.In fact, Urquiza's province of Entre R√≠os was the first so to disregard the national authority of the president and congress of the Confederation. See: Ruiz Moreno, Isidoro J., Campa√±as militares argentinas, Ed. Emec√©. P√°ez de la Torre, Carlos (h), El derrumbe de la Confederaci√≥n. Memorial de la Patria, tomo XI, Ed. La Bastilla, Bs. As., 1984. Derqui promoted his two victorious military chiefs, Sa√° and L√≥pez Jord√°n, to general on September 20, but the two generals were not able to defend him. L√≥pez Jord√°n turned back to Entre R√≠os, obeying Urquiza's order, and renounced his governmental and military duties. A little later, Derqui resigned his own office and the Argentine Confederation was dissolved. The following year, after nearly all the provincial governments had changed, Bartolom√© Mitre was elected president. L√≥pez Jord√°n never forgave Urquiza for having retreated from Pav√≥n and blamed Urquiza for the national government's remaining under the control of centralists from the city of Buenos Aires. But, for the moment, L√≥pez Jord√°n did not make up his mind to take action: he still believed in Urquiza, even if less and less. From his province in the years that followed, L√≥pez Jord√°n observed how the Federalists in the western reaches of Argentina and in the province of Corrientes were destroyed without the leader of the Federalist party, Urquiza, doing a thing to aid them. He also saw how an invasion supported by the province of Buenos Aires and by Brazil overthrew the lawful president of Uruguay and how a Brazilian fleet destroyed his native city, Paysand√∫. Urquiza still did nothing. In 1864, L√≥pez Jord√°n stood as a candidate to succeed Urquiza as governor of Entre R√≠os, but Urquiza declared himself to be in favor of the candidacy of his nephew Jos√© Mar√≠a Dom√≠nguez, a man completely subordinated to his political leader and who, in the end, was elected. The war in Uruguay provoked a Paraguayan reaction which led to the Paraguayan War. Urquiza called the people of Entre Rios to the war against Paraguay; L√≥pez Jord√°n accompanied him but later told Urquiza that Urquiza ordered the mobilization of the forces of Entre R√≠os at the encampment of Basualdo, in the northern part of the province. Eight thousand men presented themselves there, but nearly all believed that they were to unite with the Paraguayans against the Brazilians. When the citizens learnt on whose side they were to fight, they simply went home. L√≥pez Jord√°n supported and cheered the desertions and was accused of having instigated it. When Urquiza again tried to gather his army, this time at the encampment of Toledo, the men again deserted. In the end, only eight hundred citizens of Entre Rios went to war; and very few returned from it. In 1867, a revolution organized by Juan Sa√°, Juan de Dios Videla, and Felipe Varela broke out in the Argentine provinces of Mendoza and La Rioja. These leaders invoked the name of Urquiza and begged him to support the revolution. Urquiza did not move, and the revolution was quickly defeated. A powerful opposition censured Urquiza, but the power of the caudillo was greater, and there were many arrests. In 1868, Urquiza lost the election for president of Argentina but, chosen by the provincial legislature in April of that year, again became governor of Entre R√≠os, in spite of the popular support for L√≥pez Jord√°n's candidacy. On July 31 of that same year, L√≥pez Jord√°n and Justo Carmelo Urquiza, son of the caudillo, defeated national forces invading in support of a revolution in Corrientes even while rumors were circulating that L√≥pez Jord√°n might start a rebellion against Urquiza in Entre Rios. The war against Paraguay ended the following year; the cost to Argentina was more than ten thousand deaths. A few months later, at his lavish country seat, San Jos√© palace, Urquiza received the Argentine president, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, whom the Federalists regarded as the chief of their enemies, the embodiment of all they opposed. L√≥pez Jord√°n prepared himself for revolution. That revolution erupted on April 11, 1870. As a first step, a party of fifty men under the command of Sim√≥n Luengo penetrated San Jos√© palace with the object of seizing Urquiza; but he defended himself by shooting and ended up dead. That same day, in the city of Concordia, Entre R√≠os, Urquiza's sons Justo Carmelo and Waldino, both √≠ntimate friends of L√≥pez Jord√°n, were killed, too. Three days later, the provincial legislature chose L√≥pez Jord√°n as provisional governor of Entre Rios, to complete Urquiza's term as governor. In his inaugural address, L√≥pez Jord√°n supported the revolution and in passing scarcely mentioned that he had \\"deplored that . . . no other way might have been found than that the illustrious v√≠ctim sacrificed himself.\\" Later, L√≥pez Jord√°n was sought to head a rebellion against the national government. He did not rebel and, indeed, he lacked the time in which to do so. The Jordanist Rebellion Sarmiento, the Argentine president, treated the revolution in Entre Rios and the murder of Urquiza as provocative acts against himself and on April 19, 1870, sent an \\"Army of Observation\\" to Entre R√≠os. This force, composed of veterans of the war against Paraguay, posted itself at Gualeguaych√∫. Sarmiento never declared that the national government would intervene in matters in Entre Rios (which intervention the Argentine congress was opposing) but, instead, issued a presidential decrees on April 25 in which he declared war, as against an enemy country, and declared that L√≥pez Jord√°n and those who accompanied him were \\"accused of rebellion\\". Three generals attacked Entre Rios at the same time: Emilio Mitre disembarked at Gualeguaych√∫; Emilio Conesa, at Paran√°; and Juan Andr√©s Gelly y Obes entered from Corrientes. A series of engagements followed, ending at last with the defeat of L√≥pez Jord√°n in the Battle of √ëaemb√© in the province of Corrientes. He fled to Brazil with 1,500 supporters. Elections were held in Entre Rios in his absence, but without Federalist candidates, who were barred, and with very few voters. The new governor, Emilio Duportal, threw all Federalists out of office, even out of the governmental positions of priests (the Roman Catholic Church being the established church) and teachers. Public lands were sold at supposedly public auctions, but actually reserved for friends of the government; many settlers were ejected from their lands, and the police, recruited from outsiders, committed all manner of assaults and other crimes against the citizenry. Ashamed, Duportal resigned and the province fell into the hands of Le√≥nidas Echag√ºe, son of the former governor Pascual Echag√ºe, who had none of the moral qualms of his predecessor. L√≥pez Jord√°n returned to Entre R√≠os on May 1, 1873. On the 28th, Sarmiento sent to the lower house of the national congress, the C√°mara de Diputados, proposed legislation offering a hundred thousand pesos for the head of L√≥pez Jord√°n and ten thousands for that of Mariano Querencio, besides the sum of a thousand pesos for the head of each of the ‚Äúauthors of excesses committed for the revolution‚Äù.El Jordanista On December 9, Generals Gainza and Vedia defeated L√≥pez Jord√°n at the Battle of Don Gonzalo, in which Remington rifles made their first appearance among Argentine troops and ravaged the revolutionary ranks. On Christmas Day, December 25, 1873, L√≥pez Jord√°n crossed the Uruguay River at the pass of Cupal√©n, exiling himself to Uruguay. The province of Entre Rios was again subjected to rule by force, and the Federalist party was greatly weakened by hundreds of arrests. L√≥pez Jord√°n made new plans, which included a revolution in the entire country with the support of Brazil. He again returned to his province on November 25, 1876, but this time he had no support. On December 7, one of his detachments was annihilated by General Juan Ayala in combat at Alcaracito (in the departamento of La Paz in Entre Rios), after which many of L√≥pez Jord√°n's partisans who had been taken prisoner (a colonel, the son of Genaro Ber√≥n de Astrada, a former governor of the Argentine province of Corrientes, among them) were shot. It was the end of the last Federalist adventure. On December 16, L√≥pez Jord√°n fled toward Corrientes but, betrayed by a friend, he was subjected to governmental justice at Goya. He was held at Curuz√∫ Cuati√°, Goya, Paran√°, and Rosario; during the course of three years, his trial was repeatedly postponed, until, disguised as a woman, he escaped from prison with the help of his wife, Dolores Puig, on August 12, 1879. On September 3, L√≥pez Jord√°n sought asylum at Fray Bentos, Uruguay. Later life L√≥pez Jord√°n stayed in voluntary exile at Montevideo, Uruguay, until the end of 1888, when, thanks to an amnesty decreed by Argentine president Miguel Ju√°rez Celman in August of that year, he returned to his country and settled at Buenos Aires, whence he sought recommissioning into the Argentine army. But on June 22, 1889, L√≥pez Jord√°n was shot and killed in the street by the young Aurelio Casas, who had been told that L√≥pez Jord√°n had ordered the murder of his father, Zen√≥n Casas, a military captain (although the killing had actually been ordered by a Uruguayan military officer, Cornelio Oviedo, in May 1873). The Urquiza family then presented the sum of thirty-five thousand pesos to the wife of Aurelio Casas. The remains of Ricardo Ram√≥n L√≥pez Jord√°n were brought back to Entre R√≠os in 1989 and temporarily deposited in the pantheon of the P√©rez Colman family, in Paran√°. On November 29, 1995, the remains were transferred to a mausoleum erected in Carb√≥ square in Paran√°. Bibliography * Bosch, Beatriz, Historia de Entre R√≠os, Ed. Plus Ultra, Bs.

Amongst the keynote speakers who participated, we can highlight the presence of Mr. Donald Evans, U.S.Secretary of Commerce, in the Buenos Aires summit. eCOM-LAC was a founder of LACNIC, the Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry, which was formally established in late 2003, after four years of negotiations with ICANN in order to obtain approval of this initiative. This was a genuine Muiltisector Partnership which included participation of the private, academic, NGO and Civil Society sectors in the region. The ‚Äúdeliverable‚Äù was a non-profit entity, with policies defined by the regional Internet community, and which manages the IP address blocks for Latin America from its headquarters in Montevideo (Uruguay). In the years 2004/2005, eCOM-LAC was part of an International Consortium, led by the Fundaci√≥ Applicaci√≥ of Barcelona (Spain), which was awarded a 3.000.000 Euros subsidy by the European Commission, through the @lis RFP. The project that was implemented was titled: ATLAS de la Diversidad ‚Äì Mi Lugar, and approximately four hundred schools in Latin America received instruction in the use of website development and publishing tools, and simultaneously creating a network of schools that were able to share their customs, culture, music, history, etc. eCOM-LAC was tasked with provisioning broadband connectivity for the underprivileged schools that lacked resources. The Consortium paid for these costs during the duration of the project (24 months).

Internet users need to identify and differentiate themselves, even beyond their own region, in an effort to reflect their identity in their cultural, social and business activities. The DNS through the TLDs still continues providing unique identification to machines, services and internet users on the Web. This identification is traditionally associated with its country of origin or its prime activity like commerce, education and government. Users need choice. In response to this need, in recent years we have seen the emergence of some new top level domains such as: ‚Äò.biz‚Äô, ‚Äò.info‚Äô, ‚Äò.name‚Äô, ‚Äò.travel‚Äô, ‚Äò.mobi‚Äô, and significantly the regional identity TLDs ‚Äì ‚Äò.eu‚Äô, and ‚Äò.asia‚Äô and cultural identity TLDs like \\".cat\\" . These two latter domains, which are enjoying significant success, provide registrants with an option to register domain names establishing a regional or cultural identity in the Internet, as compared for example, to a national identity by registering their domain names under a country code top level domain. To give Latin-American and Caribbean individuals and organizations from all over the world a new choice to identify themselves with the rest of the internet, eCOM-LAC in partnership with NIC Mexico, applied for delegation of a new top level domain ‚Äì ‚Äò.lat‚Äô. This TLD was launched in 2019.

There are a variety of training and entry routes into the profession of conservation; for many the first step is a full-time academic course. Whereas training in Conservation has traditionally taken the form of an apprenticeship, in more recent years training in a recognized conservation course at a University has become the norm. Today it is more common for professional conservators to have taken a University course combined with a period of time as an intern. \\"The scope of conservators' work has widened in recent years, and is no longer dominated by hands-on conservation. Conservators now expect to be involved with exhibitions, conservation science, preventive conservation, project management and advocacy work\\".ICON - Institute of Conservation - Careers & Training Within the various schools that teach conservation, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself.AIC - Becoming a Conservator Many of the Conservation Associations and Professional Organizations also provide additional information about the schools in their respective fields and locations. Australia * The University of Canberra Bachelor of Heritage, Museums and Conservation, Major in Conservation This major is for students who wish to gain detailed understanding of the knowledge and techniques of cultural heritage materials conservation. The major is open to students of the Bachelor of Heritage Museums and Conservation and can also be taken as an elective major by any student. The major is not restricted. Students wishing to pursue a career in heritage conservation should also take the Minor in Conservation Science as part of their electives for the Bachelor of Heritage, Museums and Conservation. * The University of Melbourne Master of Cultural Materials Conservation (2 years full-time) The Master of Cultural Materials Conservation offers a professional qualification, combining both theory and practice, and emphasising the philosophical, intellectual and scientific aspects of cultural materials conservation. Students will benefit from the Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation's strong industry links and will gain access to the University of Melbourne's vast and varied cultural collections, including the Ian Potter Museum of Art, and the University's library, archive and school collections. Students will also have access to industry links with leading museums, galleries, archives and libraries, across Australia and overseas, with opportunities to develop research in relation to broader issues of cultural preservation for communities and cultures within the Asian-Pacific region. The option to specialise in areas including conservation treatment of paintings, works on paper, frames, and some object and architectural conservation, can be combined with an internship. In consultation with an academic supervisor, students can arrange to undertake a placement in a conservation department or practice, which deals directly in the conservation of materials of their specialisation. Students have the opportunity to undertake internships across Australia, and overseas (for example, in the UK, USA, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, Greece and East Timor).

This university at first established by the name of \\"Pardis Faculty of Isfahan\\" as a branch of Farabi University in Tehran in 1978 to educate and provide conservation and restoration specialists for dealing with historic objects and Persian urban textures. It acted as the first school of conservation in Iran and with time it expanded to other fields like Archaeology, Painting, Architecture, Industrial Design and other branches of art in BA level. With growing the faculty, it converted to the Art University of Isfahan in 1999 and Faculty of Conservation remained at the same place. This school of conservation has developed a methodology for scientific restoration in Iran. At present, it has two departments, one for conservation and restoration of historic cultural property and another for conservation and restoration of historic monuments and textures. It is offering B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in both departments and accepts students not only from Iran but also from all over the world. Today, this university with a strong background in conservation and with up-to-date equipment, instruments and knowledge is one of the most important educational and research oriented centers for cultural heritage conservation and most of the specialists involved in different sites of cultural heritage are graduated from this school.

The original building was destroyed by fire in 1995 and was rebuilt with significant modifications from the original blueprints, primarily to the upper floors, which were redesigned to accommodate the building's function as a conference center. Charles Kettering was a successful inventor, businessman, and philanthropist. His inventions of a reliable car engine ignition system, discovery of tetraethyl lead as a fuel additive to avoid engine knocking, and the development of freon, all contributed to the spread of the automobile in the United States. His philanthropy included founding of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Accessed on line November 8, 2012.  History and nomenclature  The designation HD 40307 is from the Henry Draper Catalogue, which is based on spectral classifications made between 1911 and 1915 by Annie Jump Cannon and her co- workers, and was published between 1918 and 1924.pp. 214‚Äì215 in The Henry Draper Memorial, Annie J.

Pickering, Annals of Harvard College Observatory; hours 0 to 3, 91 (1918), ; hours 4 to 6, 92 (1918), ; hours 7 to 8, 93 (1919), ; hours 9 to 11, 94 (1919), ; hours 12 to 14, 95 (1920), ; hours 15 to 16, 96 (1921), ; hours 17 to 18, 97 (1922), ; hours 19 to 20, 98 (1923), ; hours 21 to 23, 99 (1924), .  Characteristics  As a K-type star, HD 40307 emits orange-tinted light. It has only about three-quarters of the Sun's radius and mass. Its temperature is measured at slightly under 5000 K. This is relatively high for a K-type star, approaching the temperatures normally found in G-type stars such as the Sun. The astronomers who discovered the planets orbiting HD 40307 suggested that the metallicities of stars determine whether or not the planetary bodies that orbit them will be terrestrial, like Earth, or gaseous, like Jupiter and Saturn. = Distance and visibility = Despite its relative proximity to the Sun at 42 light-years, HD 40307 is not visible to the naked eye, given its apparent magnitude of 7.17. It came within 6.4 light-years of the Sun about 413,000 years ago.  Planetary system  The orbits of the inner three planets of HD 40307. After spending five years observing the star, the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere (ESO) announced that they had discovered three super- Earths in orbit around HD 40307 in June 2008. All three planets were detected by the radial velocity method, using the HARPS spectrograph system. In 2012, an independent analysis carried out by a team of astronomers led by Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire confirmed the existence of these planets and found an additional three planets in the systems. Five of the planets orbit very close to the star, with the farthest of them located twice as close to HD 40307 than is the planet Mercury is to the Sun.Mercury orbits at approx. 0.39 AU The outermost planet orbits at a distance similar to the distance of Venus to the Sun and is situated well in the system's liquid water habitable zone. The minimum masses of the planets in the system ranges from three to ten times the mass of the Earth, placing them somewhere between Earth and gas giants like Uranus and Neptune. Dynamical analysis of the innermost planets suggests that planet b is unstable at its age unless it is an ice giant, having migrated from further away. That implies similar for the other planets, even further out. The most recent discovery also indicates via dynamical analysis that the true planetary masses can not be much higher than their minimum masses.

The title \\"Black Gold\\" comes from a slang term for oil. Black Gold aired Wednesday nights on truTV at 10pm. It is also shown as a special presentation on TNT in high definition. The show also airs in the United Kingdom on ITV4 and debuted in Australia on A&E; on February 4, 2016. Series overviewFirst season= The first season follows three rigs ‚Äî Longhorn, Viking, and Big Dog‚Äîthat have only 50 days to successfully locate and retrieve the crude oil. The roughnecks, as they are called on the rig, endure exhausting and dangerous work demands. Oil rigs Longhorn and Viking are funded by wildcatter Mike Lamonica while the Big Dog is funded by wildcatter Autry Stephens, both of whom have put up millions of dollars in hopes of finding new deposits of oil. The show also features pipe salesman Michael ‚ÄúRooster‚Äù McConaughey, brother of actor Matthew McConaughey and a self-made millionaire who stars in the CNBC series West Texas Investors Club. =Second season= The second season (premiered August 8, 2009) only follows one rig, Big Dog rig number 28, owned by Autry Stephens. The season is centered around the requirement given by Stephens to finish four wells in 50 days in order to maintain the lease on the land. One notable returning character is Gerald Williams, who was fired in the previous season. =Third season= The third season, premiered September 9, 2010 follows Big Dog rig 28 wildcatting on hostile landowner Peggy Hauser's land. =Fourth season= The fourth season began on November 30, 2011, airing Wednesdays at 10pm.

It is located about 200 yards north of the FM 1960 by-pass which runs along the north side of Humble and east of the railroad tracks and U.S. Highway 59.  History  Humble was incorporated as a city in 1933. At that time, by vote of the City Council, racial segregation was invoked to make the town \\"lily white\\". The black population was forced to relocate their families as well as the graves of their dead to another location, outside the city limits. Starting in 1933, blacks began to move out of Humble and by 1935, almost all had.http://www.hcnonline.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=19686156&BRD;=1574&PAG;=461&dept;_id=635648&rfi;=6 There used to be a sawmill north of Humble that was owned by Mr. Bender, one of the founders of Humble. Blacks migrated from Gladysville, Cleveland, Splendora and Fostoria to work there. Also, Mr. Borders had a sawmill west of Humble. He was kind to the African-American people who worked for him and gave them some property to live on. The area was known as Bordersville after the name of the owner of the sawmill. When African-Americans were made to live outside the \\"border\\" of incorporated Humble, many of them moved to the Bordersville area which was settled by the African-American employees of Borders Sawmill. Time took its toll on the cemetery over the years and it became overgrown. In 2005, the members of Grace Church, a multicultural church located in Humble, sought permission from the owners of the land to clean and restore it, something they had hoped and tried to do for a long time. After receiving clearance from the City of Humble and the Texas Department of Transportation, Grace Church spent many thousands of dollars putting in a road, clearing hundreds of trees, and working with local historians to restore the cemetery. To honor the war veterans who are buried there, the church also installed a flag pole and U.S. flag station. Currently, the church is trying to have a historical marker placed at the site. While hoping to return the cemetery to the loved ones of the deceased, the church continues to cover all maintenance and upkeep. In 2008, there was an incident that involved disturbing one of the graves and desecrating one of the bodies interred there. This incident brought the cemetery back into the public eye. The pastors of Grace Church oversaw the re-interment of the body.

Classical economic theory predicts that capital should flow from rich countries to poor countries, due to the effect of diminishing returns of capital. Poor countries have lower levels of capital per worker ‚Äì which explains, in part, why they are poor. In poor countries, the scarcity of capital relative to labor should mean that the returns related to the infusion of capital are higher than in developed countries. In response, savers in rich countries should look at poor countries as profitable places in which to invest. In reality, things do not seem to work that way. Surprisingly little capital flows from rich countries to poor countries. This puzzle, famously discussed in a paper by Robert Lucas in 1990, is often referred to as the \\"Lucas Paradox.\\" The theoretical explanations for the Lucas Paradox can be grouped into two categories. # The first group attributes the limited amount of capital received by poorer nations to differences in fundamentals that affect the production structure of the economy, such as technological differences, missing factors of production, government policies, and the institutional structure. # The second group of explanations focuses on international capital market imperfections, mainly sovereign risk (risk of nationalization) and asymmetric information. Although the expected return on investment might be high in many developing countries, it does not flow there because of the high level of uncertainty associated with those expected returns. Examples of the Lucas paradox: 20th century development of Third World nations Lucas‚Äô seminal paper was a reaction to observed trends in international development efforts during the 20th century. Regions characterized by poverty, such as South Asia and Africa, have received particular attention with regard to the underinvestment predicted by Lucas. African Nations, with their impoverished populace and rich natural resources, has been upheld as exemplifying the type of nations that would, under neoclassical assumptions, be able to offer extremely high returns to capital. The meager foreign capital African nations receive outside of the charity of multinational corporations reveals the extent to which Lucas captured the realities of today‚Äôs global capital flows. Authors more recently have focused their explanations for the paradox on Lucas‚Äô first category of explanation, the difference in fundamentals of the production structure. Some have pointed to the quality of institutions as the key determinant of capital inflows to poorer nations. As evidence for the central role played by institutional stability, it has been shown that the amount of foreign direct investment a country receives is highly correlated to the strength of infrastructure and the stability of government in that country. Counterexample of the Lucas paradox: American economic development Although Lucas‚Äô original hypothesis has widely been accepted as descriptive of the modern period in history, the paradox does not emerge as clearly before the 20th century. The colonial era, for instance, stands out as an age of unimpeded capital flows. The system of imperialism produced economic conditions particularly amenable to the movement of capital according to the assumptions of classical economics. Britain, for instance, was able to design, impose, and control the quality of institutions in their colonies to capitalize on the high returns to capital in the new world. Jeffrey Williamson has explored in depth this reversal of the Lucas Paradox in the colonial context. Although not emphasized by Lucas himself, Williamson maintains that unimpeded labor migration is one way that capital flows to the citizens of developing nations. The empire structure was particularly important for facilitating low-cost international migration, allowing wage rates to converge across the regions in the British Empire. For instance, in the 17th and 18th century, England incentivized its citizens to move to the labor-scarce America, endorsing a system of indentured servitude to make overseas migration affordable. While Britain enabled free capital flow from old to new world, the success of the American enterprise after the American Revolution is a good example of the role of institutional and legal frameworks for facilitating a continued flow of capital. The American Constitution‚Äôs commitment to private property rights, rights of personal liberty; and strong contract law enabled investment from Britain to America to continue even without the incentives of the colonial relationship. In these ways, early American economic development, both pre and post-revolution, provides a case study for the conditions under which the Lucas Paradox is reversed. Even after the average income level in America exceeded that of Britain, the institutions exported under imperialism and the legal frameworks established after independence enabled long term capital flows from Europe to America.

It was founded in September 1998 by Susan and David Axelrod, driven by their daughter starting to have severe seizures when she was a child. David Axelrod's involvement caused problems for the Obama administration when the White House refused to release the names of donors to CURE; David was not actively involved in running the organization by that time, but donations to the organization tripled after the Obama administration took office. David raised awareness of CURE in 2012 when he promised to shave off his mustache if he wasn't able to raise $1 million in donations for CURE. CURE raises money through gala events. By 2018 it had raised around $60 million and had funded around 220 research projects.

Built in 1855, it was home to John Mercer Langston (1829-1897), attorney, abolitionist, diplomat, US Congressman and college president, who was one of the first African Americans elected to public office in the United States. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975. Description and history The John Mercer Langston House is located on Oberlin's east side, on the south side of East College Avenue opposite the Eastwood School. It is a two-story frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The house is not particularly architecturally distinguished, although historic photos show it having a Gothic Revival porch, and its current entrance surround includes some Gothic elements. The current porch is a 20th-century alteration, with a hip roof and metalwork supports. The house was built in 1855, and was from 1856 until 1867 the home of John Mercer Langston. The son of a slave woman and her white owner, Langston was raised in Ohio, attending Oberlin College and then reading law because no law school then accepted African Americans. In 1855, Langston won election to the position of town clerk in Brownhelm Township, the first known electoral victory of its kind by an African American in the United States. He later served as a recruiter of African Americans for military service in the American Civil War, and helped found the Howard University Law School, where he was its first dean.

It is optimized to achieve maximum grating efficiency in a given diffraction order. For this purpose, maximum optical power is concentrated in the desired diffraction order while the residual power in the other orders (particularly the zeroth) is minimized. Since this condition can only exactly be achieved for one wavelength, it is specified for which blaze wavelength the grating is optimized (or blazed). The direction in which maximum efficiency is achieved is called the blaze angle and is the third crucial characteristic of a blazed grating directly depending on blaze wavelength and diffraction order.  Blaze angle  Like every optical grating, a blazed grating has a constant line spacing d, determining the magnitude of the wavelength splitting caused by the grating. The grating lines possess a triangular, sawtooth-shaped cross section, forming a step structure. The steps are tilted at the so-called blaze angle \\\\theta_B with respect to the grating surface. Accordingly, the angle between step normal and grating normal is \\\\theta_B. The blaze angle is optimized to maximize efficiency for the wavelength of the used light. Descriptively, this means \\\\theta_B is chosen such that the beam diffracted at the grating and the beam reflected at the steps are both deflected into the same direction. Commonly blazed gratings are manufactured in the so-called Littrow configuration.  Littrow configuration  Diffraction at a blazed grating. The general case is shown with red rays; the Littrow configuration is shown with blue rays The Littrow configuration is a special geometry in which the blaze angle is chosen such that diffraction angle and incidence angle are identical.Richardson Gratings, \\"Technical Note 11\\", section \\"Determination of the Blaze Wavelength\\" (30 September 2012). For a reflection grating, this means that the diffracted beam is back-reflected into the direction of the incident beam (blue beam in picture). The beams are perpendicular to the step and therefore parallel to the step normal. Hence it holds in Littrow configuration \\\\alpha = \\\\beta = \\\\theta_B. Diffraction angles at the grating are not influenced by the step structure. They are determined by the line spacing and can be calculated according to the grating equation: : d \\\\left( \\\\sin{\\\\alpha} + \\\\sin{\\\\beta} \\\\right) = m \\\\lambda where: :d = line spacing, :\\\\alpha = incidence angle, :\\\\beta = diffraction angle (angle taken in the same direction as \\\\alpha, meaning the red \\\\beta would have a negative sign in the picture above if \\\\alpha is positive), :m = diffraction order, :\\\\lambda = wavelength of incident light. For the Littrow configuration, this becomes 2 d \\\\sin{\\\\theta_B} = m \\\\lambda. By solving for \\\\theta_B the blaze angle can be calculated for arbitrary combinations of diffraction order, wavelength and line spacing: :\\\\theta_B = \\\\arcsin{\\\\frac{m \\\\lambda}{2d}} \\\\ .  Blazed transmission grating  Blazed gratings can also be realized as transmission gratings. In this case the blaze angle is chosen such that the angle of the desired diffraction order coincides with the angle of the beam refracted at the grating material.Richardson Gratings, \\"Technical Note 4 - Transmission Gratings\\", section \\"Blazed Transmission Gratings\\" (30 September 2012).  Echelle grating  A special form of a blazed grating is the echelle grating. It is characterized by particularly large blaze angle (>45¬∞). Therefore, the light hits the short legs of the triangular grating lines instead of the long legs. Echelle gratings are mostly manufactured with larger line spacing but are optimized for higher diffraction orders. Echelle gratings are useful in planet-finding astronomy, and are used on the successful HARPS and PARAS (PRL Advanced Radial-velocity All-sky Search) spectrograph.

Perry was born in Forrest City, Arkansas. He played violin as a child, but switched to alto sax when he wished to join a local band. He attended Starr College in West Virginia, studying piano there, and had his own band in Gary, Indiana by 1940. In 1945 he went to Los Angeles, appearing in a show with Dorothy Donegan and Nat King Cole; while there he made his first recordings as a leader. He led a band called the Pied Pipers through the middle of the 1950s, making many records and touring across the United States multiple times (as well as Canada in 1951). He recorded for Melodisc, United Artists, Excelsior, De Luxe, Specialty, Dot, RPM, Lucky, Unique, Look, and Hollywood during this period. After ca. 1954 Perry went into a hiatus from music, but returned to play after moving to Bakersfield in 1967. In the 1970s he played as a one-man band with organ, saxophone, and percussion. Around this time he also released a number of comedy albums for his own label, Octive. He later moved into real estate. He died in Bakersfield, California, aged 75.

It was home in 1820 to abolitionist Benjamin Lundy (1789-1839), where he established the influential antislavery newspaper The Genius of Universal Emancipation, one of the first antislavery publications in the United States. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in May 1974, and included in the Mount Pleasant Historic District later the same year. Description and history The Benjamin Lundy House stands at the western end of Mount Pleasant's Union Street, its principal thoroughfare. It is on the south side of the street, at an angle on a lot between Market Street and County Road 104. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof. Its main section is three bays wide, with the entrance in the right most bay, with a recessed two-bay extension on the right side. A single-story wood-frame ell with clapboarded exterior extends to the left.{{cite weburl= The house (either one of its duplex units, or both) was built in 1812 or 1813, and was for one year the home of Benjamin Lundy, one of the early organizing forces in the movement for the abolition of slavery in the United States. During his year of residency here, Lundy began publishing The Genius of Universal Emancipation, the first dedicated anti-slavery publication of its type. The house belonge to Dr. Isaac Parker, a leader of the local abolitionist community, from 1815 to 1843. The building is known to have served as a station on the Underground Railroad, and is one of the few known instances of a place where a free produce movement store operated. These stores refused products and profits that were based in any way on slave labor. In late 2009 the three-story house stood in extreme disrepair. It was acquired in 2015 by the Ohio History Connection, a preservation organization that has stabilized its condition and plans to restore it.

Horses running this event must have speed, but also the agility to stop quickly in full stride, turn, and bolt directly back into a run. Course The obstacle course is a pattern, usually marked with white powder (commonly flour or powdered chalk) poured into a \\"keyhole\\" shape in the dirt. The pattern varies between events. According to the California Gymkhana Association, the pattern should be set up as follows: *80 feet from arena gate to timing line. *100 feet from timing line to center of keyhole. *Keyhole should be four feet across at the entrance, 10 feet from the entrance of the keyhole to the bulb. *The bulb itself should be 20 feet across. *The pattern may also be made of cones or poles set up in a similar pattern. Timing The event begins when the horse and rider cross the timing line. The team enters the keyhole at a gallop, then turns in either direction inside the keyhole's circle without stepping over the chalk. The horse and the rider turns as fast as they can in the bulb. The team then exits the keyhole again at a gallop and the time ends once they cross the timing line. Winning times for this event range from 5 to 10 seconds. Penalties may be applied to a team's time. Each gymkhana or event may operate under different rules and therefore the penalties may be different. Penalties may include adding five seconds to the team's time, or may even be enough to disqualify the contestant completely.

History of the claims  Origins of the British claim = The South Georgia archipelago was first claimed for Great Britain by James Cook in January 1775, having been previously discovered by Anthony de la Roch√©.18th Century History of South Georgia, South Atlantic Ocean However, the British did little to enforce this claim until 1843, when Letters Patent were issued to provide for the government of the islands, which were to be governed as a Falkland Islands Dependency. These were revised in 1876 and 1892. In 1908, following enquiries regarding the sovereignty of the area currently covered by the British Antarctic Territory from the Norwegian government, the British government stated that the islands were British, and issued Letters Patent to include \\"South Orkney, South Georgia and South Shetland islands, and Graham Land situated in the South Atlantic Ocean to the south of the 50th parallel of south latitude and lying between the 20th and 80th degrees of west longitude\\" as Falkland Islands Dependencies. It was made clear at this time that the association with the Falkland Islands was intended as an administrative convenience.National Interests and Claims in the Antarctic, pp. 19‚Äì20, Robert E. Wilson As it had been observed within the British government that a literal interpretation of this claim would include parts of the South American mainland, the letters patent were clarified on 28 March 1917, redefining the limits to exclude all territories north of 58¬∞S and west of 50¬∞W, but to otherwise include all land in this region. Though the Argentine government were given details of the 1908 letters patent (at their request), neither Argentina nor Chile objected to either claim. = Origins of the Argentine claim = Solveig Gunbj√∏rg Jacobsen, the first person born on South Georgia, pictured at the CAP whaling station at Grytviken in 1916 The Compa√±√≠a Argentina de Pesca (CAP), an Argentine-registered whaling company run by Norwegian Carl Anton Larsen, was the first company to set up operations on South Georgia in 1904. This company founded the settlement of Grytviken and its employees (including Larsen himself) became the first permanent residents of the island. In 1905, the Argentine government authorised a weather station on the island. In 1906, the CAP signed a lease with the Falkland Islands government, and following the 1908 annexation the company started to use British whaling licences and leases for land at Grytviken and Jason Harbour. Also in 1908, the CAP started looking to the South Sandwich Islands for the expansion of their business. Larsen adopted British citizenship in 1910. Argentina's first explicit claim to South Georgia was made in 1927 and to the South Sandwich Islands in 1938. = Later developments = Following the Argentine claims, the UK offered (in 1947, 1951, 1953 and 1954) to take the matter to the International Court of Justice in The Hague but this was turned down by Argentina. When Britain took the issue to the court unilaterally in 1955, Argentina declined to cooperate, citing a lack of jurisdiction. The British divided the Falkland Islands dependencies in 1962, in accordance with the newly signed Antarctic Treaty. Those areas south of 60¬∞S became the British Antarctic Territory,Foreign and Commonwealth Office: British Antarctic Territory while the remainder ‚Äì South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands ‚Äì retained their previous status. = Falklands War = Argentina established a base, Corbeta Uruguay, on Thule Island at the far south of the South Sandwich Islands in November 1976. When this base was discovered by the British that December, the British protested diplomatically, and sent a task force (Operation Journeyman) to protect the Falkland Islands from potential invasion.BBC News ‚Äì Secret Falklands fleet revealed, 1 June 2005 On 19 March 1982, a group of 50 Argentines posing as scrap metal merchants landed at Leith Harbour on South Georgia aboard the ARA Bah√≠a Buen Suceso and hoisted the Argentine flag.\\"infiltrated on board, pretending to be scientists, were members of an Argentine naval special forces unit\\" Nick van der Bijl, Nine Battles to Stanley, London, Leo Cooper P.8 as reported in Lawrence Freemdman, The Official History of the Falklands Campaign: Vol I The Origins of the Falklands War\\"Bahia Buen Suceso set sail for South Georgia on 11 March carrying Argentine Marines\\" Rowland White, Vulcan 607, London, Bantam Press, p30.BBC On this day, 19 March 1982: Argentine flag hoisted on S Georgia The British government responded by sending HMS Endurance with 22 Royal Marines to expel the Argentines, but they were held off to avoid increasing the tension.

Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982 and took Grytviken the following day, leaving 44 marines. Despite seizing Grytviken and Leith, the Argentines were not able to take the entire island and several British Antarctic Survey field camps remained in the hands of the United Kingdom throughout the length of the war. In response to the Argentine invasion, the British launched Operation Corporate (the recapture of the Falkland Islands) of which Operation Paraquet was part. Royal Marines retook Grytviken in two hours on 25 April 1982 using intelligence from the SBS who had infiltrated the island, following an attack on the ARA Santa Fe by Royal Naval helicopters.BBC On this day, 25 April 1982: Marines land in South Georgia The garrison at Leith Harbour surrendered the following day, and Corbeta Uruguay surrendered on 20 June 1982. It was demolished that December. = Current status = Grytviken in 1989 Britain has administered South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands separately from the Falklands since the islands were made a British dependent territory in their own right in 1985. The status of the territory was altered by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, and the terminology now used is British overseas territory. Argentina considers the islands to be part of the Islas del Atl√°ntico Sur Department of Tierra del Fuego Province.

Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru (left) with President Ho Chi Minh (right) in Hanoi; 1954. Cultural and economic links between India and Vietnam date back to 2nd century. The Indic ChƒÉm Pa kingdom had some influence on Vietnamese music. In contemporary era, relations between India and Vietnam have been governed by several areas of shared political interests. India strongly condemned U.S. action during the Vietnam War and was also one of the few non-communist countries to assist Vietnam during the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War. In 1992, India and Vietnam established extensive economic ties, including oil exploration, agriculture and manufacturing. The relations between the two countries, especially defence ties, benefited extensively from India's Look East policy. Bilateral military cooperation includes sale of military equipment, sharing of intelligence, joint naval exercises and training in counterinsurgency and jungle warfare. India also regularly deploys its warships for goodwill visits to Vietnamese seas.  Background  India supported Vietnam's independence from France, opposed American involvement in the Vietnam War, and supported unification of Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, India supported the North, albeit not by conducting military hostilities against the South. This can be contrasted with the policies of the US, who strongly supported the South and engaged in military conflict with the North, albeit without issuing an official declaration of war. India and North Vietnam established official diplomatic relations in 1972 and have since maintained friendly relations, especially in wake of Vietnam's hostile relations with the People's Republic of China, with which India had some diplomatic disputes.  Development of bilateral and commercial ties  Bilateral signing ceremony in 2011 India granted the \\"Most Favoured Nation\\" status to Vietnam in 1975 and both nations signed a bilateral trade agreement in 1978 and the Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (BIPPA) on March 8, 1997. The Indo-Vietnam Joint Business Council has worked to promote trade and investment since 1993. In 2003, both nations promulgated a Joint Declaration on Comprehensive Cooperation when the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam N√¥ng ƒê·ª©c M·∫°nh visited India and both nations are negotiating a free trade agreement. In 2007, a fresh joint declaration was issued during the state visit of the Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguy·ªÖn T·∫•n D≈©ng. Bilateral trade has increased rapidly since the liberalisation of the economies of both Vietnam and India. India is the 13th-largest exporter to Vietnam, with exports that have grown steadily from $11.5 million in 1985-86 to $395.68 million by 2003. Vietnam's exports to India rose to $180 million, including agricultural products, handicrafts, textiles, electronics and other goods. Between 2001 and 2006, the volume of bilateral trade expanded at 20-30% per annum to reach US$1 billion by 2006. Continuing the rapid pace of growth, bilateral trade is expected to rise to $2 billion by 2008, 2 years ahead of the official target. India and Vietnam have also expanded cooperation in information technology, education and collaboration of the respective national space programmes. Direct air links and lax visa regulations have been established to bolster tourism. In 2010, as the ASEAN-India free trade agreement came into effect, bilateral trade exploded to US$3.917 billion by the end of 2012, with Vietnam exporting $1.7 billion to India in 2012, an increase of 56.5% from 2011. As of 2015 bilateral trade stands at US$7 billion & both nations have agreed on a target of US$20 billion by 2020.

Strategic cooperation  Vietnamese Vice Minister of Defence visits the Indian Navy's Eastern Naval Command. In January 2000, the Indian Defence Minister, George Fernandes, called for a renewed political relationship with Vietnam, describing Vietnam as India's most trusted friend and ally. He proposed that India should develop a naval presence in the South China Sea through access to the Cam Ranh Bay naval and air base and that India should provide training and advanced weapons to Vietnam. India and Vietnam are both members of the Mekong‚ÄìGanga Cooperation, created to develop and enhance close ties between India and nations of Southeast Asia. Vietnam has supported India's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). In the 2003 joint declaration, India and Vietnam envisaged creating an \\"Arc of Advantage and Prosperity\\" in Southeast Asia; to this end, Vietnam has backed increasing the significance of the relationship between India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its negotiation of an Indo-ASEAN free trade agreement. India and Vietnam have also built strategic partnerships, including extensive cooperation on developing nuclear power, enhancing regional security and fighting terrorism, transnational crime and drug trafficking. Vietnam has also welcomed Indian Navy ships in their region which would enhance India and Vietnam military relations. Vietnam has also welcomed Indian support for a peaceful resolution of the territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\\"South China Sea: Vietnam sees greater Indian role.\\" Zee News, 7 July 2012.

Academy, and Fair Park Medical Careers Magnet High School is a former high school located at 3222 Greenwood Road in Shreveport, Louisiana, U.S.A. When it opened as Fair Park High School in 1928, it was the second high school in the city. C.E. Byrd High School had opened three years earlier in 1925. The institution is now known as Fair Park Middle School. In an eight-to-four decision, the Caddo Parish School Board voted in 2017 to merge Fair Park, with seven hundred pupils, with the historically black Booker T. Washington High School. The combined thousand students will attend the Washington campus, with Fair Park becoming a middle school. In standing room only, citizens aired their views to board members on the feasibility of the merger. The board majority claims the merger would save public funds through the combining of resources. History The school was built during the local oil-driven boom of the late 1920s. The population of Shreveport increased nearly five-fold increase from 1900 to 1930; this created chronic school overcrowding. Fair Park has a three-story main section built of red brick trimmed with limestone. A wing was added in 1931. The entrance features a large pediment resting on colossal pilasters. The building was originally crowned by a three-stage tower, however, the third stage and most of the second were replaced with a small dome-like top in the 1980s. Otherwise, though the building has been further expanded, the bricks sandblasted, and the windows replaced, it would be easily recognizable to its earliest students. With . From the middle 1950s until 1967, the historian Hubert D. Humphreys taught at Fair Park. Fair Park High School was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. In January 2017, Fair Park suddenly changed its principal after six consecutive years of \\"failed\\" ratings and continuing disciplinary problems. Three other high schools under the operation of the Caddo Parish School Board are also rated \\"failed\\". Reports persisted that the school would close or be downgraded to a middle school. Booker T.

Trail orienteers must identify, in the terrain and in the presence of decoys, control points shown on the map. TrailO involves navigation skills but unlike most other forms of orienteering, it involves no point to point racing and little or no route choice. It is conducted usually on trails and because the objective is accuracy, not the speed of physical movement, the sport is accessible to physically disabled competitors on equal terms as able-bodied. TrailO is one of four orienteering disciplines sanctioned by the International Orienteering Federation (IOF). European Championships in trail orienteering have been organised every year since 1994. The first ever World Cup in trail orienteering was held in 1999, and the inaugural World Trail Orienteering Championships were organised in 2004. The World Championships are now organised every year and were held in Vuokatti, Finland in 2013. TrailO has been developed to offer everyone, including people with limited mobility, a chance to participate in a meaningful orienteering competition. Because control points are identified from a distance, and competitors are not allowed to leave the trails, participants with and without physical disabilities compete on level terms.Trail Orienteering / Disciplines / Top - International Orienteering Federation Unlike other forms of orienteering which involve the competitors physically visiting the control and punch it, trail orienteering is done in form of multiple choice questions, where all questions are in the form which flag is placed at the control on the map, and the possible answers are one of the flag (A, B, etc.) seen from the decision point, or none (Z).  Formats  There are three official competition formats in World Trail Orienteering Championships: PreO, TempO and relay. =PreO= PreO (precision orienteering) is the traditional form of trail orienteering. Competitors are given a map at the start. The locations of the controls, the start and the finish are marked on the map, as in traditional orienteering. At each site, there are a number of control flags (which is called by a Latin letter A, B, C, D or E, determined at the decision point from left to right but not shown physically), but only one or none correctly represent the control marked on the map. The competitors have to stay on trails as shown on the map and look at the control at a specified location on the trail, which is called the decision point (DP). Decision points are marked on the ground, but not on the map. The sole purpose of the decision point is to determine which flags are A, B, C, D or E, which is needed to make the answer. Competitors are allowed to move along the trail to observe, but need to choose the answer at the decision point. Each correct answer scores one point, and wrong answer scores zero point. In addition, there may be a few timed controls in a PreO course, which is used for tie breaking only. They are not included in the total points (starting from 2014 rules)Competition rules for International Orienteering Federation (IOF) trail orienteering events (valid from 1 January 2014) but only have the time taken. = TempO = A TempO course has timed controls only. The competitors are ranked according to their time taken, which is the time needed to answer all controls and 30 seconds penalty for each incorrect answer, including blank and multiple answers. In each timed station, competitors are required to sit at a designated place, at which all control flags can be seen clearly. The flags are labelled from the left to the right, using the NATO phonetic alphabet (alpha, bravo, charlie, delta, echo, foxtrot). They are given a set of maps including only the area around the controls, one for each question, and have to point at the correct answer on a plate showing A, B, C, D, E, F, Z, or speak out the answer orally (alpha, bravo, charlie, delta, echo, foxtrot, zero) as quickly as possible. = Relay = The TrailO relay is a team event of 3, where every team member has to complete a precision orienteering course first and a timed part afterwards. The official format used in World Trail Orienteering Championships is as follow: * The start is a mass start, with a time limit set on the precision orienteering course shared by all three members. * The precision orienteering course consists of a number of controls, which must be a multiple of 3, where each member has to complete exactly one-third of the course in any order. For example, if there are 27 controls on the precision orienteering course, the first team member answers any 9 of them, the second answers any 9 out of remaining 18, and the third answers the remaining 9. * The transition is done in a transition area marked clearly on the map, just like in the FootO counterpart, however, each team member gets an identical map. * No communication among team members is allowed, except when at transition the previously teammate may pass a team sheet, which only indicates which controls are answered (but not the answer themselves) and nothing else. * After transition, the first and second team members are led to timed stations (which may be different for each leg), which is run using TempO rules with possible zero (Z) answer and 30 seconds penalty for each incorrect answer. * The final score is calculated by adding all team members' time used at timed stations, plus 30 seconds penalty for each wrong answer at timed controls, and 60 seconds penalty for each point deduction (mistake or exceeding the overall time limit) in the precision course. * The timed station for the third (final) leg is the final. When the third team member finishes the precision course, they are placed into a quarantine zone for the score calculation, and introduced into the timed station in reverse standing (i.e. longest time used first). There is also an alternative format, which resembles more to the FootO counterpart, where the only difference to the format above is in the precision orienteering course: * All team members share the same control sites, where each team member must visit in order, but the answers for each leg may be different. * The combinations for the controls may be different among teams, but all teams answers the same overall combination. (akin to the forking of FootO relay)  Zero answer  In advanced level of trail orienteering, apart from A, B, C, etc. which indicate the flag is the control shown on the map, there may also be the possibility for the answer to be Z (pronounced as zero), indicating there is no flag correctly placed at the control shown on the map. How far a flag must be placed off the correct location for a control to be considered as zero answer (zero tolerance) is a highly debated topic. Mobility aids Apart from a combustion-engine vehicle, any recognised mobility aids are permitted. Requested physical assistance is also permitted. Map TempO competition map made by TiM (ETOC 2018 Bratislava) The orienteering map is in ISSOM, usually at 1:5000 or 1:4000 scale. For timed and TempO controls, maps must be prepared in a very complicated way (the map must be rotated and the sheet is completed by control descriptions, North arrow, pointing board etc.). This process can be facilitated by a special program TiM. Control card A sample control card used in trail orienteering In PreO competitions, traditional paper control cards or e-cards may be used. Mobile applications on tablets and smartphones are tested as punching devices, nowadays. Traditional paper control cards are in form of a multiple-choice control card, which contain an official copy and a competitor copy, and folded in halves to make them overlap when the control card is punched. Before the competition, the name, number and class is filled, and the start and finish times are marked like in traditional orienteering. Moreover, There are fields for officials to record the times and answers at timed stations. The answers are recorded by punching the control card using the punch provided near the decision point for each control (or, in some competitions, carried by the competitor). Multiple punches or punches out-of-the-box are always considered wrong answers. If e-cards are used, the answer is made by tapping the e-card at the unit (labelled A, B, C, etc.) near the decision point. In TempO competitions, the current approach is to register answers and the time used by an application (ANT) on a mobile device. The former way is to mark data on a paper by the officials at the timed stations and to submit it to the organizer.

History Introduced by Liggett & Myers in 1963, and notable for its charcoal filter and past advertising campaigns, Lark was launched in 1963 by Liggett & Myers with its trademark charcoal filter in an effort to halt a five-year downward drift in sales. The distinguishing feature of the brand, both in terms of physical characteristics and taste was the 3-piece \\"Keith\\" filter (named for Dr. Charles H. Keith, \\"Supervisor of Physical Chemistry\\" for Liggett & Myers, who developed it)- the middle section of which contains small charcoal granules, which purportedly reduces the harshness of the cigarette's smoke. Liggett & Myers underwent several name changes over the years but kept the Lark brand in their product mix until 1999, when Liggett Vector Brands Inc. sold Lark, along with the L&M; and Chesterfield brands for $300 million to Philip Morris Companies Inc., later known as Altria. (The sale involved only domestic rights; Philip Morris already owned the international rights to the three brands, which it had purchased in the late 1970s.) Since its introduction and despite several prominent advertising campaigns, among which was one featuring people on the street being asked to \\"Show us your Lark pack\\", Lark has never held a large share of the U.S. cigarette market. , the brand had less than 1% of the U.S. market share, but was extremely popular in Japan. U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan II smoked Larks. Comedian George Carlin discussed the \\"Show us your lark\\" ad on the album AM & FM (1972). Advertising history From its introduction in 1963, the brand came in a maroon-colored package with white print (the trademark shield was initially white but was soon changed to gold along with some of the other graphics). And for most of the brand‚Äôs life it has sported the slogan \\"Richly Rewarding, yet Uncommonly Smooth\\". Although Philip Morris continues to promote the brand heavily in Japan, it receives little to no advertising in the United States. This would explain why its share of the U.S. market has declined over the years since experts generally agree that cigarette brands usually lose market share when they are no longer promoted. Past advertising campaigns, however, have been conspicuous. Much of the advertising, particularly that in print, centered on the charcoal filter and its effect on taste. The most extensively run and best remembered advertisement, however, was a television spot from the 1960s in which an off-screen narrator exhorted those on the street to \\"show us your Lark pack\\". Meanwhile, throughout the piece the William Tell Overture blared while the words \\"have a Lark, have a Lark, have a Lark today\\" were sung to the overture‚Äôs melody. Everyone it seemed had a pack of Larks and was only too happy to show them. Another notable advertisement campaign from the early 1970s featured a hot-air balloon with the Lark brand name and colours. The balloon was a symbol for the \\"smoothness\\" of Lark cigarettes. Lark was also advertised in the 1980s with James Bond style appearances by Timothy Dalton and Roger Moore in Japanese TV commercials. Future Bond Pierce Brosnan also advertised Larks in two commercials that aired only in Japan. In the late 1980s, Philip Morris allegedly spent $350.000 to have the Lark brand appear in the Licence to Kill film. =Parodies= * On George Carlin's album FM & AM, Carlin insinuates that \\"Show us your Lark\\" is a hidden sexual innuendo; he remarks, \\"Don't try that Lark thing in the Bowery; those guys will show you their Larks, man.\\" * A parody of the commercial was created by comedian Stan Freberg for Jeno's Pizza Rolls. In it, tuxedo-clad partygoers are asked to show their packages of frozen Jeno's Pizza Rolls and they do. Ultimately a Lark executive (Barney Phillips) complains about the use of the music followed by the appearance of the Lone Ranger and Tonto asking the Lark executive about the same thing. * A similar parody was presented in a fake commercial for Saturday Night Live during its first season, where the announcer urged everyone to \\"show us your guns\\", in a similar manner as the Lark commercial, minus the singing. The parody first aired on SNL's first episode on October 11, 1975. Markets Lark is mainly sold in the United States, but also was or still is sold in Brazil, Germany, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Taiwan, South Korea, Ecuador and Japan. ControversyCharcoal filter and health concerns= Because of its unique activated charcoal filter, from its inception Lark has been the subject of inquiry into whether it is safer or more harmful than cigarettes in general. According to Anne Landman with the American Lung Association of Colorado, \\"The technique used in the marketing of Lark through hospitals and the medical profession was exactly similar to that used in the marketing of Kent in 1952.\\" Ms. Landman's research, which began in 1998, further reveals that Liggett & Myer's marketing campaign several months before the release of the Surgeon General's 1964 Report on Smoking and Health was directed at creating the rumor that medical scientists endorsed Lark as the safest cigarette. This marketing technique is credited for Lark's sales surpassing those of Kent in the Buffalo area and nearly doing so in the Houston area. Perhaps the biggest controversy about the reputed safety of Lark cigarettes was created by the publication of It Is Safe to Smoke by scientist Lloyd Mallan. Mallan recounts the findings of numerous scientists who all conclude based on the research conducted that smoking can be rendered harmless or considerably less harmful if the cigarette is equipped with a charcoal filter. The only other brand in the United States at the time with a charcoal filter was Tareyton, whose filter had a different structure from Lark and was deemed to be less effective. Hawthorne Publishing, however, took the book off the market in 1967 after a congressional investigation was launched into allegations that the tobacco industry had financed it. Subsequent research questioned whether the charcoal filter might have actually made Lark a more dangerous cigarette. A paper published in March 1997 by J.L. Pauly, et al., offered the following conclusion: > \\"Charcoal granules are incorporated into cigarette filters to aid in > removing toxins in cigarette smoke. In studies of Lark, a popular American > cigarette with a charcoal filter, charcoal granules were observed on the > filter surface, and were released from the filter when the cigarettes were > smoked. During smoking, the toxin-containing charcoal granules are inhaled > or ingested. The specific adverse health effects of inhaling or ingesting > carbon granules have not been addressed; nevertheless, the smoker, as an > educated consumer, should be informed of the possible health risks.\\" =Charloal filter and decrease of cancer= In January 1964, Louis Fieser, a member of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Lung Cancer, said that Lark cigarettes were probably safer than all other brands. Fieser, Sheldon Emery Professor of Organic Chemistry, recommended that smokers who were unable to quit should switch to Larks. According to Fieser, the charcoal for the Lark filter was specially developed to screen out gases known to depress the action of cilia in the respiratory tract. While at the time Larks were the only cigarette to used this special charcoal, there was no reason why other cigarette manufacturers could not add the substance to their filters and thereby achieve the same probable level of safety as Larks. \\"Speaking as a scientist,\\" Fieser stated, \\"this filter represents a definite encouraging advance.\\" He emphasized, however, that at least 20 years would have to lapse before mortality statistics of the type reviewed by the Surgeon General's committee would be available on the new filter. Fieser said that he, at the time, smoked Larks and occasionally a pipe. Though he stated that the safest course of action would be to stop smoking he refused to say whether he had any plans to quit. The report of the Surgeon General's committee, of which Fieser is a member, concluded that \\"cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action.\\" SponsorshipAll Japan Grand Touring Car Championship= The 1996 F1 GTR of Team Lark on display. Lark was the main sponsor of the Team Goh team which featured two McLaren F1 GTR cars to race in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship under the name \\"Team Lark GTR\\". Debuting at the opening round at Suzuka Circuit, the Lark team took a 1-2 finish, with winners Naoki Hattori and Ralf Schumacher. At the following round at the Fuji Speedway, David Brabham and John Nielsen would take victory for the Lark McLaren. However, in the next two rounds, the Japanese rivals would overcome the McLarens, only to have Team Lark return to take victory in the final two rounds of the season. At the Sugo round, Lark badly damaged their one chassis, requiring them to borrow chassis #04R from GTC Competition as a replacement for the final JGTC round. With four victories on the season, Team Lark captured the GT500 teams championship ahead of factory squads from Toyota and Nissan. Team Lark would not return to defend their title in 1997, and no McLarens raced in the series. McLarens would return though in 1999 with Team Take One purchasing McLaren F1 GTR #19R, a 1997-spec car, for competition in GT500. The competition from Toyota, Honda, and Nissan had improved since the McLaren last raced, and therefore Team Take One struggled to be competitive, achieving only a best 9th place at Mine Circuit. =24 Hours of Le Mans= Team Goh also participated in the 1997 24 Hours of Le Mans with a Lark livery, but it was censored because France prohibited sponsorship of tobacco products in sports.

He was born in Chicago, Illinois. He studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he was awarded the Isaacs Scholarship in 1938-39 and the Coolbaugh Scholarship in 1939-1940. He also served as the President of the Art Students League of New York in 1940. His academic career was interrupted between 1941 and 1946 while he served in the U.S. Army with the 63rd Reconnaissance Troop in the European Theatre of Operations. After completing his B.F.A. at the Chicago Art Institute in 1946, Cohen briefly attended Drake University, where he studied Liberal Arts. At the University of Chicago, he completed residence work toward an M.A. and a Ph.D. in the History of Art from 1946-48. In 1948 Cohen joined the Northwestern University faculty as an instructor of art. He was promoted to assistant professor of art in 1952 and to associate professor in 1958. He became a full professor in 1963, a position he held until his retirement in 1984, when he became professor emeritus. As guest professor or guest artist, Cohen also taught at the Contemporary Art Workshop in Chicago in 1951, the Institute of Related Art in Wilmette in 1951, the Evanston Art Center from 1951‚Äì52, the Institute of Design, Illinois Institute of Technology from 1956‚Äì57, and the Minneapolis Museum of Art, 1963. At Northwestern University, Cohen was a President‚Äôs Fellow and Distinguished Faculty Lecturer. His numerous awards included the Copley Award, the National Foundation of the Arts Award, a Ford Arts Council Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship and the State of Illinois 150th Anniversary Award. Cohen worked in oils and mixed media. A Northwestern University ‚ÄúFaculty Profile‚Äù describes Cohen as \\"a surrealist\\" who \\"combines the metaphysical with the sensuous to express new realities of space, time, and the human figure\\".http://www.library.northwestern.edu/archives/findingaids/george_cohen.pdf Cohen was a founding member of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. In the mid-fifties, he was also a part of a ‚Äúnew Chicago School‚Äù which included artists Leon Golub, June Leaf and Cosmo Campoli. They organized annual ‚ÄúMomentum Exhibitions‚Äù that caught the notice of New York critics. (See clippings from Art News, October, 1955; Arts, January, 1955.) Cohen wrote many articles and reviews for various publications. He had many one-person shows and participated in numerous invitational exhibitions. His work can be found in permanent collections, including the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Carnegie Mellon Museum in Pittsburgh, the Minneapolis Museum of American Arts and the Hirschhorn Collection in Washington, D.C. Cohen was married to the painter Constance Teander Cohen, (February 11, 1921 - February 14, 1995). They often showed their work together in exhibits. He had a son, Paul E. Cohen and two daughters, Frances Tietov and Susan Evans. George Cohen became known in the forties and fifties for his paintings and board constructions with objects and mirrors affixed to them. He is considered a major influence on and harbinger of the Chicago Imagists, as well as an important contributor nationally to developments in painting in the fifties and sixties. He has been the recipient of many awards and prizes, including the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim, and his art is owned by private and corporate collectors as well as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. One of his key works, \\"The Serpent Chooses Adam and Eve\\" was at the '59 Invitational. Cohen has shown for many years with the Zabriskie Gallery and the Charles Alan Gallery in New York and with Richard L. Feigen in Chicago and New York. His most recent museum show was in 1981 at the Art Institute of Chicago, and in 1982 he exhibited his paintings at the Frumkin Struve Gallery in Chicago. Cohen and his wife, lived in an Evanston nineteenth-century house brimming with paintings, books, and musical instruments (two of their three children, Susan and Frances, are professional classical musicians).

The confederation included: Michele Zaza, a powerful Camorra boss affiliated with Cosa Nostra, the Gionta clan from Torre Annunziata, the Nuvoletta clan from Marano, a powerful Camorra clan also affiliated with Cosa Nostra and linked specifically to the Corleonesi, the D'Alessandro clan from Castellammare di Stabia, the Alfieri clan from Nola, led by Carmine Alfieri, the Galasso clan of Poggiomarino, led by Pasquale Galasso, the Giuliano clan led by Luigi Giuliano, the Vollaro clan from Portici, the Casalesi clan, led by Antonio Bardellino from San Cipriano d'Aversa also linked to Cosa Nostra, the Moccia clan from Afragola and the Ammaturo clan of Castellammare di Stabia. The war against Cutolo The war that ensued between the Nuova Camorra Organizzata and the Nuova Famiglia caused a huge number of victims. This caused in turn a greater attention from the Italian police organizations, pushing Cosa Nostra to accommodate an agreement between the two warring clans, hopefully favouring the Nuova Famiglia, which included a lot of former allies.Haycraft, John (1985). The Italian Labyrinth: Italy in the 1980s, London: Secker & Warburg It appears that Alfieri had already decided to eliminate the senior NCO leaders, in revenge for the murder of his brothers during the war. In November 1982, the NCO's financier, Alfonso Ferrara Rosanova, was murdered. When his deputy and main 'military' chief, Vincenzo Casillo was killed via car bomb in January 1983 by Alfieri's ally, Pasquale Galasso, it was clear that Raffaele Cutolo had lost the war. His power declined considerably. Not only Cutolo but many other Camorra gangs understood the shift in the balance of power caused by the death of Casillo. They abandoned the NCO and allied themselves with Alfieri.Stephen Gundle, Simon Parker, The New Italian Republic, pp. 240 The elimination of the key NCO figures not only marked the end of the NCO's defeat as a political and criminal force, but also the rise of Carmine Alfieri and the NF who, by now, virtually unopposed, replaced them as the main contact of the politicians and businessmen in Campania as well as other criminal organizations. These chain of killings, including that of Cutolo's son, Roberto Cutolo who was shot dead by members of the Fabbrocino clan on 24 December 1990, aged 25, coupled with the incarceration of many of its members brought an end to the Nuova Camorra Organizzata.Stephen Gundle, Simon Parker, The New Italian Republic, pp. 240 Internal war After the defeat of Cutolo, war broke out among the anti-NCO coalition, in particular between the Nuvoletta clan from Marano and Antonio Bardellino at the end of 1983. With Carmine Alfieri siding with Bardellino‚Äôs Casalesi clan. The war culminated in the Torre Annunziata's massacre of August 1984, which left eight people killed and 24 wounded among the Gionta clan allied with Nuvoletta. After the massacre and the murder of Ciro Nuvoletta two months earlier, the balance of power shifted in favour of Alfieri and Bardellino.Behan, See Naples and Die, pp. 127-28 The end On May 26, 1988, Antonio Bardellino was murdered by his right-hand man, Mario Iovine in his Brazilian home at B√∫zios, a beach side resort for the rich and famous in the State of Rio de Janeiro, as part of an internal feud within the Casalesi clan. Dopo un anno la conferma 'Bardellino e' stato ucciso', La Repubblica, July 25, 1989 In 1992, Pasquale Galasso decided to collaborate with justice, becoming the most important pentito inside the Camorra organization. After him, Carmine Alfieri was arrested and following Galasso, decided to collaborate with justice. Lorenzo Nuvoletta, because of a serious illness, after a time in jail, was granted house arrest.

As boss of the Alfieri clan, he was one of the most influential and powerful Camorra bosses from 1984 until his arrest in 1992.

The Camorra entered in his life when he was only seven. In 1953, he took an oath with his brother Salvatore, to avenge the killing of their father Antonio Alfieri. Three years later, in 1956, Salvatore Alfieri killed the murderer of his father. Alfieri clan In the 1960s Carmine was first arrested. In 1974, he was initiated in the Camorra as uomo d'onore (man of honour). In 1978 he was charged for homicide and in 1981 for mafia association.Barrese, Camorra politica pentiti, p. ??. In the 1980s he was among the founders of the Nuova Famiglia, which was opposed to the then dominant Nuova Camorra Organizzata of Raffaele Cutolo. The rivalry caused a ferocious war with a huge number of victims, including Carmine's brother Salvatore. The Alfieri clan of the 1980s and 1990s exhibited a hubris and a penchant for wanton violence that compared favorably with Cosa Nostra‚Äôs spectacular assassinations. According to police estimates, Alfieri‚Äôs killers alone counted as many as 500 murders during the decade 1983-93. For instance, Domenico Cuomo, Alfieri's main hitman confessed to have committed over 90 murders within the same period.The Business Of The Camorra , by Mike La Sorte, AmericanMafia.com, April 2005Behan, See Naples and Die, Google Print, p. 13. =Rise to power= Cutolo overplayed his hand in the Cirillo kidnap affair. His former political protectors turned and provided their support to Carmine Alfieri, his main rival in the bloody 1981-83 Camorra war between Cutolo‚Äôs Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) and the Nuova Famiglia. In November 1982, the NCO's financier, Alfonso Ferrara Rosanova, was murdered. When Cutolo‚Äôs deputy and main ‚Äòmilitary‚Äô chief, Vincenzo Casillo was killed via a car bomb in January 1983 by the allies of Alfieri, it was clear Cutolo not only had lost his political protection but the war as well. Many other Camorra gangs understood the shift in the balance of power caused by the death of Casillo. They abandoned the NCO and allied themselves with Alfieri.Behan, See Naples and Die, pp. 151-54 After the defeat of Cutolo, war broke out among the anti- NCO coalition, in particular between the Nuvoletta clan from Marano and Antonio Bardellino at the end of 1983. Alfieri sided with Bardellino's Casalesi clan. The war culminated in the Torre Annunziata's massacre of August 1984, which left eight people killed and 24 wounded among the Gionta clan allied with Nuvoletta. After the massacre and the murder of Ciro Nuvoletta two months earlier, the balance of power shifted in favour of Alfieri.Behan, See Naples and Die, pp. 127-28 In the first instance Alfieri and others were convicted for having organised the massacre and given life sentences. However, on appeal they were acquitted thanks to the intervention of politicians and the help of judge Armando Cono Lancuba.Behan, See Naples and Die, p. 237 Alfieri's Camorra is described as the \\"political Camorra\\" because of its ability to obtain public sector contracts through political contacts. Cutolo's \\"mass Camorra\\" of unemployed youth specializes in protection rackets, and Lorenzo Nuvoletta's \\"business Camorra\\" reinvested drug money into construction following the 1980 earthquake. The political Camorra was also innovatory because it tried to establish a federation between clans to overcome mutual suspicion and bloody feuds.Behan, See Naples and Die, Google Print, p. 255 =Arrest and turncoat= Alfieri, one of the most wanted men in Italy, was arrested in his pyjamas by Italian police on September 11, 1992, together with Vincenzo Cesarano and Marzio Sepe.

Kye monastery has a collection of ancient murals and books, including Buddha images.SurfIndia.com - Kye monastery There are three floors, the first one is mainly underground and used for storage. One room, called the Tangyur is richly painted with murals. The ground floor has the beautifully decorated Assembly Hall and cells for many monks. Kye Gompa now belongs to the Gelugpa sect, along with Tabo Monastery and Dhankar Gompa, one of three in Spiti. :The monastery of Kee, for instance, accommodates nearly 250 monks, who reside within the sacred walls throughout the year. Some monks go to South Indian Monasteries during winters, the rest of them stay inside the monastery walls. These monasteries have their regular heads; these heads are the reincarnations of Guru Rinpoche. The current head of Kee Monastery is from Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh. He is 19th birth of Guru Rinpoche. A celebration of its millennium was conducted in 2000 in the presence of the Dalai Lama.

McGuffey is best known as the creator of the McGuffey Readers, a hugely popular set of educational primers. The site, now a regional park known as the McGuffey Wildlife Preserve, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966. Description and history The William H. McGuffey Boyhood Home Site is located in a rural setting of northwestern Coitsville Township east of Youngstown, on the south side of McGuffey Road east of Ohio State Route 616. It is a basically rectangular parcel about in size. The parcel is basically flat, with a low ridge running north-south in its eastern part. The original log cabin built by Alexander McGuffey was probably located on that ridge, but there is scholarly disagreement over its precise location. The original property was first occupied by the McGuffey family as early as 1802, but the family did not purchase it until 1814. William McGuffey was born in Pennsylvania in 1800, and spent his youth on this property. McGuffey was a prominent proponent of public school education, and taught at Miami University for many years. While there, he published his series of McGuffey Readers, a series of grade school educational texts that were so widely used that they rivalled The Bible in sales. A structure at the site The 73-acre property of the McGuffey homestead that has survived subdivision was acquired by a nonprofit organization around the time it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966, and was donated to the county for use as a nature preserve in 1998.

It replaced the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service in 2009. The mission of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is to stimulate and fund the research and technological innovations that will enhance American agriculture and make it more productive and environmentally sustainable while ensuring the economic viability of agriculture and production. The Institute was developed as a result of a task force chaired by William Henry Danforth and appointed by then-Secretary of Agriculture Ann M. Veneman. The Danforth Task Force recommended that Congress authorize the creation of NIFA as a way to strengthen agriculture research and to attract additional highly competitive research scientists to this field of endeavor. A growing program in competitive research grants will be a hallmark of the new agency.http://www.danforthcenter.org/newsmedia/leaflet/Danforth_Leaflet_Nov_2009.pdf The creation of NIFA strengthened USDA's competitive research portfolio by replacing the National Research Initiative with the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative.

Since August 1992, he has been a pentito (a criminal turned state witnesses), collaborating with the Italian justice. He revealed many intricate secrets about the Camorra. This led to revelations from other pentiti allowing an insight into the Camorra from the insider's point of view. Early life and criminal career Galasso was born in Poggiomarino, near Naples. Belonging to a well- endowed family ‚Äì he studied medicine ‚Äì he entered criminality when he killed two Camorristi who were trying to kidnap his brother (or asking him the pizzo). Once imprisoned at Poggioreale, he became acquainted with numerous Camorristi and knew Raffaele Cutolo. He joined the Nuova Famiglia clan in the early 1980s and was soon protagonist of the bombing of Vincenzo Casillo, collaborator of Cutolo, the Nuova Famiglia's main rival. This murder is considered the beginning of the decline of Cutolo's Nuova Camorra Organizzata. During the war against the latter Galasso lost one brother. Galasso's girlfriend was Florinda Mirabile, the daughter of Mario Mirabile, a Camorra clan boss. After her father's murder, she asked Galasso for help obtaining a gun to avenge the murder. He procured a precision shotgun for her, but the vendetta was never carried out. She would eventually turn state witness against the 'Ndrangheta in 1995, and receive a light sentence in return.Mafia Women: The Affirmation of a Female Pseudo-Subject. The Case of the Ndrangheta, by Renate Siebert, in: Fiandaca, Women and the Mafia, Google Print, p. 26 Arrest and turning state witness In 1992, he was arrested and, after a short period, became a pentito. Galasso confessed to over twenty murders and revealed the whereabouts of where the victims were buried. His revelations shocked Italy, when he mentioned high level members of Christian Democrat Party (then Italy's most important party) having links with the Camorra, such as the former Interior Minister Antonio Gava. Gava, \\"il referente\\" della camorra, Corriere della Sera, April 9, 1993 According to Galasso, the Camorra and politics were not separate worlds. Each Camorra clan had a 'prime political sponsor' and in common agreement politicians and criminal bosses would decide who should be elected to the principal political positions, who should obtain public contracts and which sites should be earmarked for construction.Politicians and godfathers: Mafia and political corruption in Italy, by Alberto Vannucci, in Della Porta & M√©ny, Democracy and Corruption in Europe, Google Print, p. 58 While testifying about the links between the Camorra and DC, Galasso said that following the election of the town council of Poggiomarino, he was asked to intervene with a local councillor to persuade him with all the weight of his \\"Camorra fame\\" to ally himself with Antonio Gava who had promised him the position of mayor. Galasso's reticence was soon overcome by the direct intervention of his boss, Carmine Alfieri. \\"He assured me that Gava was on our side and that I couldn't deny him that favour\\", Galasso said. The politician was then persuaded to side with Gava, even though he disliked him.Politicians and godfathers: Mafia and political corruption in Italy, by Alberto Vannucci, in Della Porta & M√©ny, Democracy and Corruption in Europe, Google Print, p. 62. Galasso further continued, \\"For the duration of that government, I was the tongue convincing the one, who didn't want to renounce his position as mayor, and the other, who wanted to occupy it, to remain united.\\"Della Porta & Vannucci, Corrupt Exchanges, Google Print, p. 224. His villa in the town of Scafati is now home to a barracks of the Guardia di Finanza. A biography has been written on Galasso's life entitled \\"Io, Pasquale Galasso: da studente in medicina a capocamorra\\" by Gigi Di Fiore, edited by T. Pironti, Naples, in 1994. Legacy According to historian Tom Behan, \\"Pasquale Galasso's revelations are probably more important for understanding the Camorra than Tommaso Buscetta's have been in terms of understanding the Mafia. When Buscetta decided to cooperate with the authorities, he had been living abroad for several years, away from the nerve centres of power. Galasso had been in the eye of the storm until his arrest, and had arguably played a more important role within the Camorra than Buscetta had within the Mafia.\\"Behan, See Naples and Die, p. 301].

M. Kaye. It concerns Princess Amethyst Alexandra Augusta Araminta Adelaide Aurelia Anne of Phantasmorania--Amy for short--who has been given the \\"gift\\" of ordinariness. Like the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty, the story begins with the birth of a princess and the arrival of fairies--invited against the king's better judgment, for the sake of tradition--to give her gifts. The fairy godmother Crustacea, however, tells her, \\"You shall be Ordinary!\\" Unlike her six older sisters, Amy grows up with mousy hair, freckled, and plain, preferring playing in the woods to wearing fine clothes. When she finds out that her parents want to hire a dragon so that a foreign prince can \\"rescue\\" her from it and thereby \\"win her hand in marriage\\", she climbs down the wisteria vine outside her window, runs away to live in the Forest of Faraway, and makes animal friends, Peter Aurelious the crow and Mr. Pemberthy the squirrel. Realizing that her clothes have grown shabby and told by a fairy godmother that to buy new clothes she needs money and to get money she needs a job, she becomes fourteenth assistant kitchen-maid in the castle of the King of Ambergeldar, where she meets Peregrine, a man-of-all-work. They become friends; he eventually finds out that she is a princess, and she finds out that he is King Algernon of Ambergeldar, who, like her, hates his given name, and they marry.

Tradition names him as a son of King Ultach of Ulster. He later migrated to Italy, where he was appointed as Bishop of Lucca. The Basilica of San Frediano in the city is dedicated to him, as are churches in Florence. Biography Fridianus is venerated as a Christian saint of the 6th century and as a bishop of Lucca. The Basilica di San Frediano in Lucca is dedicated to him. According to Catholic tradition, he was a prince of Ireland. He went on a pilgrimage to Rome, and later became a hermit on Mount Pisano, near Lucca. The Catholic Encyclopedia states: ‚ÄúRemarkable for sanctity and miracles was St. Fridianus (560-88), son of Ultonius, King of Ireland, or perhaps of a king of Ulster (Ultonia).‚Äù According to his legend, Fridianus was brought up trained in Irish monasticism, and was taught by St Enda and St Colman. He was later ordained a priest. During his pilgrimage to Rome, he decided to dedicate his life to God in solitude and became a hermit, living on Mount Pisano, a mountainous area between the cities of Lucca and Pisa. In 556 AD, Pope John II persuaded him to take the bishopric of Lucca, which Fridianus accepted. He would often return to the countryside to spend his time in quiet prayer and solitude. St. Fridianus changing the course of the River Serchio. From the Uffizi, Florence, Italy. Fridianus became known for working miracles. His most famous one is considered a legend. The River Serchio, which ran past Lucca, often flooded the nearby city. The citizens became so distressed that they asked the bishop to come to their aid. Armed with a rake, Fridianus walked down to the river bank, and, strengthened by the prayers of the faithful, he commanded the waters of the Serchio to follow his rake. To the amazement of those gathered, the river followed Fridianus as he cut a path away from the city and the cultivated land on its outskirts. During his episcopate, the city of Lucca was attacked by the Lombards. The cathedral was burnt down and Fridianus rebuilt it. He may also have founded a group of eremitical canon priests; these canons merged with the Canons Regular of the Lateran in 1507. Fridianus had a church built on the spot of the present basilica, dedicated to St. Vincent, a martyr from Zaragoza, Spain. When Fridianus was buried in this church, the church was renamed as Ss. Frediano and Vincenzo. The church is now a major landmark and is regularly visited. St. Fridianus is often confused with St. Finnian of Moville.

Excessively rich fuel mixture or incomplete combustion allows a certain amount of fuel to pass down between the pistons and cylinder walls and dilute the engine oil. It is more common in situations where fuel is injected at a very high pressure, such as in a direct-injected diesel engine. When a mixture of air and fuel enters the cylinder of an engine, it is entirely possible for condensation of fuel to occur on the cooler parts of the cylinders. The condensate may wash the lubricating oil from the cylinder walls, travel past the piston rings and collect in the oil pan, thus increasing wear and also diluting the lubricating oil. Since the less volatile components of the fuel will have the greatest tendency to condense, the degree of crankcase-oil dilution is directly related to the end volatility temperatures of the mixture.  Causes  Crankcase dilution occurs when the fuel oil from the engine gets into the lube oil of the engine. This can be caused by the walls being wetted due to the fuel condensing in the cylinder. If the engine is cold, or there is an excess amount of cooling around the cylinder, the fuel oil will condense and have a higher chance to end up in the crankcase. Another way that the fuel oil can end up in the crankcase is because there is too much wear on the piston compression rings. The job of the piston compression ring is to keep the oil and the exhaust gases from entering the crankcase, but when there is too much wear it can no longer do its job. Other than the piston rings, ‚Äúblow-by‚Äù gases can push the fuel oil past the rings and into the crankcase. ‚ÄúBlow-by‚Äù gases are a mix of fuel oil and exhaust gases that push past the piston rings. Crankcase dilution is caused more when the lube oil is fresher. Another cause of crankcase dilution is a slow or delayed injection cycle. This causes the timing to be thrown off and the oil is most likely to enter the crankcase at this point. Water and dirt can also further the effects of crankcase dilution. Also, soot getting into the lube oil can cause crankcase dilution, but there are additives that can keep the soot at the top of the lube oil. Soot that collects in the crankcase fully goes away when the lube oil is changed out of the engine. Additives can be added to the oil to cause the soot to stay on top of the engine lube oil. These substances getting into the lube oil can accelerate the effects of crankcase dilution. Piston compression ring wear.  Effects  Fuel oil in the crankcase lube oil can cause the oil to chemically degrade. This means that the oil loses viscosity and is less effective when lubricating. The loss of viscosity of the lube oil causes the oil to not fully connect and lubricate the moving parts of the engine. This lack of lubrication can cause the engine to have an increased amount of wear over time.  Reducing Crankcase dilution  There are many ways to reduce the amount of crankcase dilution that occurs in an engine. One of the ways is to counteract the loss of viscosity by using a heavier oil. The viscosity that they recommended was 500-575 sec. Another thing that can reduce the effects of crankcase dilution is changing the piston compression rings when they become worn. This would reduce the amount of blow-by gases and overall reducing the effects. Another thing that can be done is to change the car's oil regularly to avoid the wear on your engine from crankcase dilution.  Detecting Crankcase dilution  Detecting crankcase dilution can help reduce the effects that it will have on your engine. There are many ways to detect crankcase dilution. One of the ways is to check the flash point of the oil and compare it to the brand of lube oil. The way to test the flash point of the oil is to manually take a sample and use a testing kit. When the fuel leaks into the lube oil the chemical makeup is different than the normal lube oil. Another way to test for crankcase dilution is to use a SAW to test the concentration of fuel oil in the crankcase oil. SAW stands for surface acoustic wave.  Biodiesel and crankcase dilution  Biodiesel is vegetable oil or animal fats that are mixed with lipids to produce alcohol that can be burned. The alcohol that is produced is the biodiesel. Engines that run on biodiesel have the same problem as regular fuel engines. The biodiesel fuel finds its way into the crankcase of the engine and mixes with the lube oil. When biodiesel leaks into the crankcase, it has more problems than with more traditional fuel. The biodiesel has a higher boiling point than regular fuel and is less likely to evaporate out causing it to stay in the crankcase for a longer period of time. Also, the longer that the biodiesel stays inside of the crankcase, it degrades the organic acids in the lube oil and then reacts with the crankcase wall. After reacting, it causes deposits of the reacted biodiesel in the walls of the crankcase . There are ways that these effects can be reduced. Chevron created additives to reduce the effects of the biodiesel.

The brand, part of Johnson Outdoors‚Äô Outdoor Equipment group, is headquartered in Binghamton, New York. Johnson Outdoors is based in Racine, Wisconsin. Products marketed under the Eureka! brand include tents, canopies, sleeping bags, camp mats, camp furniture and outdoor living shelters. History The Eureka Tent & Awning Company was founded sometime before 1895 in Binghamton, New York.name=\\"ReferenceA\\" DeMartine, Robert B. to Abraham Lincoln School, Binghamton, NY. (1966-09-15). The company's first workshop on Binghamton's Commercial Avenue originally produced custom tents, awnings, wagon covers, horse blankets, and flags. The company employed early manufacturing processes, such as using dies to cut stars and sewing together strips of red and white bunting to make American flags. Eureka fashioned its first awnings out of unfinished natural white cotton duck and designed them to maximize the amount of light allowed into the storefront while still providing adequate shade to passers-by. Eureka's earliest tents, assembled from untreated white army duck, were so sturdy that one completely usable early Eureka tent still hung in the company's headquarters nearly one hundred years later.Johnson Worldwide Associates North America (1994). \\"Eureka Tent and Awning Opens in Binghamton,\\" The Sporting Gazette. I: 2. In 1910, pioneering businessmen, Arthur D. Legg and Walter A. Dickerman, purchased the burgeoning company from its original owners.http://outdoorinov8.com/eurekahistory.html Legg's son, Arthur Carl Legg, bought out Dickerman's interest in 1925 and the company continued under the Legg family's direct leadership for the next fifty-six years. In 1930, the Leggs purchased the former Chenango Canal mule barn in Binghamton, which they converted into Eureka's first factory. By World War II, the Leggs had expanded Eureka to include five New York factories. In the 1940s, Eureka began to manufacture party tents for special occasions, fairs, and college commencements. The company supplied the design and production for what became known as \\"tent cities,\\" such as when approximately one thousand IBM salesmen met with IBM founder Thomas J. Watson, Sr. in 1946. Eureka tents for this meeting included sleeping tents with wooden floors, mess tents, product display tents, portrait-taking tents, and tents for shoe-shining, all of which spanned of land at the Hundred Percent Club in Endicott, New York.Watson, Jr., Thomas J. (2000). Father, Son & Co.: My Life at IBM and Beyond. New York: Bantam: 157. . During World War II, Eureka manufactured primarily all-purpose tents for the armed forces, which were used as hospital tents, barracks, and mess halls.\\"DeMartine Elected Eureka President.\\" Canvas Products Review (May 1959): 12. After the war, the company consolidated its factories to one expanded factory and became a wholesale manufacturer of canvas products and a supplier of industrial canvas and other textiles. In the 1950s, Eureka's trailer awnings experienced increased demand when the soldiers‚Äô return led to the subsequent housing shortage.http://eurekapartytents.com/About-Eureka Due to this demand, Eureka began distributing its products through sporting good stores, Army and Navy stores, and department stores throughout the United States and in several foreign countries. In 1959, Arthur C. Legg stepped down to become chairman of Eureka's board and the board elected Legg's son-in-law Robert B. DeMartine to the position of company president. DeMartine, then president of the Canvas Goods Association, had at that time been with the company for eight years. During the 1960s, Eureka progressed beyond manufacturing sturdy but heavy canvas to market to the burgeoning outdoor camping industry. Lightweight cotton cloth tents accounted for 90% of the company's sales, which were strongly supported by news of Eureka's role in the first all-American Mount Everest expedition and the development of the first free-standing, quick-to-set-up tent, the Draw-Tite.Platsky, Jeff (1982-10-03). \\"Eureka treks for tent sales,\\" The Sunday Press (Binghamton, NY). 8E. Towards the end of the decade, Eureka experimented with making lightweight tents that did a better job than the cotton tents of holding up to the elements and produced the Mt. Katahdin, one of the first high-volume double-wall construction nylon tent coated with waterproof urethane. In 1973, Johnson Wax Associates (later Johnson Worldwide Associates and Johnson Outdoors, Inc.), a subsidiary of the then-titled Johnson Wax (now S.C. Johnson, Inc.) of Racine, Wisconsin, purchased Eureka and all of its facilities. The company continued operation in Binghamton under DeMartine, posting record sales that year.DeMartine, Robert (1973). \\"Eureka Tent Sets 78-Year Record.\\" The Binghamton Press. Eureka's highlight in the 1970s was the development of the Timberline model, the first free-standing lightweight backpacking tent in the industry; and because of its adoption and use by many young scouts during this time period, the Timberline is somewhat visually iconic to the Boy Scouts of America.https://gearjunkie.com/eureka-boy-scout-gear As the backpacking and \\"back to nature\\" camping boom of the 1970s progressed, the company grew further. In 1980, Johnson Wax Associates consolidated three of its holdings, Eureka Tent & Awning Company (now just Eureka! Tent, Inc.); Camp Trails Company of Phoenix, Arizona, a backpack and sleeping bag manufacturer; and Silva of LaPorte, Indiana, a compass and cross-country ski manufacturer, into Johnson Camping, Inc., which was then headquartered in Eureka's head office in Binghamton. Johnson Wax Associates named Eureka's DeMartine president of the new conglomerate and through Johnson Camping, Eureka expanded from 300 to 500 employees and from three to five plants in New York, Arizona, Indiana, and Canada.Demo, Lori (1981-04-17). \\"DeMartine retires at Johnson Camping,\\" The Evening Press (Binghamton, NY). 9-B.

Although the team did not reach the summit of Mount Makalu on this expedition due to illness, the weather, and a minor accident, the team spent more than six months living and performing laboratory experiments in the Eureka Draw-Tite tents on the Himalayan mountains. These four-man and two-man Eureka Draw-Tite tents, proven before the expedition during the U.S. Navy's Operation Deep Freeze to endure temperatures of up to -102Àö Fahrenheit, withstood the expedition and remained in \\"excellent\\" and entirely usable condition even two years later.Blanchard, Robert L. to Mr. W.

The \\"argument\\" at the beginning of the play refers to it as the Lidiades (line 3, a play on Heroides), which the manuscripts gloss as comedia de Lidia facta (a comedy made about Lidia) and which its English translator gives as Adventures of Lidia.Elliot, 126 and 133n3. Lidia was long ascribed to Matthieu de Vend√¥me, but in 1924 Edmond Faral, in his study of Latin \\"fabliaux\\", discounted this hypothesis. More recently, scholars have argued in favour of the authorship of the cleric Arnulf of Orl√©ans, which now seems secure.Elliot, xlv. The play was probably composed sometime shortly after 1175. Compared with the other elegiac comedies, Lidia is not as dependent on Ovid. It is dark and cynical in its view of human nature, even misogynistic. Lidia, the title character, is portrayed as a complete brute, sexually mischievous, faithless, cruel, and completely self-centred. Arnulf is explicit when he claims that Lidia is just a typical woman (line 37). In style, Lidia is highly rhetorical. Bruno Roy called it \\"the apotheosis of the pun\\".Roy, 266. Lidia's name is often punned with ludus (game) and ludere (play), often with connotations of deception or sexual activity. Women are the virus that destroys virum (man, virility). Lidia would be unsatisfied even with ten (decem) men, a pun on her husband's name, Decius. The puns, though fashionable in the late twelfth century, make elegance in translation very difficult.Elliot, xlvi. Lidia is preserved in two fourteenth-century manuscripts. One of them may have been copied by the hand of Giovanni Boccaccio. Regardless, he certainly borrowed the tale for his Decameron, 7.9. His major alteration was the name of Lidia's husband, changed from Decius to Nicostrato. Geoffrey Chaucer also borrowed aspects of Lidia for \\"The Merchant's Tale\\", one of The Canterbury Tales. Story The comedy is divided into three parts: a short \\"argument\\" explaining the nature and purpose of the work, a brief prologue laying out the characters and the situation, and the story itself. In the argument Arnulf claims that he is writing to improve upon his previous comedy about \\"the sportive knight\\", Miles gloriosus. He has depicted \\"all female wiles worthy of note\\" so that you \\"may flee forewarned: after all, you too may have a Lidia in your life\\" (lines 5-6). A moralistic or didactic purpose was often given in the Middle Ages to justify the production of eroticised or sexualised literature. The prologue begins with a pun on one of the main characters, Pyrrhus, the loyal knight of Lidia's husband, the duke Decius, and the Latin word for pear tree, pirus. The pun is accommodated in English by use of \\"Pearus\\" for \\"Pyrrhus\\". A pear was a common phallic symbol from antiquity to the Middle Ages.According to Elliot, 146n34, citing Du Cange, \\"pear\\" can mean \\"testicle\\", as when Lusca asks Pearus to \\"strike that pear [the fruit] with a better one\\". Another elegiac comedy, Alda, also about a character named Pyrrhus, involves the same pun on pirus for both \\"pear tree\\" and \\"testis/penis\\". According to Vasv√°ri, 9 and n9, this \\"protracted botanical symbolism\\" dates back at least to Classical Latin and forward as far as Chaucer and Boccacio. For its use in antiquity, see James N. Adams (1982), Latin Sexual Vocabulary (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press). For its use in Clig√®s, see L. Polak (1972), \\"Clig√®s, F√©nice, et l'arbre d'amour\\", Romania, 93:303-16. The dramatist is poking fun at Pyrrhus when he refers to \\"the pears fallen from the pear tree\\" (line 8). The references to the \\"jealous one\\" in the prologue are probably a reference to Matthieu de Vend√¥me and his rivalry with Arnulf. The tale begins by describing Lidia's dissatisfaction with her marriage. She is enamored of Pearus and whenever he passes she pretends to faint, his name gets stuck in her throat (which, given its phallic symbolism, is an innuendo for oral sex), and when she lies in her bed alone she is pleased that Decius is away. She then concocts a plan to test Pearus. She sends her elderly messenger Lusca (the one-eyed) to tell Pearus how she dies for him, would willingly give herself to him, and is unfaithful to her husband. Shocked, Pearus rationalises that it is a test of his loyalty planned by his master, Decius, and proclaims that just as Lidia is loyal to the duke, so is Pearus. What follows is a diatribe from Lusca on the evil of women, the promiscuity of Lidia, and the decline of the state of marriage. She decides, however, that her interests are best served by Lidia's continued infidelity, since a disloyal wife is freer with her husband's wealth. When Lusca approaches Pearus a second time, the knight is moved by the story of Hippolytus to test Lusca's allegation that Decius is a fool whom Lidia controls and deceives at will. He devises three tests for Lidia: she must kill the duke's prized falcon to prove she can deceive him, she must pluck five hairs from his beard, and she must extract one of his teeth. Each of these tests is a test of virility, since the falcon, the beard, and the tooth could all be symbols for male sexuality in the Middle Ages.Elliot, 145n23. In the following scene, Lusca relays Pearus' challenge to Lidia. Lidia, dressed \\"sumptuously\\", then brazenly enters the noisy hall where Decius is holding court, makes an impassioned speech accusing Decius of preferring the hunting grounds to her bedchamber, and grabbing the falcon from its perch, wrings its neck in front of all. Then, laughing, she nuzzles up to Decius and plucks five hairs from his beard, claiming that they were white, making him appear older than he was. The ruse to take Decius' tooth takes days of planning. Lidia eventually has the youthful cupbearers turn their heads to the side as they serve the wine, in the belief that they have bad breath. Then, at the banquet, she loudly proclaims that they turn aside because Decius has bad breath. Pearus is then summoned to help remove the duke's offending bad tooth. Amazed, Pearus then concedes to Lidia's newest wish: to be caught \\"in flagrante delicto\\" by the duke. The plan is simple. Lidia feigns illness and the four named characters make a trip to a garden to help relieve her. When they arrive at a pear tree, Decius sends Pearus up it to fetch some fruit. While in the tree the knight, feigning modesty, pretends that he can see the duke and Lidia in the act of intercourse. Lidia explains that it is an illusion caused by the height. Decius and Pearus promptly switch places to test the illusion. While Pearus and Lidia have sex, the duke believes he is being tricked by the pear tree. When he climbs down, he orders the tree cut down, at Lidia's request, so that it will not deceive others. References *Elliot, Alison Goddard (1984). Seven Medieval Latin Comedies.

The Farim phosphate rock deposit had estimated resources of more than 166 Mt at a grade of 29% P2O5. Red Back Mining Inc. through its subsidiary Champion Industrial Minerals (CIM) held a mining lease and after completing a technical and market evaluation in 2003, the company concluded that the project had advanced to a stage where it required a level of developmental, operational, and marketing expertise that was beyond CIM's capacity; since that time, the company has attempted to either locate a suitable partner to develop the Farim deposit or to sell it. Over the past 10 years, licences changed hands between companies for reasons similar to those advanced by CIM, i.e. technical inability to perform required work. More recently, the licence has been held by GB Minerals which signed in 2009 a production agreement with the Guinea-Bissau government.

Once the lesser estate comes to an end (the lease expires or the life estate tenant dies), the property automatically reverts (hence reversion) back to the grantor. A reversion interest is logically similar, but not legally identical, to the rights retained by someone who lends his property to another for a limited time. Although the bailee has the right to possess the property during the limited duration, these rights are neither permanent nor exclusive. When the time comes, the property rights of possession will terminate and return to the holder of the reversion. Reversions are commonly created in real property transactions, particularly during lease arrangements as well as devise (the transfer of real property through a will). In the context of a will, a testator may devise a simple life estate to a devisee. The testator may retain the reversion in the estate or give it to another individual. The owner of the life estate will retain ownership of the property during the devisee's life, and may freely alienate this interest. However, upon the death of the devisee the life estate will terminate and ownership of the real property will fully vest in the holder of the reversion. A tenancy for years is a simple illustration of a reversion interest in the context of leasing arrangements. An owner of real property becomes a lessor by transferring a bundle of rights - including a right of entry - to the lessee for a certain period of time. The lessor typically retains a reversion interest in the property which will mature after the lease expires. A common example of this transaction is the leasing of an apartment to a tenant for a one-year period. When the lease expires, the rights of the lessee are terminated and exclusive ownership of the property returns to the lessor. Reversion should not be confused with the possibility of reverter created in the grant of a fee simple determinable. Although both result in the return of the land to the original grantor or his heirs, reversions occur upon the natural expiration of the grantee's estate, while the possibility of reverter actively ends the grantee's otherwise-indefinite estate as a consequence of the grantee's failure to comply with the condition contained in the grant. Unlike some other future interests, reversions have always been fully alienable.

After the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, a new wave of immigrants came from Palestine to Jordan increasing the number of Armenians to about 10,000. However starting in the 1950s, and particularly after the 1967 Arab- Israeli Six-Day War, Jordan witnessed the emigration of many Armenians to Australia, Canada and the United States a trend that continued in the 1970s, reducing the numbers of Jordanian Armenians to about 3,000. The majority of these Armenians are the descendants of survivors from the Armenian Genocide during World War I who were deported from the Ottoman Empire in Anatolia and Cilicia or fled to Syria and then Jordan. The early Armenian refugees in Jordan resided mainly in places like Ma'an, Shobak, Al Karak and Madaba and Russeifa. Nowadays, the majority of the Armenians lives in the capital Amman, with a few families in Irbid, Aqaba, Madaba and Zarqa. Armenians have worked in photography, fashion, car mechanics and in professional businesses and small trade. Most Armenian organizations and schools and religious structures are located in Amman's Jabal Al-Ashrafieh neighborhood also commonly called the Armenian Neighborhood (in pronounced Hayy al-Arman). Religion While most Armenians have now moved out of the Armenian quarter in Amman, the Armenian quarter currently comprises two Armenian churches. Armenians in Jordan are mainly followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church, under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The patriarch of Jerusalem assigns a bishop assigned for the Jordanian diocese. A small minority of Armenians in Jordan belongs to the Armenian Catholic Church. The churches: * Armenian Apostolic Church (Hayasdanyayts Arakelagan) St. Thaddeus Church (based in Amman) - St. Thaddeus Armenian Apostolic Church in Amman serves the Armenian Apostolic community, whereas the Armenian Catholics have their own parish in the Armenian quarter in Jabal Al-Ashrafieh in Eastern Amman. * Armenian Apostolic Church (Hayasdanyayts Arakelagan) St. Garebed Church} (based in Baptism Site Jordan River). * Hay Gatogheege Armenian Catholic Church of St. Sahag and Mesrob (based in Amman).

Amman is host to many Armenian institutions, long-running schools and cultural associations. Armenian students, who graduate from those community schools, can immediately enter the Jordanian High school system, after passing the elementary school classes. First Armenian school was founded in Jabal Al-Natheef in Amman . Called Hetoumyan Azkayeen Varjaran, it operated in the 1930s. Another smaller school operated in Russeifa founded by Samuel Agha Serpekian. Currently, two Armenian elementary schools operate in Amman: *Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU's) Gulbenkian Youzbeshian Varjaran (school) founded 1962.

The name Marshalls dates back to 1213 when Gilbert, son of Roger Marschal is recorded as leasing land in Havering to the house of Canons at St Bernard, and in 1321 Richard le Marescall owned land near the eventual site of the house. Marshalls was situated roughly where the playground of the current St Edwards' C of E Primary school is now, and at its greatest the surrounding estate was approximately bounded by the modern roads of Main Road, North Street, Pettits Lane, and Pettits Boulevard. Buildings There is no record of any particularly grand or notable property associated with Marshalls. By about 1610 it was described as a messuage with 40 acres and was still described as ‚Äúthat messuage or tenement commonly called or known by the name Marshalls‚Äù in 1746. The house was considerably improved by Jackson Barwis, the High Sheriff of Essex, who lived there until his death in 1809. It is essentially this house that Pevsner in his book on Essex describes as having a \\"stuccoed Georgian five-bay front (Tuscan porch) and gabled back parts\\", while the sale catalogue from 1816 describes it as ‚ÄúA plain neat edifice, brick, extremely well erected...(with)...a portico entrance to the principal or ground storey....‚Äù. The house was demolished in 1959 as it was ‚Äúnot of historical or architectural value‚Äù. Owners and tenants As described above, Gilbert Marschal leased land in Havering to the Augustinian Canons of the Hospice of St Bernard in Switzerland, of which nearby Hornchurch Priory was a dependency. The land continued in the family into the 14th Century and then passed to the Carew family. Edward Carew son of John Carew, the deputy Steward of the Royal Library of Havering, is recorded as a past owner in 1610; at this date the property belonged to a ‚Äúgentleman named Thorowgood‚Äù, probably George Thorowgood who owned Hornchurch Hall. On 20 January 1694 Simon Thorowgood leased Marshalls to Thomas Scawen, but then sold the property to Russell Alsopp in 1704. When Alsopp died he owed much money to Sir William Scawen, Governor of the Bank of England from 1697 to 1699 and there followed a lengthy legal argument over ownership of the property. In 1748 Marshalls passed from John Leigh to Mary Frost, and later passed to Jackson Barwis who was High Sheriff of Essex for 1796, the property remaining in the possession of his widow until her death on 24 December 1815. The house was then bought by local banker Rowland Stephenson of the bank Remington, Stephenson & Company in 1816. During his time Marshalls was described as ‚ÄòPrincely‚Äô, but Stephenson, MP for Leominster had embezzled the bank of nearly half a million pounds and in 1828 he fled the country. Marshalls was then bought by Hugh McIntosh, who also owned the Manor of Havering and passed to his nephew David McIntosh who lived there until 1850 when he moved to the newly built mansion in Havering Park, although he had been letting Marshalls for some years. In 1855 the young Octavia Hill visited the family of Daniel Harrison who were living there by then. She brought some of the poor children she had been teaching in London, to give them a taste of the countryside with which they were so unfamiliar.

Parker House is located on the Ohio River waterfront, north of the center of Ripley. It is in an relatively isolated setting, apart from other residences in Ripley, on what was once a partly industrial property. The building is a two-story brick structure, with a side gable roof that has stepped gables. A lower two-story wood frame ell extends to the rear. The front facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the rightmost bay, topped by a transom window. Windows are plain sash, set in rectangular openings with stone lintels. The house is all that is left of a larger manufacturing complex built about 1853 for the business of John Parker, which originally included a machine shop, blacksmithy, and foundry. Most of these facilities were damaged or destroyed by a fire in 1889, and were not rebuilt by Parker. Ripley was a hotbed of abolitionist sentiment in the antebellum period, and it was thus a well-known target for slaves escaping across the river from Kentucky, a slave state. Although Parker's property was close to the river, he apparently rarely sheltered slaves in his home, its remote location equally attractive to fugitive slaves and slave catchers. Parker was born into slavery, but was given an education by his physician owner, and was able to purchase his freedom. He regularly crossed into Kentucky in search of escaping slaves, and brought them into the network of Underground Railroad supporters in Ripley. The property was sold by Parker's wife not long after his death, and was used in support of a coal shipping operation for many years. In the 1990s it was purchased by a local nonprofit and rehabilitated for use as a museum.

The painting focuses on a classical subject like many of his works from that decade, in this case the story of the execution of Socrates as told by Plato in his Phaedo.Lajer-Burcharth, Necklines,57. In this story, Socrates has been convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and introducing strange gods, and has been sentenced to die by drinking poison hemlock. Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly.De Nanteuil, Jacques- Louis David,64. The Phaedo depicts the death of Socrates and is also Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito. In the painting, an old man in a white robe sits upright on a bed, one hand extended over a cup, the other gesturing in the air. He is surrounded by other men of varying ages, most showing emotional distress, unlike the stoic old man. The young man handing him the cup looks the other way, with his face in his free hand. Another young man clutches the thigh of the old man. An elderly man sits at the end of the bed, slumped over and looking in his lap. To the left, other men are seen through an arch set in the background wall. Painting Although he consulted Father Adry, a scholar on the subject, David's depiction of Socrates death contains many historical inaccuracies. He removed many characters originally described in the dialogues of Plato. However, he included Apollodorus, the man leaning against the wall just within the arch, even though he is said to have been sent away by Socrates for displaying too much grief. David also historically misrepresented the ages of many of the pupils of Socrates, including Plato. Plato would have been a young man at the time of Socrates's death, but in this painting he is the old man sitting at the foot of the bed. Even the face of Socrates is much more idealized than the classical bust that is typically used as a reference portrait of Socrates. This underlines that Socrates life is projected out of Plato's mind, whereas the old Plato idealises Socrates. Thus, the painting can rather be seen as an analysis than a failed historic depiction. David uses color to highlight the emotion in this painting. The shades of red are more muted on the edges of the painting and become more vibrant in the center, culminating in the dark red robe of the man holding the cup of poison, generally taken as offering the cup to Socrates rather than receiving it after Socrates had consumed its contents. The only two serene men, Socrates and Plato, are garbed in a contrasting bluish-white. The more muted color scheme of this painting may be a response to critics of David's Oath of the Horatii, who called his colors \\"garish\\". David signed this painting in two places; he put his full signature under Crito, the young man clutching Socrates's thigh, and his initials under Plato. David's signature placement often had symbolic meaning ‚Äì for example, in his painting of Stanis≈Çaw Kostka Potocki, David signed in the collar of the dog that is barking at the sitter. In Death of Socrates, his signatures also have meaning. His initials under Plato are a reference to the fact that the story comes from Plato, a thanks for the inspiration. His fuller signature under Crito means that this is the character whom the artist identifies most with. This may be a reference for Crito's position in the composition ‚Äì clutching Socrates's thigh. In this way, David would be seen as a man who likewise clutches at the morals and values that Socrates represents. There is some controversy as to the origins of the painting. Vidal states that \\"the younger of two sons commissioned David's Death of Socrates in 1786\\",Vidal, \\"David among the Moderns\\", 598. but Bordes says that \\"the drawing for Socrates‚Ä¶bears the unexpected date of 1782.\\" However, it is possible that the commission in 1786 was for a painting that David had already conceived as early as 1782, and Bordes does acknowledge that the date is an addition to the drawing.Bordes, \\"David\\", 154. Regardless of when it was originally conceived, the painting was completed in 1787, in Paris. It was during David's first trip to Rome that he began to study the depiction of funerary scenes and to draw many examples. Many of David's major works stem from these funerary drawings.De Caso, \\"Jacques-Louis David and the Style 'All' antica, 686. In this painting, David examines a philosopher's approach to death. Socrates is stoic and calm because he sees death as a separate, actual realm, a different state of being from life but not an end to being.Maleuvre, \\"David Painting Death\\", 25. In fact, in Phaedo, Socrates seems more concerned with how Crito will handle his death than with his own well-being.Plato, Phaedo, 127. In the painting, Socrates's gesture shows us that he is still teaching, even in the moment before his death. It is said that this gesture was inspired by the poet Andr√© Ch√©nier. Other versions Another painting depicting the event was done by the Italian artist Giambettino Cignaroli. Cignaroli's work shows Socrates already dead, surrounded by his anguished followers. The Death of Socrates by Jacques- Philip-Joseph de Saint-Quentin Yet another depiction of Socrates' death was done by the French artist Jacques-Philippe-Joseph de Saint-Quentin. The work, currently housed at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, dates to circa 1738.

The Hungarian Jews separated themselves in 1858 from its mother institute Kolel Chibas Yerushalayim which at one point in time included the Jewish communities of the entire Austrian Hungarian Kingdom. Kolel Chibas Yerushalayim was itself a breakaway from the original Kolel Perushim, established by the students of the Vilna Gaon. Two leading Hungarian rabbis were appointed as the \\"Nesyim\\" or \\"Presidents of the Kolel, Avraham Shmuel Binyamin Sofer, author of Ketav Sofer, and Meir Eisenstein. In honor of these two leaders the Hungarian Kolel was also called \\"House of Sofer and Meir\\" History By the year 1881 the kollel had built up many apartment buildings to provide housing for its members. This was accomplished in great part thanks to donations by Rabbi Yitzchok Zvi Ratzersdorfer, a Hungarian Jew who later relocated to Antwerp, Belgium and helped build the Jewish community there. These houses are called Batei Ungarin, in Yiddish Ungarishe Hoiser - the Hungarian Houses. When the Jewish community had to flee the Old City during the 1938 riots, the Kollel moved its operations to other neighborhoods, including Meah Shearim, Givat Shaul and Ramat Shlomo. The kollel is still active with Pushka and Halukka money gatherings in America and Europe for the benefit of Jerusalem, and is managing many Torah institutes of the Yishuv haYashan of Jerusalem. Usually it is adherent to the rulings of the Edah HaChareidis; both Grand Rabbis of Satmar, Rabbi Aron and Rabbi Zalman Teitelbaum are on the presidency board among others.

Early life Edwards was the son of Joseph Harold Edwards and Ellen Keays; he was born in Franktown, Ontario on 28 April 1893. When he enlisted in the 130th Battalion, CEF on 16 December 1915 at Perth, Ontario, he was five feet eleven inches tall, weighed 168 pounds, and was swarthy with dark blue eyes. He gave his profession as chauffeur and auto mechanic. As was customary for Canadians in those days, he swore allegiance to the King of England, and contracted to serve for the duration of the war.  Infantry career  He embarked to England on the troopship SS Lapland, arriving in October 1916, and serving with the 38th Battln. CEF and received a field promotion to corporal in November 1916, before being wounded on 8 April 1917. Edwards was transferred to No 3 Canadian General Hospital in Boulogne with what was reported as shrapnel or gunshot wounds to the leg and shoulder. He was evacuated to England and taken on strength at the Endell Street Military Hospital, Seaforth on 12 April 1917. Edwards was then transferred to the Canadian Convalescent Hospital at Bromley, Kent. He was awarded the Military Medal on 26 May 1917. Aviation career Discharged from the CEF in June 1918, Edwards enlisted in the RAF. He was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant as an observer and joined No. 20 Squadron on 28 July 1918, flying in Bristol F.2 Fighters. Pilots Edwards flew in action with include aces Paul Iaccaci and Captain Horace Percy Lale, Lt. William McKenzie Thomson, and Capt. Geoffrey Hooper. He was wounded in the lung on 21 October 1918 and returned to Canada on the S.S. Minnedosa in January 1919 and spent considerable time in St. Andrews Military Hospital in Toronto. Of his total 21 claims, 19 were in one month (September 1918). He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. His war time tally consisted of 18 enemy Fokker D.VII airplanes destroyed (including one shared victory), and 3 more Fokkers driven down out of control. Postwar Edwards went on the unemployed list of the RAF effective 1 June 1919. After the war, Edwards became a car salesman. He lived in the Toronto area for the rest of his life and died in 1951. He is buried in Franktown. Text of citationsDistinguished Flying Cross= \\"2nd Lieut. Harold Edwards. (FRANCE) When on offensive patrol, during 16 September, this officer with nine other machines, engaged twelve enemy scouts. In the combat that ensued he destroyed one, his pilot accounting for a second, and they took part in destroying a third. In all 2nd Lieutenant Edwards has accounted for nine enemy machines, setting an excellent example of gallantry worthy of high praise.\\" =Military Medal= There exists some confusion regarding the awarding of the Military Medal to this man. The action cited on his Medal Card for the action on March 26, 1917, refers to him as Private Edwards though he had been a corporal since November 23, 1916. A publication of Kingswood House in Dulwich, which was leased by Massey-Harris for convalescing Canadian soldiers, the Kingswood Bulletin, cites the following action: Private Armir, Corp. Edwards, and L.Corp. Eryl at Kingswood House More Honours For Kingswood Men One of the most interesting items in the programme at our Empire Day fete, was the presentation of Medals won for distinguished conduct at the Front, by three of our patients. The Distinguished Conduct Medal was awarded to 107065, Private T. N. Armit, of the 2nd C.M.R.‚Äôs, and the Military Medal to 787002, Corporal H. L. Edwards, of the 38th Battalion, and to 18421, Lance-Corporal V. Eryl, of the 52nd Battalion. Mrs. Raynolds, on pinning the coveted medals on the men‚Äôs breasts, in a few well-chosen words, expressed the pride and pleasure which all those connected with Kingswood experienced in having such brave men in the Home, and in hearing of their noble deeds. Needless to say, the three heroes of the day were very heartily cheered by their comrades. The brave deed which merited even a higher distinction for Corporal Edwards, is worthy of mention. During the desperate fighting at Vimy Ridge on the memorable ninth of April, the advance of his company was held up by a well- handled machine-gun and its crew of six Germans. The gun and its crew were well sheltered in a large shell crater, protected in front by barbed wire entanglements. Five separate attempts to advance in front and capture the gun were made by parties of volunteers, two at a time, but they fell one by one. Corporal Edwards and a comrade then worked their way round the flank, taking cover over the uneven shell-pitted ground, took the Germans by surprise, disposed of five by rifle, bayonet and revolver, and carried back the gun and the remaining German as a prisoner. Corporal Edwards and his comrade immediately made good use of the captured machine gun against other bodies of German troops. Corporal Edwards hails from Smiths‚Äô Falls, his father is Major Edwards of the 240th Battalion, and his uncle is a Captain in the same Battalion. He also has a brother a Sergeant in the Canadian Army‚Äîtruly a fine family record. ‚ÄîFrom report of Resident Secretary.  DFC citation  Whilst on Offensive Patrol with 9 Bristol Fighters, 12 Fokker Bi-planes were attacked on the same level over ST.QUENTIN. About 8 more E.A. joined the fight from above. These however were attacked by a formation of Dolphins which was above the E.A. A dog fight ensued, which ended in all the E.A. being either brought down or driven away. The Leader of the Bristol Fighter formation, Machine No. E2154 (Pilot ‚Äì Lt.Thomson. Observer ‚Äì 2/Lt.Edwards) dived on 1 E.A. firing about 100 rounds at close range. This E.A. suddenly spun slowly down and crashed in some trenches N.E. of ST.QUENTIN. Lt.Thomson then saw another E.A. falling past him, obviously out of control, and, diving on it, fired about 100 rounds at point blank range. This E.A. had been attacked by Machine No. C951 (Pilot ‚Äì Lt.Strachan. Observer 2/Lt.Calderwood) who started it in its spin and eventually saw it crash N.W. of ST.QUENTIN. 2/Lt/Edwards (observer in Machine No.E2154, Pilot ‚Äì Lt.Thomson) fired about 200 rounds with double guns at an E.A. which was diving on a Bristol Fighter on his right. The E.A. fell over and over and hit the ground near ST.QUENTIN. This is confirmed by Lt.Boulton, Pilot in Machine No. E2493. Lt.Iaccaci, DFC. And Sergt.Howland, DFM., in Machine No.E2213 found themselves under a Fokker Bi-plane and the Observer fired nearly a whole drum at it. Lt.H.E.Johnston and 2/Lt.E.S.Harvey in Machine No.C4718 were attacked by an E.A. from below. Lt.Harvey fired two bursts at this E.A. which spun slowly down but was not watched all the way. This is confirmed by Lt.Iaccaci (sub-leader of Lt.Johnston‚Äôs formation). Machine C951 (Pilot ‚Äì Lt.Strachan, Observer ‚Äì2/Lt.Calderwood) was attacked by five E.A. on the same level, three of which were engaged by the Observer, who put about 100 rounds into one, at 150 yards range; this E.A turned off and dived down, leaving a heavy trail of black smoke and eventually crashed near OMISSY. A second E.A. was sent down in a slow spin over ST.QUENTIN, but could not be watched to the ground. The remainder of the E.A. broke off the fight. The leader of Patrol in E2154 (Pilot ‚Äì Lt.Thomson, Observer ‚Äì 2/Lt.Edwards) was attacked from below and from the side and the Observer got in about 100 rounds at 50 yards range at one trying to get under the tail. This E.A. went down out of control and was seen to crash near OMISSY. Another E.A. was driven down out of control by the Pilot, but could not be watched to the ground. (Signed) W.M.Thomson. Lieut.

Nowadays, EBX advises new startup companies and tries to rebuild itself again. In early 2012, Batista had a net worth of , ranking him the seventh wealthiest person in the world, and the richest in Brazil. By July 2013, his wealth had plummeted to $200 million due to his debts and his company's falling stock prices. Bloomberg reported in January 2014 that Batista \\"has a negative net worth.\\" Forbes and Folha de S.Paulo quoted Batista in September 2014, stating that his net worth was ‚Äì$1 billion. Batista is currently under arrest and has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for bribing disgraced Rio de Janeiro governor S√©rgio Cabral, in order to secure public contracts. Early life and career Batista was the second of seven children of businessman , who was Minister of Mines and Energy in the Jo√£o Goulart and Fernando Collor administrations and a former president of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (now known simply as Vale), then wholly a state enterprise, between 1961‚Äì1964 and 1979‚Äì1986. His mother, Jutta Fuhrken, was born in Germany and, from her, Batista says he learned self-esteem and discipline, attributes he considers crucial to his formation as an entrepreneur. After spending his childhood in Brazil, Batista and his family moved to Europe when he was a teenager, due to his father's occupation. They lived in Geneva, D√ºsseldorf and Brussels. In 1974, he began to study metallurgical engineering at the University of Aachen in Germany. When he was 18 years old, his parents returned to Brazil. Batista remained abroad and began selling insurance policies door-to-door to make his living. In interviews, he often mentions that the \\"stress\\" and the lessons learned from this experience were essential for his education. Batista returned to Brazil in the early 1980s and focused his attention on the gold and diamond trades. He established himself as a salesman, contacting producers in the Amazon area and buyers in large metropolitan centers in Brazil and Europe. When he was 23 years old, he started a gold trading firm, called Autram Aurem, using the Inca Sun as the company trademark and symbol. A year and a half later, the company had earned US$6 million. He implemented the first mechanized alluvial gold mining plant in the Amazon, marking the beginning of the EBX Group. At age 29, he became CEO of TVX Gold, a company listed on the Montreal Stock Exchange, initiating his relationship with global capital markets. From 1980 to 2000, he created US$20 billion in value with the operation of eight gold mines in Brazil and Canada and a silver mine in Chile. Between 1991 and 1996, the value of his company more than tripled. Personal life Batista married the model Luma de Oliveira in 1991, and divorced her in 2004. They had two boys, Olin and Thor.

Projects Since the 1980s, Batista created and put into operation eight gold mines in Brazil and Canada (Amapari, Casa Berardi, Crix√°s, Musselwhite, New Britania, Novo Astro, Novo Planeta and Paracatu), a silver mine in Chile (La Coipa), and three iron ore mines in Brazil (Mina 63, Tico-Tico and Ip√©).\\" All of Batista's companies were named with 3-letter combinations ending in the letter \\"X\\", which Batista believed was a symbol for the multiplication of wealth. From 2004 to 2010 Batista created and put into operation five companies: MMX (mining), MPX (energy), OGX (petroleum), LLX (logistics) and OSX (offshore industry). As of 2013, due to falling commodity prices, none of his enterprises were profitable despite substantial infusions of cash by the Brazilian government, and Batista was engaged in desperate efforts to shed assets and meet the demands of creditors. =EBX= The EBX Group produces iron ore in Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul and has put the first commercial-scale solar power plant into operation in Brazil. It invested an estimated US$15.5 billion between 2011 and 2012 in Brazil and is responsible for projects of significant scale, such as the LLX A√ßu Superport in S√£o Jo√£o da Barra, Rio de Janeiro, the MMX Sudeste Superport in Itagua√≠, Rio de Janeiro, and the MPX thermal power plants in Itaqui, Maranh√£o and Pec√©m, Cear√°. These important energy and infrastructure projects are being executed in parallel to OGX's exploratory campaigns in Campos dos Goytacazes, Rio de Janeiro, Santos, S√£o Paulo and Parna√≠ba, Maranh√£o basins, which have resulted in oil and gas discoveries. There were 20,000 people working in the construction and operation of the group's projects in 2011. The EBX Group is headquartered in Rio de Janeiro and operates in nine Brazilian states. It has offices in New York City (USA), Colombia and Chile. In addition to the infrastructure and natural resources sectors, Batista's EBX Group also invests in real estate (REX), entertainment (IMX), technology (SIX) and catering (NRX). In Rio de Janeiro, EBX is developing sports, hospitality, gastronomy, health and beauty initiatives. Since the early 2000s however, Batista has focused primarily on natural resources, energy and infrastructure. In April 2012 the EBX Group contracted International Business Machines Corp. to outsource EBX's IT operations. =MMX= MMX is the mining company of the EBX Group, with integrated logistics and low production costs. The company has projects in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul, as well as in Chile. =MPX becomes Eneva SA= MPX operates in the energy industry in Brazil, Chile and Colombia. The company has complementary businesses in power generation, coal mining and exploration and production of natural gas. MPX was responsible for the first commercial solar power plant in Brazil in the city of Tau√°. (CE) As part of the restructuring of the EBX companies under Batista, MPX was renamed Eneva SA and is now co-controlled by Germany's E.ON SE and Batista. =OGX now √ìleo e G√°s Participa√ß√µes= OGX was the EBX Group company which carries out activities in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. The company was responsible for the largest private sector exploratory campaign under way in Brazil, claiming an early success rate in exploratory wells of more than 90% and initially valuing its deposits at more than $1 trillion. The company's wells turned out to be duds, however, and OGX filed for bankruptcy protection on 30 October 2013. In December the 2013 its shareholders voted to rename the company \\"√ìleo e G√°s Participa√ß√µes.\\", known simply as OGpar. =LLX now Prumo Logistical Global= LLX was the logistics company of the EBX Group, responsible for building the A√ßu Superport, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, projected to be the largest port-industrial complex in Latin America. As of 11 December 2013, LLX was renamed Prumo Log√≠stica Global by its new controlling parent, U.S.-based EIG Group. =OSX= OSX operates in the offshore shipbuilding industry and is constructing the largest shipyard in the Americas, the \\"Embraer of the Sea,\\" at the A√ßu Superport. Different segments: shipbuilding, in the charter of Exploration and Production (E&P;) equipment and Operation and Maintenance (O&M;). Shipbuilding firm OSX, part of the EBX Group, Brasil made the filing in a Rio de Janeiro in November 2013 court less than two weeks after its sister oil company, OGX, also declared bankruptcy. Financial losses On 26 July 2013, Bloomberg News reported his losses as \\"historic.\\" The losses can be attributed largely to the downturn in the precious metals mining industry, as well as a catastrophic collapse of Batista's OGX ‚Äî which had claimed would pump 750,000 barrels of oil a day, delivering only 15,000 barrels per day. Other economic issues and management decisions factored in as well. Bloomberg News likened events leading to the failure as a \\"Perfect Storm.\\"Bloomberg \\"Eike Batista's Perfect Storm Costs Him Billions,\\" Bloomberg News, July 26, 2015. He publicly boasted several times that he would overtake Mexican baron Carlos Slim to become the world's richest man by 2015. However, akin to Japanese businessman Masayoshi Son, who lost over 90% of his fortune in the dotcom boom of 2000; Batista's wealth decreased by over 100% between March 2012 and January 2014, from a peak net worth of $32 billion to a negative net worth. Many business and finance-related media, such as Forbes magazine and Businessweek, are still in the process of concluding whether Eike Batista holds the record for having been the fastest destroyer of wealth. Eike Batista has written in Brazilian newspapers about the loss of his fortune and fall from billionairedom, stated that he regrets listing his companies in the stock markets, and that, in retrospect, a private equity model of financing his ventures would have been better. Batista pledged that he would leave no creditor unpaid, and would fulfill all of his debt obligations. On 9 February 2015, Brazilian police seized cash and seven cars, including a white Lamborghini Aventador, from Batista. Enterprises Major companies founded by Batista: EBX, OGX, MPX, MMX, LLX, OSX, REX, AUX, NRX Newrest, IMX, Gloria Palace, Marina da Gl√≥ria, MDX, BEAUX, MR.LAM, PINK FLEET, and RJX. Arrest, conviction and sentencing In January 2017, Brazilian authorities issued a detention order for Batista and eight other individuals as part of Operation Car Wash (), a high-profile $100 million money laundering investigation. Batista returned from New York and was detained in the maximum security prison in Bangu. On April 28, 2017 Supreme Court judge Gilmar Mendes ordered Batista's release pending trial. Batista had been charged with making $16.5 million in bribes to the former governor of Rio de Janeiro state. On July 3, 2018, Batista was convicted of bribing former Rio de Janeiro governor Sergio Cabral for the purpose of obtaining state government contracts, paying Cabral US$16.6 million, and was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. Batista's lawyer, Fernando Martins, expects to appeal the verdict. Biller, David \\"Former Brazil Billionaire Batista Hit With 30-Year Sentence,\\" Bloomberg News, July 3, 2018.

Built in 1828, it was home to Presbyterian abolitionist John Rankin, and was one of the original stops on the Underground Railroad. Harriet Beecher Stowe's visit to Rankin provided some of the story that became Uncle Tom's Cabin. The house was acquired by the State of Ohio in 1938 and is now operated by the Ohio History Connection and opened for tours. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Description and history The John Rankin House occupies a prominent position on a hill overlooking the town of Ripley and the Ohio River. It is set on about , accessed via a drive and visitors center off Rankin Hill Road (County Road 556). The house is a modest 1-1/2 story brick structure, with a side-facing gabled roof. The main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sash windows in rectangular openings. The entry is sheltered by a portico with a shallow-pitch gable roof and square posts. The interior follows a typical center hall plan, with four rooms on the ground floor and two small bedrooms in the attic level. The interior retains original features and finishes, including wide floor boards and carved fireplace surrounds. The house was built in 1828 by the abolitionist Presbyterian minister John Rankin, and it is where he raised a large family. It also became a significant stopping point for fugitive slaves who had crossed the river from Kentucky, a slave state, often under guidance from a \\"conductor\\" on the Underground Railroad. Rankin is estimated to have assisted in securing the freedom of more than 2,000 slaves, often at great personal risk. The house was often under surveillance by slave catchers, and some slave owners had placed a price on his head. The Rankins sold the house after the American Civil War, and it was purchased by the state in 1938 for use as a historic site. See also *John P.

He gained a reputation as a maverick during the mid-1990s for creating unorthodox games like Real Sound and is perhaps best remembered today for his rebellious marketing techniques. Outside of his native home land he was best known for his survival horror video games, the D series. Apart from creating video games, Eno was also a well-regarded electronic musician and he created the scores for several of his games. During his life, Eno founded the video game development companies: EIM and From Yellow to Orange (previously called Warp and Super Warp). He also worked in a variety of fields apart from video games and music including the automotive, cellphone, tobacco, and hotel industries. Eno died on February 20, 2013, due to heart failure brought on by hypertension. Career Uncommonly interested in video games and music from a young age, Eno had experimented extensively with programming and recording, and one of his first games, Towadoko Murder Case, placed in a regional game contest. Eno's first job in the industry was with the nascent video game company, Interlink (responsible for the small 1989 hit, ). With Interlink, Eno was given a small degree of control in his projects and the company soon released a game in the Ultra Series under his co-planning. Unsatisfied with his role at Interlink, and interested in more direct control over the projects, Eno used his savings to found the video game development contract company, in 1989. Eno's plan for EIM was largely modeled upon Interlink, however as a strict contract company EIM focused solely on sequels and spin-off titles. Though Eno was now able to choose projects and control the company's output through his selections, he remained unsatisfied by the limitations imposed on EIM by the need to be faithful to the creative visions of the groups that contracted EIM's services. For this reason as well as growing mental instability, Eno dissolved EIM in 1992 and began work as a consultant to an automotive manufacturer. = Warp and From Yellow to Orange = In 1994, after having his interest in games revitalized by trips to Macworld 1994 and Be-In, a local video game expo, Eno formed Warp with a small team of programmers and designers including animators Fumito Ueda (Ico and Shadow of the Colossus), Takeshi Nozue (Final Fantasy VII Advent Children) and Ichiro Itano (Macross), all of whom later became famous under different employment. While EIM had been modeled after Interlink, Eno modeled Warp after Panasonic's 3DO department. Warp produced a number of titles for various platforms, however its main output consisted of games designed for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Under Eno's management, Warp's games were noted for their outlandishness and unconventional production. The game Short Warp, for example, notably came shipped with condom feelies, and the game Real Sound shipped with a bag of \\"herb seeds\\". Eno took up radio broadcasting during this period. He developed a maverick reputation during his work with Warp, and shocked the Japanese video game press in a dramatic 1996 press conference where he burned bridges with Sony by displaying a video depicting the PlayStation logo morphing into the logo for Sega Saturn to indicate that Warp's latest game, Enemy Zero, would be a Saturn exclusive. Furthering this reputation, at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show Warp displayed a video of themselves dancing and singing a song with lyrics roughly translated as \\"Enemy Zero is a good game, Warp is a good company\\", at the end of which Eno threw to the floor a plush doll of Muumuu, the mascot of Sony's hit game Jumping Flash!. Warp's last four titles were designed exclusively for Sega. Due in part to the failure of the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer as a video game console, in part to Eno's growing episodes of mental instability, and dogged by mediocre sales figures for their non-3DO games, Warp disbanded shortly after the release of D2 in 2000. Thereafter, Warp was renamed Superwarp. Superwarp diverged from Warp in concentrating on DVDs, network services, and online music.McWhertor, Michael. Game designer and musician Kenji Eno dies at 42 . Polygon.com. 21 February 2013. With Superwarp, Eno worked on 20 or 30 widely diverse projects including work with NTT DoCoMo, creation of a cell- phone purchase interface for Coca-Cola vending machines, marketing cigarettes, and designing a trendy hotel. Eno also began blogging during this period. Superwarp was disbanded in 2005 without having released a single video game title. Eno explained that this was his final act of distancing himself from his past at WARP. Superwarp was eventually renamed From Yellow to Orange in 2001. Eno continued heading the company until his death. In 2006, Eno announced that From Yellow to Orange was in the process of designing a game and, during an interview at E3 2006, he hinted that the game would be designed for Nintendo's Wii. In the September 2008 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Eno stated in an interview that he was working on a game that would be revealed either in the \\"next issue, or the next, next issue of EGM.\\" On March 23, 2009, Nintendo released the new game entitled on the Wii's downloadable games service, Wiiware. In August 2008 Kenji Eno teamed up with Kenichi Nishi (Chibi-Robo!, Captain Rainbow, etc.) under the control of Fieldsystem, Inc. to write the score for and help develop Newtonica, a game for the iPhone and iPod Touch. Personal life Eno attended a school for gifted children in his younger years, however the regular course of his childhood was greatly affected by the disappearance of his mother from his life during his second year of elementary school. Eno dropped out of high school at age 17 and, after brief jobs at Canon and a telephone-appointment company, he soon entered the video game industry. Videogames had always played an important role in his life as he started to visit arcade game rooms from an early age. He cites Space Invaders and Pac-Man as two of the most influential games that motivated him to pursue a career in game design. Eno got married during the development of D, he was not planning on having kids as he felt he wasn't economically stable \\"I was pretty broke back then, living in a one bed room apartment\\", however with the success of D Eno stated that he was able to \\"afford kids\\". Eno has claimed influence from electronic group, Yellow Magic Orchestra. =Death= Eno died on February 20, 2013, due to heart failure brought on by hypertension. He was 42. Music Eno's musical achievements are in general lesser known outside of Japan, although they have enjoyed more mainstream success than his video games. Eno has produced several albums independently as well as collaborated on albums such as The Cinematic Orchestra's Remixes 1998-2000. Eno is also credited with having composed music for several of his games including Juuouki, Casino Kid 2, Sunman, and the dark ambient scores to D and D2.

Born in the Philadelphia suburbs, the younger Collins attended the elite Episcopal Academy, graduating in the class of 1935. He went on to Yale University, where he played on the team that won the 1937 Ivy League Championships. In 1939, his senior year, Collins was team captain at Yale. Upon graduation, he signed with the Philadelphia Athletics and played 32 games his rookie year, 1939. For the 1940 season, Collins joined the International League, playing for the Baltimore Orioles In the 1941 season he returned to the Athletics, playing a career-high 80 games. Collins played 20 games for the Athletics in 1942, before entering military service with the Navy. Commissioned as a lieutenant, Collins served as a communications officer aboard the Cleveland-class light cruiser USS Miami, which participated in the battle of Leyte Gulf and supported strikes on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. After the war, Collins returned to the Athletics but was released in April 1946. He went on to play in the International League for the Jersey City Giants and the Buffalo Bisons before retiring from the field.

In Canada in 1923 and 24, three wheat pools were created. They were farmer- owned co-operatives, created to break the power of the large for-profit corporations, that had dominated the grain trade in Western Canada since the late 19th Century, and were an early source of Western alienation. The wheat pools were successful grain traders and marketers from 1923 to 1929. During the Great Depression, however, huge losses forced them out of the grain marketing business. They persisted as grain elevator operators but after 1935 all grain marketing in Canada shifted to a new government agency, Canadian Wheat Board. During the post-war era, the wheat pools almost completely replaced the private grain companies as elevator operators. By the 1990s, however, most had demutualized (privatized), and several mergers occurred. Now all the former wheat pools are part of the Viterra corporation, which itself was acquired by Glencore Xstrata in 2013.  Background  Agrarian activism = The pools were the culmination of a long tradition of agrarian activism dating back decades in the Prairie Provinces of Canada which peaked in the 1920s.Rennie, Bradford James, The Rise of Agrarian Democracy: The United Farmers and Farm Women of Alberta, 1909‚Äì1921, (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000), 222 One notable date was the founding of the Territorial Grain Growers Association (T.G.G.A.) in 1901. The T.G.G.A.'s successor organizations would be important organizers in the later campaigning to organize the wheat pools. The co-operative movement was also being established in Canada at this time. = Farmer grievances = At this time farmers in the Prairie Provinces were deeply alienated from the Canadian political and economic status quo. Farmers accepted as common knowledge that grain companies, railways, banks, and the government were part of a system that sought to exploit and oppress farmers. They developed a class solidarity and a fear and loathing of the ruling elite.Rennie, 3. Specifically they despised the private grain trade system as symbolized by Winnipeg Grain Exchange. Farmers suspected the grain traders of being middle men who only profited by leeching off the efforts of farmers without adding any value. They were especially angered by the practice of hedging that private traders used on the futures exchange, which they believed allowed traders to profit from falling markets, hurting farmers.Grant MacEwan, Harvest of Bread, (Saskatoon: Prairie Books, 1969), 99; Allan Levine, \\"Open Market or 'Orderly Marketing':The Winnipeg Grain Exchange and the Wheat Pools, 1923 1929\\", Agricultural History, 61, 2 (Spring,1987), 51; Fairbairn, 8‚Äì13 They also believed that private traders artificially held down prices during the fall harvest in order to shortchange producers.  Previous attempts to reform the grain trade  Elevator co-ops = Some attempts had been made to set up co-operative grain elevators. There were many local co-ops that owned a single elevator, but the two most important were the United Grain Growers (U.G.G.) and the Saskatchewan-government backed Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company (Sask. Co-op Elevators). U.G.G. was formed by merger of two smaller co-ops: the Alberta government-backed Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company and the Grain Growers Grain Company (G.G.G.C., which had previously acquired the elevators of failed Manitoba government elevator company) in 1917. Following the merger, U.G.G. was a powerful force with 300 elevators and a terminal at the Lakehead.Rennie, 153. While U.G.G. and Sask. Co-op Elevators were farmer-owned, they did not follow the traditional co-op structure of paying dividends back to the users on a patronage basis (per the amount of business), instead they paid dividends to shareholder-investors. For diehard co-operators this was unacceptable. Furthermore, the two companies were unable to negotiate a merger between themselves and were not involved in marketing grain overseas. They lacked the size or reach to challenge the open-market system.Fairbairn, 6. = Government marketing = During the Great War the Canadian government had completely taken over the grain industry. The government created a series of boards in and around the war, each with progressively more power to control the grain trade. The Board of Grain Commissioners of 1912 was purely for regulation (to supervise grading, etc.), but by 1915 the government had seized control of all wheat exports to help the war effort, and by 1917 futures trading on the Winnipeg Exchange was banned. In 1917, the new Board of Grain Supervisors was given monopoly powers over wheat, and fixed uniform prices across the country. Soon after the Board took over marketing of crops as well. Farmers were worried that after the war prices would crash and various agrarian groups lobbied Ottawa to keep the Board in place. The government relented by creating the Canadian Wheat Board for the 1919 crop only. Farmers got a guaranteed price for that crop, paid immediately, and later a further payment once the Board had sold all harvest and made a profit. This system of guaranteed prices and distributed income was extremely popular and when the Board dissolved in 1920, farmers were livid. It certainly did not help that, \\"from a peak of $2.85 per bushel in September, 1920 [prices] began a slow and sickening decline to less than a dollar a bushel in late 1923.\\"MacEwan, Harvest, 103.

In the standard model, the lepton number and the baryon number are accidental symmetries, while in lattice models, rotational invariance is accidental. In Quantum Mechanics The connection between symmetry and degeneracy (that is, the fact that apparently unrelated quantities turn out to be equal) is familiar in every day experience. Consider a simple example, where we draw three points on a plane, and calculate the distance between each of the three points. If the points are placed randomly, then in general all of these distances will be different. However, if the points are arranged so that a rotation by 120 degrees leaves the picture invariant, then the distances between them will all be equal (as this situation obviously describes an equilateral triangle). The observed degeneracy boils down to the fact that the system has a D3 symmetry. In quantum mechanics, calculations (at least formally) boil down to the diagonalization of Hermitian matrices - in particular, the Hamiltonian, or in the continuous case, the solution of linear differential equations. Again, observed degeneracies in the eigenspectrum are a consequence of discrete (or continuous) symmetries. In the latter case, Noether's theorem also guarantees a conserved current. \\"Accidental\\" symmetry is the name given to observed degeneracies that are apparently not a consequence of symmetry. The term is misleading as often the observed degeneracy is not accidental at all, and is a consequence of a 'hidden' symmetry which is not immediately obvious from the Hamiltonian in a given basis. The non relativistic Hydrogen atoms a good example of this - by construction, its Hamiltonian is invariant under the full rotation group in 3 dimensions, SO(3). A less obvious feature is that the Hamiltonian is also invariant under SO(4), the extension of SO(3) to 4D, of which SO(3) is a subgroup (another way of saying this is that all possible rotations in 3D are also possible in 4D - we just don't rotate about the additional axis). This gives rise to the 'accidental' degeneracy observed in the Hydrogenic eigenspectrum. As a more palatable example, consider the Hermitian matrix: \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 &-0.5&-\\\\sqrt{0.5}&0.5 -0.5&-\\\\sqrt{2}&0&0 -\\\\sqrt{0.5}&0&0&0 0.5&0&0&\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\end{bmatrix} Although there is already some suggestive relationships between the matrix elements, it is not clear what the symmetry of this matrix is at first glance. However, it is easy to demonstrate that by a unitary transformation, this matrix is equivalent to: \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0&1&0&0 1&0&1&0 0&1&0&1 0&0&1&0 \\\\end{bmatrix} Which can be verified directly by numerically (or for purists, analytically - see Chebyshev polynomials for some clues) diagonalising the sub-matrix formed by removing the first row and column. Rotating the basis defining this sub matrix using the resulting unitary brings the original matrix into the originally stated form. This matrix has a P4 permutation symmetry, which in this basis is much easier to see, and could constitute a 'hidden' symmetry. In this case, there are no degeneracies in the eigenspectrum. The technical reason for this is that each eigenstate transforms with respect to a different irreducible representation of P4. If one encountered a case where some group of eigenstates correspond to the same irreducible representation of the 'hidden' symmetry group, a degeneracy would be observed. Although for this simple 4x4 matrix the symmetry could have been guessed (it was after all, always there to begin with), if the matrix was larger, it would have been more difficult to spot.

Community wind projects are locally owned by farmers, investors, businesses, schools, utilities, or other public or private entities who utilize wind energy to support and reduce energy costs to the local community. The key feature is that local community members have a significant, direct financial stake in the project beyond land lease payments and tax revenue. Projects may be used for on-site power or to generate wholesale power for sale, usually on a commercial-scale greater than 100 kW. Community wind farmsAustralia= Hepburn Wind Farm The Hepburn Wind Project is a wind farm at Leonards Hill near Daylesford, Victoria, north-west of Melbourne, Victoria. It comprises two 2MW wind turbines which produce enough power for 2,300 households.Victorian community goes it alone on wind farm ABC News, July 25, 2008. This is the first Australian community-owned wind farm. The initiative has emerged because the community felt that the state and federal governments were not doing enough to address climate change. =Canada= Community wind power is in its infancy in Canada but there are reasons for optimism. One such reason is the launch of a new Feed-in Tariff (FIT) program in the Province of Ontario . A number of community wind projects are in development in Ontario but the first project that is likely to obtain a FIT contract and connect to the grid is the Pukwis Community Wind Park. Pukwis will be unique in that it is a joint Aboriginal/Community wind project that will be majority-owned by the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation, with a local renewable energy co-operative (the Pukwis Energy Co-operative) owning the remainder of the project. =Denmark= Middelgrunden offshore wind park In Denmark, families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity within their own or an adjoining commune.Community-Owned Wind Development in Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands, Paul Gipe, Wind Works, published 1996.

North Frisia is seen to be a model location for community wind, leading the way for other regions, especially in southern Germany. =India= {See also: Renewable Energy in India} Starting in 2006, a village panchayat (local self- governing body) in Tamil Nadu state has become completely self-sufficient in energy by using renewable sources like wind, solar and biogas. The Odanthurai village panchayat near Coimbatore city comprises 11 villages and has a population of about 8,000. By 2009, it had set up its own 350 kW windfarm to meet its energy needs. The windmill was set up at Malwadi near Udumalpet and generates about 8 lakh (800,000) units annually. The power requirement for Odanthurai stands at about 4.5 lakh (450,000) units, and the local panchayat body is now selling the surplus power to the state grid. This gives the panchayat an annual income of 19 lakh rupees. The village cooperative is also using other sources of renewable energy. It has 65 solar streetlights in two hamlets and a nine-KW (kilowatt) biomass gasifier to pump drinking water from the river to the overhead tanks. Doing so, Odanthurai became the first local body in India to utilize the remunerative enterprises scheme of the state government. =The Netherlands= Sixty-three farmers in \\"De Zuidlob\\", the southern part of the municipality of Zeewolde, have entered into a cooperative agreement that aims to develop a wind farm of at least 108 MW. The project will include the installation of three phases of 12 wind turbines with capacities of 3 to 4.5 MW each. The aim is to put the wind farm into service in 2012. The Netherlands has an active community of wind cooperatives. They build and operate wind parks in all regions of the Netherlands. This started in the 1980s with the first Lagerweij turbines. Back then, these turbines could be financed by the members of the cooperatives. Today, the cooperatives build larger wind parks, but not as large as commercial parties do. Some still operate self-sufficiently, others partner with larger commercial wind park developers. Because of the very unproductive state policies for financing wind parks in the Netherlands, the cooperatives have developed a new financing model, where members of a cooperative do not have to pay taxes for the electricity they generate with their community wind park. In this construction the Zelfleveringsmodel the cooperative operates the wind park, and a traditional energy company only acts as a service provider, for billing and energy balance on the public grid. This is the new role for energy companies in the future, where production is largely decentralized. In 2012 a new company launched a new business model for community energy, Windcentrale. The wind turbine is sold in physical shares to families. Every share does not give financial gains, but real power, 500 kWh per year, average. A power company, part of the model, subtracts the generated amount of power, from the yearly power bill. Owners only have to pay for the power they used in excess of the amount their share generated. The Windcentrale started with 2 existing turbines that were sold to about 3 months. 8 months later they sold a turbine in a single evening. By the end of 2016 they were a community of about 17.000 members with 10 turbines and about 15 MW rated power. Every turbine is owned by a separate cooperative, with the Windcentrale doing all organizational work in the cooperative. In three years they grew to the same size, in members, than older wind cooperatives with average age of 25 years. Too of these older wind cooperatives, DeltaWind and Zeeuwind are run as a business and are building a 100 MW wind farm Krammer =United Kingdom= Westmill Wind Farm As of 2012, there are 43 communities who are in the process of or already producing renewable energy through co-operative structures in the UK. They are set up and run by everyday people, mostly local residents, who are investing their time and money and together installing large wind turbines, solar panels, or hydro-electric power for their local communities. Baywind Energy Co-operative was the first co-operative to own wind turbines in the United Kingdom. Baywind was modeled on the similar wind turbine cooperatives and other renewable energy co-operatives that are common in Scandinavia, and was founded as an industrial and provident society in 1996. It grew to exceed 1,300 members, each with one vote. A proportion of the profits is invested in local community environmental initiatives through the Baywind Energy Conservation Trust. As of 2006, Baywind owns a 2.5 megawatt five-turbine wind farm at Harlock Hill near Ulverston, Cumbria (operational since 29 January 1997), and one of the 600 kilowatt turbines at the Haverigg II wind farm near Millom, Cumbria. Community-owned schemes in Scotland include one on the Isle of Gigha. The Heritage Trust set up Gigha Renewable Energy to buy and operate three Vestas V27 wind turbines, known locally as The Dancing Ladies or Creideas, D√≤chas is Carthannas (Gaelic for Faith, Hope and Charity). They were commissioned on 21 January 2005 and are capable of generating up to 675 kW of power. Revenue is produced by selling the electricity to the grid via an intermediary called Green Energy UK. Gigha residents control the whole project and profits are reinvested in the community. Another community-owned wind farm, Westmill Wind Farm Cooperative, opened in May 2008 in the Oxfordshire village of Watchfield. It consists of five 1.3 megawatt turbines, and is described by its promoters as the UK's largest community-owned wind farm. It was structured as a cooperative, whose shares and loan stock were sold to the local community.

Unity Wind Ltd is an industrial and provident society that intends to install two 2MW wind turbines at North Walsham in North Norfolk. Its key aim is community wind turbineshttp://www.unitywind.com/installed and run by community investment and for financial benefit to the community. =United States= In 2009, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory published a report that identified three different types of community wind projects in the United States. The first model describes a project owned by a municipal utility, such as the Hull Wind Project in Massachusetts. The second model is a wind project that is jointly owned by local community members, such as the MinWind Projects near Luverne, Minnesota. The third type is a flip-style ownership. This model allows local investors to partner with a corporation in order to take advantage of Production Tax Credit federal incentives. Flip projects have been built in Minnesota and Texas. Business modelsCommunity shared ownership= In a community-based model, the developer/manager of a wind farm shares ownership of the project with area landowners and other community members. Property owners whose land was used for the wind farm are generally given a choice between a monthly cash lease and ownership units in the development. =Cooperative= A wind turbine cooperative, also known as a wind energy cooperative, is a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise that follows the cooperative model, investing in wind turbines or wind farms. The cooperative model was developed in Denmark. The model has also spread to Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and United Kingdom, with isolated examples elsewhere. At a European level, REScoop.eu advocates for renewable energy cooperatives to have fair access to the market, linking individual cooperatives and federations under its umbrella, representing around 1,000,000 citizens and 1,500 cooperatives. = Municipal = Some places have enacted policies to encourage development of municipally owned and operated wind turbines on town land. These projects are publicly owned and tax exempt. An example is the Hull Wind One project in Massachusetts' Boston Harbor in 2001. A 660 kW wind turbine was installed, and is still a great example of small scale commercial wind.  Impacts of community wind energy  Economic = Once a wind farm project is established in a community, jobs are needed for: manufacturing the materials needed to build the project, transportation of supplies to the project area, and construction of the project as well as building roads leading to the project. After the project is complete, jobs will be needed to maintain and operate the facility. According to a study by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, wind energy produces 27% more jobs per kilowatt-hour than coal plants and 66% more jobs than natural gas plants. 3. Landowners will also collect revenues for hosting turbines on their property. Given a typical wind turbine spacing requirements, a 250-acre farm could increase annual farm income by $14,000 per year with little effect on their normal farming and ranching operations. 4. Community wind energy projects increase local property tax revenue because there was very little to be taxed previously due to the sparse population and vast farm land. Once the wind turbines are in service they are taxed, creating much needed revenue for the local community. = Social = The Midwest and the Great Plains regions in the United States are ideal areas for community wind energy projects; they are also often prone to drought. Fossil fuel plants use large amounts of water for cooling purposes which is detrimental to communities' water supply if there is a drought. Wind turbines do not use any water since there is no considerable amount of heat produced during energy generation. Wind energy adds power to the electric grid which decreases the amount of oil needed to generate a community's electricity. Local land owners, who produce the wind energy, can also control the amount of energy produced, which expands the regional energy mix. Overall community wind energy reduces the local community's dependence on oil but, because of the subsidies involved, can greatly increase their costs for electricity. = Environmental = thumbrightLivestock ignore wind turbines, \\"The animals don't care at all. We find cows and antelope napping in the shade of the turbines.\\" ‚Äì Mike Cadieux, site manager, Wyoming Wind Farm and continue to graze as they did before wind turbines were installed. Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use. There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of peat bogs, affect the siting and operation of wind turbines. There are anecdotal reports of negative effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines. Peer- reviewed research has generally not supported these statements.W.

Seilo, Bo S√∏ndergaard. \\"Wind Turbine Sound and Health Effects: An Expert Panel Review\\", Canadian Wind Energy Association, December 2009.  Policy, issues, and legislation  In 1992, the renewable energy production tax credit of 2.1 cents per kilowatt-hour was established. In February 2009, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Congress acted to provide a three-year extension of the PTC through December 31, 2012. Wind projects that were up and running in 2009 and 2010 can choose to receive a 30% investment tax credit instead of the PTC. The investment tax credit is also an option for wind projects that are in service before 2013 if the final construction is complete before the end of 2010. Smaller wind farms (100 kW or less) can receive a credit for 30% towards the cost of installment of the system. The ITC, written into law through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, is available for equipment installed from October 3, 2008 through December 31, 2016. The value of the credit is now uncapped, through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In order to ensure wind energy's future in the energy market, the renewable electricity standard (RES) is a policy in which market mechanisms guarantee a growing percentage of electricity produced comes from renewable sources, like wind energy. The RES exists in 28 states (not at a national level). An example is the Obama-Biden New Energy for America plan, which sets future goals of rapid renewable energy production at 10% by 2012. A pressing issue of concern is the lack of a modern interstate transmission grid which delivers carbon free electricity to customers. Currently the US Senate and the Natural Resources Committee have reported the bill out of committee on June 17, 2009. A combined energy and climate bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate this fall. In the US House of Representatives the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a comprehensive energy and climate bill on May 21, 2010. The clean air and climate change policy is goal to switch from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable carbon-free energy sources for electricity production. Generating 20% of U.S. electricity from wind would be the climate equivalent of removing 140 million vehicles from the roadways. Currently the US Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works has control over the legislation and will begin to complete a markup by September 25, 2009. The House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act on June 26, 2009, comprising a provision to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. It also allocates a portion of the allowances given away for free to energy efficiency and renewable energy. However, the allowances flow through state governments rather than directly to renewable generators. Overall federal funding for community wind research and development is insufficient and even more so when compared to other fuels and energy sources. In 2009 the US Department of Energy (DOE) received $118 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for wind energy research and development. In 2010 the Senate passed a bill granting the DOE $85 million for the DOE wind program. For the same purpose, the House of Representatives allowed the DOE $70 million.

A one-story shed on the property dates to the Rickenbacker occupancy. The first portion of the house was built between 1893 and 1895 by Rickenbacker's father, William, with two rooms on the main floor and two attic rooms. About 1900 William and Eddie Rickenbacker built an ell to the north, over a cellar. Eddie grew up in this house, and it was his nominal residence during World War I until he rented an apartment in 1922 with his wife. Eddie paid off the mortgage on the house after his father's death, and it remained in the family until about 1960, the residence of Eddie's sister Mary. The house was purchased by the city in 1998, when it was poor condition, with the intent of making it the centerpiece of a museum that would revitalize the area. The effort had faltered by 2009, after some rehabilitation had been made to the house. The effort has since been taken over by a nonprofit organization.

She was also one of the first two white female settlers in New Zealand. Early life Badger was born in 1778, the daughter of Thomas and Ann Badger. She was baptised on 31 July 1778. Her family was poor, and one day in 1796,Journal of Lesbian Studies Published 1997 Haworth Press Google Books Retrieved on 2008-06-16 she stole several guineas and a silk handkerchief in an attempt to support them, but was caught and arrested. She was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude in New South Wales. Transportation Badger arrived on the Earl Cornwallis in 1801. In 1806 she was serving at the Parramatta female factory, during which she gave birth to a daughter. In 1806, she travelled with her child aboard the Venus, with plans to become a servant in Van Diemens Land. The captain of the ship, Samuel Chase, was in the habit of flogging the women for entertainment, until his charges and crew mutinied. Badger and another convict, Catherine Hagerty, talked the men on board into seizing the ship, while the captain was ashore at Port Dalrymple in northern Tasmania. In 1806, Badger and Hagerty and their lovers, John Lancashire and Benjamin Kelly, went to the Bay of Islands in the far north of New Zealand, where they settled at the pa at Rangihoua. By April 1807, Hagerty had died and by the end of the year Lancashire and Kelly had also left. In 1826, the American ship the Lafayette landed in Vava ªu. On the ship's landing in Sydney, they reported that Charlotte Badger and her daughter had stopped there eight years earlier. Badger could speak MƒÅori fluently and could communicate in Tongan and was travelling on a whaling ship to America. Some stories suggest that the other mutineers all fled but were eventually caught and hanged, while others suggest that they went pirating after Badger, Hagerty, Lancashire and Kelly left, despite not knowing how to navigate the ship. Then MƒÅori captured The Venus, and burned it to retrieve the scrap metal, and cooked the men on board. Meanwhile, Lancashire and Kelly were also recaptured and Hagerty died of a fever.  Controversy  Historian Jennifer Ashton has uncovered evidence suggesting neither Badger nor Hagerty were present on the Venus when it was captured. Ashton says Charlotte Badger is listed in the New South Wales convict muster every year from her arrival in 1801 until 1825 aside from one census in 1806 (the year the Venus was captured). One possible explanation for her absence is that Badger was on the Venus but returned to Australia shortly afterwards but Ashton considers that scenario very unlikely. \\"...if someone who had been involved in piracy arrived back in New South Wales that it would have made the news and that person would have faced further justice - and there‚Äôs no mention of her ever facing any further justice.‚Äù Ashton also found documents showing Hagerty was granted a full pardon and returned to England in 1800 and says there is no record of her ever returning to Australia.

The forestry sector in Argentina has great potential. The geography of the country extends from north to south, encompassing . Its variety of climates, land quality, and reliable precipitation allow for the cultivation of different tree species at high growth rates. The climate varies and most areas are quite temperate. The country also enjoys short harvest periods for the most important species. This has allowed the industry to become more competitive and continue its high growth rates. Forest situation An estimated 1.115 million hectares were planted as of 2005. There were also 33.2 million hectares (82 million acres) of native forest reserve. Out of this total, 20 million hectares (50 million acres) are high quality land for future development in Argentina. However, this vast amount is not easy to put into production due to its land tenure situation (the proliferation of owners holding areas of 5 to 10 hectares), legislation which protects native forests, and lack of infrastructure. If investors wish to expand their land for cultivation, the opportunity costs are substantial. The current plantation rate is estimated to be 50,000 hectares per year. It is also estimated that the consumption of wood products from cultivated forests is 5.3 million cubic meters, and sustainable wood supply to the year 2015 will be more than 20 million cubic meters. Argentina, however, is not a major consumer of wood products. For instance, wood is not commonly used in building construction. About 60 to 70 percent of wood product production is used for internal consumption (wood boards, plywood, cellulose pulp, etc.) and the rest for exports. The growth of planted forests has increased dramatically since 1997 due to new investments (especially from Chile). The implementation of Law 25,008 in January 1999 was an important factor for growth in this sector. This law promoted and assisted the forestry sector for a period of 10 years. Between 1990 and 2000, foreign and domestic investments surpassed US$1.5 billion. The forestry industry depends on both cultivated forests (85 percent) and native forests (15 percent). The major species cultivated in Argentina are pines and eucalyptus. In addition, species such as salix and populus are also cultivated in a smaller scale. Currently, there are no other species that have been introduced for cultivation in Argentina. Characteristics of the forestry sectorProduction and trade Argentina's exports of forestry products began in earnest in the 1990s. However, as a producer of primary goods with low value added, the country experienced an overall trade deficit that ran from US$500 million to US$1 billion from 1992 to 2002. With the sharp devaluation of the peso in 2002, exports of Argentine forest product were given a shot in the arm. Argentine goods became more attractive and exports began to increase, especially for high-value-added products. Between 2002 and 2004, exports increased from US$300 million to about US$700 million. =Wood and furniture= During 2005, the success of the forestry industry in Argentina continued. Compared to the years 2000 and 2001, the trade surplus for wood and furniture products increased dramatically. The year 2005 was the fourth consecutive year that this sector experienced a trade surplus. It is estimated that for one hectare of cultivated forest, the industry produces 400 tons of wood. Moreover, the average value of a cubic meter of wood boards from cultivated forests is US$70 to US$80. In some cases, there are boards that run between US$200 to US$250 and there is a small niche of specific types of boards with prices up to US$400. The area between Misiones, Corrientes, and Entre R√≠os is the major producer of wood products, and represents 65 percent of the total production in Argentina. In terms of the major destinations of Argentina's exports of wood and furniture products, the United States, Brazil, Spain, and Chile continue to be the most important markets. In 2005, both South Africa and the Dominican Republic emerged as markets for this sector. China in 2005 also increased its demand for forestry products from Argentina, but they are mainly low-value-added products. Some of the most important exports goods from Argentina are fiber and particleboards, plywood, wood boxes and containers, and wood handles for tools. Imports of wood and furniture in 2005 experienced an increase of 52 percent compared to the previous year. This increase was mainly for products such as staves and barrels for the wine industry, boxes, and other products for packing. These imports in particular experienced a US$25 million increase compared to 2004, which represents 25 percent of the total imported goods in 2005. There are also other products such as cork products as well as paper and cardboard products in which imports have increased. =Cellulose pulp= Argentina is the third biggest producer of cellulose pulp in Latin America. As of 2005, Argentina produced 1.5 million tons. The major plants are located in Misiones and they use pinewood as their raw material. The most important plants in this region are Alto Paran√° S.A. and Papel Misionero S.A. There are also other plants that use fiber from eucalyptus as raw material for both the production of cellulose fiber and paper. Pulp mill dispute There are also other issues that can make some aspects of the industry uncertain. Currently there is a dispute between Uruguay and Argentina over two cellulose plants that are being built on the Uruguayan side of the R√≠o de la Plata, which forms the border between the two countries. This dispute began after Argentine environmentalists alleged that the plants would pollute the river that divides the two countries, and asserted that Uruguay had not provided the necessary information on the environmental impact of the plants. In protest, Argentine environmentalists blocked traffic on the Libertador General San Mart√≠n Bridge and General Artigas Bridge, the two main international bridges connecting the two countries. As of now, the Argentine and Uruguay government have not been able to resolve the issue. This impasse could possibly slow down the development and introduction of new technologies for the forestry sector. Such technologies are crucial to increase cultivated land and production. Argentina has the potential to become a major cluster for the worldwide industry, but more investment is necessary. =Paper production= Argentina is the fourth largest producer of paper, paperboard and corrugated fiberboard in Latin America. As of the 2004, the sector produced about 1.4 million tons. The production experienced an increase of 11 percent compared to 2003. However, this production only satisfied 67 percent of domestic demand. The paper production in Argentina is primarily for packing (48 percent), printing (25 percent), and newspapers (13 percent). The forestry sector in Argentina experienced significant growth rates between 2001 and 2006. An estimated 1.115 million hectares (2.8 million acres) were planted as of 2005. It is estimated that this year, between 40,000 and 50,000 hectares (100,000 to 124,000 acres) will be cultivated mainly in the Mesopotamia region (the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, and Entre R√≠os). Among the most important species cultivated in the country are pines and eucalyptus, representing 50 and 30 percent of production, respectively. Major factors that have contributed to the industry's growth have been the land quality, the relative lower price of the land compared to other markets such as Brazil and Chile, and Law 25,080, which has been in effect since 1999. This law, besides providing economic incentives for small and medium producers, has also created important fiscal benefits to attract both domestic and foreign investments. The outlook for the forestry sector is positive in the short term. The relative short average periods for harvest and Brazil's current young cultivation should help Argentina become more competitive in the wood market. However, there are still challenges that the industry needs to overcome to exploit its potential, such as the development of infrastructure in various forestry areas.Rubio, Nicolas. \\"Argentina‚Äôs Forestry Sector\\".

Government policy Argentina currently does not have restrictions limiting the cultivation of forests in private properties. Only native forests are regulated by the government contingent upon the approval of the cultivation project by local government. =Law Number 13,272= This law is intended to conserve the forests, prohibit deforestation, and the irrational use of forestry products. It also specifies that any investment project carried out in natural forests needs to be approved by the Argentine government. =Law Number 24,856= This law oversees activities such as implementation of projects, restoration, maintenance, protection, and sustainable management of native forests. It also establishes rules for the commercialization of forestry products and non-forestry products from native forests. =Law Number 25,089= This law was implemented in January 1999 and is intended to increase land development by the Argentine forestry industry to 3 million hectares of cultivated forest in 10 years. It also establishes an inventory process for planted forests and it has provided for the establishment of agreements with international organizations that focus on development and technology transfer for this industry. This law also provides tax benefits and economic support for Argentine and foreign investors. * Tax benefits: ** Tax stability for 30 to 50 years for companies with forestry investment projects ** Accelerated amortization of income taxes ** Accelerated return of value-added tax (21 percent) ** Tax breaks on assets, real estate, sales, and gross income from state and municipal governments ** Accelerated depreciation of capital goods * Economic Support ** The Argentine government will finance up to 100 percent for projects with 700 hectares, 50 percent for forests between 701 and 1,000 hectares, 30 percent for extensions between 1,001 and 2,000 hectare, and 15 percent for more than 2,001 hectares Support for projects focused in plantation of traditional species and enrichment of native forests Forestry by region A path in a jungle in Misiones with its characteristic red soil Among the most important regions in Argentina for the industry are the provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, Entre R√≠os, and Buenos Aires. These four provinces form the country's eastern border with Uruguay and Brazil, and comprise 80% of the total cultivated area. Forests are composed of the following species: * 50% - Pine (Misiones, Corrientes, Entre R√≠os, Patagonia, Central and Northwest areas of the country) * 30% - Eucalyptus (Misiones, Corrientes, Entre R√≠os, Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe, Central and Northwest area of the country) * 16% - Willow and aspen (Buenos Aires, R√≠o Negro, Mendoza, Neuqu√©n) * 4% - Other broad-leaved trees The Argentine forestry sector has strengthened considerably in the last 15 years. The reasons behind this growth include: * Great extensions of undeveloped land for the forestry industry at low prices that do not compete with other industries such as agriculture * The Law 25,080 which provides economic incentives and favorable investment environment for the industry (including fiscal stability) * No restrictions for foreign investment During the 1990s, Argentina was a net importer of forestry products with high value-added (i.e. paper, cardboard, furniture, etc.) and a net exporter of primary and low value added goods (i.e. wood, cellulose pulp). This situation has changed especially after the currency devaluation in 2002 and foreign investment during the 1990s. Now, the country has begun producing a number of high value added products such as fiberboards and finished products such as furniture. Argentina is now in a position to become an important producer of forest products in the future. The industry is focusing on the production of more high value added products, and increasing rates of plantation. Other issues There are both negative and positive factors that currently affect the forestry industry in Argentina that need to be considered by investors. Argentina still has low land prices relative to other countries involved in forestry (e.g., Chile and Brazil). It is estimated that the cost of land varies between US$250 and US$450 per hectare ($101/acre - $182/acre). Also, Misiones and Corrientes have estimated cultivation costs of US$800 to US$1,000 and US$400 to US$500 per hectare respectively. The soil, especially in the area of Misiones and Corrientes, is specially suited for forestry, and has one of the highest growth rates for forestry in the world. Another issue is the lack of interest of the SAGPyA (Secretaria de Agricultura, Ganaderia, Pesca y Alimentacion) to promote the forestry industry. Even though there is a law implemented for the promotion of the forestry sector, it is not a priority for the government. In many cases, economic support for cultivation projects has been delayed. For instance, it is not clear if Law 25,008 will be extended in the year 2009 or if it will be modified. In 2006, the Argentine Forestry Association-Mesopotamia (Afome) complained to the Ministry of Economy about how SAGPyA has managed the Law 25,008. Afome blames SAGPyA for not reaching cultivation goals established in 1999 due to delayed promotional payments.

It was located on what is now known as the Shrewsbury to Wolverhampton Line. History The station was opened by the Shrewsbury and Birmingham Railway in 1849, and was shared with the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company. The line through the station was taken over by the London and North Western Railway. It initially closed to traffic just a few months after opening, but reopened again in the summer of 1850.Disused Stations - Admaston Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 3 August 2017 It only appeared in LNWR timetables for their Shrewsbury to Stafford route in its early years, as Great Western Railway trains between Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton ran through without stopping there, though the line had come under joint ownership by 1854. Platforms, a station house and a brick single storey ticket office on the down (westbound) side were eventually provided in the final years of the nineteenth century, by which time GWR trains were calling on a regular basis (though not particularly frequently - the 1895 timetable had three trains to Birmingham and two to Stafford operated by the respective companies, whilst six trains called in the other direction). After the 1923 Grouping, joint operation passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and GWR. The station remained quite modestly served thereafter (eight eastbound and seven westbound calls by 1947), though the line itself carried heavy volumes of freight and passenger traffic. The line then passed on to the Western Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948, with Admaston becoming an unstaffed halt at the end of June 1952. In January 1963, the line and station were transferred from the Western Region of British Railways to the London Midland Region. Shortly afterwards consent to closure was granted by the then Transport Secretary Ernest Marples the following May. The last train called here on the evening of 5 September 1964, with closure to passengers coming into effect two days later.

Description AIDS/LifeCycle is a charity event to raise money for HIV/AIDS services and raise HIV/AIDS awareness. Participants (riders, roadies, and staff) raise money throughout the year. In the first week of June, the riders cycle from San Francisco to Los Angeles with the support of the roadies and staff. For seven days, ALC passes through communities in California as a memorial to those who have died of AIDS and as an event to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS. Each day of riding can range from 40-100+ miles. At the end of each day of riding, cyclists arrive in a camp to eat, shower, and rest before riding out again the next morning. Currently (as of ALC 6-8) the route is a total of about 545 miles. Mileage may change due to route/road constructions and availability of campsites.

Traditions *Riderless Bicycle *Red Dress Day - During the fifth and shortest day of the ride, participants wear the color red, usually a red dress. *Ginger Brewlay - She is usually on the roughest hill of the day, cheering on the riders and posing with them. Her outfits are outlandish and creative. *The Chicken Lady - A long-time rider who usually wears chicken-themed items, including a colorful skirt, silver stockings, a purse shaped like a chicken and over-the-top sunglasses. *Teams - Riders have the option, but are not required, to join a team when they sign up for the event. There are usually dozens of social and corporate teams on the ride. *Talent Show *Rest Stops Themes - Most, if not all, of the 25+ rest stops during the AIDS/Lifecycle embrace a different theme. The rest stop roadies dress in costume, decorate the area and often provide a fun and memorable photo opportunity for riders. Rest stop 4, the last rest stop on most days of the ride, is known for its elaborate costumes and choreographed performances. *Day 6: Candlelight Vigil - On the shore of Ventura Beach. Up to 3,000 people create a massive rectangle of silent reverence for those lost and those suffering. *Bradley - The kids, faculty and parents from the local Bradley school put on a barbecue to raise money for extracurricular activities. The kids dress in ALC tee-shirts and sell buttons and pens. *Otter Pop Stop - On day two, the longest day, folks from the Bay Area drive down to the historic Mission Soledad, in Soledad, California, and create a rest stop with a crazy beach party like atmosphere where frozen Otter Pops are served to the riders, with music, dancing, and outlandishly costumed volunteers in tutus. Camping Riders, roadies and staff end each of the first 6 days in camp, a fully supported campsite with portable toilets, shower trucks, hot meals, medical services, bike mechanics and more. Tents are provided by AIDS/Lifecycle, but participants do need to bring sleeping bags. Training rides The AIDS/LifeCycle community holds training rides throughout the year. These rides are coordinated by AIDS/Lifecycle Training Ride Leaders, volunteers who have completed at least 1 AIDS/Lifecycle and an official Training Ride Leader certification. Rides are listed on the AIDS/Lifecycle Training Ride Calendar and vary by category, terrain and length.

Nomenclature Although known to art historians by a conjectural Dutch version of his name, all contemporary documentary references use the French forms Jean-Charles-Dominique or Jean-Charles-Donat (with or without hyphens). The Acad√©mie's documents spell his surname \\"Vambec\\" or \\"Vambecq\\", but he signed his work \\"J. Van Beecq\\", \\"JVBeecq\\", or \\"I. Van Beec\\". Life According to the record of his death in the minutes of the French Acad√©mie, van Beecq was born in Amsterdam in 1638. His earliest dated work, a capriccio view of Antwerp was painted in 1673. His paintings usually depict warships and battles out at sea, or scenes of harbours with palatial classical buildings standing directly on the waterfront. =England= Shipping in an Estuary Temple of the Sun in Tenochtitlan, engraving by Moyse Jean-Baptiste Fouard after a drawing by Van Beecq. Most of his pictures of 1677‚Äì9 are of English subjects, and the art historian Gary Schwartz has proposed that should be identified with the \\"Vanbeck\\" recorded as being admitted to the Painter- Stainers Company in the City of London in 1677. The following year the same Vanbeck is recorded as living with a younger painter, Adriaen van Diest in Durham Yard, leading Schwartz to suggest that, in view of his style, he may have been a pupil of van Diest's grandfather, Willem, and had his origins, like van Diest, in The Hague. The National Maritime Museum at Greenwich has two paintings by him showing English warships: The Royal Prince before the Wind, (1679) and Shipping in an Estuary (1701). The latter, an idealised sunlit scene, painted after his move to France, is his last signed and dated work. =France= Van Beecq was in Paris by July 1680, when he presented a painting at a meeting of the Acad√©mie royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, of which he became a member on 26 April 1681. He benefited from the support of Charles Lebrun, the Acad√©mie's patron and founder, who persuaded it, contrary to its usual practice, to pay the artist the full amount of his entry emolument at once, for \\"important reasons\\" which are not recorded. By 1685 there were four paintings by van Beecq in place at Louis XIV's new palace at Marly, the decoration of which was organised by Le Brun and Jules Hardouin Mansart. They are known to have included views of Algiers Bombarded by Night and The Cannonade of Chios. The latter, the only surviving painting by van Beecq of which a contemporary documentary record exists, is now in the collection of Mus√©e de la Marine in Paris. The king also owned van Beecq's painting of the bombardment of Genoa by Admiral Dusquesne in 1684; two versions were painted, though neither is known today. Surviving correspondence shows that drawings by eyewitnesses of the bombardment were gathered by government officials as source material to supply to van Beecq, to ensure the accuracy of his representation. A large engraving on two plates was made after the painting by Moyse Jean-Baptiste Fouard. In 1691 Fouard engraved a series of plates after van Beecq's designs (only one of which is signed by the two men) for the French translation of a history of the Spanish invasion of Mexico, called Histoire de la conqu√™te du Mexique ou de la Novelle Espagne. He was expelled from the Acad√©mie in 1694, depriving him of the prestigious title of peintre du roi, but readmitted three years later. He did not attend any meetings after 1701, and the minutes of the Acad√©mie record his death in April 1722, aged 83.

It reflects on the temporary nature, or ephemerality, of the human condition. The general sentiment is often expressed in wisdom literature throughout history and across cultures, although the specific phrase seems to have originated in the writings of the medieval Persian Sufi poets. It is known in the Western world primarily due to a 19th-century retelling of Persian fable by the English poet Edward FitzGerald. It was also notably employed in a speech by Abraham Lincoln before he became the sixteenth President of the United States. History An early English citation of \\"this too shall pass\\" appears in 1848: It was also used in 1852, in a retelling of the fable entitled \\"Solomon's Seal\\" by the English poet Edward FitzGerald.in Polonius: A Collection of Wise Saws and Modern Instances In it, a sultan requests of King Solomon a sentence that would always be true in good times or bad; Solomon responds, \\"This too will pass away\\". On September 30, 1859, Abraham Lincoln recounted a similar story: Origin of the fable The fable retold by FitzGerald can be traced to the first half of the 19th century, appearing in American papers by at least as early as 1839. It usually involved a nameless \\"Eastern monarch\\". Its origin has been traced to the works of Persian Sufi poets, such as Rumi, Sanai and Attar of Nishapur. Attar records the fable of a powerful king who asks assembled wise men to create a ring that will make him happy when he is sad. After deliberation the sages hand him a simple ring with the Persian words \\"This too shall pass\\" etched on it, which has the desired effect to make him happy when he is sad. It also, however, became a curse for whenever he is happy. This story also appears in the Jewish folklore. Many versions of the story have been recorded by the Israel Folklore Archive at the University of Haifa. Jewish folklore often casts Solomon as either the king humbled by the adage, or as the one who delivers it to another. In some versions the phrase is simplified even further, appearing as only the Hebrew letters gimel, zayin, and yodh, which begin the words \\"Gam zeh ya'avor\\" (, gam zeh yaavor), \\"this too shall pass.\\" See also * Impermanence * Memento mori * Ozymandias * Sic transit gloria mundi * Ubi sunt * Yorick References Category:English phrases Category:Adages ","title":"This too shall pass"},{"id":"17978206","text":"The Alabama International Trade Center was created in 1979 as one of the first international SBDCs.

Founded in 1803 by anti-slavery Quakers, the village was an early center of abolitionist activity and a well-known haven for fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. The village center is relatively little altered since the antebellum period. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Districts in 1974, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2005. Description and history The town of Mount Pleasant was established in 1803 by Robert Carothers, an Irishman from Virginia, and Jesse Thomas, a Quaker from North Carolina. The town was founded in part out of anti-slavery sentiment by North Carolina Quakers who specifically sought a place where their slaves could be freed. The town was platted in 1804, and its original street and lot plan are intact from this period, organized around the intersection of Union and Concord Streets. Additional areas west of the original plat were added in 1815 and 1817, the town has experienced growth as a supply center for the War of 1812. Although the town boasted a mix of residential and commercial properties on its main roads in the 1820s, it is now almost entirely residential. Prominent non- residential buildings include the Friends Meetinghouse built by the Quakers in 1814 to house the first yearly meeting established west of the Allegheny Mountains. The village is important for the role it played in the antislavery movement and the Underground Railroad. From an early date, the strong Quaker population in Mount Pleasant preached and practiced its abolitionist views and published antislavery literature, such as Benjamin Lundy's \\"Genius of Universal Emancipation.\\" A station on the Underground Railroad, the town was a refuge for fugitive slaves and a welcome home for free blacks. Residents built and administered a school for free black children, and in 1848 established a Free Produce Store which sold no products produced by slave labor. The town was also integrated to some degree, with African-American living among whites, generally as servants. African Americans also owned property, but this was generally in the outlying areas of the community. The village's economic fortunes stagnated after the American Civil War came to an end because it was bypassed by the railroads.

Kimball III (December 20, 1943 - July 6, 2011) was an American author and journalist who spent 25 years as a sports columnist for the Boston Herald before retiring in 2005. Considered one of the foremost boxing writers of his era, he is the author of Four Kings: Leonard, Hagler, Hearns, Duran, and the Last Great Era of Boxing (2008) and \\"Manly Art: They can run -- but they can't hide\\" (2011). In collaboration with John Schulian, he edited two anthologies, \\"At The Fights: American Writers on Boxing\\" (2011) and \\"The Fighter Still Remains: A Celebration of Boxing in Poetry and Song from Ali to Zevon\\" (2010). Since 1997 he had written the weekly ‚ÄòAmerica at Large‚Äô column for The Irish Times in Dublin, Ireland, and had contributed to a number of boxing websites.  Youth and Education  The son of a career Army officer, Kimball was born in Grass Valley, California, but lived all over the world as a boy, including stops in Taiwan and Germany. After graduating from high school in San Antonio, Texas, he attended the University of Kansas, and later the Iowa Writer's Workshop. He became increasingly involved in the counterculture of the late 1960s, and although he had originally attended college on a Naval ROTC scholarship, later in the decade his participation in the antiwar movement led to several arrests.  Early career  In the late 1960s Kimball (with John Fowler‚Äîwhose Abington Book Shop\\"City Lights\\" of the midwestMcCrary, Jim (2017) \\"Grist\\" (via From a Secret Location) was right next to (east of) the Gaslight Tavern on Oread in Lawrence, KS‚Äîand Charles Plymell)Grist: No. 8 (1966) Fowler, Kimball, Plymell\\"Writing into a Void\\" (2012) European Journal of American Studies, Vol. 7, No. 1 was an editor for the influential Midwestern magazine Grist before moving to New York, where he was heavily involved in the literary scene revolving around the Poetry Project at St. Mark‚Äôs-in-the-Bouwerie and the Lion‚Äôs Head saloon in Greenwich Village. After working at the Scott Meredith Literary Agency in New York, Kimball returned to Kansas in 1970, where he waged a colorful campaign from the Gaslight for the office of Douglas County sheriff. As a freelance writer he contributed to diverse publications such as The Paris Review, Rolling Stone, The Realist, and Scanlan‚Äôs Monthly, and his novel, Only Skin Deep, was published in 1968. In the early 1970s he was also an editor for the Cambridge (Mass.) literary journal Ploughshares.  Journalistic career  In early 1972 Kimball became the sports editor of the Boston Phoenix, and for nearly a decade there worked on a Phoenix staff that at various times included Joe Klein, Jon Landau, Janet Maslin, Curt Raymond, Sidney Blumenthal and David Denby, while nurturing the early careers of fellow sportswriters Mike Lupica, Michael Gee, and Charles P. Pierce. In 1980 he became a columnist for the Herald, and for the next quarter-century covered major sporting events around the world, including Super Bowls and World Series, NBA Finals and the Olympic Games, golf‚Äôs four majors and Ryder Cups, Wimbledon and the America‚Äôs Cup yacht races. He covered nearly 400 world title fights, and was the 1985 recipient of the Nat Fleischer Award for Excellence in Boxing Journalism. Kimball also received ‚ÄòBest Column‚Äô awards from the Boxing Writers Association of America, the Golf Writers Association of America, Boston Magazine, and United Press International.

From training camps to locker rooms, author George Kimball was there to cover every body shot, uppercut, and TKO. Inside stories full of drama, sacrifice, fear, and pain make up this treasury of boxing tales brought to life by one of the sport's greatest writers. About the Author George Kimball spent 25 years as a sports columnist for the Boston Herald and in 1986 received the Nat Fleischer Award for Excellence in Boxing Journalism.

It was written by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson. The song was one of the band's first compositions and remained unreleased for seven years before being released on the band's second EP, The First Session on August 26, 1997. Although not as well known as Hole's later songs, \\"Turpentine\\" is a notable song for the band as it is often cited as \\"the first Hole song.\\" Origin and recording \\"Turpentine\\" was reputedly the first song written for Hole, with the music composed Eric Erlandson and the lyrics written by Courtney Love. The song is known to have been written as early as November 1989 as Hole performed the song during their third live show in Huntington Beach, California on November 11, 1989. However, some of the lyrics of the song seem to have been written by Love earlier with the line \\"my water breaks like turpentine\\" appearing in a poem written by Love in the mid- late 1980s which also features lines that would later appear in \\"Loaded\\", a track on Hole's debut album, Pretty on the Inside (1991). The first and only known studio version of the song was recorded on March 17, 1990 during Hole's first studio session at Rudy's Rising Star, a \\"tiny ... basement studio\\" in Los Angeles, California after Sympathy for the Record Industry's president, Long Gone John, gave the band a budget of $500 to record their first single, \\"Retard Girl.\\"Mermis, John. \\"[He] gave the band 500 bucks for a recording session. She told me she wanted to do this song called 'Retard Girl' and that intrigued me.\\" Extract from an interview from Courtney Love: The E! True Hollywood Story, broadcast on October 5, 2003. CompositionMusic= The musical content of \\"Turpentine\\" is highly influenced by punk rock, noise rock and no wave music. The song's chord progression shifts throughout the song with the verse riff being composed with four chord progression. The pre-chorus uses a two chord progression which is widely used in punk music and further progressions baring resemblance to no wave music. In the studio version of the song, the guitars are tuned down and throughout the entirety of the song use distortion and the drums are also emphasised in the song. The song follows an A-B-C-A musical form. =Lyrics= \\"Turpentine\\" is typical of Love's writing standards at the time, using sardonic and cryptic imagery as well as the frequent usage of derogatory terms. The song, however, also uses religious imagery, most obvious in the line \\"I know all you devils by your Christian names\\" and \\"bless my body / bless my soul.\\" One interpretation of the song's lyrics refers to it as Love's \\"mockery on ... Christianity.\\" However, there are also several allusions to themes such as alienation and self-image, both of which are significant themes in lyrics on Pretty on the Inside and also Live Through This (1994). One of the main lyrics of the song (\\"my water breaks like turpentine\\") was also later featured as a lyric on \\"20 Years in the Dakota,\\" a song recorded in 1992 and released on the \\"Beautiful Son\\" single and similarly, a large proportion of the lyrics were featured, alongside the lyrics to \\"Burn Black,\\" on \\"Amen,\\" an outtake from Nobody's Daughter (2010).

Backward design of curriculum typically involves three stages:Wiggins, G. & McTighe, J. (1998).Wiggins, G. & McTighe, J. (2011).Buehl, D. (2000) # Identify the results desired (big ideas and skills) #* What the students should know, understand, and be able to do #* Consider the goals and curriculum expectations #* Focus on the \\"big ideas\\" (principles, theories, concepts, point of views, or themes) # Determine acceptable levels of evidence that support that the desired results have occurred (culminating assessment tasks) #* What teachers will accept as evidence that student understanding took place #* Consider culminating assessment tasks and a range of assessment methods (observations, tests, projects, etc.) #Design activities that will make desired results happen (learning events) #*What knowledge and skills students will need to achieve the desired results #*Consider teaching methods, sequence of lessons, and resource materials Backward design challenges \\"traditional\\" methods of curriculum planning. In traditional curriculum planning, a list of content that will be taught is created and/or selected.Wiggins, G. & McTighe, J. (1998). In backward design, the educator starts with goals, creates or plans out assessments and finally makes lesson plans. Supporters of backward design liken the process to using a \\"road map\\".McTighe, J., & Thomas, R. S. (2003). In this case, the destination is chosen first and then the road map is used to plan the trip to the desired destination. In contrast, in traditional curriculum planning there is no formal destination identified before the journey begins. The idea in backward design is to teach toward the \\"end point\\" or learning goals, which typically ensures that content taught remains focused and organized. This, in turn, aims at promoting better understanding of the content or processes to be learned for students. The educator is able to focus on addressing what the students need to learn, what data can be collected to show that the students have learned the desired outcomes (or learning standards) and how to ensure the students will learn. Although backward design is based on the same components of the ADDIE model, backward design is a condensed version of these components with far less flexibility. Curriculum design, and instructional design Backward design is often used in conjunction with two other terms: curriculum design and instructional design. Curriculum design is the act of designing or developing curricula for students. Curricula may differ from country to country and further still between provinces or states within a country. A curriculum is based on benchmark standards deemed important by the government. Typically, the time frame of attainment of these outcomes or standards is set by physical age.What is Backward Design? Instructional design is a technology for the development of learning experiences and environments which promote the acquisition of specific knowledge and skill by students.Merrill, M. D., Drake, L., Lacy, M. J., Pratt, J. (1996). In addition, instructional design models or theories may be thought of as frameworks for developing modules or lessons that increase and enhance the possibility of learning and encourage the engagement of learners so that they learn faster and gain deeper levels of understanding.Ed Forest: Backward Design and Backward Course Design, Educational Technology There are numerous instructional design models available to instructors that hold significant importance when planning and implementing curriculum. Many of the models are quite similar in that they essentially all address the same four components in some form or another: the learners; the learning objectives; the method of instruction; and some form of assessment or evaluation. Based around those components, the instructor then has the opportunity to choose the design model and stages that work best for them in their specific situation. This way they can achieve the appropriate learning outcomes or create a plan or strategy for improvement. As learners and instructors may vary, instructional design must be a good fit for both and therefore different models can have behavioral, cognitive or constructivist roots. History Ralph W. Tyler introduced the idea of \\"backward design\\" (without using this particular term) in 1949 when referring to a statement of objectives. A statement of objectives is used to indicate the kinds of changes in the student to be brought about so that instructional activities can be planned and developed in a way likely to attain these objectives.Tyler, R.W. (1949). The term \\"backward design\\" was introduced to curriculum design in 1998/99 by Jay McTighe and Grant Wiggins (Understanding by Design). The somewhat idiosyncratic term is ultimately due to James S. Coleman, who in his Foundations of Social Theory (1990) used it to parallel the term \\"backward policing\\" which he coined for a policy which he found in the production process in Honda factories. Advantages According to Doug Buehl (2000),Buehl, D. (2000). advantages of backward design include: * Students are not as likely to become so lost in the factual detail of a unit that they miss the point of studying the original topic. * Instruction looks toward global understandings and not just daily activities; daily lessons are constructed with a focus on what the overall \\"gain\\" from the unit is to be. * Assessment is designed before lesson planning, so that instruction drives students toward exactly what they need to know. The importance of assessment  The primary starting point for backward design is to become familiar with the standards/outcomes for the grade level and curriculum being taught. The second part of curriculum planning with backward design is finding appropriate assessments. It can be difficult for \\"traditional\\" educators to switch to this model because it is hard to conceptualize an assessment before deciding on lessons and instruction. The idea is that the assessments (formative or summative) should meet the initial goals identified. Wiggins and McTighe (2008) also utilize the \\"WHERE\\" approach during the assessment stage of the process.Wiggins, G. & McTighe, J. (2008) * W stands for students knowing where they are heading, why they are heading there, what they know, where they might go wrong in the process, and what is required of them. * H stands for hooking the students on the topic of study. * E stands for students exploring and experiencing ideas and being equipped with the necessary understanding to master the standard or outcome being taught. * R stands for providing opportunities for students to rehearse, revise, and refine their work. * E stands for student evaluation. Other models of instructional design ADDIE model of design =ADDIE model of design= Most models of instructional design follow the core elements found in the ADDIE model of design: analyze (designer develops an understanding of the desired outcomes and the learner's knowledge and skills); design (documents learning outcomes, assessment tools, exercise and content); develop (creating the learning materials); implement (the created learning materials are distributed to the learners); and evaluate (the effectiveness of the learning materials is assessed and documented).ADDIE model. Many instructional designers and training developers use the ADDIE model as a generic process for creating other models. This model is purposely not designed to be followed in a linear step-by-step fashion, but rather is circular so that it is possible to re-trace steps once data have been collected and analyzed.Gustafson, K.L. & Branch, R.M. (2002). Dick and Carey Model =Dick and Carey model (also known as the systems approach model)= The Dick and Carey model is made up of nine different stages which are meant to be executed in parallel, rather than linear, fashion, but this model still follows the same basic instructional design pattern of the ADDIE model, as does backward design. The Dick and Carey model focuses on the interrelationship between context, content, learning and instruction, and addresses instruction as an entire system.Instructional technology/Instructional design. In this model, all of the components of this model work together to enable learners to meet the desired learning outcomes. The model includes the following components: # Identify instructional goals # Conduct instructional analysis # Identify entry behaviors and learner characteristics # Write performance objectives # Develop assessment instruments # Develop instructional strategy # Develop and select instructional materials # Design and conduct formative evaluation of instruction # Design and conduct summative evaluation. Both the Dick and Carey model and the backward design model are goal and objective oriented; assessment is created based on learning objectives and goals, and instruction is created based on evaluation and assessment. The Dick and Carey model, however, is a more systemic model in that making changes to components affects other components and, therefore, the changes occur in parallel. In the more linear backward design model, the steps are non-flexible which means that skipping or changing steps is not an option. =Kemp instructional design model (also known as the Morrison, Ross and Kemp model)= The Kemp instructional design model is a holistic form of instructional design, taking into account all factors of the learning environment.Instructional design models and theories. It is very systemic and also follows the same basic design pattern of the ADDIE model. The Kemp model is much more focused on the individual learner needs and goals by following nine components: # Identify instructional problems, and specify goals for designing an instructional program # Examine learner characteristics that should receive attention during planning # Identify subject content, and analyze task components related to stated goals and purposes # State instructional objectives for the learner # Sequence content within each instructional unit for logical learning # Design instructional strategies so that each learner can master the objectives # Plan the instructional message and delivery # Develop evaluation instruments to assess objectives # Select resources to support instruction and learning activities. The largest difference between backward design and the Kemp model is that the Kemp model is meant to be used on a smaller scale. This allows for easier adaptations to be made for individual lessons and individual learners. It also places more emphasis on support and service for learners and instruction.Kemp design model. Supporting research using backward design * Shumway and Barrett (2004) used the backward design model to strengthen pre- service teachers' attitudes towards teaching. The experience appears to have allowed the pre-service teachers to do exactly that after using both the backward design model and a modified backward design. These pre-service teachers became more excited about their teaching profession and became better prepared as student teachers through the backward design that they had experienced. Shumway, S. & Berrett, J. (2004). * In the article, Essential Questions ‚Äî Inclusive Answers (C.M. Jorgenson, 1995), Souhegan High School followed the steps of a backwards design model to reach all levels of student ability and create a school that promoted full inclusion. They concluded that all involved had experienced a richer experience because of the implementation of the backward design model.Jorgensen, C. M. (1995). * In An Integration of \\"Backwards Planning\\" Unit Design with the \\"Two Step\\" Lesson Planning Framework (Jones et al., 2009), a framework for employing backward planning in designing individual lessons is provided. Educators are provided with an integrated framework and more importantly a case study of the backward lesson planning in action.Jones, K.A., Vermette, P.J., Jones, J.L. (2009). * In the article, Backward Design (Childre, Sands, and Pope, 2009), examples of backward design are shown improving learning at both the elementary and high school levels. The research targets the depth of understanding for all learners. The fact that much research avoids the inclusion of special needs students is noted. The traditional instructional approaches that fail to engage disabled students were not an issue when backward design was implemented. The backward design was found to provide meaning and relevance to all levels of students.Childre, A., Sands, J.R., Pope, S.T. (2009).  Application Here is a practical example of a 5th grade teacher developing a three-week unit on nutrition:Wiggins, G., & McTighe, J. (2011). Stage 1: Identify desired results Based on three curriculum expectations about nutrition (concepts about nutrition, elements of a balanced diet, and understanding eating patterns), the take-away message that the teacher wants his/her students to understand is \\"Students will use an understanding of the element of good nutrition to plan a balanced diet for themselves and others\\". Stage 2: Determine acceptable evidence The teacher has created an authentic task in which students will design a 3-day meal plan for a camp that uses food pyramid guidelines. The goal is a tasty and nutritionally balanced menu. Stage 3: Plan learning experiences and instruction The teacher first considers the knowledge and skills that students will need in order to complete the authentic assessment. Specifically, students will need to know about different food groups, human nutritional needs (carbohydrates, proteins, sugars, vitamins, minerals etc.), and about what foods provide these needs. They will need to know how to read nutrition labels. Resources will be a pamphlet from the UDSA on food groups, the health textbook, and a video \\"Nutrition for You\\". Teaching methods will include direct instruction, inductive methods, cooperative learning, and group activities. Criticisms Although this approach is widely accepted, the following are criticisms of the backward design approach:Cho, J., & Trent, A. (2005). * Difficulties in dealing with issues of validity and reliability * Textbooks and content standards do not always explicitly highlight the key concepts that students should learn * This approach provides teachers with little support about how to enhance understanding of their students and the way people learn * Teachers may misunderstand and misinterpret what their students should learn and what the big ideas are * Teacher effectiveness is measured more on the success of the students based on formulated assessments rather than ability to connect knowledge and skills to the needs and interests of students. Thus, lack of concern with social and cultural differences within the classroom * This process promotes lesson design through deductive reasoning. It does not fit in well in a constructivist ontology where the multifaceted nature of each student warrants consideration in planning. Similarly, it leaves little room for improvisation. * Teachers who know their curriculum and lesson trajectory that was led by Backwards Design may find that over adherence depletes their ability to focus on the learning experience and, with students or colleagues, induce new routes towards learning goals. A focus on principles of creative development such as contextual probing, improvisation, and juxtaposition may lead students to discover and know that which was unanticipated by the teacher or curriculum developers. In this, BD is incomplete or a potential recipe for student boredom. * Desired results may fall short of student potential. This model assumes the relative level of students, yet students may have the capacity to go beyond desired results. In assuming an end goal, students are not empowered to reach for their own goals or to follow a process that may lead to results that surprise both the student and the teacher. For the master teacher, it would be worthwhile to move past fixed goals and establish processes and student choices that lead them to relevant yet indeterminate locations.

History The first mass-immigration of Russians into Armenia occurred in the late 18th century when Molokans, a break-off sect of the Russian Orthodox Church, were deported to Amasya and Sevan, with some 5000 of their descendants still living in the country. After the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-1829 many Russians immigrated to Russian Armenia, establishing businesses and churches, and settling throughout mountainous northwest of the country. During Soviet period much more Russians immigrated into Armenian SSR and were engaged in the industry and clerical work. Outward migration of Russians increased after 1990, during the Dissolution of the Soviet Union, when economic conditions harshly deteriorated and Armenian became the official language of the country. Traditional Russian villages can still be found in Amassia, Ashotsk (Shirak), Sevan and Semyonvka (Gegharkunik Province), Filoetovo, Lermontov, Pushkino, Sverdlov, Lernantsk, Medovka, Lerhovit, Petrovka, Tashir and Mikaielovska (Lori Province).

The group was established in 2003 and is a 501(c)3. The organization was founded in 2003 by a group of Penn State Nittany Lions football players who turned an annual weightlifting competition into a fundraiser. Wide receiver Scott Shirley's father was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2003. When Shirley turned to his teammates for support, he discovered three others also had fathers battling the disease. Because so few (less than 200,000) Americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer, funds to fight the disease are scarce. Two of Shirley's teammates, offensive tackle Damone Jones and center Dave Costlow, saw an opportunity for student-athletes to use their high-profile and access to the media to promote awareness and raise funds for under-served charities. The three formed Uplifting Athletes later that year. Chapters Uplifting Athletes' founding chapter is at Penn State University. The football team there has designated the Kidney Cancer Association as their charity. To date the team has raised over $300,000 dollars for that charity. The Penn State chapter raises funds through its annual weight-lifting competition, Lift for Life. The competition features teams of four players competing in 11 strength and conditioning events, such as bench press and the \\"giant tire flip.\\" Subsequent chapters have formed at other universities. Some of the earlier chapters to form include: * A chapter at Boston College benefiting Ewing's sarcoma * One at Colgate University benefiting Ehlers-Danlos syndrome * A chapter at the University of Maryland benefiting cystic fibrosis. * A chapter at Ohio State University has also chosen to support the Kidney Cancer Association. Members of OSU's football team hold a video game tournament to support the cause. * There are also chapters and events in other states, from Florida to California. In 2009, the Penn State and University of Maryland chapters of Uplifting Athletes hosted events for Rare Disease Day. In June 2010, for the first time in Uplifting Athletes History, leaders of all current chapters met in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at the offices of Uplifting Athletes for a conference to share ideas and learn how to improve the performance of their chapters. The student-athletes learned from industry experts and guest lecturers about such things a better decision making, budgeting, and marketing.

All of its ranges are exclusively made in Italy, and distributed in 43 countries. History The company's original fragrance, Colonia, was created in 1916 in a small perfume factory in the center of Parma's historic old town, after which the company is named. At the time, the majority of commercial perfumes were much stronger and heavier in composition; so the unusually light and refreshing fragrance from Parma found wide success in Europe. In the 1930s the increasing popularity of the cologne led to an increase in production and the development of its distribution. The thirties and fifties are described as a 'golden age' for Acqua di Parma Colonia, which became very successful among members of high society, with celebrity clientele. Over the years, the brand expanded its product range, introducing a home collection that includes bathrobes and towels, and leather goods. In 1993 the brand was revived by entrepreneurs Luca di Montezemolo (former chairman of Ferrari), Diego Della Valle (President and CEO of Tod's, (a shoeware and leather company)) and Paolo Borgomanero (a major shareholder of lingerie retailer La Perla). In 1998 Acqua di Parma opened its first boutique on Milan's Via del Ges√π (in the Quadrilatero della moda district), followed by Paris‚Äôs Rue des Francs Bourgeois in Le Marais in 2012, Rome‚Äôs Piazza di Spagna in 2014, and Miami's Brickell City Centre in 2017. The company was acquired by multi-national LVMH in 2001,Acqua di Parma S.r.l. Company Overview on Bloomberg BusinessWeek and is now headquartered in Milan. In May 2008 the company entered the luxury spa market with the Blu Mediterraneo Spa in Porto Cervo (Sardinia). In 2013 the company opened its second spa at the Gritti Palace in Venice. In 2013, the company launched La Nobilt√† del Fare (‚ÄúThe Nobility of Work‚Äù), a book focusing on stories of Italian arts and crafts excellence, featuring photography by Giovanni Gastel. Etihad airways has a deal to supply exclusive leather packs containing samples of the signature fragrance and hand cream in their business, first class and ultimate Residence apartment.

The two singles in conjunction with the LP, \\"Glory Glory\\" and \\"Right On\\", were released several months before the album. \\"Glory Glory\\" reached #58 and #42 on Billboard and Cashbox (respectively) in the summer of 1970. At the end of that same year, \\"Right On\\" (the group's last single on Atlantic) \\"bubbled under\\" Billboard at #119 in December 1970. Reception Writing for Allmusic, critic Thom Jurek wrote the album; \\"is perhaps a bittersweet memory for the band's members, and indeed certainly is for their die-hard fans. Its pluses included some of the best (if under-recognized) songs Felix Cavaliere had ever written... There are some really uneven moments here, but there are some stellar ones as well, and no serious fan of the Rascals should be without at least half the cuts here. In fact, in many ways, this is a stronger effort than See had been...\\" Music critic Robert Christgau wrote of the album; \\"... those who ignore the atrocious title and listen to the songs are in for a surprise, because this is no Freedom Suite. In fact, it may be their most consistent regular-release LP--only one waste cut per side.\\" Inner cover photo The photo shows Dino Danelli, Gene Cornish, and Felix Cavaliere sitting on a rooftop.

Origins as live mascot  Fresno State adopted the Bulldog mascot in 1921, ten years after its founding as the Fresno Normal School. That year, which was also the first year of Football for the school, student body president Warren Moody and friends were continually greeted outside the main campus building by a white bulldog. The live dog was adopted by the student body and brought to football games as the mascot.  Transition to costumed mascot  Champ A live dog was brought to football games as the mascot for several decades, until the 1980s when the Bulldogs moved into a bigger stadium and became more successful. A costumed Bulldog was introduced in 1981, and was created by a student named Gary Johns. While Timeout has become a costumed mascot, there are still live bulldogs brought to the game. The costumed mascot, like those at other universities, has become a staple of the football experience, and will occasionally mock-fight the other mascot. A particularly memorable instance occurs when Fresno State plays the conference rival Louisiana Tech Bulldogs in the annual Battle for the Bone. In addition to being a costumed mascot, Timeout is also featured in other ways by the athletic department in promotions and contests. Timeout has been made into a bobblehead figure, sold in the Bulldog Shop on the campus of the university and provided in other promotions. Timeout is also used by the University as the information search engine for new students, in the feature \\"Ask Timeout\\".  Controversy  A controversy arose in the 2007 season when the athletic department made a sudden change to the look of the mascot that proved unpopular with many fans. The original Timeout was a gray color, with large jowls and snout, a small mouth with a harmless, protruding tongue. This was replaced by a brown colored 'bulldog' with a large, open mouth with many teeth, and less of a jowly snout. Many people complained that the new timeout looks less like a bulldog and more akin to a cat or cougar. Some people even protested, and one fan attended the games wearing a former timeout's costume. This caused the university to rethink the decision and allowed fans to make a vote between the newer design and the previous design. The previous design won, although it has been slightly altered it is more like the old mascot and most fans are now content with the costume. The costume was brought back at the start of the 2008 football season ReferencesExternal links * \\"Ask Timeout\\" * Collegian on new Timeout Category:Mountain West Conference mascots Category:Fresno State Bulldogs football ","title":"Timeout (mascot)"},{"id":"17979007","text":"A fifty-state strategy is a political strategy which aims for progress in all states of the United States of America, rather than conceding certain states as \\"unwinnable.\\" In a presidential campaign, it is usually implemented as an appeal to a broad base of the American public in an attempt to win, even if marginally, every state, since even a marginal victory is effectively total victory for electoral purposes. It can also refer to an overall long-term strategy for a political movement such as a political party. This strategy is very ambitious and, when used for a specific election, is typically abandoned as the election day draws nearer. In the vast majority of cases, winning a state's popular vote for president or senator ‚Äî even by a small margin ‚Äî means the state's entire representation in the election goes to the victor without being divided.For presidential elections, Maine and Nebraska do not follow the winner-takes-all rule for their Electoral College seats. For U.S. Senate elections, a state's two seats can both end up in an election at the same time if at least one seat was vacated at the right time. A fifty-state strategy requires a campaign to spend valuable resources in a rival's strongest states, when those resources could instead be concentrated in swing states that will become a total win or a total loss based on only a small difference in popular votes. AttemptsSuccessful= A president has won every state three times. In 1788 and 1792, George Washington won all the electoral votes running effectively unopposed, and in 1820, James Monroe, running unopposed, carried all twenty-three states in the union at that time (although one electoral vote was cast for John Quincy Adams and two electors died prior to casting votes). A complete fifty-state victory has not been accomplished since the fiftieth state was admitted into the union, though there have been several landslide victories: *In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt carried forty-six of forty-eight states, losing only Maine and Vermont. *In 1972 with Richard Nixon losing only Massachusetts *In 1984 with Ronald Reagan losing only his rival's home state of Minnesota. Both Nixon and Reagan also lost the District of Columbia, which has had presidential electors since the Twenty-Third Amendment in 1961. =Unsuccessful= In 1960, the first presidential election after the admission of Alaska and Hawaii, Richard Nixon pledged to visit all 50 states following his nomination at the Republican National Convention. Nixon was defeated in the general election by Democrat John F. Kennedy, in one of the closest presidential campaigns in American history. Many observers and commentators in succeeding years, such as Larry Sabato, have criticized Nixon's fifty-state pledge as a factor in his loss, suggesting that it forced him to place less emphasis on close states. Eight years later, in 1968, Nixon ran for president again and won a three-way race against Democrat Hubert Humphrey and independent candidate George Wallace. His achievement of visiting every state in his previous campaign made Nixon the first president ever to accomplish this task, though not during a winning campaign. =Mixed results= Howard Dean pursued an explicit \\"fifty-state strategy\\" as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, putting resources into building a Democratic Party presence even where Democrats had been thought unlikely to win federal positions, in hopes that getting Democrats elected to local and state positions, and increasing awareness of Democrats in previously conceded areas, would result in growing successes in future elections. Democrats who supported the strategy have said that abandoning red states as lost causes only allowed the Republican Party to grow even stronger in areas where it was unchallenged, resulting in lopsided losses for Democrats in even more races. During the 2008 United States presidential election, Barack Obama attempted a form of the fifty-state strategy to reach into deep red states to try to flip them. This was largely based on Obama's appeal during the primaries in very Republican states, like the Deep South, and the Great Plains states. In September, Obama scaled back his fifty-state strategy, abandoning Alaska and North Dakota and reducing staff in Georgia and Montana. John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate made winning Alaska very unlikely for Obama, and she also had strong support in North Dakota. Obama was ultimately able to win Virginia and Indiana, two states that had not voted Democratic since 1964, and North Carolina, last won by a Democrat in 1976. Additionally, the margins of victory in North Dakota, Georgia, and Montana were considerably closer than they had been in 2004.

The unit comprised six companies from Loudoun, two companies from Fauquier, one company from Fairfax and one company from Prince William. Initial regimental officers included: Lt. Colonel Charles B. Tebbs, Major Norborne Berkeley, John M. Orr - Quartermaster, Dr. Richard H. Edwards - Surgeon, Charles F. Linthicum - Chaplain. After Eppa Hunton's promotion to brigadier general in August 1863, in part based on his valor during the Battle of Gettysburg, particularly during Pickett's Charge (although the regiment suffered 90% casualties, either wounded like Hunton, killed or missing), Norborne Berkeley was promoted to command the 8th Virginia, and his brother Edmund became the Lieut. Colonel, his brother William Berkeley, Major, and Charles Berkeley became the senior Captain of what then became known as the \\"Berkeley Regiment.\\"Nonetheless, Norborne, William and Charles Berkeley were all in Union prisoner of war camps and their brother Edmund still recovering from his Gettysburg wound on August 9.John E. Divine, 8th Virginia Infantry (The Virginia Regimental Histories Series 1983) p. 26 History In May 1861, the Governor of Virginia, John Letcher, granted Eppa Hunton the commission of Colonel and ordered him to raise an infantry regiment from the northern Virginia area. Before the Battle of First Bull Run, the newly raised 8th Virginia was assigned to guard the numerous Potomac River crossings in Loudoun County, from which it had drawn four companies. The regiment fought in that battle to particular acclaim (suffering 30 casualties out of 450 effectives) and then returned to Leesburg, where they were engaged in the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October 1861 (suffering 43 wounded of the 375 engaged). In March 1862 the 8th was ordered to leave Loudoun to participate in the Peninsula Campaign as part of Pickett's Brigade. Lt. Col. Tebbs, who had been Loudoun's Commonwealth Attorney before the war and captain of the Loudoun Guards and secession advocate, relinquished his commission in April and took a civilian job with the Confederate States government in Richmond.Charles B. Tebbs pardon application available online at ancestry.com After a valiant charge at the Battle of Gaines' Mill in June (one of the Seven Days Battles in which the unit lost a total of 10 killed and 66 wounded), Col. Hunton referred to his men, who he felt would go against any odds seemingly without counting the cost, as The Bloody Eighth, a term he would use from then on.8th Virginia Infantry, 2nd Edition, John E. Devine, copyright 1983, H. E. Howard, Inc., Lynchburg, Virginia In September 1862, the 8th briefly returned to Leesburg, following the Battle of Second Bull Run, in which they participated although initially in reserve status, on their way to the Maryland Campaign. The following year, they took part in Pickett's Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg--they sustained 90% casualties, and only one officer (Charles Berkeley) and eleven men remained uninjured. Col. Hunton was promoted to Brigadier General the following month, and the regiment became known as the \\"Berkeley Regiment,\\" since Norborne Berkeley was promoted to command it, his brother Edmund became the Lieut. Colonel, with his brother William Berkeley as regimental Major, and brother Charles Berkeley as the senior Captain. The 8th Virginia remained with the Army of Northern Virginia throughout the remainder of the war, taking part (although in decreasing numbers) in the Overland Campaign, Richmond-Petersburg Campaign and the Appomattox Campaign. It reported 53 casualties between June 1 and December 31, 1864, including the popular former chaplain turned adjutant, Charles Linthicum, a Methodist minister from Frederick County, Maryland who initially joined to substitute for a member of his congregation who had a large family. On April 6, 1865, the majority of the regiment was killed or surrendered at the Battle of Sayler's Creek, including Gen. Hunton. The surgeon and eleven privates who escaped that battle were paroled 3 days later following Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Courthouse.

Preston (June 14, 1896 ‚Äì March 1, 1989) was an English-American engineer, ecologist, and conservationist. He helped found the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and worked to reclaim the land that is now Moraine State Park in Butler County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. Preston was a leading expert in glass technology. He studied birds throughout his life and published papers on the shapes and pigmentation of birds eggs, the distribution of the heights of their nests and their migration patterns. Preston also wrote three major papers on the mathematical characteristics of ecological rarity and commonness. BiographyEarly life= Frank W. Preston was born on May 14, 1896 in Leicester, England. He received three degrees from the University of London upon graduation in 1916. Following his college years, Preston worked as a civil engineer in Loughborough, England. He was drafted into the British Army during World War I but received a maximum exemption through the efforts of his employer. Preston was personally against the exemption and wrote the draft board in 1917 stating a desire to serve \\"in anything useful and suggested a brief exemption.\\" Preston first traveled to the United States in 1920. His employer, William Taylor, sent him to Rochester, New York to work with George Eastman of Eastman Kodak. Taylor had developed a lens polishing machine that Eastman was interested in using for his camera manufacturing business. Preston returned to England and earned a Ph.D. at London University in 1925. He returned to the United States the following year and established Preston Laboratories in 1926 or 1927 in Butler. =Work with glass= Frank W. Preston's \\"day job\\" centered around his business, Preston Laboratories, where he researched glass. He became known as a troubleshooter for glass companies like Corning Incorporated. He invented a glass-melting furnace that allowed Corning Glass to create its line of Corelle glassware. =Work as a conservationist= Preston Laboratories was located first in Butler, then later moved to Meridian, Pennsylvania. Meridian is just south of the Muddy Creek and Slippery Rock Creek valleys. These valleys are where Preston began his work as a conservationist. Preston walked throughout the valleys and mapped their geological and geographic attributes. He discovered glacial erratics, kettle hole bogs and figured out how the mammoths and mastodons migrated through the area during the ice ages. On a trip to the Muddy Creek Valley he noticed that despite the barren landscape that had been left by the oil wells and strip mines of the late 19th and early 20th century, the valley had a rich natural history of moraines. Preston worked to form the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, which purchased the land that became Moraine State Park, recreated the glacial landscape and preserved open spaces. Muddy Creek was dammed to form Lake Arthur. The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy worked with the state to reclaim the land. The mines were sealed, over 400 oil and gas wells were capped, and the land that had been stripped was covered again with back fill, and graded to resemble its former condition. The soil was specially treated with fertilizer to allow for the growth of thousands of trees, shrubs and grasses. Lake Arthur was completed in 1970 with the opening of Moraine State Park on May 23, 1970. Legacy Frank W. Preston continued to work in ecology and conservation in his adopted home state of Pennsylvania. He worked hand in hand with Maurice K. Goddard and Otto Emery Jennings in creating state parks in Western Pennsylvania including, McConnells Mill State Park, Maurice K. Goddard State Park and the Jennings Environmental Education Center which borders Moraine State Park to the north. Frank W. Preston died on March 1, 1989 in Butler, Pennsylvania. His Meridian property has since become a park owned and maintained by Butler Township following the death of his wife, Jane, in 2008. The property was willed to the township on the grounds that it never be timbered, mined, or drilled for natural gas. The park was named Preston Park in his honor.

If a user types in an incorrect Uniform Resource Locator (URL), for example \`http://wikipedia.orf\` instead of \`http://wikipedia.org\`, the ISP's DNS server will respond with a spoofed DNS response that redirects the user to an advertising web page. How it works Domain Name System (DNS) resolution is the process of translating a human-readable domain name (for example, \`en.wikipedia.org\`) into an IP address that computers can use. Every ISP runs a DNS server to allow their customers to translate domain names into IP addresses that computers understand and use. When an ISP's DNS server receives a request to translate a name, according to RFC the DNS server should return the associated IP address to the customer's computer which is then able to connect to the requested resource. When the ISP's DNS server receives a request for a name that is not recognized or is unavailable, some ISPs spoof the NX (null) response and instead return the IP address of a search or advertising page to the client. When the client is using a web browser, this will display a search page that contains possible suggestions on the proper address and a small explanation of the error. These search pages often contain advertising that is paid to the ISP.

Kingdom of Kei inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Kei: =Youko Nakajima= is a sixteen-year-old honors student in Japan who lives an ordinary life. Her primary worries are her naturally red hair (it was speculated by some students and a teacher that Youko might've dyed her hair red) and an inexplicable recurring dream that haunts her. When a man named Keiki suddenly appears at her school, he bows at her feet, swearing loyalty to her and offering protection. The school is attacked by a giant bird and she reluctantly accepts his oath. He gives her a sword and transports her across the Void Sea to the Twelve Kingdoms, where she ends up in the Kingdom of Kou. Youko is initially confused by the changes that have been brought onto her including a complete change in her appearance that she cannot see herself and being stranded in an unknown land with no means of returning home. These changes cause her to cry constantly, lapse into a state of helplessness, and complain about interfering in other beings' lives no matter what the situation. As she searches for Keiki, she finds herself constantly battling against Youma and being betrayed by civilians of Kou many times. While Youko becomes wary of trusting others, she eventually comes to befriend and trust a hanjyu named Rakushun. They escape to the Kingdom of En where Youko learns that she is the heir to the throne of the kingdom of Kei. Although she is initially reluctant, Youko accepts the position through her growth in the story. In a later story arc as the newly appointed queen, Youko learns of several problems in her kingdom including a revolt in the Province of Wa. Subsequently, she is pulled into the search for Taiki when the Tai general Risai beseeches Youko's help in finding him. As the ruler of Kei, she is given the regnal name of , because of her bright red hair and because her councillors initially view her as a child. Despite being a weak character to begin with, appearing very withdrawn and not wanting to do anything that would bring attention to herself, Youko grows in strength and maturity, becomes empathetic towards the people around her, thinking articulately about her actions (especially as queen) and continues to do so until the end of the series. =Aozaru= is the physical manifestation of the sentient spirit of the scabbard of the . The sword is a royal treasure to the kingdom of Kei and can only be wielded by the kingdom's rightful ruler ‚Äì as such, Youko is the only one who can draw the sword from its sheath. The sword was forged from a water demon that a previous great ruler of Kei had defeated while the scabbard was created from a long-tailed monkey demon. From the scabbard hangs a large jewel that can heal the one who holds it. The sword is not only capable of killing demons and sages and breaking substances like metal chains, but is also capable of presenting visions of the past, future, and things in the distance. The sword and scabbard must be kept together, otherwise the phantasms of the sword appear unchecked while the spirit of the scabbard is free to act as it wishes. When Youko loses the scabbard during an attack by Kikis, it appears in the form of Aozaru, the blue monkey, and taunts her with her doubts while the sword presents her with visions of things she does not wish to see. Eventually, Youko, overcoming her own doubts, kills the monkey and picks up the dead scabbard. Because she has killed Aozaru, the sword can be drawn from the sheath by anyone, though it can be wielded effectively only by Youko. =Seikyou= has long served as the Chosai, the top administrator, of Kei. Seikyou works to convince Youko that Koukan, the leader of the province of Baku, is a threat to her. After an assassin plots to kill Youko, Seikyou advises Youko that Koukan planned it and that she should execute him, but Keiki advises her to listen to Koukan before acting. When Youko orders Koukan to report, Seikyou has him attacked, forcing him to flee. Seikyou continually seeks to confuse Youko, telling her that Gahou is corrupt but advising that no action be taken against him, even though Seikyou secretly supports Gahou. He repeatedly seeks meetings with her when Keiki is not present so that the kirin cannot advise her. Youko, citing Seikyou's attempts to manipulate her and his failure to better safeguard her life, demotes Seikyou and appoints Keiki as chosai. When Youko leaves to study with Enho, Seikyou takes advantage of the situation to usurp Keiki's authority. When the rebels become a threat to Gahou, Seikyou sends a royal army force under general Jinrai to Shisui to scare the rebels into surrendering, unaware of Youko's presence in Wa because she told everyone in the court except Keiki that she was going to En. Seikyou's plan fails because Youko appears to take control of the royal forces and she redirects them against Gahou. After Shoukei convinces Youko that Seikyou is the mastermind behind the plot, Youko has him arrested. =Ei Province inhabitants= The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Kei's capital called the Ei Province: Keiki is a Kirin and the Saiho of Kei. Like all Kirin, Keiki abhors violence and prefers peaceful resolutions. Keiki appears as a very quiet and unemotional type, however does have caring qualities, especially seen towards the Kirin Taiki. In spite of being gruff and somewhat unapproachable, he is actually very sincere and loyal to Youko. Before meeting Youko, Keiki had taken a long time before selecting Youko's immediate predecessor, , to become the ruler of Kei. However, she was an ineffective ruler and fell in love with Keiki; her jealousy resulted in irrational acts including expelling all the women from the country and executing those who remained. Keiki contracted Shitsudou and in order to save his life, Joukaku abdicated her throne and killed herself after a short reign of six years and was posthumously known as . Cured of his illness, Keiki set out immediately to find a new monarch for Kei. He eventually finds Youko Nakajima, who had been living as a taika in Japan without any knowledge of the Twelve Kingdoms, and forcibly brings her back to the Twelve Kingdoms. They are separated on arrival and Keiki is captured and enchanted by Kourin, the kirin of Kou, so that he is unable to speak, summon his Shirei, or return to human form. Forced to appear before , Joukaku's sister and pretender to the throne of Kei, Keiki remains a prisoner of the false ruler until Youko, aided by the King of En, rescues him and frees him from his enchantment. After liberating Kei, Keiki continues to advise Youko on statecraft and politics. Enho is a wise man who lives in the city of Hokui in the province of Ei, where Keiki is the provincial leader. When Youko decides that she knows too little about her kingdom to rule wisely, Keiki sends her to Enho to study. Among the citizens of Kei, only Youko, Keiki, and Enho know of this arrangement. When she arrives, Enho's Rike is under attack by youma, and she acts to save Enho and the rike's other residents, but only Enho, a girl named Rangyoku, and her brother Keikei survive. When Youko leaves to visit Takuhou and Meikaku, the rike is attacked by Shoukou's men; Rangyoku is killed, Keikei is injured, and Enho is abducted and taken to Gahou. Youko moves to rescue Enho and learns from Suzu that Shoukou has taken Enho. When she captures Shoukou, he reveals that Enho is held by Gahou. Enho is rescued when Youko sends the royal army to attack Gahou and she appoints him as her Taishi, one of her chief advisors responsible for educating her on matters of state. Enho is known by a number of aliases; his true name is actually . Under the name , Enho was known as a legendary higher sage who served , a great and beloved Emperor of Kei, and was responsible for sealing Aozaru into the Suig≈´t≈ç's sheath. During this time, he was also known as . =Wa Province inhabitants= The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Kou's Wa Province: Shoukou is the governor of the Shisui Prefecture in the Wa Province of Kei. His corruption is so great and the taxes he demands are so high that he threatens the fragile stability of Youko's rule as the new Queen of Kei. When Shoukou's carriage runs over the blind boy Seishuu, Suzu convinces a resistance movement led by Koshou and Sekki that the time has come to rebel against Shoukou. Youko joins with the rebels when she discovers that Shoukou is responsible for abducting her mentor Enho. In the anime, Shoukou enlists the aid of the half-crazed Asano and appears slim, confident, and defiant of the Heavens' will, but during his sword fight with Youko, when he realizes that he is fighting the ruler of Kei, he gives up. In the novel, when Youko finds Shoukou, she discovers that he is immensely fat and he is futilely trying to hide from her. In both media, Suzu insists that Shoukou be killed, but Youko refuses to allow anyone to kill Shoukou since she needs to question him about who has been allowing him to get away with his crimes. Gahou is the corrupt leader of the Wa province of Kei. Gahou orders Shoukou to kidnap Youko's mentor Enho because he believes that Enho's idealism is a threat to him. Shoukei swears to depose him after she witnesses a crucifixion Gahou ordered, leading to her joining a resistance movement led by Kantai. When Shoukou is captured, because Gahou fears that his lackey will reveal damaging information that will lead to his dismissal, Gahou sends a military force to wipe out both the Shisui rebels and Shoukou, a plan foiled by Kantai's timely parallel effort to relieve the rebels with his own force. When Youko takes control of a royal army force sent by Seikyou and led by general Jinrai, she sends the force to arrest Gahou and free Enho. Koshou is the charismatic leader of the Shisui rebels. He rallies the rebels to fight against Shoukou, even though he believes that they cannot win. When Youko declares that Shoukou must be spared, Koshou supports her. When the town of Takuhou, the capital of Shisui, is set on fire, Koshou insists that the people must be rescued or else the rebellion has no point, even though the fire is a trap for his fighters. When Youko asks him what he wants as a reward for his service, he asks her to procure a university spot for his brother Sekki. Sekki , the brother of Koshou, is the brains behind the Shisui rebels. When Youko appears searching for Enho, Koshou is about to attack her because he believes she is a spy who is going to give them away, but Sekki stops him. He later explains that he heard the ring of steel, and that Youko's bravery suggests that she is far more dangerous than she appears. Sekki makes all the tactical decisions for the rebels except when fire threatened Takuhou and Koshou overrides him. =Baku Province inhabitants= The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Kou's Baku Province: Kantai is actually , the general of the province of Baku. He is a Hanjyuu that can take the form of a large bear and he is incredibly strong even in human form. He saves Shoukei after she ran from the soldiers who sought to arrest her after she threw a rock at Gahou's executioners. Kantai seeks to expose the corruption of Gahou, and he sends Shoukei to the intermediate village of Houkaku to provide touki weapons to the Shisui rebels. Suzu arrives there to take the weapons to Takuhou. When Kantai realizes that his allies in Shisui will be wiped out by Gahou, he sends his own forces to intervene. Shoukei accompanies him and seeks out Suzu to inform the Shisui rebels that Kantai is on their side. When Koushou insists on saving Takuhou from fire, Kantai is shamed into helping him despite his doubts. When Youko asks Kantai what reward he wants for fighting corruption, Kantai asks for pardon for his lord Koukan. After Gahou is defeated, Youko places Kantai in charge of Kei's entire army. Koukan is the leader of the province of Baku. Of all the provincial lords, only Koukan opposed the false queen Joyei. Seikyou advises Youko that Koukan will oppose her as well and when a trusted advisor attempts to kill Youko, Seikyou argues that Koukan is behind the plot. Youko suspects Koukan, but she does not act on her suspicions due to the advice of Keiki, who argues that Koukan is not the sort of man who would come up with such a scheme. When she orders Koukan to appear and explain himself, he is attacked and forced to flee and go into hiding. Youko eventually learns that not only has Koukan been falsely accused, but he has taken the initiative to try to stamp out corruption in the Wa Province by sending his top general Kantai to the Wa capital of Meikaku. She rewards him for his efforts by promoting him to chosai, the chief administrator of her court. Kingdom of En inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of En: =Shoryu= is the King of En, once known by the Japanese name of . Like Youko, Shoryu is a Taika. He has ruled En for approximately five hundred years and is considered a genius of administration. However, Shoryu believes that all kings have the potential to be great and that he is by no means exceptional as a human being. He possesses an easy-going attitude and tends to go off on his own, much to the consternation of his advisors, but highly perceptive and cunning. Originally the young master of the Komatsu clan during feudal Japan, his clan was wiped out shortly after he was found by Enki. He accepts Enki's request to become the King of En in the Twelve Kingdoms, remarking that a king can only be a king if he has people to lead. As king, he comes to be known as Shoryu, the Chinese pronunciation of the characters for his given name, Naotaka. When he ascends the throne, the Kingdom of En is in a terrible state; during his five hundred year rule, he has led the country to a state of extreme calm and prosperity. He initially appears to Youko and Rakushun as and offers both protection and support to Youko as the new Queen of Kei. As such, Shoryu provides her with an army to rescue Keiki and retake the Kingdom of Kei. As a fellow taika, Shoryu feels that he should help guide Youko in her new life and proves to be one of her strongest supporters as she becomes the new ruler of Kei. =Enki= As a taika from Japan, is also known as . Born during a time of civil war in Japan, the Kirin of En was abandoned by his parents at a very young age and had been starving to death until his Nyokai found him. Because he matured at a younger age, Enki appears as a young boy compared to other kirin like Keiki. He and Shoryu share a good relationship and are able to treat one another in a casual manner. As a result of his past, Enki possessed a strong aversion to kings, seeing them as warmongers and the ones responsible for destroying a country. Originally feeling that humans could not rule a kingdom properly, Enki was reluctant to choose a new king. Invoking a Meishoku, he returned to Japan and met Naotaka Komatsu, the son of a seafaring king and a taika from the Twelve Kingdoms. Though he did not have any faith in kings, he realizes that Naotaka is the king of En and Rokuta accepts him as his master. The pair return to the Twelve Kingdoms and Naotaka takes the throne as \\"Shoryu\\". Their trust in one another is strengthened when the King of En is forced to suppress a rebellion in his kingdom. When the kingdom of En chooses to aid Youko to rescue Keiki and free the kingdom of Kei from its false queen, Enki and Rakushun travel through various provinces in Kei to persuade the governors to abandon the imposter. Because he periodically travels to Hourai, Enki is also responsible for finding the kirin of Tai and helping him come to terms as a kirin. =Kouya= Young Kouya Adult Kouya is a young boy who was abandoned by his impoverished mother when he was young, Kouya was raised by a youma he called ≈åkii-no (big one), who called Kouya Chiisai-no (little one). He met Rokuta when they are young and revealed his wish to travel to Hourai, believing that it is a peaceful land and hoping to find his mother. Rokuta named his new friend Kouya, meaning midnight as they had met at midnight. Not wishing to forget his new name, particularly since he had forgotten the name his mother had given him, Kouya asked that ≈åkii-no call him Kouya and began to call ≈åkii-no Rokuta in order to remember his new friend. Kouya eventually encountered Atsuyu, the governor of En's Gen Province, and was greeted with apparent kindness. In exchange for Kouya's loyalty, Atsuyu provided Kouya with a place to live and a formal education. As a result, Kouya becomes involved with Atsuyu's attempt to overthrow Shoryu, the King of En, twenty years into the king's reign. During this time, Kouya develops into a sadistic person with no regard to human life ‚Äì regularly letting his demon bird devour prisoners, soldiers, as well as female servants who have offended him. When Atsuyu is defeated, Kouya leaves En without punishment, and becomes known as , a heavenly sage tasked with guarding and protecting the people who travel the Yellow Sea. Since then, he has waited for Shoryu fulfill his promise to create a place where Kouya and ≈åkii-no can live in peace. Kingdom of Kou inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Kou: =King of Kou= The former , known also as , has ruled his country for fifty years and has tried his best to improve the state of Kou. However, he comes to feel that he will never be able to bring Kou the prosperity seen by the neighbouring kingdoms of Sou and En, whose rulers have ruled for six hundred and five hundred years respectively. When , the ruler of Kei, dies after a reign of six years, the King of Kou comes to fear Youko's ascension to the throne of Kei, believing that as a taika like the King of En, she will be able to bring the ruined country the same prosperity as En and Kou will continue to fall behind. As such, the King of Kou secretly supports the false queen , the younger sister of Joukaku who seized the throne without being chosen by Keiki, and makes various efforts to capture and kill Youko. In the anime, these efforts include manipulating Yuka Sugimoto so that Youko will be unable to attain the throne of Kei. After his eventual death as a result of Kourin sacrificing herself, the King of Kou is posthumously known as . =Kourin= is the Kirin of Kou. She attempts to dissuade the King of Kou from attacking Youko and from losing faith in his own ability as a ruler by constantly comparing himself to the Kings of En and Sou. As a kirin, she is bound to obey his orders, regardless of her willingness to do so; under his orders, she reluctantly captures Keiki when he tries to bring Youko to the Twelve Kingdoms and orders her shirei and the demons they command to pursue and attack Youko. In the anime, she sacrifices herself to stop the King of Kou from attacking Youko. With the death of his kirin, the King of Kou will die within a year. =Rakushun= is a Hanjyuu with the form of a twenty- two-year-old mouse who is a citizen of the Kingdom of Kou. Rakushun is proud of being a hanjyuu and is somewhat uncomfortable in his human form; Youko only learns that he could appear as a human after quite some time. Though Youko is initially distrustful of him, he becomes her first good friend in the Twelve Kingdoms. He is very intelligent and knowledgeable, teaching Youko essential skills on how to live in the Twelve Kingdoms as well as politics and customs. He travels with Youko from Kou to En in hopes of being able to further his education since hanjyu are prohibited from higher levels of education in Kou. Rakushun eventually deduces that Youko is the rightful ruler of the Kingdom of Kei based on the unusual circumstances that have surrounded her since coming to his world; upon this discovery, he reassures Youko that he has faith in her and wishes to see what sort of country she will build when she doubts her ability to become Kei's new monarch. After Youko ascends the throne of Kei, Rakushun remains in En and enrolls in the country's Daigaku. During his tenure at school, Enki sends Rakushun to Ryuu to investigate why Youma are appearing there. While there, Rakushun meets Shoukei, who attempts to shift blame to him for stealing items from the palace at Kyou. The court does not believe her story and knows that she is the thief, but it nevertheless accepts the items as a bribe and allows her to go. Ironically, Shoukei's double-cross allows Rakushun to complete his mission since the corrupt nature of the court shows that Ryuu is in decline. Kingdom of Hou inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Hou: =Chuutatsu= Chuutatsu was the reigning king of Hou. He had his kingdom as an overly strict law enforcement. When his laws did not improve the lives of his people, the king mistakenly believed that even harsher laws were required and continued to enact increasingly harsher laws each time his laws failed. This resulted in 600,000 of his people being executed. He was later killed by Gekkei. =Shoukei= was the sheltered princess of Hou, until her father Chuutatsu's government was overthrown due to his overly strict enforcement of the law. 600,000 of his people were executed during his reign. When her father is assassinated, her mother and the Kirin of Hou are killed before her; Shoukei is spared because she had been unaware of her father's actions. Her name is removed from the register of Immortals and she is stripped of her royal name; as a commoner, Shoukei can only use her given name, . Revoked of her status as a member of Hou's royal family, Shoukei is forced to live anonymously as a peasant without any luxuries and is displeased with the drastic changes in her life. To comfort herself, she enjoys singing a song about a doll from her time as the Princess of Hou, until she decides that she was nothing more than a doll herself when she was a princess. She becomes jealous of Youko, the new Queen of Kei, whose rise in status coincides with Shoukei's own fall in fortunes. Shoukei is eventually forced to flee from Hou when her identity as the former Princess of Hou is discovered by impoverished townspeople who have been angry about her father's cruel deeds during his reign, and they try to execute her themselves. She briefly serves the queen of Kyou, Shushou, but she is treated very severely if not downright cruelly, because the queen believed her to be too proud. She decides to steal clothes and jewellery from the palace and escapes to Ryu, where she meets Rakushun. When captured by Ryu government officials, Shoukei tries in vain to blame Rakushun for her crimes before attempting to bribe her way out of trouble. Shoukei gradually overcomes her jealousy of Youko, realizing that Youko must be something special to be friends with a forgiving hanjyuu like Rakushun. Shoukei leaves for Kei, but upon her arrival, she witnesses a man condemned to be crucified in the Wa Province. Reminded of her father's own brutality, she throws a rock at the executioners to stop them from killing the poor man and is chased by guards until she is saved by a young woman named Youshi, who tells her that the man wil be all right thanks to her. Initially unaware that her rescuer is Youko, Shoukei decides to find the Queen of Kei in order to warn her about the coming rebellion and, like Suzu, joins rebels revolting against Shoukou, the corrupt governor of Wa. Following the establishment of Youko's rule of Kei, Shoukei becomes a courtier in Youko's court and serves as a royal scribe. =Gekkei= is the governor of Kei Province in Hou. He leads the rebellion against Chuutatsu and willingly commits regicide, believing that the sin of killing the king and the kirin are better than allowing the king to continuing executing lives for trivial offenses. Gekkei reveals that while Chuutatsu had been far too harsh in his rule, Gekkei knew that the austere king's expectations of others had been overextended. When his laws did not improve the lives of his people, the king mistakenly believed that even harsher laws were required and continued to enact increasingly harsher laws each time his laws failed. Gekkei led his uprising because he had become aware it was too late to restore him to the rightful path and there was no longer anyone willing to stop the king, who had become fanatic in trying to ensure his people were righteous. After executing the king, the kirin, and the queen, Gekkei spares Shoukei's life, in spite of the deep resentment and loathing the populace holds over her for not stopping her father. After removing her from the divine registry, he places Shoukei in village under an alias until her identity is revealed after three years. When he rescues her, he sees that she still has not realized her faults and coldly sends her to the kingdom of Kyou to prevent further chaos in Hou. However, he worries about Shoukei's welfare after she is exiled from Hou, particularly after hearing she has fled from Kyou after stealing from the queen of Kyou. Despite leading the insurrection against the king, Gekkei refuses to lead the provisional government to maintain order in Hou until a new monarch is chosen, even with tacit support from the queen of Kyou. Instead, he retreats to the Kei Province to continue his duties as his governor, believing that leading the provisional government would equate him to becoming an usurper. He reluctantly accepts the responsibility after learning Shoukei's fate and how she has changed and learned to accept responsibility for her actions. Kingdom of Sai inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Sai: =Suzu= was born to a poor farmer's family in Meiji era Japan. She is swept into the Twelve Kingdoms by a shoku after falling off a cliff when she was sold to pay off her family's debt. As a Kaikyaku, she is unable to communicate with anyone and soon falls into despair. In the anime, she is first seen in an encounter with Taiki, whom she wishes to meet because he also grew up in Hourai, but she is injured and forced away from him by his protective Nyokai. Suzu winds up travelling with travelling performers until they encounter a Sen-nin known as , who is the first person Suzu meets who is able to understand her. Riyo agrees to take Suzu when she returns to the mountains and grants Suzu the status of a sen-nin so she may understand the language of the Twelve Kingdoms. Suzu serves Riyo for one hundred years, but is forced to endure a great deal of abuse from Riyo, who reveals herself to be a cruel mistress who especially delights in abusing Suzu as she lacked the will to fight back. Shortly after Riyo attempts to torture Suzu with news of the new Queen of Kei, whose background was similar to Suzu's own, Suzu escapes and briefly finds shelter with the kindly queen of Sai. She eventually leaves for Kei in order to search for Youko, believing that she can rescue Suzu from difficult life, and befriends a boy named Seishuu, who has failing eyesight. When Seishuu is killed by Shoukou, the corrupt governor of Kei's Wa province, Suzu joins a revolutionary group dedicated to his downfall. Joined by a young woman named , Suzu additionally seeks to assassinate the Queen of Kei, as all evidence indicates that the queen has done nothing to stop Shoukou, and is initially unaware that Youshi is actually Youko in disguise. She and Shoukei eventually befriend Youko and learn her identity as Kei's monarch. After Youko ends the revolt, Suzu is brought to Youko's court to become one of her ladies- in-waiting. =Kouko= is the current Queen of Sai, who has ruled the country for twenty years alongside her Kirin, Sairin. Known for her compassion and great character, she is known by the regnal name of , in recognition of her status as the previous king's aunt and adopted mother. Her informal given name is Prior to becoming the ruler of Sai, Kouko had served as the Taifu, one of the three advisors of Shishou, her nephew and immediate predecessor as king. Kouko's son, Eishuku, served as Shishou's prime minister and she was the foster-mother to Eishuku's page, Seiki. Shishou's eventual downfall and abdication of the throne resulted in the loss of most of Kouko's family, after which she was chosen to the kirin to become Sai's new monarch. During her reign, she has expressed great wisdom and resolve. When Suzu flees from Riyou, the Mistress of Suibi Cavern, Kouko and Sairin give Suzu sanctuary in the royal Choukan Palace. While Kouko promises that Suzu will not be removed from the Divine Registry, she does not allow Suzu to join the servants taken from Riyou's aerie to work in Choukan Palace. Because believes that Suzu must learn to understand how others are feeling rather making assumptions and becoming disappointed when the person does not live up to her expectations, Kouko sends Suzu away to try and see more of the world. While she is somewhat disappointed that Suzu insists on going to Kei believing that the ruler of Kei will understand her better than Kouko or Sairin, Kouko provides Suzu with a travel pass and funds, in hopes that Suzu will learn from her experiences. =Sairin= is the current Kirin of Sai. Because she is well-known and beloved in Sai for possessing a kind heart and gentle nature, she was given the name . Before selecting Kouko as the monarch of Sai, Sairin had chosen a king known as Shishou (Á†•Â∞ö, Shish≈ç), who climbed Mount Hou after the death of the king who preceded him. At the beginning of his reign, he presented Sairin with the royal treasure of Sai, a jewelled branch called the kashokada (ËèØËÉ•ËèØÊú∂), as a promise to rule his country well and bring about prosperity. However, during his twenty-year reign, his actions caused Sairin to contract shitsudou. Realizing he had lost the way, Shishou ascended Mount Hou to abdicate the throne and took his life. Sairin chose Kouko as the next king and continues to always carry a branch with leaves on it, as a memento of the broken promise Shishou had made to her that he would govern his country well. Kingdom of Tai inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Tai: =Taiki= Taiki Takasato is the Kirin of Tai, though is not fully mature and is actually a heina (an immature Kirin), and Koki (a rare black Kirin). Like Youko, Shouryuu, and Enki, he is a taika from Hourai; as a result, he is known by the name . His nickname, , derived from an alternate pronunciation of \\"Takasato\\" and was given to him by Gyousou after Taiki chose him as the new King of Tai. After many years in Hourai, Taiki is eventually taken back to the Twelve Kingdoms in order to fulfill his role as the kirin of Tai. However, when the kingdom of Tai falls, both the King of Tai and Taiki go missing. Fifteen years before Youko Nakajima's arrival in the Twelve Kingdoms, Taiki's ranka had been blown over to Hourai by a shoku. He is returned to Mount Hou ten years after his disappearance, after being found by Enki. Taiki is cared for and educated in his role as the kirin of Tai by his nyokai, , but is initially unable to transform into his beast form because he had been in human form for so long. He eventually chooses Gyousou to become king; while Taiki is uncertain of his choice and initially terrified of Gyousou, he eventually realizes that his fear was recognition of the \\"aura of the ruler\\" required of the one chosen by the kirin to become a true king. In addition to Haku Sanshi, Taiki also has a powerful toutetsu youma, Gouran, as his shirei. Before his disappearance, Taiki was close to Keiki and was called \\"half-pint\\" by Enki. After his disappearance, Taiki is eventually revealed to be alive in Japan and attends high school. In the anime, he is a student at Youko, Yuka, and Asano's school and appears repeatedly in volumes four and five of the anime and referred to at times. Due to the sudden stop of the anime, Taiki's story was never finished and leaves the unresolved situation in which Rokuta is still looking for him in Japan. His story is continued in the novels. In A Shore in Twilight, one of Gyousou's men named Asen stages a coup d'√©tat when he becomes dissatisfied with the king's aggressive reforms. Gyousou is lured away and Asen attacks Taiki, cutting of his horn just before Taiki flees to Hourai via a meishoku. The trauma causes Taiki to lose his memory of the year he spent in the Twelve Kingdoms and he remains in Japan for six years. During this time he begins to lose his kirin nature and is slowly poisoned by the meat he is fed by his family. Eventually Sanshi and Gouran start to go wild and begin killing everyone who gets close to Taiki, mistaking them for enemies: this causes his human family, which already distrusted him, to abhor him and pretty much wish for Takazato's death, believing him to be a living curse. The final breakdown comes when Sanshi and Gouran murder the abusive Takazatos when Taiki is away, showing that they have completely lost their nature as shirei and have become wild youma. (As shown in Demon Child.) Taiki eventually remembers everything and is rescued by the combined efforts of Risai and the kings and kirins of the Twelve Kingdoms. Upon his return, he and his shirei are so full of impurity that the other kirin are unable to get close to him, so a goddess agrees to cleanse them of the impurity. Afterward, Taiki (now without his kirin powers or shirei due to the loss of his horn) reunites with Risai and they leave for Tai in an attempt to save the kingdom. In the novels, Taiki's story stops here and the fate of Tai is not known. =Gyousou= is a famous general of Tai. After the death of the previous King of Tai, Gyousou ascended Mount Hou in hopes of becoming the new king. Though Taiki is terrified of Gyousou and unsure if he has chosen the right person to become the King of Tai, Taiki eventually realizes his fear of Gyousou was how he recognized Gyousou was to become king. Upon Gyousou's recognition as Tai's new king and his departure from Mount Hou, he chooses to present Taiki with the nickname Kouri as a sign of what he hopes will be a prosperous age for Tai. Because of his predecessor's extravagance, Tai was nearly bankrupt and had fallen into a state of civil war. Gyousou reduced the royal palaces expenditures to a bare minimum. War continued to escalate in Tai and eventually both Taiki and Gyousou disappear and are thought to be dead. Though Taiki is eventually found to be alive in Hourai, Gyousou remains missing though is believed to be still alive. =Risai= is the general of Tai's Jou Province and well-known, though she is not as renowned as Gyousou. When Taiki's return to the Twelve Kingdoms is announced, she is among the many who ascend Mount Hou in hopes of being chosen as the new king. She is a sennin (sage) as a result of becoming a general of Jou since the governor of Jou, who has a lived a long life, requires those who serve him to also possess longevity as well to retain their usefulness. Taiki develops a friendly relationship with her, but in the end does not recognize her as Tai's new king. After Gyousou ascends the throne of Tai, she remains a loyal subject. When Taiki and Gyousou both mysteriously vanish during another civil war, she and military commanders and civil servants oppose the governor who places himself in charge of the kingdom. While many are arrested, Risai is among the few who successfully escape arrest (though she's gravely injured and loses an arm) and continues to search for Gyousou and Taiki. She eventually flees to Han and then finds refuge in Kei where she beseeches Youko to somehow find either Taiki or Gyousou in order save Tai from a corrupt and totalitarian rule by a usurper whose rule violates the Mandate of Heaven. Kingdom of Kyou inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Kyou: =Shushou= , the queen of Kyou, has ruled for over 90 years, but she has the appearance of a young girl of twelve, since that was when she was chosen to become the new ruler. She ascended the throne twenty-seven years after the death of the previous king. Though strict and capricious, she has demonstrated herself to be a wise monarch. She also appears to have above-average strength in the anime, being able to make Shoukei bow her head to her with only two fingers. She and Kyouki have an odd relationship; she often lectures Kyouki not to be so naive and sympathetic. On some of these occasions, she slaps Kyouki, but explains her reasons and comments that she wishes she had a shorter kirin so it would be easier for her to slap him. Before becoming king, Shushou lived in Renshou, the capital of Kyou, as the youngest daughter of a wealthy merchant. Though she lived a comfortable life and received a good education, she found could not tolerate how ordinary people continued to suffer in a country without a king. At the age of twelve, she ran away from home to go on a pilgrimage and climb Mount Hou in order to be selected as the next ruler of Kyou. Her story is told in one of the novels that was not animated, Tonan no Tsubasa (The Aspired Wings). Shoukei, after her identity as the former princess of Hou is discovered by local townspeople and she is nearly executed, is sent away to Kyou, and reluctantly agrees to serve Shushou. Shushou shows no sympathy for Shoukei, believing that Shoukei was a fool who did nothing but play while Hou suffered and lacked the discernment to see her father's wrongs, and only allowed her to be brought to Kyou in order to prevent more chaos in Hou. It is believed that Shushou likely influenced Lord Gekkei, the governor of Hou's Kei Province, to lead revolt against the king of Hou in order to end his errant rule and appears to support his temporary rule of Hou as it prevents Hou from collapsing and reduces the number of refugees who come to Kyou. =Kyouki= Kyouki is the current Kirin of Kyou. Kingdom of Ren inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Ren: =Seitaku= Seitaku is the current King of Ren. =Renrin= Renrin is the current Kirin of Ren. Kingdom of Ryuu inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Ryuu: =Rohou= Rohou is the current ruler of Ryuu. =Ryuuki= Ryuuki is the current Kirin of Ryuu. Kingdom of Han inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Han: =Ranjou= Ranjou is the king of Han who has ruled his kingdom for 300 years. =Hanrin= Hanrin is the Kirin of Han. Kingdom of Sou inhabitants The following characters reside in the Kingdom of Sou: =Senshin= Senshin is the king of Sou who has ruled for 600 years making him the longest-ruling king in the Twelve Kingdoms. =Sourin= Sourin is the Kirin of Sou. Hourai/Japan inhabitantsYuka Sugimoto= is one of Youko's classmates in Japan and gets transported to Kou along with Youko and Asano. She enjoys fantasy books and is thrilled to be part of the adventure, believing that she is destined for greatness. Destined to be a rival, Yuka becomes extremely jealous of Youko when she finds out that Youko is the \\"chosen one\\" and believes herself to be just as worthy. The King of Kou takes advantage of Yuka's confused feelings to convince her to fight against Youko. She later realizes her mistake after making up with Youko, helps her to rescue the kidnapped Keiki, and Youko sends her back to Japan. She is the one who tells Youko's human parents what truly happened to her. After her return, she cuts her already short hair, determined to not hide behind her fantasies. By that time, she also becomes friends with Taiki, who has lost his memory as a being from the Twelve Kingdoms. In the novels, she is only mentioned in passing and does not go to the Twelve Kingdoms but remains in Hourai (Japan). Instead, she serves as a plot device to show Youko's lack of resistance to peer pressure. =Ikuya Asano= is another one of Youko's classmates and has known Youko since childhood. He is transported to the kingdom of Kou with Youko and Sugimoto, and conceals his deep set apathy under an energetic demeanor. When Yuka turns on Youko, he finds his loyalty split between them and eventually goes missing after a battle between Yuka and Youko when he falls from a cliff. He is not seen by either of them for some time. Asano eventually becomes part of a group of Shusei and works for them as they traveled through the kingdoms. However, being in a completely alien country and lacking the ability to speak or understand the language, the strain has taken a toll on his sanity. He ends up travelling with Suzu and her friend Seishuu during their journey to Kei, though they are separated afterward. As he continues lose his mind, Asano questions the reason he was ever brought to Kou and seemingly can't find a reason for his life to go on. He finally finds Youko again, and she tells him about her adventures and how she's decided to stay and fight for Kei. She asks him to work for her and the resistance, and he accepts as his last chance of redemption. However, while performing a mission for them, he is fatally stabbed by an enemy and loses consciousness in Shoukei's arms before he dies of his injuries. In the novels, Asano does not exist and Youko attends an all-girls school. =Ritsuko Nakajima= is the mother of Youko Nakajima and the wife of Masashi Nakajima. Ritsuko is a well- meaning mother who despite her stern manner cares greatly about her daughter. Despite her own personal preferences such as which schools she wants Youko to attend, she usually goes along with her husband's decisions as a dutiful wife. Because she doesn't want Youko to stand out or be mistaken as a delinquent, Youko's mother worries about Youko's naturally red hair and often tells her to cut it or dye it black. While her classmates generally saw Youko as a timid pushover or other negative views of her general indistinguishability, Ritsuko tells her husband that Youko was well-behaved, gentle, and predictable. In the anime, Ritsuko eventually learns of her daughter's fate from Yuka Sugimoto when she returns from the Twelve Kingdoms. Although she was saddened that Youko will not come back, she is satisfied to know that Youko is doing well where she is. In the novels, it is unknown if her mother ever learns what became of Youko. =Masashi Nakajima= is the father of Youko Nakajima and the husband of Ritsuko Nakajima who is implied to be a salaryman.

Irwin (born 9 May 1960) is a Scottish former professional footballer who played for Fareham Town F.C. (England), FC Stade Nyonnais (Switzerland), The Bahama Royals (Bahamas) and the Boston Bolts and Albany Capitals of the American Soccer League.  Soccer  After the collapse in 1984 of the North American Soccer League (NASL) featuring the New York Cosmos starring Brazilian forward Pel√©, Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia and the West German sweeper Franz Beckenbauer., the United States Soccer Federation realized that they had to develop home grown talent in order to be in a position to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In 1988 Professional Soccer returned to the US in the form of the American Soccer League which had two divisions : Northern Division - Albany Capitals, Boston Bolts, Maryland Bays, New Jersey Eagles, Washington Stars ; Southern Division - Miami Sharks, Tampa Bay Rowdies, Orlando Lions, Washington Diplomats, Fort Lauderdale Strikers. Each franchise had a quota of only three non American players in its first year and two in subsequent years. Irwin had the distinction of being the first player to be signed by the Boston franchise as one of their three foreign players. Soon after, Boston signed their marquee player Jeff Duback who was the current US National team goalkeeper. During the 1988/89 season as sweeper and vice captain of the Boston Bolts, Irwin was selected as the only Boston player to the American Soccer League (ASL) All Star Team. He was one of two Scotsmen on the All Star team, being joined by former Scottish National Team goalkeeper Alan Rough. The All Star team played against the Fort Lauderdale Strikers at Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with the legendary George Best making a guest appearance for the Strikers. In 1988 at Nickerson Field, Boston University, Irwin scored the winning goal for the Boston Bolts v Orlando Lions by placing a penalty kick beyond fellow Scotsman and Orlando goalkeeper Alan Rough. This was the Boston Bolts first home game of the 1988/89 season and their first win. In 1989, following Irwin's selection to the ASL All Star team, he was signed by the Albany Capitals as one of their two foreign players. He joined US national team players John Harkes, Brian Bliss and Mike Windischmann, and former England international Paul Mariner.

Goudie was born in Youngsville, Louisiana, 150 miles west of New Orleans in the area of the state known as Cajun country, where he lived until age 8. (It is likely he learned to speak French while growing up there, which would be useful later in his life.) His family then moved to New Orleans, where he began playing cornet, possibly studying with Bunk Johnson. He became proficient enough to find work with local bands such as Papa Celestin's Original Tuxedo Band and the Magnolia Band - two top bands in New Orleans at that time. He began studying clarinet and tenor saxophone, which would eventually become his primary instruments. Goudie's arrival in New Orleans circa 1907 meant he had a tantalizing front- row seat to the blossoming of early jazz. Musicians such as King Oliver, Kid Ory, Johnny Dodds, Freddie Keppard, Jimmie Noone and a host of others, were in their prime and working at many venues throughout the city, in everything from duos, to six-piece jazz bands, to brass bands. Goudie may even have worked with, or crossed paths with, a young man close to his age, blowing up a storm on cornet - Louis Armstrong. Between the years following the 1918 closure of \\"The District\\" (aka Storyville) and the early 1920s, New Orleans experienced a diaspora of musicians, one of whom was Goudie. In 1921 he joined a band accompanying a traveling minstrel show, and for the next four years he performed in Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and California. He joined another traveling group, Frank Matthews and the Louisiana High Browns, ending up in Tampico, Mexico in 1925. That same year he sailed to France, making Paris his home base for the next 14 years. Work was plentiful for expat African-American musicians in Paris prior to World War II, and he worked with bands led by Benny Peyton, Louis Mitchell, Sam Wooding, Noble Sissle, Freddy Johnson, Bill Coleman (1937), and Willie Lewis (1935-38). While in Paris he worked at the famous \\"Bricktop's,\\" owned and operated by Ada \\"Bricktop\\" Smith, who was a supporter of American jazz musicians. Goudie played often and recorded with Gypsy guitar wizard Django Reinhardt. Frequently the two of them could be found in the wee hours at some cafe, playing \\"real soft, just for ourselves.\\" It is said while in Europe Goudie carried a wicker suitcase full of upholstery tools with which to augment his income - a trade he likely learned as a young man in New Orleans. He left Paris in late 1939, moving to South America, where he worked in Brazil and Argentina with guitarist Oscar Aleman, and fronted his own groups. In 1946 Goudie moved back to Paris, playing there with Arthur Briggs, Harry Cooper and Bill Coleman (1949‚Äì51). In 1951 he moved to Berlin, again leading his own band. He recorded there in 1952 and 1953 and in Yugoslavia in 1955. In the summer of 1957 he returned to the U.S. to run his uncle's business in San Francisco. His presence became known to the close-knit Bay Area jazz community and it wasn't long before he again was playing music and in great demand, working with bands led by trumpeter Marty Marsala, pianists Earl Hines, Bill Erickson and Burt Bales, trombonist Bob Mielke and other local groups. Goudie succumbed to cancer at age 64, in San Francisco. As a young man, his great height earned him the nickname \\"Tree,\\" and he became known as \\"Big Boy\\" during his years in Paris. Goudie's recording career began in December 1930 with the band of Noble Sissle, with whom he made his only known film appearance, a British Path√©tone short filmed at Ciro's nightclub in London.

Boylan (January 31, 1912 ‚Äì November 16, 1994) was an American film, television, and theatrical actor. One of three children born in Canton, Ohio to an Irish-American immigrant family, he began acting in 1932 when he helped found the Players' Guild for a local community theater. His working life was spent in the Ohio and Pennsylvania steel industries, but he continued acting whenever the opportunity arose, often travelling to Greenwich Village in New York City the 1930s and 1940s when regular employment was scarce. It was during these periods spent in New York that he performed on Broadway, becoming acquainted with fellow actors Burgess Meredith and John Ireland while there. After over 40 years working in the steel industry, he retired in 1975, with his last job being the works manager at the Milton Manufacturing Company in Pennsylvania. Three years later he moved to Washington state, where he quickly established himself in the local repertory circuit, acting with the Seattle Repertory Theatre, the Bathhouse Theater, The Empty Space, and the Tacoma Actors Guild. With more time to devote to his craft Boylan's acting career enjoyed an Indian summer, as he began carving out a successful niche in film and television with his silver-haired, moustached appearance. He played opposite John Travolta in The Experts (1989), opposite Jeff Bridges in American Heart (1992), and most notably in Twin Peaks, where he was cast as the mayor of the titular town in David Lynch's award-winning television series. He had been working in a repertory production of Much Ado About Nothing when he was spotted for the role, but was unwilling to quit just for the show. Instead, the 79-year-old Boylan would fly to Los Angeles every Sunday night after the final stage performance of the evening, spend all day Monday filming his part, before returning to Seattle in time for the Tuesday matinee, as if he had never been away. His final film role was in 1993's Sleepless in Seattle, as an elevator operator at the Empire State Building, a role that took his life full circle; it was at the Empire State Building sixty years before that he had met his wife Jeanne, through his good friend Fred von Ritter, who was married to her sister Lynn. A lifelong smoker, he died of lung cancer and pneumonia in Bellevue, Washington, leaving behind his wife, son John, daughter Kathy, and two grandchildren. His \\"signature\\" performance, for which he had won a Best of Festival award at New City Theater's annual directors' festival in 1986, was in Anton Chekhov's one-man comedy On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco. His son later admitted that even while performing in this play, he had been \\"smoking on the sly\\".

Early life Fullarton, a native of Elvan Street, Shettleston, Glasgow, left school at 14 and worked to earn money for the upkeep of his family, a task made all the more onerous by the death of his father two years later. His early employment included a role scooping up manure from local streets to sell on, but he eventually worked his way to a mechanical engineering apprenticeship. Through 1937, Fullarton saw footage of events in Spain which were to push him into action. \\"It was the bombing of civilians that really got on my nerves. I would go to the cinema and see that on the newsreel, see the women running with the bairns in their hands, eyes turned skywards for the planes, to see if they were coming.\\" He began to attend street meetings, listening to and imbibing the words of charismatic soap-box orators such as the returning International Brigader James Maley, a recent prisoner of war. Fullarton became increasingly involved with the cause of republican Spain, collecting money and non-perishable foods, and chalking local roads with announcements of street meetings. For him, the next step, volunteering for action in Spain, was merely a logical progression of actions rather than an ideological decision or the result of any coercion by local political groups. Spanish Civil War & World War 2 In early 1938, with the Communist Party having agreed to his suitability for Spain, Fullarton informed a local friend, Willie Gauntlet, of the news. Gauntlet replied: \\"Oh. I'll go too.\\" This was hardly atypical of the area ‚Äì from Fullarton's close and the four surrounding it, he, Gauntlet and two other men, Jimmy Reid and Willie Dougan, were to serve in Spain. In March 1938, aged 18, Fullarton set off by train from Glasgow Central for London Euston alongside five other Scottish volunteers. In London, they purchased weekend train tickets for Paris so as not to arouse the suspicions of the authorities (Britain's non-interventionist government strictly forbade anyone from volunteering to fight in Spain, and invoked the 1870 Foreign Enlistment Act to make it illegal for them to do so). From Paris, volunteers were transferred to the Spanish border for their surreptitious journey on foot across the Pyrenees. Having entered Spain, Fullarton was sent for a brief period of military training at Figueres, although this proved to be basic at best: fake wooden rifles were distributed for practice due to a shortage of the real thing. He was then assigned to the Major Attlee Company and in the early summer of 1938 moved to the Chabola Valley in preparation for the republican side's crossing of the River Ebro. Fullarton bonded with his fellow volunteers and attended lectures on political theory and ideology. \\"People would quote Lenin and Stalin by the yard. I realised how ignorant I was about these things. I didn't know about them at that time.\\" When the Battle of the Ebro began in July 1938, Fullarton was at the centre of the action amidst relentless German aerial bombardment. \\"Every day we got it ‚Äì an average of six or seven times. Twenty or 30 of them would come over and give us all they had, then strafe us with the machine guns\\", he said. Fullarton was at high risk, and during intense fighting he was shot through the stomach. He lay, prone and silent, for several hours so as not to be identified by Franco's Nationalists. Without anaesthetics, doctors probed to find the bullet in his body with a long needle. As he wrote home from his sickbed: \\"The bullet made an ugly hole but I will soon be OK again. These explosive bullets that the fascists are using make a helluva mess of you. It enters you and only makes a small hole, but when it is inside it explodes and where it comes out it blows all the flesh with it.\\" After a period of convalescence in Catalonia, on 23 December 1938, Fullarton was transported back to Great Britain, aged 19. Back in Glasgow he struggled to find work, his name tainted by association with the Spanish war, an experience repeated when he tried to join the Royal Air Force. Fullarton was eventually able to join the RAF during the Second World War, serving in South Africa. This, however, did not stop the Foreign Office writing to him demanding a fee for the money it had paid towards his repatriation from Spain.Obituary for Stephen Fullarton, 'The Guardian', 4 April 2008. https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/apr/04/1 Later life Following his war years, Fullarton resumed work as an engineer and started a family. He read assiduously, enjoying the works of Robert Burns and William Shakespeare in particular, giving himself the education his tough upbringing had cut short. He and his wife Isabella MacDonald Fullarton (died 1968) had three children.

While Dobbs was primarily a third baseman, he could also play the corner outfield positions and first base. Early career Dobbs graduated from Canyon Springs High School (CA) High School in June 1996. He was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 52nd round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft, but opted to attend Riverside (CA) Community College instead. While at the Long Beach State University in , he was drafted in the 10th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft by the Houston Astros, but opted to stay in school.

After a strong 2007 spring training with the Phillies, Dobbs made the major league roster, platooning at third base with Wes Helms. Dobbs' great hitting gave him more starts in 2007. He was mainly used as a pinch hitter in the beginning of the season, but his clutch pinch hits and good at-bats while starting got him more playing time with the Phillies. Over 2007 and 2008, Dobbs led the majors in pinch-hit RBIs. In 2007, he finished in first place with 18 pinch-hit RBIs, the most in the major leagues. In 2008, his pinch-hitting prowess continued as he led the majors with 22 pinch hits and a .355 batting average while finishing second among pinch hitters with 16 RBIs. Dobbs struggled to replicate his 2008 season in 2009, hitting just .247 with 5 home runs and 20 RBIs. In the 2010 season, Dobbs batted .152 before the Phillies designated him for assignment on June 22 to activate Jimmy Rollins from the disabled list. He cleared waivers and began to play for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs. After appearing in four games for Lehigh Valley, Dobbs was recalled to the major leagues, where he replaced Pl√°cido Polanco, who was placed on the disabled list. On August 17, he was designated for assignment when the Phillies removed Chase Utley from the 15-day disabled list. On September 3 Dobbs was recalled from Lehigh Valley. =Florida/Miami Marlins= On January 31, 2011, Dobbs signed a minor league contract with the Florida Marlins with an invite to spring training.

Dunn Memorial Fellowship Program, often referred to as the Dunn Fellow Program or the Dunn Fellowship, is a year-long governmental honors fellowship program in Illinois. The fellowship affords recent college graduates from every state the opportunity to experience and gain first-hand knowledge of Illinois State government and general governmental structure at the executive level. Successful candidates are offered fellowships with the Illinois Office of the Governor in both Chicago and Springfield, Illinois and in Washington, D.C. Dunn Fellows work directly with management staff in the Office of the Governor and generally gain a broad perspective of the operation of state government. Many fellows upon completion of their year will move on to careers in state government as administrators or other management roles. Program history and background The Governor's Yearlong Fellowship Program was established in 1979, which was later renamed the James H. Dunn Memorial Fellowship Program in 1981 by Executive Order 7. This change honored James H. Dunn, a Rockford, Illinois citizen for his outstanding commitment to public service.2008 Dunn Fellowship application: http://www.illinois.gov/gov/pdfdocs/2008_dunn.pdf Executive Order 3 in 1986 brought all fellowship and internship programs administered by the Office of the Governor under the aegis of the Prescott E. Bloom Internships in Government Program. According to the Dunn Fellowship application, \\"No one understood the benefit of government internship programs to both the State and the individual better than State Senator Prescott E. Bloom. From 1976 until his premature death in 1986, Senator Bloom sponsored his own annual internships, which successfully introduced hundreds of high school and college students to the inside of state government.\\" The fellowship's purpose is to develop college graduates who have demonstrated a commitment to academic excellence and community involvement into capable leaders.Internship Opportunities, Office of Governor Rod R. Blagojevich: http://www.illinois.gov/gov/intopportunities.cfm Fellows are given the opportunity to develop skills in program budgeting, legislation, communication, and research, all of which are strongly demonstrated by successful public administrators. The program addresses the public sector's future need of competent and committed administrators by training these young adults in the operations of state government. Over the course of the fellowship year, the program provides a public sector management training program encouraging fellows to remain in a career oriented toward public service. In addition, the program enables college graduates to supplement their academic backgrounds, providing them with an opportunity to develop their professional and leadership skills. Also, the program helps to achieve state affirmative action goals through the nomination of qualified minorities, women, and persons with disabilities. The Dunn Fellowship Program is now administered by the Illinois Department of Central Management Services. Dunn Fellows, however, receive placements as fellows in the Office of the Governor and they are assigned Governor's Office supervisors and represent the Governor's Office as full-time staff during their fellowship. On July 15, 2009 the Dunn Fellowship was cut from the Fiscal Year 2010 budget by Governor Pat Quinn. After an outpouring of support, the program was restored in August 2009. Eligibility and selection process Selection of each incoming class of Dunn Fellows is highly competitive. Applicants typically demonstrate strong performance in areas of academic achievement, community leadership and involvement, extracurricular activities, and career development. While there is no minimum GPA to apply, successful candidates normally appear in the upper percentiles of their graduating classes. Minimum criteria for applying to the Dunn Fellowship Program are as follows: *Have completed at least a bachelor's degree from an accredited university by the time of the start of the program (August 1 of each year). *Be a recent college graduate (or have recently completed graduate school). While there is no time limit defining \\"recent,\\" the program is designed for graduates who have recently finished their college education. *Be legally allowed to work in the State of Illinois. *Complete the application packet. There are no preferences to academic majors or programs of study when considering candidates for fellowships. However, certain programs tend to offer training and experience in areas valuable to fellows. Successful candidates usually have participated in programs that encourage academic rigor, analytical skills, public policy research, and critical thinking. After the application deadline has passed, senior members of the Governor's Office and Illinois Department of Central Management Services, Personnel Division will review applications and select approximately 50 candidates for in-person interviews. Fellowships will be awarded shortly after interviews are completed. Approximately 19 fellowships are awarded each year. Program composition and activities Fellows are classified as full-time employees with the Illinois State Government. Fellows work in a variety of policy areas and administrative teams, directly assisting with the day-to-day operations of the State. Throughout the program history, fellows have either been assigned a work post for an entire year, allowing the fellow to specialize in one specific area of government administration, or fellows have cycled through a variety of posts throughout their fellowship (i.e. changing posts after each 3-month period to receive a broad view of governance.) Fellows have typically worked in all departments and teams of the Office of the Governor, including press, policy development, staff support, outreach programs, legislative affairs, and budget. It is the goal of the program to give fellows the necessary experience to become competent public sector administrators, which is accomplished in part by giving fellows a broad perspective in state government to help achieve this goal. Throughout the program's history, Dunn Fellows have also done a variety of activities together including participation in leadership and career development seminars, community service projects and volunteerism, and tours and group outings. Alumni Many Dunn Fellow alumni are promoted within state government to posts involving management of staff and individual projects. In addition, a good portion of Dunn Fellows return to graduate school or pursue training programs immediately following the fellowship to assist their career development. The Fellowship is represented throughout the public and private sectors, with many former fellows working at the management level in their respective fields of interest. An alumni association is in the formation stage. Its mission will be to connect Dunn Fellow classes, provide networking opportunities, and promote community service among past and current Dunn Fellows.

Mickey was killed and the house destroyed in the resulting fire. At trial, Hughes was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity in one of the first cases involving \\"battered-woman syndrome\\" as a defense. Early life Hughes was born in Stockbridge, Michigan. Her mother named her Francine after a French musician. Her father, a farmworker, was an abusive alcoholic. Her mother, she later said, told her that \\"you did what was best for your husband.\\" At age 16, Francine left high school to marry James \\"Mickey\\" Hughes. They had four children. Abuse Although she had moved out after their divorce was finalized in April 1971, Mickey had moved back in with her after he was involved in a serious car accident that summer. Francine later testified in court that although she was reluctant to have him return to the home, she felt she could not refuse as she did not want to \\"hurt him more...than he already had been\\", referring to the severity of his injuries from the accident. The abuse persisted and escalated in the years after Mickey's recovery, and he regularly beat her, destroyed furniture and killed his daughter's kitten. Francine felt that she could not remove Mickey from the home or move out herself, fearing that he would kill her. She obtained her GED and, in 1976, enrolled in a secretarial course in an effort to retain some independence. Crime and trial On the day of the fire, March 9, 1977, Francine returned from her secretarial course in the afternoon and found Mickey intoxicated and irate. He refused to allow her to make food for their four children, and berated her for some time about quitting school, which she refused to agree to, even after Mickey forced her to burn her schoolbooks. He began to physically assault her. The police came and spoke to the pair, but left after refusing to arrest Mickey as he had not assaulted her in front of them. However, a police officer would later testify that Hughes had warned her that \\"it was all over\\" for her because she had called the police. Francine again attempted to make dinner for herself and the children, but Mickey became irate and swept the food onto the floor. He forced Francine to the floor by bending her arm behind her back and made her clean the mess with her hands. When she was finished, he dumped out the trash can on the floor and forced her to clean it again. Finally, he forced her to agree to quit secretarial school and burn her textbooks. After he forced Francine to cook his dinner, he raped her. She suffered through this last assault until he finally fell into a drunken slumber. However, she decided to wait for her youngest child Dana to return home. When he did not return after some time, Francine decided to burn the house down to prevent her from returning to her life with Mickey again. She told the three children to put on their coats and wait in the car. She then poured gasoline around Mickey's bed and lit the gasoline. The resulting fire consumed the home. In the meantime, with her children in the car, Francine drove to the police station so she could confess to the killing. After a trial in Lansing, Michigan, Francine was found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Both the prosecution and the defense agreed that Francine's plight was sympathetic. However, no jurors have ever confirmed publicly whether that was a factor in their decision. Later years In 1980, Hughes married Robert Wilson, a country musician, and became a nurse. She was an LPN and worked at several nursing homes. After retiring, she sat with the elderly and taught a nursing class. She died in Leighton, Alabama, on March 22, 2017, from complications of pneumonia that she developed in late 2016. She was 69. Cultural impact Hughes' story was made into a book and a subsequent film in 1984 titled The Burning Bed starring Farrah Fawcett.\\"This Week in Michigan History 'Burning Bed' based on woman who killed ex\\". Detroit Free Press, March 9, 2014 p. 13A According to National Public Radio as broadcast on April 3, 2017, the song \\"Independence Day\\" written by Gretchen Peters and made popular by Martina McBride is about this event.

On June 23, 2008, an apparent hate group which identified themselves as \\"Anonymous\\" organized DDOS attacks against the website, successfully eliminating 60% of the website's service capacity. On June 27, 2008, the hackers utilized cross-site scripting to deface the website's main page with satirical images and headlines referencing numerous racial stereotypes and slurs, and also successfully stole information from SOHH employees. (Radio broadcast) Following the defacement, the website was shut down by its administration. AllHipHop, an unrelated website, also had its forum raided. By the evening of June 27, 2008 AllHipHop.com was back online and released an official statement in which it referred to the perpetrators as \\"cyber terrorists\\" announced that it would cooperate with SOHH \\"...to ensure the capture of these criminals and prevention of repeat offenses.\\" On June 30, 2008 SOHH placed an official statement regarding the attack on its main page. The statement alleged that the attackers were \\"specifically targeting Black, Hispanic, Asian and Jewish youth who ascribe to hip-hop culture,\\" and listed several hip hop oriented websites which it claimed were also attacked by the hackers. It concluded with a notice that it would be cooperating with the FBI. When interviewed, Felicia Palmer, co-founder of SOHH, confirmed that an FBI probe was ongoing, and that each time the website was attacked, data on the suspects was retrieved. Palmer indicated that some of the attackers were \\"located within the United States, between the ages of 16-21\\" and that a few of them were based in Waco, Texas. Initially under the impression that the hackers were pranksters, she came to believe they were \\"beyond pranksters\\" and the attack was racist in nature.

The genus has been used as a wastebasket taxon for thalattosuchian fossils for over two centuries, and almost all known historical species of teleosauroid have been included within it at one point. The genus has remained a wastebasket, with numerous species still included under the label ‚ÄòSteneosaurus‚Äô, many of which are unrelated to each other (either paraphyletic or polyphyletic with respect to each other and other genera of teleosauroids).  Discovery and assigned species  Front part of the lectotype snout as figured by Georges Cuvier in 1809 The type species, S. rostromajor, was only formally recognised as such in 2020, and this revision determined the type specimen of Steneosaurus was undiagnostic, and so declared the genus Steneosaurus a nomen dubium. The remaining species referred to Steneosaurus thus require new generic names, and some species have already been assigned to new genera prior to Steneosaurus being declared a nomen dubium. Species in this genus are traditionally classed into two skull groups: longirostrine (long, narrow jaws) and mesorostrine (slightly shorter jaws). ;Longirostrine * 'S.' atelestatus - Oxfordian Marnes de Villers of France * 'S.' baroni - Bathonian Oolite and Kandreho Formations of Madagascar * 'S.' blumembachi - Oxfordian Marnes de Villers of France * 'S.' gracilirostris - Toarcian Alum Shale of England * 'S.' heberti - Callovian Etrochey vertebrate layer (C√¥te-d'Or) of France * 'S.' leedsi - Callovian Oxford Clay of England * 'S.' megistorhynchus - Bathonian Forest Marble Formation of England and Great Oolite Formation of France * 'S.' oplites - Toarcian La Caine-Curcy of France * 'S.' pictaviensis - Callovian Les Lourdines in France * 'S.' rudis - France ;Mesorostrine * 'S.' bouchardi - , Kimmeridgian‚ÄìTithonian of France * 'S.' edwardsi - Callovian Marnes de Dives Formation, Le Wast and Les Lourdines in France and Oxford Clay of England Additional Steneosaurus fossils not attributed to a specific genus have been found in: * Bathonian El Mers Formation, Morocco * Bathonian Techout Formation, Tunisia * Jurassic Czarnoglowy, Poland = Reassigned species = * 'S.' bollensis = Macrospondylus * 'Steneosaurus' boutilieri = Yvridiosuchus * 'Steneosaurus' brevior = Mystriosaurus * 'Steneosaurus' deslongchampsianus * 'Steneosaurus' larteti = Deslongchampsina * 'Steneosaurus' megarhinus = Bathysuchus * 'Steneosaurus' obtusidens = Lemmysuchus  Classification  A 2005 phylogenetic analysis into the evolutionary relationships of Thalattosuchia did not support the monophyly of Steneosaurus, as the genera Machimosaurus and Teleosaurus both fell within Steneosaurus. Reinforcing the paraphyly of Steneosaurus, the Callovian species \\"Steneosaurus\\" obtusidens has been recovered as the sister species of Machimosaurus in recent cladistic analyses of Thalattosuchia and renamed Lemmysuchus, while 'Steneosaurus' bollensis was recovered in a basal position to other members of Steneosaurus sensu lato.

Invasive pest ants in Florida, previously identified as T. albipes, have now been separated as Technomyrmex difficilis, both forming part of a species complex with a worldwide distribution. Description T. albipes is a small black ant some long with the lower part of the limbs pale. Workers are chocolate-black with pale lower limbs, antennae with twelve segments and a flattened petiolar node. It differs from T. difficilis in lacking the pair of setae (bristles) that that species has on the back of its head. Distribution and habitat The white-footed ant is native to the Indo-Pacific area, and has been introduced into Australia, Africa, North America, the Caribbean and parts of Asia. It inhabits dry forests and open locations. Tent-like nests are made out of debris in trees, bushes, rotten logs, under rocks, in leaf litter and similar places. It also nests in man-made structures such as wall cavities and attics. Colony The colony structure of this ant is unusual; there are both winged and wingless males, and three types of female, queens, intercastes and workers. New colonies are founded when winged males copulate with winged females after a nuptial flight. These females then shed their wings, find a suitable nesting site and start laying eggs, but their function in the colony is later taken over by intercastes. These females differ from workers in having spermathecae (sperm storage organs) and are mated by wingless males inside the colony. They are responsible for most of the reproduction that takes place in the colony. The queen is larger than other members of the colony and lays both fertilised and unfertilised eggs throughout her life, but the colony continues in existence after she dies. So successful is this reproductive strategy that colonies grow to very large sizes, sometimes containing millions of individuals, and may occupy multiple nest sites. Ecology The white-footed ant forages widely, entering dwellings and scavenging in kitchens and other rooms where it is considered a pest. It is largely arboreal and feeds on the honeydew of sap-sucking insects such as aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects. For this purpose it protects the insects and drives off predators, thereby encouraging the insects which may be agricultural pest species; the mealybug Dysmicoccus brevipes for example transmits pineapple wilt disease in Sri Lanka, and biological control of the mealybug has proved difficult because of the activities of the ant. Similarly in South Africa, the ant has encouraged outbreaks of the red scale insect (Aonidiella aurantii), a major pest of citrus in the country.Bedford, E. C. G., 1998. \\"Red scale Aonidiella auranii (Maskell)\\". In: E. C. G. Bedford, M.A. Van den Berg and E. A. De Villiers (eds.), Citrus pests in the Republic of South Africa.

Johnson worked for the KGB between 1953 and 1964, and passed on information while stationed at various sites in Europe and the U.S. Most famously, when working in the U.S. courier center at Orly Airport south of Paris, he occasionally had night duty alone in the center, where dispatches arrived to and from Air Force and Army bases in Europe.

Then they rushed them back to Orly to get them to Johnson before he went off duty in the morning. In 1964, Johnson was turned in by his wife and, like Mintkenbaugh, received a 25-year prison sentence in 1965.

It was adapted for the screen twice, first in 1931, then again in 1951. The play was Sturges' second Broadway production, and the first of his plays to be made into a film. The Attic Theater Company revived the show at The Flea Theater in the summer of 2014. Broadway production Sturges wrote the play shortly after being fired as the assistant stage manager for a road production of play called Frankie and Johnny. At liberty in Chicago, he started by writing two lines of dialogue: \\"What are your intentions?\\" \\"Strictly dishonorable.\\" He wrote the play quickly, in about six days of work, and called it originally \\"Come, Come, Isabelle,\\" giving the ingenue his grandmother's maiden name, Isabelle Perry., pp.250-54 Sturges submitted the play to producer Brock Pemberton, whom he had worked for as a stage manager, and Pemberton accepted it. Rehearsals took three weeks and there was an additional week out of town, during which Sturges made numerous changes at Pemberton's insistence. The opening night audience was not responsive and Sturges, waiting at the back of the house, was concerned that the comedy was not going over. He left before the curtain came down and went out to drink, deliberately not reading the reviews. It was not until he called Pemberton in the morning to ask for two tickets for a friend that he found out that the play was a smash hit, garnering rave reviews. The play had opened on September 18, 1929 - although Sturges recalled it as opening on the 19th - at the Avon Theatre and ran until January 1931, logging 557 performances. It was directed by Pemberton and Antoinette Perry, after whom the Tony Awards are named. The success of Strictly Dishonorable, which earned him over $300,000,, p.264 changed Sturges' life immediately: > The aura of sudden celebrity bestowed on me by Strictly Dishonorable > attracted photographers, reporters, gossip columnists, professional > panhandlers, producers, job offers, and a written demand from my biological > father, Mr. Biden, for immediate repayment of the sums he has dispensed on > my behalf when I was about a year old. Offers came from film world, so Sturges picked up some fast money by writing film scripts. Shortly after, a play from his trunk, Recapture, went into production and opened to receive \\"the most violently destructive notices I had seen in years.\\" =Broadway cast= The opening night cast of Strictly Dishonorable was: * John Altieri as Giovanni * Carl Anthony as Judge Dempsey * Tullio Carminati as Count Di Ruvo * Louis Jean Heydt as Henry Greene * Muriel Kirkland as Isabelle Parry * Edward J. McNamara as Patrolman Mulligan * William Ricciardi as Tomaso Antiovi * Marius Rogati as Mario Cast notes: * William Ricciardi was the only actor from the Broadway cast to play his role in the 1931 film adaptation.

He reigned from 856 to 859. After the death of √Åilgen√°n in 853 there was an interregnum until the succession of his brother M√°el Gualae in 856.Annals of Innisfallen, AI 856.1 The Danes had arrived in Ireland in 849 and took control of Dublin in 851. The dispersed Norse went off to plunder different areas of Ireland and a rivalry began between these two Viking groups with Irish kings using this rivalry in their own conflicts. A number of men in Munster joined up with these Norse and were known as Gall Gaedil (\\"foreign Gaels\\"). Cerball mac D√∫nlainge (died 888), King of Osraige aligned himself with the Danes versus the Norse to become the most powerful ruler in southern Ireland during this period. During the interregnum, the High King of Ireland M√°el Sechnaill mac M√°ele Ruanaid (died 862) of Clann Cholm√°in led an expedition into Munster in 854 as far as the borders of the D√©isi in Tipperary County and took hostages from Munster.Annals of Ulster, AU 854.2 The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland claim that Cerball, brother-in-law of the high king, was sent by the high king into Munster as well to claim the hostages.Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, FA 246 According to the Annals of the Four Masters, the Norse had instigated the opposition to the high king in Munster.Annals of The Four Masters, AFM 852.3 The high king appeared again at Cashel to take hostages from Munster in 856, probably at the time of the accession of M√°el Gualae.AU 856.2 The Norse activities in Munster were a disruptive influence and around 855 the men of Munster appealed to Cerball of Osraige for aid against the Norse. Cerball arrived with a force of Danes under a leader named Horm and they surrounded the Norse and massacred them.FA 254 In 856 a Norse force slew Gorm√°n son of Lon√°n, heir designate of Cashel, at Loch Cenn.Chronicum Scotorum, CS 856 In 857 Cerball and his Danish allies, Amla√≠b Conung and √çmar, won a victory over the Norse and Gall Gaeill under Kettil \\"The Fair\\" in the Munster territory of Arad T√≠re in northern Tipperary.AU 857.1, FA 263 In 858 M√°el Sechnaill led a large muster of the men of Ireland into Munster to exact hostages. This time Cerball was his enemy as well as the Leinstermen had complained to the high king of him. The forces of Cerball and M√°el Gualae had been stationed at Belach Gabr√°n in southern Osraige, possibly at Goresbridge on the River Barrow, to oppose the High King's army, but this took an unexpected route and their forces were divided. The High King inflicted a shattering defeat on the forces of M√°el Gualae at the Battle of Carn Lugdoch (near modern Waterford) and the King of the D√©isi, M√°el Cr√≥n mac Muiredaig, was slain. The High King remained at Emly for a month raiding all of Munster as far as the sea in Desmond. He took hostages from all the lands of Munster. Many of the Norse-Gaels were slain by the High King's army. The defeat of the Munstermen led Cerball to also submit and give hostages to the high king.AU 858.4, FA 260 The next year however in 859 Cerball again defied M√°el Sechnaill and with his Danish allies led an expedition into Mide.AU 859. This led to a royal conference at R√°ith Aeda Meic Bric (modern Rahugh, County Westmeath) with the High King, the kingdom of Cerball was made directly subject to the high king and separated from Munster.

The Constellation Space Suit was a planned full pressure suit system that would have served as an intra-vehicular activity (IVA) and extra-vehicular activity (EVA) garment for the proposed Project Constellation flights, which were planned to begin after the Space Shuttle retired. The design of the suit was announced by NASA on June 11, 2008, and it was to be manufactured by Houston, Texas-based Oceaneering International, the first company other than the David Clark Company, Hamilton Sundstrand, and ILC Dover (and, before 1964, B.F. Goodrich) to produce life- support hardware, as a prime contractor, for in-flight space use.  Design  Image of early prototype - February 2010 The Constellation Space Suit system was designed by NASA for Constellation program due to the needs of reducing space on board the relatively small (by current standards) Orion spacecraft, and at the same time, would protect the astronauts during launch, reentry and landing, and extreme emergencies (such as a cabin depressurization). Another need for NASA was that the suit system must be capable of withstanding the rigors of microgravity EVAs, and with modifications, from the rigors of lunar surface EVAs during a 7-day lunar sortie, with the provisions for 6-month stays once the Lunar Outpost is completed. As the Apollo/Skylab A7L, ACES, and Shuttle/ISS Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) pressure and space suits were deemed unsuitable for NASA's needs for Project Constellation, a new suit system was designed and is designated as \\"Configuration One\\" (IVA/Microgravity EVA) and \\"Configuration Two\\" (Lunar EVA). = Configuration One = The \\"Configuration One\\" suit, worn for launch, landing, for extreme emergencies, and for microgravity EVAs, will resemble the current ACES pressure suit used by NASA astronauts on Space Shuttle flights. Unlike the current suit, which were based on the G3C suit worn by the Gemini 3 crew and later adapted for use by the U.S. Air Force for high-altitude operations, the \\"Configuration One\\" suit will feature a closed-loop environmental system (similar to that of a rebreather - the ACES suit uses a SCUBA-like open-loop system, limiting its operations above ), new bearings in the shoulder, elbows, wrists, hip, and knees, and a full-pressure helmet with a swivel faceplate (closed by a mechanical seal) and incorporating a sunshade. Like the older G3C suit, the \\"Configuration One\\" suit will be made up of five layers, the innermost being a rubberized pressure-retaining bladder made of neoprene cloth, and covered with a Nomex cover layer in international orange color. In the event a microgravity EVA is conducted, instead of the Primary Life Support System backpack worn by Apollo, Space Shuttle, and ISS crews, astronauts will rely on a life-support umbilical used on all Gemini and Skylab flights. As the Orion spacecraft lacks an airlock like that found on the Shuttle and the ISS, all members of the spacecraft crew will be required to be suited up, as the entire cabin would be depressurized (similar to that employed on Gemini and Apollo), thus microgravity EVAs conducted from an Orion spacecraft would only be of an emergency nature. The \\"Configuration One\\" system would be capable of supporting an astronaut crew for approximately 120 hours in the event of an emergency cabin depressurization. *Manufacturer: Oceaneering International (David Clark Company as subcontractor) *Missions: TBA, but ready to fly by 2015. *Function: Intra-vehicular activity (IVA) and emergency Orbital Extra- vehicular activity (EVA)Constellation Space Suit System PowerPoint (June 12, 2008) *Operating Pressure: David Clark Suit Prototype (January 25, 2010) *Primary Life Support: Vehicle Provided = Configuration Two = The \\"Configuration Two\\" suit, was to be used primarily for lunar EVAs conducted during the initial 7- to 10-day lunar sortie missions and later for 3 to 6-month lunar outpost missions, would consist of a completely new spacesuit, similar in appearance to both the Mark III and I-Suits designed and tested by ILC Dover in the early 2000s, but would incorporate the arms, legs, gloves, boot assemblies, and helmet from the \\"Configuration One\\" suit. Like the Mark III and the Generation III I-Suit, the \\"Configuration Two\\" suit would use a rear-entry hatch design, eliminating the need for the dual-plane closure used on the Shuttle/ISS EMU suits and unlike the current NASA suit, a hybrid of both the Apollo A7L/A7LB suits and the Litton-developed RX-series hard suits, will be of a \\"soft-suit\\" design, allowing astronauts to bend over and grasp objects when fully suited and pressurized. New joint designs on the \\"Configuration Two\\" suits, along with the soft-suit elements from the \\"Configuration One\\" suits, will allow the suits to operate at a higher pressure (around , the pressurization used on the Orlan space suit), eliminating the danger of undergoing decompression sickness normally associated with the lower pressure of the Shuttle/ISS suits (which operates at ). Unlike the orange-colored \\"Configuration One\\" suits, the \\"Configuration Two\\" suits will have a white cover layer, which will require the use of cover layer \\"sleeves\\" on the arms and legs of the \\"Configuration One\\" suit. Like the cover layer on the A7L and A7LB suits, the cover layer \\"sleeves\\" for the \\"Configuration Two\\" suit's \\"Configuration One\\" limbs will be attached using Velcro. *Manufacturer: Oceaneering International (David Clark Company as subcontractor) *Function: Terrestrial Extra-vehicular activity (EVA) *Operating Pressure: *Primary Life Support: 150 hoursTech Review - NASA's Next Space Suit  Other items  Like the Shuttle/ISS EMU and the ACES pressure suit, astronauts will wear, underneath of the suit, a \\"Depends\\"-like undergarment known as a Maximum Absorbency Garment or \\"MAG,\\" which will allow for containment of urine and fecal matter (although the latter may be staved off with a low residue diet), over which a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) is worn. The LCVG, resembling a union suit, has tubing sewn into the material to allow for the circulation of cooling water and removal of carbon dioxide while the suit is worn. A communication cap, known throughout NASA as a \\"Snoopy cap,\\" is worn by the astronaut to facilitate communication through either the intercom system, or with Mission Control in Houston. Unlike the familiar white-striped brown caps currently in use, the \\"Snoopy caps\\" proposed for Constellation will be the white-colored caps worn by all Space Shuttle crews prior to STS-107 and with the two colors of the suit systems (orange and white), will make the American crews to somewhat resemble Soviet cosmonauts of the 1960s.  Contractor  The Constellation Space Suit would be manufactured by Oceaneering International of Houston, Texas. The David Clark Company of Worcester, Massachusetts, the manufacturer of the ACES pressure suit (as well as the manufacturer of the Gemini space suit), and United Space Alliance, would be two of the seven subcontractors used by Oceaneering to develop and manufacture the suit.

(September 3, 1927 ‚Äì December 5, 2000) was a close-up magician and Marianist Brother. The tricks he invented are still an integral part of many close-up magician's repertoire. Hamman was world- renowned in the magic community. His initial interest in the art started as a child. As he recuperated from polio, he spent hours learning, practicing and inventing card tricks and other magic involving sleight-of-hand. In many cases, he \\"reinvented\\" classic maneuvers or streamlined them. He was a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, the Catholic Magicians' Guild and the Society of American Magicians. Career Hamman created more than 100 card magic tricks throughout his career.Genii Magazine profile of Brother Hamman. February 2000. Among the many tricks he invented, he is best known for the Hamman Count, a sleight-of-hand in which cards are falsely counted to give the impression that the magician holds more, or less, than he actually does. He authored many books and videos on magic and was invited to many local, national and international level (including FISM) magician gatherings to display his prowess and ability with cards. In 1995, Br. Hamman was the first living magician to be honored during the first St. Louis Magical Heritage Awards, the \\"Hall of Fame\\" for local magicians. Professional magicians referred to Br. Hamman as the \\"Magical Marianist\\". In his acceptance speech, he explained the key to a successful magic performance: His first major publication was \\"The Card Magic of Bro. John Hamman, S.M.,\\" published by Paul LePaul in 1958. In his foreword, LePaul wrote, Among magicians, Br. Hamman is still known as a Magician's Magician. The highest honor the magic community can bestow on one of its own, it refers to one's ability to amaze even fellow conjurers. Despite this, his first love was doing magic for his students.''' Br. Hamman was also a skilled Gospel Magician. He frequently used his magic to teach some important aspect of Catholic catechism to his students.  Personal life  Br. Hamman was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to Godfrey and Olivia (n√©e Ruoff) Hamman. He was one of two boys and a girl. The Loretto Sisters and Sisters of Saint Joseph taught him at St. Luke and St. Rose grade schools before he entered McBride High School in September, 1941. Influenced by Fr. John G. Leies and by his older brother Donald, who was already a Marianist candidate, the young John became a postulant at Maryhurst in 1942. He pronounced first vows at Marynook in Galesville, Wisconsin, on August 15, 1945, and final vows on July 10, 1951. In 1995 he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his religious profession as a Marianist. Br. Hamman earned a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Dayton in 1948 and an M.A. in English from St. Louis University in 1963. In the fall of 1948 he began his teaching career at Central Catholic Marianist High School in San Antonio, where he taught English. A year later he was assigned to St. Michael's High School in Chicago, where he stayed for two and a half years. In January, 1952 he was assigned to DeAndreis High School in St. Louis for the spring semester. Following this brief assignment, Brother John went to Coyle High School in August, 1952. Shortly thereafter, in October of the same year, he was diagnosed with a severe case of polio. He spent two years at Maryhurst recuperating. Due to his illness, Br. Hamman was only able to teach on a limited schedule. He was assigned to St. Mary's High School in 1954. After seven years, he returned to Central Catholic High School for a year before going to St. John Vianney High School in 1965. He was able to continue teaching there until he retired in 1986. Due to declining health and congestive heart failure, he was assigned to the Marianist Residence in San Antonio in 1995. Death Br. John Hamman died on December 5, 2000, at the St. Joseph Healthcare Center in San Antonio, Texas, at age 73. He is interred in the Marianist Cemetery on the campus of St. Mary's University in San Antonio. Br. John's personal letters, documents, poetry, and writings are held at the National Archives Marianist Province in San Antonio, Texas, close to St. Mary's University.

The club was formed out of the pre-war merger of K√∂lner Club f√ºr Rasenspiele and K√∂lner Sport-Club 1899,*Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag through which it lays claim to being the city's oldest football club. __TOC__ History Following the union of the two clubs, VfL took up the place of predecessor SC in the Gauliga Mittelrhein, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich in 1933. The club was moderately successful there, capturing the division title in 1941 before moving on to take part in the national playoff rounds. They were eliminated in a semi-final match by eventual vice-champions Schalke 04 (4‚Äì1) and lost the subsequent third place match to Dresdner SC by the same score. As World War II progressed it forced German football competition to become more local in character and the Gauliga Mittelrhein was broken up. VfL became part of the Gauliga K√∂ln- Aachen and won its second consecutive title there. They were put out of national level competition when they lost a quarterfinal contest to Kickers Offenbach (3‚Äì1). The team made appearances in 1939, 1941, and 1942 in early round play for the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup). In 1943, the club became part of the wartime side Kriegspielgemeinshaft VfL 99/S√ºlz 07 K√∂ln in partnership with SpVgg S√ºlz 07. The combined side repeated as Gauliga K√∂ln-Aachen champions and were again eliminated in a national quarterfinal, this time by KSG Spielverein/48-99 Duisburg (0‚Äì2). VfL resumed play as an independent side following the war, and after a season in the Bezirksliga Rheinbezirk, joined the 2. Oberliga West (II) for the 1950‚Äì51 season. The following year the first team side of SC West K√∂ln became part of VfL, which then played a single season as Spielgemeinschaft SC K√∂ln 99 before readopting its original name. The side took up play in the Amateurliga Mittelrhein (III) where they earned mid-to-lower table results. After the formation of the Bundesliga and new second division Regionalliga in 1963, the Amateurliga became a third tier competition below those leagues, where the VfL continued to earn indifferent results. A fifteenth-place finish in 1980 dropped the club to lower level local competition. The team played in the Kreisliga A K√∂ln, where it finished second in the 2007‚Äì08 season.Fussball.de: Kreisliga A K√∂ln ‚Äì 2007‚Äì08 accessed: 17 June 2008 In 2009 it was sent down to Kreisliga B2 and the next year was sent down again to C4.

In 2013 she was named a Rabbis Without Borders fellow by Clal, the Center for Learning and Leadership, and in 2015 was named co-chair of ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal along with Rabbi David Markus. In 2016, The Forward named her one of America's most inspiring rabbis.  Background  Born in San Antonio, Texas in 1975 to Marvin and Liana Barenblat, Rachel moved to New England in 1992 to attend Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. She holds a BA in religion from Williams and a Masters of Fine Arts in writing and literature from the Bennington Writing Seminars, as well as rabbinic ordination from ALEPH: the Alliance for Jewish Renewal and a secondary ordination as a mashpi'ah, also from ALEPH.  Work  In 2000 Barenblat co-founded Inkberry, a literary arts non-profit organization, with Sandy Ryan and Emily Banner. From 1999-2002 she was a contributing editor at Pif Magazine and for several years in the early 2000s served as contributing editor at Zeek magazine, a Jewish journal of thought and culture. Her book Massachusetts: The Bay State was published in 2002 by World Almanac Library, along with books about Wisconsin, Michigan, Washington and Texas. From 2009-2011, she served on the board of directors of the Organization for Transformative Works. Beginning in 2014 she served on the board of directors of ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal, which she co-chaired from 2015-2017. In 2018 she co-founded Bayit: Building Jewish. Barenblat is author of several book-length collections of poetry, including 70 faces: Torah poems (Phoenicia Publishing, 2011), Waiting to Unfold (Phoenicia, 2013), and Texts to the Holy (Ben Yehuda Press, 2018), as well as a variety of liturgical works, most notably her haggadah for Pesach and a volume for mourners called Beside Still Waters co-published by Ben Yehuda Press and Bayit: Building Jewish in 2019. Her first full-length collection of poems, 70 Faces‚Äîa collection of poems which arise out of a full year's cycle of weekly Torah portions‚Äîwas published by Montreal-based Phoenicia Publishing in 2011. 70 faces received critical praise: :\\"These poems are so out there, so radical, and at the same time so gentle and inviting. Barenblat manages to do work that has passion and truth behind it, without ranting. I love the simple and confident way she deals with the akedah -- and I love the final poem in this collection -- gliding right past heartbreak into renewal, which is what her poems all seem to do.\\" -- Alicia Ostriker : \\"Rachel Barenblat's Torah poems open the doorway into sacred text so that we can walk in and make it our home. She invites us to bring all of our passion, doubt, humor, humility and chutzpah as we encounter these ancient words and bring them to Life. Through Rachel's skillful, joyful, playful and profound poetry, the Torah opens her secrets to us and invites us into an intimate conversation with Truth.\\" -- Rabbi Shefa Gold and has received generally positive reviews: :\\"[The poems in 70 Faces] take time to think about daily things -- a bottle of milk, talismans on a desk -- and ongoing things -- the names of animals, the urge to make -- and lifelong things -- a baby born in danger, a difficult reunion at a funeral. // They chronicle the round of the year and the quiet, continual effort to walk forward, to think about work and family and the light on the ridge lines.\\" :\\"Reb Rachel engages head-on with a question that nags ‚Äî what is the downside to this whole taking over Canaan business? There is nothing heavy-handed or polemical here. She could be talking about the ancient Israelites, the modern Israelites, or any of us caught in the situation of getting the better of someone else. In my humble, really good poetry tackles big questions in such a way as to leave the reader with more questions, shaking our collective heads heads in wonder. The good stuff ‚Äì and here I'm quoting another poem from the book - builds a structure to house what you long for.\\" although the Forward reviewer argued that the book's fatal flaw is \\"its failure to live up to the claims the author makes for it.\\" Her second book of poetry, Waiting to Unfold, was also published by Phoenicia (2013): :Poet and rabbi Rachel Barenblat wrote one poem during each week of her son's first year of life, chronicling the wonder and the delight along with the pain of learning to nurse, the exhaustion of sleep deprivation, and the dark descent into -- and eventual ascent out of -- postpartum depression.Waiting to Unfold description, publisher's website. :This book is two cycles, one of pregnancy, and one of the first year after her child's birth. The poems have that same \\"Oh! I'd forgotten about how beautiful/hard/sad/quiet/fierce that was\\" quality that all true stories about the first year of parenthood do, and made me laugh and tear up a little and feel nostalgic and sad for new mothers everywhere. Barenblat is also author of several poetry chapbooks, among them the skies here (Pecan Grove Press, 1995), What Stays (Bennington Writing Seminars Alumni Chapbook Series, 2002), chaplainbook (Laupe House Press, 2006), and the self- published Through, a collection of miscarriage poems (2009.)

They soon convinced 100 more of Detroit's citizens to join. Early members included Russell A. Alger, ex-governor of Michigan, Hugh McMillan, founder of the Michigan Telephone Company, and real estate magnate James B. Book. Within a year, the club had outgrown its first home and moved to larger quarters on Fort Street. Less than a decade later, the club hired architect Wilson Eyre to design a new building to serve as their meeting place. Architecture The Detroit Club is a four-story brick and stone Romanesque Revival building. The front door is hidden within an unusual recessed archway with stairs.Eric J. Hill, John Gallagher, and the American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter, AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture, Wayne State University Press, 2002, , p.84 The club features a grill and library on the first floor, a family room on the second floor, and a main dining room with smaller meeting rooms on the third floor.\\"Facilities\\" from the Detroit Club The interior features fine woodwork, a wide main stair, and an enormous fireplace in the main dining hall. The original woodwork was lighter than the current version. Events A number of pivotal events in the twentieth century took place within the walls of the Detroit Club. In 1902, the Automobile Club of Detroit was organized at a meeting in the club. In 1922, Michigan governor Alex Groesbeck held strategy sessions to decide whom to tap to fill the open Senate seat which resulted from Truman Newberry's resignation. Groesbeck chose James Couzens. In 1930, Governor Fred W. Green met with Detroit bank presidents to work out details for closing the city's banks. In 1944‚Äì45, after an extensive series of meetings at the club, Henry Ford II wrested control of Ford Motor Company from Harry Bennett. Later, Lee Iacocca used the club to launch his campaign to restore the Statue of Liberty and develop Ellis Island into a museum.

It belongs to a class of antifungal agents called echinocandins, which inhibits the synthesis of glucan, a major component of the fungal cell wall, via noncompetitive inhibition of a crucial enzyme, Œ≤-(1‚Üí3)-D-glucan synthase. Echinocandin B is a fermentation product of Aspergillus nidulans and the closely related species, A. rugulosus; discovered in 1974 in A. nidulans var. echinulatus strain A 32204 in Germany, it was the first of the echinocandin class of antifungals. Echinocandin B can undergo deacylation (removal of the lipid side chain) by the action of a deacylase enzyme from the filamentous bacterium Actinoplanes utahensis, which catalyzes the cleavage of the linoleoyl side chain; in three subsequent synthetic steps, including a chemical reacylation, the antifungal drug anidulafungin is synthesized.

ProtoStar intended to operate an initial fleet of three geostationary satellites. Two satellites were acquired and launched. ProtoStar's anchor customer, Dish TV India Limited, is the largest direct-to- home television operator in India. Bankruptcy and auction ProtoStar Ltd filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on June 29, 2009. ProtoStar sought and was made by the bankruptcy court to auction its two satellites off to pay its outstanding liabilities. The auction for ProtoStar I was set by the bankruptcy court for October 14, 2009, however the auction was delayed until October 31, 2009 based on interest from 11 different satellite operating companies. The auction was won by Intelsat Corp with a bid of $210M, beating out European rival Eutelsat. ProtoStar I The ProtoStar I satellite was built by Space Systems/Loral (SS/L) based on the SS/L 1300 spacecraft design. It was originally built by SS/L as the ChinaSat 8 satellite and scheduled for launch in April 1999 on a Long March 3B rocket. However, the U.S Department of State blocked its export to China under ITAR regulations. The satellite was placed in storage and sold to ProtoStar in 2006. On January 5, 2007 SS/L announced that the satellite would be modified to meet ProtoStar's requirements. The fueled satellite weighed and will operate in both the Ku band and the C band. On January 8, 2007 Arianespace announced that ProtoStar had contracted with Arianespace for the launch of ProtoStar I. It was launched aboard an Ariane 5 ECA rocket on July 7, 2008. Post-launch maneuvering of the satellite was performed successfully July 8, 2008., and ProtoStar I was placed into its geostationary orbital location of 98.5 degrees East Longitude. Following the sale of ProtoStar I in the ProtoStar bankruptcy auction, October 29, 2009, and the completion of the sale with Intelsat, Intelsat renamed the satellite Intelsat 25. Intelsat 25 will serve for African market at 31.5 West orbital location. ProtoStar II On January 14, 2008 Boeing announced that the Boeing Satellite Development Center in El Segundo, California would provide a spacecraft based on the Boeing 601HP spacecraft design for use as ProtoStar II. The spacecraft was originally built for PanAmSat (now Intelsat) to be used as Galaxy-8iR, but that contract was terminated November 15, 2002. On May 16, 2009 ProtoStar II was carried to orbit on a Proton rocket provided by International Launch Services. On June 16, 2009 Boeing announced the successful in-orbit handover of the satellite to ProtoStar Ltd. following successful in-orbit tests. In December 2009 SES purchased Protostar II at auction for its SES World Skies unit. The purchase price was $185 million. Ground control segment The ProtoStar I ground control system is in Singapore and will be operated by SingTel. For ProtoStar II the primary control system will be installed in Indonesia and operated by Indovision, with a backup system integrated into the control system for ProtoStar I.

As a medication it is administered in subcutaneous implant form; the implant lasts for two months. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. Medical use Afamelanotide is used in the European Union to prevent phototoxicity in adults with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). For updates see EMA Index page It is an implant that is injected and placed under the skin; an implant lasts two months. People who have severe liver disease, liver impairment, or kidney impairment, should not use this drug. Pregnant women should not take it, and women who are active sexually should use contraception while they are taking it. It is not known if afamelanotide is secreted in breast milk. Adverse effects Very common (up to 10% of people) adverse effects in people with EPP include headache and nausea. Common (between 1% and 10%) adverse effects include back pain, upper respiratory tract infections, decreased appetite, migraine, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, lethargy, sleepiness, feeling hot, stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, flushing and red skin, development of warts, spots, and freckles, itchy skin, and reactions at the injection site. There are many uncommon (less than 1%) adverse effects. Pharmacology Afamelanotide is thought to cause skin to darken by binding to the melanocortin 1 receptor which in turn drives melanogenesis. Afamelanotide has a half-life of 30 minutes. After the implant is injected, most of the drug is released within the first two days, with 90% released by the fifth day. By the tenth day no drug is detectable in plasma. Its metabolites, distribution, metabolism and excretion were not understood as of 2017. Chemistry The amino acid sequence is Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His- D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2, and it is additionally known as [Nle4,D-Phe7]-Œ±-MSH, which is sometimes abbreviated as NDP-MSH or NDP-Œ±-MSH. Afamelanotide is the International Nonproprietary Name. History It was discovered at University of Arizona and initially developed there as a sunless tanning agent; the Australian company Clinuvel conducted further clinical trials in that and other indications, and brought the drug to market in the European Union and the United States. The role of Œ±-MSH in promoting melanin diffusion has been known since the 1960s. In the 1980s, scientists at University of Arizona began attempting to develop Œ±-MSH and analogs as potential sunless tanning agents, and synthesized and tested several analogs, including melanotan-I. To pursue the tanning agent, melanotan-I was licensed by Competitive Technologies, a technology transfer company operating on behalf of University of Arizona, to an Australian startup called Epitan, which changed its name to Clinuvel in 2006. Early clinical trials showed that the peptide had to be injected about ten times a day due to its short half-life, so the company collaborated with Southern Research in the US to develop a depot formulation that would be injected under the skin, and release the peptide slowly. This was done by 2004. As of 2010, afamelanotide was in Phase III trials for erythropoietic protoporphyria and polymorphous light eruption, and was in Phase II trials for actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma, and had been trialled in phototoxicity associated with systemic photodynamic therapy and solar urticaria. Clinuvel had also obtained orphan drug status for afamelanotide in the US and the EU by that time. In May 2010, the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA, or Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) approved afamelanotide as a treatment for erythropoietic protoporphyria. In January 2015, afamelanotide was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe for the treatment of phototoxicity in people with EPP. There were three trials that evaluated afamelanotide in those with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP). In Trial 1, subjects received afamelanotide or vehicle implant every two months and were followed for 180 days. Subjects recorded every day the number of hours spent in direct sunlight and whether they experienced any phototoxic pain that day. The trial measured the total number of hours over 180 days spent in direct sunlight between 10 am and 6 pm on days with no pain. In Trial 2, subjects received afamelanotide or vehicle implants every two months and were followed for 270 days. Subjects recorded every day the number of hours spent outdoors whether ‚Äúmost of the day‚Äù was spent in direct sunlight, shade, or a combination of both, and whether they experienced any phototoxic pain that day. The trial measured the total number of hours over 270 days spent outdoors between 10 am and 3 pm on days with no pain for which ‚Äúmost of the day‚Äù was spent in direct sunlight. In Trial 3 subjects were randomized to receive a total of three afamelanotide or vehicle implants administered subcutaneously every two months and were followed for 180 days. Data from this trial were used primarily for assessment of side effects. The FDA approved afamelanotide based on evidence from three clinical trials (Trial 1/ NCT 01605136, Trial 2/ NCT00979745 and Trial 3/ NCT01097044) of 244 adults 18‚Äì74 years of age with EPP. The trials were conducted at 22 sites in the US and Europe. In October 2019, afamelanotide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medicine to reduce pain caused by light exposure (particularly sunlight) as experienced by sufferers of erythropoietic protoporphyria. Society and cultureUsage in general public= A number of products are sold online and in gyms and beauty salons as \\"melanotan\\" or \\"melanotan-1\\" which discuss afamelanotide in their marketing. Without a prescription the products as drugs are not legally sold in any jurisdiction and are potentially dangerous. Starting in 2007, health agencies in various counties began issuing warnings against their use. Unlicensed and untested powders sold as \\"melanotan\\" are found on the Internet marketed for tanning and other purposes, and multiple regulatory bodies have warned consumers that the peptides may be unsafe and ineffective.  Research  It is under development in other skin disorders in several jurisdictions. It causes skin to turn darker by causing the skin to make more melanin.

Calling changes in the stock market as Stock market cycles a \\"cycle\\" is a misnomer, because of its non-cyclical nature. Milton Friedman believed that for the most part, excluding very large supply shocks, business declines are more of a monetary phenomenon. Despite the often-applied term cycles, the fluctuations in business economic activity do not exhibit uniform or predictable periodicity.copied content from Business Cycle; see that page's history for attribution According to standard theory, a decrease in price will result in less supply and more demand, while an increase in price will do the opposite. This works well for most assets but it often works in reverse for stocks due to the mistake many investors make of buying high in a state of euphoria and selling low in a state of fear or panic as a result of the herding instinct. In case an increase in price causes an increase in demand, or a decrease in price causes an increase in supply, this destroys the expected negative feedback loop and prices will be unstable.

The bus is of symbolic importance to the efforts of the two nations' governments to foster peaceful and friendly relations and follows the success of the Delhi‚ÄìLahore Bus, which was launched in 1999. Background Since the First Kashmir War (1947‚Äì48), travel and communication between what became Pakistan administered Kashmir and Indian- administered Kashmir were indefinitely suspended. The region was a major theatre of war during the Indo-Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971. In the 1990s, the Line of Control was the scene of exchanges of fire between Pakistani and Indian forces and infiltration of militants into Indian Kashmir. The idea of the Srinagar‚ÄìMuzaffarabad Bus was inspired by the success of the Delhi‚ÄìLahore Bus, established in 1999, as well as other cross-border transport initiatives such as the Samjhauta Express and the Thar Express. However, the proposal was not considered until after the normalisation of bilateral relations following the 2001‚Äì2002 India‚ÄìPakistan standoff, during which the Delhi‚ÄìLahore Bus had also been suspended. Finalisation of bus link The proposal was placed under official consideration by both countries in 2003 and was supported by the ongoing ceasefire and peace talks between militants and Indian forces as well as Kashmiri people who wanted to visit relatives separated since the 1947‚Äì48 war that divided the region. The Pakistani government under President Pervez Musharaff began extensive talks with the administration of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which were continued by the administration of Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, who succeeded Vajpayee in 2004. The official agreement was promulgated on February 16, 2005, when then-Indian Minister of External Affairs K. Natwar Singh visited the then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharaff in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The decision was announced along with agreements on starting a new bus service connecting the Pakistani city of Lahore and the Indian city of Amritsar, establishing the Thar Express train service and opening respective consulates in the cities of Karachi, Pakistan, and Mumbai, India. The Indian official position viewed the bus service as a \\"humanitarian measure without prejudice\\" and not affecting the rival policies and stands of the two governments on the Kashmir conflict. To make the bus safe and fully operational, the LoC would be demined if and where necessary and other security arrangements would be made as well. Both governments announced that the bus service could be used by Indian and Pakistani citizens wishing to travel anywhere in Indian Kashmir and Pakistani Kashmir, including the Northern Areas of Pakistan, which are part of India's claim on Kashmir and pre-1947 Kashmir. Bus service details The bus runs a distance of 170 kilometres (110 mi). The bus service was officially launched on April 7, 2005 and was flagged-off by the Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. In India, all citizens would have to apply at the Regional Passport Office in Srinagar, which was the designated authority to evaluate applications, verify identities and issue entry permits. The Indian government has proposed improving travel permit procedures, increasing the frequency of the bus service to weekly instead of a fortnight, and starting bus services connecting Kargil, India, with Skardu, Pakistan, and Jammu, India, with Sialkot, Pakistan.

UNAIDS estimate there to be 12,000 prostitutes in the country. Morals Police captain Vladimir Istrati is quoted as saying \\"Prostitution in Moldova is a very well organised crime, there is a precise structure of operation which includes secretary, office and owner.\\" The secretary is hard to file evidence against because they are most likely to conceal their true activity behind offering exotic services over the phone. Nailing down prostitutes and pimps is easier.\\" Prostitution in Transnistria is punishable only by a fine, but there is no such clause as in the Moldovan legislation. Local names Prostitutes in Moldova are known locally by a variety of names: * StradƒÉ (street worker) - work on the street, often drug addicts or alcoholics * Scaun (stool) - work in bars and restaurants * Lum√¢nare (candle) - stand on the side of main roads * CƒÉlƒÉtori (travellers) - accompany car and truck drivers on journeys * Prostituate cu acoperi»ô (prostitutes with a roof) - indoor workers * Interdevochka (intergirls) - work in upmarket hotels, usually entertaining foreign clients History Prostitution in Moldova was first recorded in the 2nd century BC. In the 19th century there is evidence of pimps being involved. The trade's existence was initially denied during the Soviet era and then prohibited July 27 1987. Until May 31, 2009, punishment was a fine or administrative arrest for up to 30 days, the administrative arrest was then replaced by unpaid work for a period of 20 to 40 hours. On December 29, 2005, it was decided that sanctions would not apply to victims of trafficking; The new law \\"On Offences\\" gave this rule a broader wording: \\"a person engaging in prostitution contrary to their will\\". Sex trafficking Since it is Europe's poorest country, it is a major exporter of human trafficking for the purpose of the sex trade. The CIA names human trafficking as one of the major crime issues of Moldova.CIA World factbook: Moldova Human traffickers primarily recruit women from poor villages. Women and children are trafficked for sexual exploitation to Turkey, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Russia, Cyprus, Greece, Albania, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, France, Italy, and Portugal. The annual country human rights report from the United States Department of State pinpoints some involvement by government officials and Moldovan law enforcement in human trafficking. The United States Department of State issued a report in 2006 on human rights violations in MoldovaMoldova: 2005 country report on human rights practices stating: > \\"The country was a major country of origin for women and children trafficked > abroad for forced prostitution and men and children who were trafficked to > Russia and neighboring countries for forced labor and begging. The country > was also a transit country for victims trafficked from Ukraine to Romania. > Women and girls were trafficked to Turkey, Cyprus, Italy, Hungary, and the > Balkan countries for prostitution. NGOs reported recent cases of victims > trafficked to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Women and girls reportedly were > trafficked to Italy and Greece through Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, and > Albania. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), > victims have increasingly been directed to Asia, Russia, Turkey, Western > Europe, and the Middle East. The IOM reported that the country was the main > origin in Europe for women and children trafficked for forced prostitution.\\" The authorities have tried to lead awareness among the population about the extent of this problem, and during the early 2000s the authorities launched numerous information campaigns. One consisted of billboards in the streets of the capital Chi≈üinƒÉu depicting a girl gripped in a huge clenched fist and being exchanged for dollars. The caption read: \\"You are not for sale\\". E. Benjamin Skinner in his book \\"A Crime So Monstrous\\", on page 156, speculates that between 1991 and 2008, up to 400,000 women were trafficked from Moldova.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on September 15, 1956, and stars Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. The cartoon expands upon the rivalry depicted between Bugs and Daffy, in such films as Chuck Jones' 1951 short Rabbit Fire, this time placing the action in a show-biz setting. In this 7-minute short, Daffy must double for Bugs in any slapstick that Warners deems too dangerous for its top star. After each disaster, Daffy shouts \\"MAKEUP!\\". The director directing the scenes has an Erich Von Stroheim accent. This is one of the only four Warner Bros. shorts (the others being This Is a Life?, Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers, and [Blooper] Bunny) in which Bugs is paired with each of his three main antagonists (Daffy, Elmer Fudd, and Yosemite Sam). The title is a play on the film A Star Is Born. Plot The opening frame depicts the exterior of Bugs' dressing room, inside which he is talking to the journalist, Lolly (a reference to the nickname of Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons). Outside, we see Daffy sweeping the floor, complaining about the job he got. Fed up, Daffy decides to be a movie star. Daffy then marches into the casting director's (possibly Jack L. Warner) office just as he is on the phone with another executive discussing the difficulty in finding anyone \\"STUPID ENOUGH\\" to be Bugs' stunt double for his next picture. Daffy of course takes the job! After a visit to the Make-Up Department, Daffy gets his first taste of on-the-set film action shortly thereafter (a Western co-starring Yosemite Sam). Initially, Daffy is extremely excited to be finally in any motion picture (\\"I could be sent to prison for the scenes I'm gonna steal!\\", he snickers). He takes Bugs' place in a rabbit costume and holding a carrot, and stands next to Sam. Daffy gets the worst of it instead of Bugs! Next, Bugs is in a scene where Elmer Fudd is cast in his usual role as trying to hunt Bugs. Bugs is high in a tree and Elmer is supposed to climb it to saw the branch Bugs is sitting on, off (though not all the way through, as Bugs reminds him). However, Daffy has other ideas. He tells Elmer to come closer to him, as he has something to tell him. Lacking a clue to Daffy's actual motive, Elmer shuffles closer to Daffy, who whacks him in the head to knock him out. Daffy tries to upstage Bugs by sawing off the branch Bugs is on; unfortunately for Daffy, the branch Bugs stands on is solid, while the part Daffy stands on falls to the ground! After this sequence, Bugs is fishing off a pier, but Daffy takes no notice. Despite Bugs' advice to let HIM do the scene, Daffy insists on taking his place at the end of the pier and his fishing rod. Yet he is not safe from the film script even now, as a giant bluefin tuna swallows him whole. Another scene wherein Bugs is chased by Elmer follows this one, culminating when Bugs dives into another tree. With the \\"SCREWY RABBIT\\" cornered, Elmer aims his gun into the tree but gets poked in the rear by the gun's barrel (in reality, it is really Bugs holding another gun). When Elmer pulls his gun back, the other one makes the same movements. Wondering just how stupid Elmer is, Daffy furiously marches onto the set, snatches Elmer's gun and shoves him off. Daffy sticks the gun into the hole in the tree in which Bugs is hiding but what he believes to be another gun (in reality it is HIS gun bent around so that it points at his hindquarters) sticks up through a hole in the ground just behind him! Daffy retracts his gun; the \\"other\\" gun does the same. Daffy does this two or three more times before he decides to try a small experiment. He ties a red ribbon around the barrel of his gun, then sticks it into the tree, and looks behind him. The ribbon on the gun in the ground is white with red polka dots, leading Daffy to believe it to be a fake. He shoots, intending to mark Bugs, but the bent-around gun plan is revealed when the bullet hits him in the hindquarters and he pulls the gun out of the tree. The ribbon is white with red polka dots! Daffy did not notice that Bugs had switched the ribbon. The next scene has Bugs piloting a plane accelerating up to 20,000 feet, then going uncontrollably in the direction of the ground. At the last second, the plane is \\"stopped\\" before crashing and Bugs get out and his place gets taken by Daffy who, as usual, gets the worst of it, once again! Having finally had more than enough, Daffy announces that \\"I'm through playin' stooge to a rabbit! I wanna star in my OWN picture!\\" to the casting director, who promptly tells the distraught Daffy that he has just such a script: the starring role in a new movie called \\"The Duck\\". The final scene shows the filming of \\"The Duck\\", with Daffy starring as a typical duck in a peaceful pond and directed by the same man who helmed the earlier movie wherein Daffy subbed for Bugs. Just as in the first scene of the earlier film, Daffy digs out his script to rehearse his line. When the director announces \\"Camerrrra! Action!\\" Daffy says, \\"I wonder where all the hunters are today?\\", at which point ten hunters suddenly surround the pond, gun Daffy down and leave. Again infuriated, Daffy shrieks, \\"I DEMAND TO KNOW WHO WROTE THIS SCRIPT!\\" The cruel screenwriter turns out to be none other than... Bugs, to whom the camera is now transferred and who says, \\"I'd love to tell him, but, uh... hehehehe... modesty forbids.\\" Cast *Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Director (voice) *Arthur Q.

Each year, the program accepts around 20 new students between the ages 12 and 15, half of which are from outside the Vancouver School District. This is out of approximately 200 applicants; rigorous testing must be performed to select acceptable candidates. Over the course of two years, students aim to complete the required high school curriculum along with some university level coursework. When they graduate from the program, the students usually are accepted into UBC earlier than they would if they had graduated from a regular high school (aged 14‚Äì17 instead of 18‚Äì19). The program was first established in 1993 by the Vancouver School Board, British Columbia Ministry of Education and the University of British Columbia. Students of the program have access to most UBC facilities and possess UBC undergraduate student cards. The program held its 20th anniversary on May 15‚Äì17, 2015. Location The Transition Program is located in the heart of the University of British Columbia, on 240D 1924 West Mall. The building the Transition Program resides in is the Auditorium Annex located on West Mall. It is above the Math Graduates office, across from the Pacific Institute of Mathematical Sciences building, and behind the Walter C. Koerner Library. Work load The University Transitions Program's student workload is much higher than that of most regular high schools. It compacts the five year high school curriculum into two years. The curriculum compacting is effectively achieved due to the demonstrated high-level of learning ability and motivation of the students. The program requires students to work hard and take responsibility for their learning outcomes while offering a supportive learning environment. The students are supported by the Transitions Program staff, parents, and themselves to ensure a positive and productive learning environment. Achievements * The Transition Program is the winner of the 2008 Grades 8 and 9 Math Challengers, the 2009 Grade 9 Math Challengers, the 2011 Grade 9 Math Challengers, the 2012 Grade 8 Math Challengers, the 2015 Grade 9 Provincial Math Challengers, the 2018 Grade 8 and 9 Regional Math Challengers, and the 2020 Grade 8, 9 and 10 Regional Math Challengers. Students from the Transition Program have held top placements in the Provincial Math Challengers competitions. * Students have been invited to Seattle for the Northwest Intramurals Math Competition. * The Transition Program has won awards at numerous Model United Nations Conferences. * The Transition Program has won a Reach for the Top Junior Championship in 2003. * The Transition Program has won a bronze medal in a Reach for the Top Junior Championship in 2014. * The Transition Program has won a silver medal in a Reach for the Top Junior Championship in 2018. * The Transition Program has won a silver medal in a Reach for the Top Junior Championship in 2020. * The Transition Program is the winner of the 2009 Investja investment competition. * Four students from the Transition Program won the physics competition, B.C.'s Brightest Minds, in 2009 and 2010 (Allen Zhang and Yin Shu Yang in 2010, Karlming Chen and Angus Lim in 2009).

It was their first and only release with Jet Records.  Background  The album was recorded in September 1990 and released six months later to commemorate the group's 10th Anniversary. By this time, the group was down to three members: Bobby G, Cheryl Baker and Mike Nolan, member Shelley Preston having left at the end of 1989. The album consisted of many of Bucks Fizz's hit singles and cover versions of popular hits, although didn't include the entire concert. The cover photos were not taken at the Fairfield Halls gig as featured on the album, as the shots taken had been damaged, and so new ones were taken in early March 1991 at a private gig at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London.Information from fans attending both gigs The album was released two weeks later in time for their Eurovision anniversary on 4 April. The release of the album coincided with the closure of record company Jet, resulting in it receiving little promotion. The album failed to chart. In 2012, during sessions for The Lost Masters albums, two tracks taken from this concert were uncovered which had not been included. These were medleys - one of old Motown hits, the other of Rolling Stones songs. These were included on the third edition of The Lost Masters.

Macy and Cheryl Hines respectively) are on their own unsuccessful quests to find love.
