The dinosaurs were Elvis, a male Tyrannosaurus, Paula, a female Brachiosaurus, Jagger, a male Stegosaurus, Hammer, a male Chasmosaurus, and Madonna, a female Geosternbergia (despite having the crest of a male, and despite the fact that Geosternbergia was a genus of pterosaur rather than a dinosaur). The films were made by Moonbeam Entertainment, the family-oriented sub-brand of B-movie producer Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment. Richard Band, Michael Bishop, and Fuzzbee Morse composed the music for the movies. Development In the early 1990s, Charles Band was working on a new label from Full Moon Entertainment, called Moonbeam Entertainment. Moonbeam Entertainment was created specifically for family, science fiction and fantasy films created for children and adults with no \\"hard edge\\" to them. Around the same time, storyboard artist Peter von Sholly, approached Band with a concept about creating a movie about miniature dinosaurs. Band, intrigued with the idea, thought that it was perfect to be the first Moonbeam film. David Allen Productions and Mark Rappaport created the special effects for all of the films. The first Prehysteria! was co- directed by Charles and Albert Band and it was released in 1993. The film was a huge success, gaining over $100,000,000 in rental sales. Due to its outcome, a sequel, Prehysteria! 2, was quickly developed and released in 1994. No character from the first film returned; however, Albert Band returned to direct. In 1995, Moonbeam developed a second sequel entitled Prehysteria! 3. David DeCoteau directed the film. The only returning character was Owen Bush from the second film. All of the films were released by Paramount Home Video. *Besides the dinosaurs, Mr. Cranston (Owen Bush) is the only returning character in the series. The Stegosaurus, Jagger, never appeared on the first three film posters. Prehysteria! was Austin O'Brien's first lead role. The Tyrannosaurus, Elvis, and Brachiosaurus, Paula, have appeared on all of the film posters. The dinosaurs in the first three films were realized by traditional stop motion animation and rod puppets. Prehysteria! 2 and Prehysteria! 3 were both aimed at younger audiences. Madonna the Geosternbergia hurt her wing in Prehysteria! 2, so that the producers could save money on the cost of stop motion animation. In Prehysteria! 3, Madonna does not fly. Prehysteria! was the first Moonbeam Entertainment film. Prehysteria 2 was Moonbeam's first sequel. The characters of \\"Richie\\", played by Stuart Fratkin and \\"Louis\\", played by Tony Longo from the first Prehysteria!, were brought back to star in another Moonbeam Production, \\"Remote\\", because they had done so well as comedic thugs in Prehysteria!. FilmsPrehysteria!= The first film in the series that was released in 1993, Prehysteria! tells the story of Rico Sarno, a museum curator, who enters a forbidden temple in South America, and discovers a nest of five eggs. He steals them and brings them back to his museum. Frank Taylor (Brett Cullen), a farmer, sells fossils to Rico and in a mix-up, the Taylor's dog takes a cooler, which has the eggs. The kids, Monica (Samantha Mills) and Jerry (Austin O'Brien) discover the dinosaurs when they hatch and try to keep it a secret, until their father finds out. When Vicki (Colleen Morris), a woman who works for Rico, sees the dinosaurs, she tells the Taylors not to give them back to Rico because he will expose them. Rico finds out the Taylors have them and hires two robbers to help him get the dinosaurs back.

Mr. Cranston is a friend of the Taylors and he watches the mini-dinosaurs while they are on vacation. The five mini-dinosaurs break out of the Taylors' farm and accidentally get shipped into a crate of raisins. The crate is found in a box car by Naomi (Jennifer Harte), a girl whose father works at the train station and a rich kid named Brendan Wellington (Kevin Connors) who is hiding in the box car because he is being chased by bullies who are about to attack him. When the two discover the raisin crate, they get into an argument on who should keep the dinosaurs, Brendan claiming that he saw them first and Naomi claiming them on the fact that it is her box car. Brendan pays a worker for the crate, knowing that the dinosaurs are inside. Brendan is unhappy because he has no friends and is desperate for attention because his father does not spend much time with him. Naomi and Brendan later become friends and the mini-dinosaurs help the boy get the attention he needs, and try to save him from his abusive Mistress Miss Winters who is allergic to animals. When she finds out about Brendan having pets (not knowing that they are dinosaurs) she hires two exterminators. She also views Brendan as a child with a lot of problems and wants to send him to a disciplinary school.

This time, the five dinosaurs fall out of the back of Mr. Cranston's truck, and they make their way to another family's home. The dinosaurs help the MacGregor family, who is struggling with their mini-putt golf course. Ella MacGregor, (Whitney Anderson) is in love with her Scottish culture, but is sad that the mini-putt golf course is going under. She finds the dinosaurs, and with her family's help, they re-build the golf course with a dinosaur theme, which helps them a lot. But Ella's evil uncle Hal MacGregor (Bruce Weitz) is determined to take over the course by all means, and Ella and her parents must hide the mini-dinosaurs to protect them from danger.

Route 138's northern terminus is at Route 28 in Milton. Route description Running generally north, Route 138 crosses from Rhode Island into Fall River, where it meets the southern terminus of Route 79 at exit 5 of Interstate 195, then begins a concurrency with Route 79 and later, U.S. Route 6. Routes 138 and 6 then travel off of Route 79 and over the Brightman Street Bridge into Somerset, where the concurrency with U.S. Route 6 splits at an intersection with Route 103. Route 138 proceeds through Dighton and into Taunton, intersecting Route 140 and U.S. Route 44 at Taunton Green. In Raynham, the route has an interchange with Interstate 495 at exit 8 before continuing into Easton, where it intersects Route 106 before beginning a brief concurrency with Route 123 near Stonehill College. Route 138 meets the western terminus of Route 139 at the beginning of an extremely short concurrency with Route 27 in downtown Stoughton, before crossing into Canton and meeting Interstate 93/U.S. 1 at exit 2 (Exit 2A is for Route 138 south, while 2B is for Route 138 North).

The purpose of a splog can be to increase the PageRank or backlink portfolio of affiliate websites, to artificially inflate paid ad impressions from visitors (see made for AdSense or MFA-blogs), and/or use the blog as a link outlet to sell links or get new sites indexed. Spam blogs are usually a type of scraper site, where content is often either inauthentic text or merely stolen (see blog scraping) from other websites. These blogs usually contain a high number of links to sites associated with the splog creator which are often disreputable or otherwise useless websites. There is frequent confusion between the terms \\"splog\\" and \\"spam in blogs\\". Splogs are blogs where the articles are fake, and are only created for search engine spamming. To spam in blogs, conversely, is to include random comments on the blogs of innocent bystanders, in which spammers take advantage of a site's ability to allow visitors to post comments that may include links. In fact, one of the earliest uses of the term \\"splog\\" referred to the latter. This is used often in conjunction with other spamming techniques, including spings.  History  The term splog was popularized around mid August 2005 when it was used publicly by Mark Cuban,Cuban's original post is archived here . but appears to have been used a few times before for describing spam blogs going back to at least 2003.See, for example, a June 13, 2003 hackermojo.com entry, which uses the term, albeit in reference to spam comments on blogs. It developed from multiple linkblogs that were trying to influence search indexes and others trying to Google bomb every word in the dictionary.

It was the first publication of the company that was also known as Softdisk, which would go on to publish disk magazines for other systems, other software, and later be involved in Internet access, hosting, and development.  History  The brainchild of Jim Mangham, who then worked at the LSU Medical Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, Softdisk (originally intended to be called The Harbinger Magazette, but launched as Softdisk Magazette, with \\"magazette\\" being a portmanteau word combining \\"magazine\\" and \\"diskette\\") was published out of Mangham's house, with his then-wife Judi Mangham, LSUMC co-worker Al Vekovius, and Softalk magazine (a paper magazine for the Apple) as partners in the venture. The first issue was published in September, 1981, and consisted of a single 5.25\\" floppy diskette which could be flipped over to get to content on the back side. There was fairly little content on the first issue, and it was mostly repeated on the second issue, so later when issue numbers were retroactively assigned for the purpose of back issue sales the October, 1981 issue was designated as \\"Softdisk #1\\", with the preceding month's issue considered either \\"#0\\" or unnumbered. Reusable mailer used to send early issues of Softdisk Originally, the subscribers had to send back the previous month's disk when the following issue was received; reusable mailers were used for this purpose, with a postage-paid return address label on the flip side of the address label used for outbound mailing, which was inserted in a plastic Ziploc baggie on the outside of the mailer so it could be reversed by the recipient. This disk return requirement was due in part to the fact that floppy disks were more expensive in those days and needed to be reused for economy, but was also designed to allow the subscribers to participate by leaving feedback electronically on the returning disks, as well as article and program submissions. At first, the only payment for published material was in the form of coupons for free issues (subscriptions were on a month-to-month basis, with subscribers enclosing payment for the next issue along with returning disks; the price was $5 per issue at first), though eventually monetary payments were instituted. There was quite a bit of submitted material even before there was any financial incentive to participate; similarly to later projects such as open-source software and wikis, Softdisk found a community of willing participants with motives other than making money. As the publication grew and evolved, however, it became more conventional and \\"mainstream\\", losing some of its early quirky flavor and the community that developed around it; ultimately, it was more of a normal commercial publication, sold on an annual subscription basis and in retail stores, with a paid staff and contracted freelancers to produce material, and without any disk-return requirement. Within the Apple II platform, Softdisk spawned Softdisk G-S for the Apple IIgs computer in 1989; Softdisk G-S lasted until 1997.Apple II History Chap 21 It took advantage of the improved graphic and sound capabilities of the IIGS over earlier Apple models. Diskworld for the Macintosh (later Softdisk for Mac) was also published, and eventually Softdisk was redesigned to have a similar user interface, with many of the same staff people working on both the Mac and Apple II products. The original publication continued past the time when most people in the computer field regarded the Apple II as obsolete, but eventually ended publication in August, 1995 with issue #166 (at which point then-editor Peter Rokitski was putting it out practically singlehandedly), survived by disk magazines for other computer lines such as the Macintosh and Windows which lasted a few more years before the entire line of Softdisk disk magazines was terminated. Back issues of both Softdisk and Softdisk G-S magazines for the Apple II and IIgs can be purchased through Syndicomm. They also sell complete sets of the two magazines on CD- ROM, with each issue's disks in multiple disk image formats for use in either emulators or on actual Apple II computers.

Briefly, the technique is based on the fact that free atoms will absorb light at frequencies or wavelengths characteristic of the element of interest (hence the name atomic absorption spectrometry). Within certain limits, the amount of light absorbed can be linearly correlated to the concentration of analyte present. Free atoms of most elements can be produced from samples by the application of high temperatures. In GFAAS, samples are deposited in a small graphite or pyrolytic carbon coated graphite tube, which can then be heated to vaporize and atomize the analyte. The atoms absorb ultraviolet or visible light and make transitions to higher electronic energy levels. Applying the Beer-Lambert law directly in AA spectroscopy is difficult due to variations in the atomization efficiency from the sample matrix, and nonuniformity of concentration and path length of analyte atoms (in graphite furnace AA). Concentration measurements are usually determined from a working curve after calibrating the instrument with standards of known concentration. The main advantages of the graphite furnace comparing to aspiration atomic absorption are the following: * The detection limits for the graphite furnace fall in the ppb range for most elements * Interference problems are minimized with the development of improved instrumentation * The graphite furnace can determine most elements measurable by aspiration atomic absorption in a wide variety of matrices. System Components GFAA spectrometry instruments have the following basic features: 1. a source of light (lamp) that emits resonance line radiation; 2. an atomization chamber (graphite tube) in which the sample is vaporized; 3. a monochromator for selecting only one of the characteristic wavelengths (visible or ultraviolet) of the element of interest; 4. a detector, generally a photomultiplier tube (light detectors that are useful in low-intensity applications), that measures the amount of absorption; 5. a signal processor-computer system (strip chart recorder, digital display, meter, or printer). Mode of Operation Most currently available GFAAs are fully controlled from a personal computer that has Windows-compatible software. The software easily optimizes run parameters, such as ramping cycles or calibration dilutions. Aqueous samples should be acidified (typically with nitric acid, HNO3) to a pH of 2.0 or less. GFAAs are more sensitive than flame atomic absorption spectrometers, and have a smaller dynamic range. This makes it necessary to dilute aqueous samples into the dynamic range of the specific analyte. GFAAS with automatic software can also pre-dilute samples before analysis. After the instrument has warmed up and been calibrated, a small aliquot (usually less than 100 microliters (¬µL) and typically 20 ¬µL) is placed, either manually or through an automated sampler, into the opening in the graphite tube. The sample is vaporized in the heated graphite tube; the amount of light energy absorbed in the vapor is proportional to atomic concentrations. Analysis of each sample takes from 1 to 5 minutes, and the results for a sample is the average of triplicate analysis.

The company produced and distributed a number of low-budget horror and fantasy feature films including Trancers and The Dungeonmaster. Notable films from the company include Re-Animator, From Beyond, Trancers, Dolls, TerrorVision, Prison, Troll, and Ghoulies. HistoryEarly years (1983‚Äì1984)= Sensing the emerging theatrical market for independently produced horror and science-fiction films, producer Charles Band opted to create a mini-studio that rivaled the studio system of the major Hollywood companies. The first mention of the name Empire Pictures came in May 1983 at Cannes when Band sought funding for Parasite II, the proposed sequel to his successful Parasite from the previous year. The initial Empire Pictures productions included Swordkill (aka Ghost Warrior) and The Dungeonmaster, which both received limited theatrical releases in 1984. =Box office success (1985‚Äì1986)= Empire's first box office success came in early 1985 with the release of Ghoulies. Released in several major markets, the film had grossed up to $3,455,018 by February 1985; upon release in New York City the film grossed over $1 million in that city alone its first weekend. This theatrical success paved the way for the company to showcase future cult hits Trancers and Re-Animator in theaters. Flush with cash, Band ended up purchasing Castello di Giove, a 12th-century castle located in Giove, Italy. The intention was to use the castle as a European base of operations and a filming location. During this time period Band also purchased Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica, the studio founded by Dino De Laurentiis in 1946, for an alleged $20,000,000. 1986 saw the company's biggest output in terms of theatrical releases with Eliminators, From Beyond, TerrorVision, and Troll. The latter proved to be Empire's biggest success that year, grossing $5,450,815 when released in nearly 1,000 theaters. =Bankruptcy (1987‚Äì1989)= With a studio secured in Italy, 1987 saw the company significantly increase the amount of production. Empire showed up at the American Film Market in February 1987 touting 36 new releases to offer companies. Titles produced during this time included Dolls, Ghoulies II, Prison, and Robot Jox. Empire also narrowed its focus on theatrical product after entering into a distribution agreement with Vestron Video. Empire Pictures began to collapse in mid-1988 due to financial problems and long-term debt obligations to Cr√©dit Lyonnais. Once it became clear that Empire could not last, the company was seized by the bank and taken over by Eduard Sarlui's Epic Entertainment (later Epic Productions) in May 1988. This led to in- production titles such as Stuart Gordon's Robot Jox, Peter Manoogian's Arena, and David Schmoeller's Catacombs to be delayed in release by several years. The following fall of the same year, Band formed another company, Full Moon Entertainment, which also specializes in horror/fantasy genre films. The studio's rise and subsequent fall are covered in the book Empire of the 'B's: The Mad Movie World of Charles Band written by Dave Jay, Torsten Dewi, and Nathan Shumate. The story is also the subject of the upcoming documentary Celluloid Wizards in the Video Wasteland by Daniel Griffith. As of 2017, MGM via Polygram Entertainment is the current owner of a majority of the Empire Pictures library.

It was designed by A. I. Gontskevich and S. Sulin and opened on 15 May 1935 along with the first stage of the metro. The station is situated under the southern part of the Vozdvizhenka Street (which was then called Kominterna‚Äîhence the original name) next to the building of the Russian State Library. The northern of the two side platforms of the station works during rush hours only.  History  Originally the station was not included in the plans for the first stage due to its closeness to the Biblioteka Imeni Lenina station. When a change to the plans was introduced with a new station it was decided not to augment the design of the planned large tunnel with parallel tracks separated by a row of columns, but to modify it by increasing its height and building platforms on the sides in what is known as a Parisian Style. Construction began in July 1934, and immediately problems were encountered. Under the street was situated a massive sewage pipe consisting of fragile ceramic, and with an outflow of two million buckets. In such conditions, even a slight vibration in the soil would have caused a serious accident, especially since the proposed subway tunnels were only 1.5‚Äì2 metres away from it. A few solutions to the problems were proposed, either to temporary turn off the sewer system and deposit the massed water via a gully on the Arbatskaya square into the Moskva River, or to relay the sanitation into metallic pipes. Moscow Soviet discarded both ideas, the former out of sanitary and hygienic interests, the second one because that would have required closing off the whole street for a few weeks to the traffic. Engineer Kulbakh came up with a more innovative solution ‚Äì relaying the collector not from trenches dug up from the surface, but from those in which the walls of the tunnels were built. Works on a shared 40-metre stretch were carried out with superior precision and accuracy, thus preventing the collector to be damaged, with no injuries or streets being closed off. For the remaining part of the station very little problems took place and in record times on 31 January 1935 the station was completed. The unique circumstances which resulted in station is accredited to its current appearance with side platforms that are curved and three rows of octagonal columns. The two outer rows of columns, which run along the centre line of each platform, are faced with white marble. The third row of columns, painted white and resting on square, black-tiled piers to account for the difference in height between the track bed and the platforms, runs along the main axis of the station and separates the two tracks. Passenger cross over a central bridge that was added later. Old vestibule For entrances and exists as well as transfers to the close by station Biblioteka Imeni Lenina, a temporary vestibule was built (architects P. Faidysh and S. Lavrov), and was situated on the corner of Vozdvizhenka and Mokhovaya streets (currently an entrance to an understreet subway is located there). A more permanent vestibule was planned to be included inside the massive building of the Lenin library. One more vestibule was planned on the western end exiting to a subway underpass across the recently demolished Voyentorg building. Staircases from the platforms still exist and go to rooms that are used for service needs. No direct transfer to Biblioteka Imeni Lenina originally existed, that was because on the first stage trains went from Sokolniki to Smolenskaya (Kievskaya after 1937) and then onto Park Kultury one after the next. Although transfer corridors were completed soon after, it is unlikely that they were used prior to the opening of the Pokrovskiy radius in 1938 which allowed to separate Arbatskiy from Kirovskiy. During this time the main library building was being completed which had plans to accommodate a metro entrance inside it. The new vestibule was due to be opened in 1940, but it became apparent that the station will not cope with the passenger traffic that will bestow upon it, and a reconstruction project was developed. Both platforms would be connected with a small footbridge over the paths, and the transfer corridors were to double in width. However World War II delayed the plans' realisation, and the new vestibule was opened only in 1946. During this time the reconstruction was finally carried out, with the footbridge being directly accessible from the vestibule. Its pre-war planning is clearly demonstrated in the light architecture, uncharacteristic of the postwar Stalinist monumentalism. The dark narrow corridors with staircase were also widened and leveled by raising the floor a total of 1.5 metres. On the 24 December 1946 of that year the reconstruction was complete, and the station was renamed as Kalininskaya following the disestablishment of the Comintern. On 5 April 1953 a new, deep Arbatsky radius was launched. Kalininskaya was closed to passengers and its underground section was sealed. The vestibule inside the library was handed over to Arbatskaya which required an escalator to be built to connect to the main underground lobby of the new station, a staircase was also built in place of Kalininskaya's foyer. The passenger traffic was also divided, to rise ‚Äì escalator, down ‚Äì staircases. Two out of three passes to Kalininskaya's platforms were sealed. However, on 8 November 1958 metro traffic on the new Filyovskaya line was re-opened, starting from Kalininskaya and including the first, shallow Arbatsky radius. During the mid-1960s additional access to the subways under the crossroads as well as a second transfer corridor to Biblioteka Imeni Lenina were added. In a second reconstruction (1997‚Äì99), the small escalator was removed and replaced with a staircase. During its history the station was renamed several times, originally opened as Ulitsa Kominterna it was renamed in 1946 to Kalininskaya after Mikhail Kalinin. However the confusion caused by a similarly named Kalininskaya line and the changing politics in the USSR caused the station to be renamed again. In 1990, it was officially renamed Vozdvizhenka for the nearby square; however after only a few days, was renamed Alexandrovsky Sad after the Alexander Garden next to the Kremlin.  Transfers  Station is a part of largest interchange hub of Moscow Metro, consisting of 4 stations. From here, it is possible to change into Arbatskaya station of the Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line and Biblioteka Imeni Lenina station of the Sokolnicheskaya line in eastern end of station, those 2 stations have combined exit to Mokhovaya street. Through those stations it is possible to change into the Borovitskaya station of the Serpukhovsko‚ÄìTimiryazevskaya line. There is no direct change into the Borovitskaya station.–ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è –æ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ ¬´–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–∞–¥¬ª –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–π—Ç–µ –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–∞ –°–≤–∏—Ä–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∫–æ–≤–∞ ¬´–ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–µ –º–µ—Ç—Ä–æ¬ª  References  Category:Moscow Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1935 Category:Filyovskaya Line Category:Railway stations located underground in Russia ","title":"Aleksandrovsky Sad (Moscow Metro)"},{"id":"2501424","text":"The National and University Library (, ), established in 1774, is one of the most important national educational and cultural institutions of Slovenia. It is located in the centre of Ljubljana, between Auersperg Street (), Gentry Street (), and Vega Street (), in a building designed by the architect Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik in the years 1930‚Äì31 and constructed between 1936‚Äì41. The building is considered one of the greatest achievements by Pleƒçnik. According to the Mandatory Publications Copy Act, issuers are bound to submit a copy of each publication they publish to the National and University Library. In 2011, the library kept about 1,307,000 books, 8,700 manuscripts, and numerous other text, visual and multimedia resources, and was (in 2010) subscribed to 7900 periodicals. Books and other resources are kept at storehouses at Auersperg Street () and at Lesko≈°ek Street (). There have been significant problems with a lack of space and a new modern building has been planned to be built in the vicinity. History Around 1774, after the dissolution of Jesuits, the Lyceum Library formed from the remains of the Jesuit Library and several monastery libraries. It was established with a decree issued by Maria Theresa. The submission of legal deposit copies to the Lyceum library became mandatory with a decree published by the Austrian court in 1807, at first only in Carniola, except for a short period of French administration, when it received copies from all the Illyrian provinces. In 1919, it was named State Reference Library and started to collect legal deposit copies from the entire Slovenia of the time. In the same year, the University of Ljubljana (the first Slovenian university) was established and the library served its needs too. In 1921, it started to acquire legal deposit copies from the entire Yugoslavia. It was named University Library in 1938. Architecture Early phases of construction of the library building (1937) Since 1791, the library was located in the building of Ljubljana lyceum. In 1919, additional space was provisionally dedicated to it in the building of the Poljane Grammar School. In 1930‚Äì31, plans for a new building were created by Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. Initially the project encountered resistance by the Yugoslavian authorities based in Belgrade. However, persistent student protests and demonstrations have been effective,NUK: History , retrieved 5 October 2010 and the new building was erected between 1936 and 1941 by the company of the constructor Matko Curk. The library building is the most monumental of Pleƒçnik's works in Slovenia. In its size and form, it models the former Ducal Court (), which was at the same location and was destroyed in the 1895 earthquake. The building has a square ground plan and is a massive block with a court. The front fa√ßade, oriented toward Auersperg Street, was designed as a combination of brick and stone embeddings, some of them archaeological remains from the place. It was modelled in the manner of the Italian palazzo, similar to the house of the Italian architect Federico Zuccari. The handles of the main door end with a little head of Pegasus. The symbiosis of the fragile glass and massive walls in other parts of exterior is entirely original. The side walls are oriented towards Gentry Street and Vega Street. The side entrance from Gentry Street is decorated with a sculpture of Moses, created by Lojze Dolinar. The interior comprises four wings and the central hallway. Light comes to the main entrance through windows in the main reading room, which is at the top of the main staircase, oriented crosswise. This symbolises the central thought of the building's architecture, \\"From the twilight of ignorance to the light of knowledge and enlightenment\\". The staircase and its 32 columns are built of the dark Podpeƒç marble, actually limestone. In addition, there is a small staircase with landings in the form of balconies in each of the four corner of the building. The main reading room, modelled after the industrial aesthetics of the 19th century, is decorated with large chandeliers. It has two glass walls at each side, divided in two symmetric parts by a column and forming part of the side walls of the building. There are wooden tables and chairs. The equipment in main spaces of the building is scarce. The cellar was renovated in 2000 by Marko Mu≈°iƒç, when the building was also additionally protected against earthquakes. The library was depicted on the reverse of the 500 tolar banknote, issued in 1992 by the Bank of Slovenia. Expansion A construction of new building of the National and University Library, named NUK II, has been planned since 1987. It will stand on the corner of Zois Street (), Slovene Street (), Roman Street (), and Emona Street (). In a competition in 1989, the proposal put forward by Marko Mu≈°iƒç was chosen. For it and the work in the following years, Mu≈°iƒç was paid over 2 million euros and the country has spent over 30 million euros for NUK II. However, construction was never started. There were several causes for the delay, among them problems in the process of the acquisition of the real estate, the preparation of the documentation necessary to obtain the construction permit and the archaeological excavations of the remains of the Roman castrum Emona that took place in 1990‚Äì99 and in 2008. In 2009, the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology, led by Gregor Golobiƒç, found the original plans outdated and decided that the competition had to be repeated. It was carried out again in late 2011 and early 2012. The evaluating committee, led by Ale≈° Vodopivec, received 120 proposals, almost half of them from outside Slovenia. In May 2012, the committee chose the proposal submitted by the architectural office Bevk Peroviƒá arhitekti as the best. The new library will be suited to the digital era, and archaeological remains in the area will be integrated in the overall composition. , the date of the beginning of construction and the expected costs were not yet known. The site has been used as a provisional parking lot.

It stars Ozu regular Chish≈´ Ry≈´ as the patriarch of the Hirayama family who eventually realises that he has a duty to arrange a marriage for his daughter Michiko (Shima Iwashita). It was Ozu's last film; he died the following year on the day he turned 60. Today, An Autumn Afternoon is considered by many to be one of Ozu's finest works. \\"252. An Autumn Afternoon (Ozu, 1962)\\" Plot Tokyo, 1962. Sh≈´hei Hirayama (Chish≈´ Ry≈´) is an aging widower with a 32-year-old married son, K≈çichi (Keiji Sada), and two unmarried children, 24-year-old daughter Michiko (Shima Iwashita) and 21-year-old son Kazuo (Shin'ichir≈ç Mikami). The ages of the children and what they respectively remember about their mother suggests that she died just before the end of the war, perhaps in the bombing of Tokyo in 1944-45. Since his marriage, K≈çichi has moved out to live with his wife in a small flat, leaving Hirayama and Kazuo to be looked after by Michiko. Hirayama and five of his classmates from middle-school, Kawai (Nobuo Nakamura), Horie (Ry≈´ji Kita), Sugai (Ts≈´zai Sugawara), Watanabe (Masao Oda) and Nakanishi, hold regular reunions at a restaurant called Wakamatsu (\\"Young Pine\\"), which is owned by Sugai. They reminisce about old times and banter with each other. For example, Horie is teased about having a new young wife and asked whether he is taking pills to maintain his virility. Their old teacher of Chinese classics, Sakuma (Eijir≈ç T≈çno), nicknamed Hy≈çtan (\\"the Gourd\\"), attends one of the reunions. We learn from a remark of his that Hirayama went from school to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, so would have been a career naval officer up to 1945. Sakuma has too much to drink, and when Kawai and Hirayama take him home, they find that he has fallen on hard times and is running a cheap noodle restaurant in a working-class area. They meet his middle-aged daughter Tomoko (Haruko Sugimura), who missed the chance to marry when young and is now too old. Sakuma's former pupils decide to help him out with a gift of money, and Hirayama goes back to the restaurant to hand it over. While he is there, Yoshitar≈ç Sakamoto (Daisuke Kat≈ç), the owner of a small local car-repair shop, comes in for a bowl of noodles and recognises Hirayama as the captain of the ship in which he served as a Petty Officer during the war. He takes Hirayama to his favourite bar. Hirayama notices that the bar-owner Kaoru (Ky≈çko Kishida) resembles his dead wife. Kaoru puts on a recording of the patriotic song Warship March and Sakamoto marches up and down, holding a salute and singing meaningless syllables in time to the music, in a mocking version of military drill. Later, Hirayama visits the bar alone and Kaoru puts the record on again. Two tipsy customers begin to parody the kind of morale-boosting radio propaganda announcements that would have been introduced by this tune during the war. K≈çichi borrows 50,000 yen from his father, ostensibly to buy a refrigerator, but this is more than the refrigerator will cost. He plans to use the extra money to buy a set of second-hand golf clubs from his colleague Miura (Teruo Yoshida). His wife Akiko (Mariko Okada) doesn't want him to, and says that if he is going to indulge himself like this she will spend money on an expensive white leather handbag. Eventually, having made her point, she relents. The \\"Gourd\\" tells his former pupils that it is because he selfishly kept her at home to look after him that his daughter is now condemned to a lonely life as a spinster. Troubled by this, Hirayama recognises his own selfishness in keeping Michiko at home to look after him, and decides to arrange a marriage for her. He asks K≈çichi to find out if Miura, whom Michiko is fond of, is interested. Unfortunately, Miura is already engaged. K≈çichi and Hirayama break the news to Michiko. Michiko does not react but retires to her room. Hirayama and K≈çichi conclude that she is not upset, but a little later Kazuo comes in and asks why Michiko is crying. Hirayama later asks Michiko if she is willing to go for a matchmaking session with a candidate Kawai has selected. Michiko agrees. In one of the ellipses Ozu is famous for, the film next shows us Michiko being dressed in a traditional wedding kimono and head-dress. She has clearly agreed to marry, but the bridegroom, and the wedding ceremony, are never shown. After the wedding, Hirayama goes to a bar with friends while K≈çichi, Akiko and Kazuo wait for him at home. When he returns, drunk, K≈çichi and Akiko leave. Kazuo goes to bed, leaving Hirayama by himself. In the final scene, a melancholy Hirayama drunkenly sings snatches of the Warship March. His last words in the film are \\"Alone, eh?\\".

The Japanese title, \\"A Taste of Sanma\\", refers to the sanma or Pacific saury fish. As a seasonal food, sanma is used in Japanese culture to represent autumn. Ozu chose this as representative of the changes taken place in Japan (cf. the Spring and Autumn Period). ReleaseReception= An Autumn Afternoon is widely regarded as a masterpiece.

It is home to a variety of cultures with a thriving local economy. Hyson Green has the largest ethnic minority population in the city. Since 2006 Hyson Green has seen a larger rise in development and direct international investment than any other area of Nottingham. It and \\"Forest Fields are areas of long-standing multiple disadvantage and have a negative image in the city.\\" Hyson Green is spread over Berridge and Arboretum wards of Nottingham. While the local economy is improving, child poverty remains higher than average, as listed in Nottingham City Council's ward profiles. The area is served by Radford Road tram stop and Hyson Green Market tram stop on the Nottingham Express Transit. The opening of the tram system has boosted Hyson Green's profile and helped to regenerate the area. History Hyson Green was built on the southern part of the Basford and Nottingham Lings, a large sandy waste of gorse bushes, ling and heather with patches of grass. After the Norman Conquest it became part of the demesne of William Peverel, chief steward to William I in the Lordship of Lenton and Basford. William built Lenton Priory and removed any remaining trees. On the night of 19 October 1330, King Edward III walked along it with a posse of men to apprehend Roger Mortimer, in Nottingham Castle. He would have walked from Low Sands, or Radford through High Sands (now written as Hyson Green). Ecclesiastically Hyson Green was within the Parish of Radford. The borough of Nottingham consisted of three parishes:St Mary, St Nicholas and St Peter; building was restricted to within those tight geographical limits. As the definition was loosened, Hyson Green grew. After the enclosure act in 1798, the open forest at High Sands was cultivated. There were fields and gardens, and there is note of one ancient house and Bobbers corn mill. =First housing= The first modern house was built in 1802, then in 1820 rows of houses were built in Pleasant Row, Lenton Street, Saville Row, Lindsay Street, and Pepper Street by societies of workmen: stocking-makers and warp hands. The houses cost ¬£70 each, and workmen paid for them in instalments. The upper rooms were used as workshops where the residents installed rented stocking frames. These four-storey houses were spacious with long individual front gardens. These were a change from the confined courts and yards of New Radford, which however were soon to follow. A tea garden and bowling green was made at the \\"Cricket Players\\" public-house which was established by John Pepper about 1824. The government of Nottingham was changed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The Enclosure Act, 1844 freed Nottingham's open fields for building. The streets were lit with gas in 1869. In 1875, Hyson Green was a few streets of houses mainly between the tram lines on Radford Road and the Hyson Green Works, a brass foundry, on Gregory Boulevard. There was open country between the settlement and Scotholme House in New Radford. The terraced frameknitters houses had generous gardens. In addition to the brass- foundry there was a lace factory, an Anglican church with attached school and two Methodist Chapels. In Bedford Square and Radford Court (both demolished) were groups of back to back cottages. The Borough Extension Act 1877 brought Basford, Radford and thus Hyson Green into Nottingham. A large number of houses were built by J. R. Morrison in around 1880. He died in 1886 In 1889 Nottingham became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888. City status was awarded as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of Queen Victoria, being signified in a letter from the prime minister, the Marquess of Salisbury to the mayor, dated 18 June 1897. By 1912, this was an area of gridiron streets with densely packed small terraced houses. The generous gardens of the previous generation had been infilled with rows of small cottages This had become a classic slum, with high infant mortality and a strong self-supportive community. =On the flats= The Hyson Green Flats were built in 1965 and demolished in 1988. They were a well-known landmark in their day and many people really enjoyed living there- due to a great deal of community spirit. There were 593 individual flats and maisonettes. They had a kitchen, separate bathroom and toilet and communal underfloor central heating. Councillor Marcia Watson reminisced: > High rise was popular then. People weren‚Äôt fussy back then. The view was > beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. I loved it‚Ä¶for me, moving in and living > there, it was the first home of my own. Nottingham City Council had built these high-rise and deck access developments using major contractors, notably Wimpey and Taylor Woodrow, who built in off- the-peg schemes. The flats were accessed along 31 high level walkways. There were defects in these estates and legislative and economic changes were also afflicting disproportionately the communities which lived in council rented accommodation. There was dissatisfaction with the council as landlord in this period and its repair schedules. By 1981, renting a council house was less than aspirational. 1981 riots in Hyson Green In 1981, there were serious riots across many major cities in England, including Nottingham on the weekend of 10 to 12 July. The main motives for the riots were related to racial tension and inner-city deprivation, together with a distrust of the police and ‚Äòauthority‚Äô in general. The riots started on the Friday night on the Radford Road in response to a huge build up of police presence, and moved over to the flats in the early hours of Saturday morning. On the Saturday night the riots moved to the city centre when racists from outside the town had attacked blacks under the cover of the riots. The fighting began as a confrontation with the police using stones and petrol bombs, with shop windows only being broken ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô ‚Äì but looting developed later; the rioters were always of mixed races, ages, employed and unemployed. Petrol bombs were made and thrown but an early attempt to torch the flats was successfully resisted by the residents. Over 100 people were arrested by the police, but only one man was charged. Prince Charles visited Hyson Green Flats in 1982 ‚Äì during a fact-finding tour of Britain‚Äôs inner cities. 'He had minimum security as he visited the walkways and drank tea and talked with the residents. He left in a yellow helicopter' resident Mark Watson remembers. =Housing after the flats= The cleared area was used for an Asda superstore and low rise, lower density housing. Geography Mary Potter Centre Adjacent to The Forest tram stop is the Forest Recreation Ground, which holds the annual Nottingham Goose Fair and frequent sport matches on the grass pitches. There is a small playground, and several astro-turf pitches. The recreation ground was a race course in Victorian times. Local facilities include a library, now situated in the Mary Potter Centre. The former library building dates from approximately 1890 and has always been a free library. Local economy and religion Radford Road in Hyson Green is a busy shopping road outside of the city centre. Radford Road is home to two major Asian supermarkets,http://thenottinghamfoodblog.com/2013/01/27/ethnic-goodies-in- hyson-greens-medina-food-store-and-shariff-sons-superstore/ dozens of ethnic eateries, supermarkets, jewellers, book shops, barbers and general stores. Asda also sells Halal food. Muslim Hands has a fundraising office. The local area has a Czech Republic Protestant Church, a Russian Orthodox Church, a Greek Orthodox Church, a Nigerian Catholic Church, 2 Sikh Gurdwaras, 3 Hindu temples, a Buddhist temple and 11 Mosques. *St. Paul's Church, Hyson Green now housing. *St. Stephen's Church, Hyson Green *Hyson Green Methodist Free Church now a community centre. *St Mary's Roman Catholic Church Transport Nottingham City Transport * L12: University Campus - QMC - Hyson Green - City Hospital Island. * L14: Nottingham - Canning Circus - Hyson Green - City Hospital - Basford - Bulwell.

La Com√©die humaine consists of 91 finished works (stories, novels, or analytical essays) and 46 unfinished works (some of which exist only as titles).Pierre Citron edition, vol 1, 49‚Äì50. It does not include Balzac's five theatrical plays or his collection of humorous tales: Contes drolatiques (1832‚Äì37). The title The title of the series is usually considered an allusion to Dante's Divine Comedy;Robb, Graham: Balzac: A Life, pg. 330, 1996, W. W. Norton and Company, Inc. while Ferdinand Bruneti√®re, the famous French literary critic, suggests that it may stem from poems by Alfred de Musset or Alfred de Vigny.Bruneti√®re, Ferdinand, Sanderson, Robert Louis: Honor√© de Balzac, pg. 77, J.P. Lippincott Company, London, 1906. While Balzac sought the comprehensive scope of Dante, his title indicates the worldly, human concerns of a realist novelist. The stories are placed in a variety of settings, with characters reappearing in multiple stories. Evolution of the work The Com√©die humaine was the result of a slow evolution. The first works of Balzac were written without any global plan (Les Chouans is a historical novel; Physiologie du mariage is an analytical study of marriage), but by 1830 Balzac began to group his first novels (Sarrasine, Gobseck) into a series entitled Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e (\\"Scenes from Private Life\\"). In 1833, with the publication of Eug√©nie Grandet, Balzac envisioned a second series entitled \\"Sc√®nes de la vie de province\\" (Scenes from Provincial Life). Most likely in this same year Balzac came upon the idea of having characters reappear from novel to novel, and the first novel to use this technique was Le P√®re Goriot (1834‚Äì35). In a letter written to Madame Hanska in 1834, Balzac decided to reorganize his works into three larger groups, allowing him (1) to integrate his \\"La physiologie du mariage\\" into the ensemble and (2) to separate his most fantastic or metaphysical stories ‚Äî like La Peau de chagrin (1831) and Louis Lambert (1832) ‚Äî into their own \\"philosophical\\" section. The three sections were: * \\"Etudes de Moeurs au XIXe si√®cle\\" (Studies of Manners in the 19th Century) ‚Äì including the various \\"Sc√®nes de la vie...\\" * \\"Etudes philosophiques\\" * \\"Etudes analytiques\\" ‚Äì including the \\"Physiologie du mariage\\" In this letter, Balzac went on to say that the \\"Etudes de Moeurs\\" would study the effects of society and touch on all genders, social classes, ages and professions of people. Meanwhile, the \\"Etudes philosophiques\\" would study the causes of these effects. Finally, the third \\"analytical\\" section would study the principles behind these phenomena. Balzac also explained that while the characters in the first section would be \\"individualit√©s typis√©es\\" (\\"individuals made into types\\"), the characters of the \\"Etudes philosophiques\\" would be \\"types individualis√©s\\" (types made into individuals\\"). By 1836, the \\"Etudes de Moeurs\\" was already divided into six parts: * \\"Sc√®nes de la vie priv√©e\\" * \\"Sc√®nes de la vie de province\\" * \\"Sc√®nes de la vie parisienne\\" * \\"Sc√®nes de la vie politique * \\"Sc√®nes de la vie militaire\\" * \\"Sc√®nes de la vie de campagne\\" In 1839, in a letter to his publisher, Balzac mentioned for the first time the expression Com√©die humaine, and this title is in the contract he signed in 1841. The publication of the Com√©die humaine in 1842 was preceded by an important preface or \\"avant-propos\\" describing his major principles and the work's overall structure (see below). For this edition, novels which had appeared in serial form were stricken of their chapter titles. Balzac's intended collection was never finished. In 1845, Balzac wrote a complete catalogue of the ensemble which includes works he started or envisioned but never finished. In some cases, Balzac moved a work around between different sections as his overall plan developed; the catalogue given below represents that last version of that process. Balzac's works were slow to be translated into English because they were perceived as unsuitable for Victorian readers. John Wilson Croker attacked it in the April 1836 issue of the Quarterly Review, excoriating Balzac for immorality, saying \\"a baser, meaner, filthier scoundrel never polluted society ‚Ä¶\\" The consensus of the day was that only Eug√©nie Grandet, Le Cur√© de Tours, Le M√©decin de campagne and a few of the early short stories were suitable for females. Individual works appeared, but not until the 1890s did \\"complete\\" versions appear, from Ellen Marriage in London (1895‚Äì8, forty volumes edited by George Saintsbury, five omitted as too shocking) and from G. B. Ives and others in Philadelphia (1895‚Äì1900).Margaret Lesser: Marriage, Ellen (1865‚Äì1946). In: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, May 2010). Subscription required. Retrieved 23 August 2010. The \\"Avant-propos\\" In 1842, Balzac wrote a preface (an \\"Avant-propos\\") to the whole ensemble in which he explained his method and the collection's structure. Motivated by the work of biologists Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, Georges Cuvier and most importantly √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Balzac explains that he seeks to understand \\"social species\\" in the way a biologist would analyse \\"zoological species\\", and to accomplish this he intends to describe the interrelations of men, women and things. The importance of the woman is underlined by Balzac's contention that, while a biologist may gloss over the differences between a male and female lion, \\"in Society the woman is not simply the female of the man\\".Oeuvres compl√®tes volume 1, La maison du Chat-qui-pelote quotation: Balzac then gives an extensive list of writers and works that influenced him, including Sir Walter Scott, Fran√ßois Rabelais and Miguel de Cervantes. He then describes his writer's role as a \\"secretary\\" who is transcribing society's \\"history\\"; moreover, he posits that he is interested in something that no previous historian has attempted: a history of \\"moeurs\\" (customs, manners and morals). He also notes his desire to go behind the surface of events, to show the reasons and causes for social phenomena. Balzac then professes his belief in two profound truths ‚Äî religion and monarchy ‚Äî and his concern for understanding the individual in the context of his family. In the last half of his preface, Balzac explains the Com√©die humaines different parts (which he compares to \\"frames\\" and \\"galeries\\"), and which are more or less the final form of the collection (see below). Sources of the Com√©die humaine Because of its volume and complexity, the Com√©die humaine touches on the major literary genres in fashion in the first half of the 19th century. =The historical novel= The historical novel was a European phenomenon in the first half of the 19th century ‚Äî largely through the works of Sir Walter Scott, James Fenimore Cooper and, in France, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re and Victor Hugo. Balzac's first novel Les Chouans was inspired by this vogue and tells of the rural inhabitants of Brittany during the revolution with Cooper-like descriptions of their dress and manners. Although the bulk of the Com√©die humaine takes place during the Restoration and the July Monarchy, there are several novels which take place during the French Revolution and others which take place in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, including \\"About Catherine de Medici\\" and \\"The Elixir of Long Life\\". =The popular novel= Balzac's later works are decidedly influenced by the genre of the serialised novel (\\"roman feuilleton\\") popular at the time, especially the works of Eug√®ne Sue which concentrate on depicting the secret worlds of crime and vice that hide below the surface of French society, and by the ethos of melodrama typical of these part-works. =Fantasy= Many of Balzac's shorter works have elements taken from the popular \\"roman noir\\" or gothic novel, but often the fantastic elements are used for very different purposes in Balzac's work. His use of the magical ass' skin in La Peau de chagrin for example becomes a metaphor for diminished male potency and a key symbol of Balzac's conception of energy and will in the modern world. In a similar way, Balzac undermines the character of Melmoth the Wanderer in his \\"Melmoth Reconciled\\": Balzac takes a character from a fantastic novel (by Charles Robert Maturin) who has sold his soul for power and long life and has him sell his own power to another man in Paris... this man then sells this gift in turn and very quickly the infernal power is traded from person to person in the Parisian stock exchange until it loses any of its original power. =Swedenborg= Several of Balzac's characters, particularly Louis Lambert, traverse mystical crises and/or develop syncretic spiritual philosophies about human energy and action that are largely modelled on the life and work of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688‚Äì1772). As depicted in his works, Balzac's spiritual philosophy suggests that individuals have a limited quantity of spiritual energy and that this energy is dissipated through creative or intellectual work or through physical activity (including sex), and this is made emblematic in his philosophical tale La Peau de chagrin, in which a magical wild ass's skin confers on its owner unlimited powers, but shrinks each time it is used in science. Themes of the Com√©die humaine The following are some of the major themes that recur throughout the various volumes of the Com√©die humaine: =France after the Revolution= Balzac frequently bemoans the loss of a pre-Revolutionary society of honor which has now become ‚Äî especially after the fall of Charles X of France and the arrival of the July Monarchy ‚Äî a society dominated by money. =Money and power= \\"At the origin of every fortune lies a crime\\" : this precept from the \\"Red Inn\\" recurs constantly in the Com√©die humaine, both as a biographical truth (Taillefer's murderous fortune, Goriot's deals with the Revolutionary army), and as a sign of French collective guilt at the horrors of the Revolution (and most notably by the death of Louis XVI of France). The other source of power is rank. People of good blood aspire to a title, while people with titles aspire to the peerage. The opening section of The Secrets of the Princess Cadignan provides an explanation of why the title of prince is not prevalent nor coveted in France (compared to contemporary Germany or Russia). =Social success= Two young men dominate the Com√©die humaine: Lucien de Rubempr√© and Eug√®ne de Rastignac. Both are talented but poor youths from the provinces, both attempt to achieve greatness in society through the intercession of women and both come into contact with Vautrin, but only Rastignac succeeds while Lucien de Rubempr√© ends his life by his own hand in a jail in Paris. The difference in outcome is partly explained by Balzac's views on heredity: Rastignac comes from a noble family, while only Rubempr√©'s mother comes from a noble family (he had to obtain royal permission to use his mother's family name instead of his father's name Chardon). This deficit is compounded by the fact that his mother had not only married a commoner far beneath her in rank, but she had also performed menial labour to support herself when her husband died. Another contrast is between Emile Blondet and Raoul Nathan. Both are multi-talented men-of-letters. Blondet is the natural son of the prefect of Alen√ßon and is described as witty but lazy, incurably hesitant, non-partisan, a political atheist, a player of the game of political opinions (along with Rastignac), having the most judicious mind of the day. He marries Madame de Montcornet and eventually becomes a prefect. Nathan is described as half- Jewish and possessing a second-rate mind. Nathan succumbs to the flattery of unscrupulous financiers and does not see that they are prepared to bankrupt him to achieve their purposes. Blondet sees what is happening but does not enlighten Nathan. The downfall drives Nathan to attempt suicide by the method of \\"any poor work-girl\\". He then sells out to the government of the day (on Blondet's advice) to secure an income, and returns to living with the actress/courtesan Florine. In the end he accepts the cross of the Legion of Honour (which he formerly satirised) and becomes a defender of the doctrine of heredity. =Paternity= The Com√©die humaine frequently portrays the complex emotional, social and financial relationships between fathers and their children, and between father-figures and their mentors, and these relationships are metaphorically linked as well with issues of nationhood (the king as father, regicide), nobility (bloodlines, family names), history (parental secrets), wealth (the origin of parental fortunes, dowries) and artistic creation (the writer or artist as father of the work of art). Father Goriot is perhaps the most famous ‚Äî and most tragic ‚Äî of these father figures, but in Le P√®re Goriot, Eug√®ne de Rastignac also encounters two other paternal figures, Vautrin and Taillefer, whose aspirations and methods define different paternal paths. Other significant fathers in the series include Eug√©nie Grandet's abusive and money-hoarding father and C√©sar Birotteau, the doomed capitalist. =Maternity= At one end of the scale we have 100% maternal involvement ‚Äì as depicted by the upbringing of the sisters de Granville (A Daughter of Eve) later Mesdames Felix de Vandenesse and du Tillet. At the other end of the scale we have 0% maternal involvement ‚Äì as depicted by the upbringing of Ursule Mirou√´t by four men: her half-uncle-in-law (an atheist and republican), the local priest (saintly), the district judge (learned) and a retired soldier (worldly). We are left in no doubt that it is the second option that produces what Balzac considers to be the ideal woman. Ursula is pious and prone to collapsing in tears at the slightest emotion. =Women, society and sex= The representation of women in the Com√©die humaine is extremely varied ‚Äî spanning material from both the romantic and pulp traditions ‚Äî and includes idealized women (like Pauline in La Peau de chagrin or Eug√©nie Grandet), the tragic prostitute Esther Gobsek (Splendeurs et mis√®res des courtisanes), the worldly daughters of Goriot and other women in society who can help their lovers advance, the masculine and domineering Cousine Bette, and the alluring and impossible love object (Foedora in La Peau de chagrin or the heroine of La fille aux yeux d'or). The latter category also includes several lesbian or bisexual characters.

History Parkwood was first settled by Henry Willett of Willett & Co, who was granted Canning Location 21 on the Canning River (which included nearby Lynwood) and settled in the area in June 1832. In November 1964, the Shire of Canning proposed the names \\"Burtsdale\\" and \\"Willetton\\" for Willetton and Lynwood/Parkwood respectively, the name Burtsdale honouring Septimus Burt, who purchased the land in 1882. In August 1965, developers at Lynwood requested the name \\"Clovercrest Estate\\", but finally agreed to \\"Lynwood\\". The name Willetton was shifted westwards and Lynwood was gazetted in December 1965. Parkwood became its own suburb in 1993 and Lynwood still exist north of High Road. Geography Parkwood is bounded by High Road to the north and northeast, Nicholson Road to the east, Roe Highway to the south and Willeri Drive to the west.  Facilities  Parkwood is a residential suburb with a scattering of parks of varying sizes. It contains Lynwood Senior High School (1974) and Parkwood Primary School (1975, originally called West Lynwood), which contains one of Perth's seven primary- school-level Intensive English Centres. The program is designed to assist refugees, displaced children and others with low English literacy, many of whom have special needs. The Stockland Riverton shopping centre, located in northwestern Parkwood on High Road, is near the Canning Arts Centre and the Riverton Leisureplex. The Riverton Leisureplex is a large facility with sporting, fitness and recreation facilities first opened on 9 November 2001, is operated by the City of Canning and includes the council's largest library. The building was designed by the architectural firm James Christou and Partners. The southeast is served by a neighbourhood shopping centre on Vellgrove Avenue and community and sports centre, which back onto Whaleback Golf Course, an 18-hole public golf course. The facility first opened on 9 January 1981 on a buffer reserve between the Canning Vale industrial area and the housing developments in Parkwood and Lynwood, and was significantly upgraded in December 2002.

Many of the farms located on Konnerud have names that ends with rud (mean clearing). It is generally believed that the farms located near Konnerud date from 1100 - 1400. =Mining= One of the many entrances to the mine Many valuable and high quality metals and minerals including silver, copper and lead are located around Konnerudkollen, a small mountain near Konnerud. In the middle 1730s, action was taken to mine these minerals. Due to the lack of prior experience, development had been delayed until Count Wedel-Jarslberg brought in mining experts from Germany. The minerals had to be transported to Svelvik, resulting in expenses which soon exceeded revenues from mining. Many of the fishing lakes of Konnerud, such as Svensedammen and Sagdammen, exist today purely because of this problem, as the mines needed a place nearby to clean the minerals. The mining provided jobs for newcomers to Konnerud, and investors earned considerable profit until the mining was given up on completely in 1790. Konnerud Hill Mines (Konnerud Gruver) Konnerud Hill Mines (mindat.org) =Konnerudkollen Hotel= Konnerudkollen Hotel (Norwegian: Konnerudkollen Touristhotel) opened in 1898 and was used as a place where visitors could relax and get away from the stress of city life. The King of Norway, Haakon VII stayed there. It burned down to the ground in the early 1960s. Today, only two buildings remain of the hotel. Remains of the foundation can still be seen clearly. The lot where the hotel once was placed is now used as a place to keep horses. =Konnerud Old Church= In 1737, Konnerud received a church of their own due to the increased population resulting from the mining operation. The oldest church in Konnerud, (Norwegian: Konnerud Gamle Kirke), was originally built in 1760, but quickly deteriorated because of the lack of care. It was rebuilt again in the middle of 1850 and consecrated during 1858. Konnerud Old Church was designed by the architect, Georg Fredrik Wilhelm Hanstein (1820-1862). The altarpiece was painted by Nils Alstrup Dahl (1876-1940).

The main reason was to attract miners with families to the mines. The school burnt down completely in 1933, but was quickly rebuilt again in 1934, which was doubled in size. The school originally had a house meant for the principal, but the idea was cast away after the Second World War when the house was used by Nazi commanders. Due to the growing number of children in Konnerud, the school has had buildings attached to it during 1954, 1981, 1996 and finally in 1997. For a long time, Konnerud School was the largest school in Buskerud. The largest number of students was 750 in 1983-84.

G. Wells. It features an inventor who builds a time machine and travels in time using it, and it pre-dates Wells's best-selling 1895 time travel novel The Time Machine by seven years. Writing and publication \\"The Chronic Argonauts\\" was written in serial parts while Wells was ill and staying with friends in Stoke-on-Trent, from early April to early July 1888. Wells later recalled that: \\"at Etruria my real writing began. ... Moreover I began ... the original draft of what later became The Time Machine...\\".H. G. Wells, Experiment in Autobiography, 1934. It was published in the April, May, and June 1888 issues of the Royal College of Science student magazine The Science Schools Journal. Two digital versions of the text, available online April 2020, both show four subheadings: * Being the Account of Dr. Nebogipfel's Sojourn in Llyddwdd * How an Esoteric Story Became Possible * The Esoteric Story Based on the Clergyman's Depositions: The Anachronic Man * The Chronic Argo \\"The Chronic Argonauts\\" was the second story to use an inventor-built machine to travel in time, a year after the publication of Enrique Gaspar y Rimbau's El anacron√≥pete. Despite extensive biographical work on Wells over more than a century, there is no evidence to suggest that Wells saw or was influenced by the 1881 New York newspaper story \\"The Clock that Went Backward\\", in which an antique clock served as a time-travel device. \\"The Chronic Argonauts\\" later developed into the famous final version of The Time Machine (1895), with the bulk of the re-writing and new writing being done in 1894. The finished novel has a number of points of similarity with the first short-story version of 1888. Plot summary A third-person narrator describes the arrival of a mysterious inventor in the inward-looking Welsh town of Llyddwdd. Dr. Moses Nebogipfel takes up residence in a house neglected after the deaths of its former inhabitants. The simple rural folk become apprehensive about Nebogipfel's activities in the house and suspect him of witchcraft. Ultimately they storm the inventor's \\"devilish\\" workshop. Nebogipfel escapes with the sympathetic Reverend Elijah Ulysses Cook, in what is later revealed to be a time machine. The unnamed narrator later discovers the dazed Reverend Cook, who has been missing for three weeks. Cook then becomes a second narrator, relating in flashback the night of his disappearance, and a series of subsequent adventures in time with Nebogipfel. He reveals that Nebogipfel understands himself to be an \\"Anachronic Man\\", a man whose genius drives him to seek out a time more suited to his abilities. A 'time loop' is implied, in which Nebogipfel went back to the past and killed the previous owners of the house, thus causing it to fall into ruin and enabling him to occupy it for his present-day experiments. Inspiration for Nebogipfel Since the 1970s there has been some discussion among scholars about a possible source of inspiration for Nebogipfel, since he is the root of the stock character of the time-travelling scientist. These suggestions were summarised by Martin T. Willis, who stated that the scholars had \\"reached no conclusions about the character of, or inspiration for, the Time Traveler\\", and added his own suggestion of the American inventor Thomas Edison.Martin T.

It is ≈åshima'a second feature film and is known for its elements of Japanese nuberu bagu. The film won the 1960 Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Newcomer for ≈åshima. Plot After Makoto Shinjo hitchhikes a ride, the driver tries to molest her, but is stopped by Kiyoshi Fuji. He takes her on a date, first to watch the Anpo Protests against the US-Japan Security Treaty, and then later to ride a motorboat on a river, where he rapes her. One day, after trying to wait for him at a bar he frequents, she is targeted by gangsters who prostitute women, but Kiyoshi fights them and they leave them alone in exchange for a payment. The two fall in love and Makoto spends more time with him, causing her to be rebuked by her older sister Yuki, resulting in her deciding to live with him. To make money, the two reconstruct how they met, with Makoto seducing a driver and, when he comes on to her, Kiyoshi extorting him. In one case, a politician named Horio picks her up, but makes her feel happy so she doesn't do it. When Makoto finds out that she is pregnant, Kiyoshi tells her to get an abortion, but when he tries to get her to exploit a driver again, she refuses. Horio picks her up, and when she calls Kiyoshi to ask whether she can stay the night, the line is busy. Kiyoshi asks an older lover he is seeing for a loan and when he gives the money to Makoto, she tells him she slept with Horio. In response he finds Horio and takes money from him, telling him that he was just another target of Makoto's. After the abortion, performed illegally at the clinic of Yuki's former lover Akimoto, the couple is arrested for extortion. After they confess, and with the help of Kiyoshi's older lover, the two are released and Akimoto is arrested. Kiyoshi breaks up with Makoto so they won't hurt each other anymore. The gangsters find Kiyoshi because the motorbike he borrowed from them for the extortions was stolen, resulting in two of them being arrested. They ask him to give them Makoto, but Kiyoshi refuses and is killed. At the same time Makoto is given a ride by a passerby, and when he refuses to let her out, she jumps out of the car to her death.

The use of adolescent criminals as protagonists generated controversy at the time, though the film was also a commercial success, which helped to pave the way for the emergence of a young and adventurous generation of new Japanese filmmakers: in short order, Shohei Imamura, Masahiro Shinoda, Yasuzo Masumura, Susumu Hani, Hiroshi Teshigahara and others began to attract international attention. In this film, ≈åshima was already beginning to explore the themes he would soon become celebrated for: a focus on youth and on 'outsiders', and critical deconstructions of more stereotypical imagery in Japanese cinema. Reception Vincent Canby of The New York Times complimented the colors and cinematography of the film, but was confused by its unexplained political and social references and felt the story was told too distantly, making it dim. Mary Evans of The Japan Times compared the film to a sociological study which, while mostly succeeding, failed when it moralized. She also found faults in the originality of the story, the violence of the ending, and the portrayal of the gangsters and Makoto, but called the film strong and praised ≈åshima's \\"great feeling for his medium.\\" James Hoberman of The Village Voice described the film as a \\"candy-colored extravaganza [that] is directed with considerable brio and filled with bold metaphors\\", but felt that certain aspects were dated such as \\"powerless men preying upon even weaker women\\" and its \\"absence of cynicism and even careerism.\\" The film won the 1960 Blue Ribbon Awards for Best Newcomer for ≈åshima.

Plot Mitchell Goosen (McDermott) is a teenager from California who loves to surf and rollerblade. His zoologist parents are given the opportunity for grant work in Australia for six months. Eager to accompany his parents to the surf-friendly shores of the South Pacific, he is dismayed to find out that he will not be joining them and instead will be living with his aunt and uncle in Cincinnati, Ohio, so as to finish the remainder of his high school semester. He arrives in Cincinnati in the midst of a winter storm, quickly coming to the realization that this is far from the free-spirited ocean atmosphere that he has been accustomed to. He meets his cousin Wiley (Green), an awkward but affable teenager and his aunt and uncle whose lifestyle and demeanor, though warm and hospitable, is a bit old-fashioned. Mitchell's first day at school is met with the typical fish out of water obstacles as he immediately grows to the disfavor and jealousy of the gritty hockey players who chastise Mitchell for his easygoing \\"Maharishi\\" philosophy and \\"California\\" appearance. These antagonists include Jack (Conrad), Augie (Black), Snake (Vargas), Rosenblatt, and the Banduccis. With an upcoming hockey game against the rival \\"preps\\", led by the aggressive and arrogant Blane, Wiley and subsequently Mitchell are asked to fill-in for two students who are caught putting a laxative into one of their teacher's coffee. Mitchell accidentally scores a goal for the preps, cementing his status as outcast with the hockey players. Jack is particularly upset and proceeds to tackle Mitchell while still on the ice, concussing him and leaving him unconscious for what appears to be hours. Over the course of the next few weeks, Mitchell and Wiley are harassed and pranked relentlessly, but one bright spot comes in the form of a girl named Nikki (Powell), who Mitchell makes a deep connection with. During a double date with Wiley and Nikki's friend Gloria, Blane (who is revealed as Nikki's ex) appears and physically confronts Mitchell and Nikki. Mitchell, a staunch pacifist, is attempting to defuse the situation peacefully even as Wiley is hurt in the confrontation. The intervention of Jack further complicates the situation as he is revealed to be Nikki's brother, and is not happy to see her with Mitchell. Mitchell is at first flippant to Jack's aggression, but steadfastly refuses to fight Jack. At Jack's insistence that Mitchell is backing out because he's scared, Mitchell's laidback stoicism cracks and he replies that he won't fight Jack because he and subsequently anyone else in Cincinnati isn't worth his time or effort as he's leaving in three months. Upon hearing this, Nikki leaves, heartbroken, having taken his comments to include her as well. Wiley also expresses his disappointment in Mitchell for not at least standing up for Nikki. In school, Nikki rebuffs Mitchell's attempts at reconciliation and Wiley is also upset. Sometime later, Mitchell is inspired by a dream (involving a Spanish-speaking shark named Pepe) to fight for Nikki without fighting Jack. Wiley is skeptical, but follows his cousin to a street hockey game between Jack's friends and the Preps the next day. Mitchell approaches the team who ostensibly agree to let him play (hoping to watch him suffer an injury), but are taken aback when he easily scores a goal against the preps. In the next play, it would appear that Mitchell suffers a setback when Blane takes a cheap shot, and he again backs down from a fight, but then Mitchell takes his revenge by sneaking up on Blane and pantsing him in front of the crowd, revealing he's not wearing any underwear under his jock strap. He escapes a pack of preps, but only after reconciling with Nikki, asserting to her that there are some things worth fighting for. Snake, Augie, the Banduccis, and Rosenblatt (Jack being notably absent) visit Mitchell at home, at first appearing to be hostile but then raising him up over their heads, celebrating his actions against Blane and finally accepting him as a new friend. They solicit Mitchell's help and rollerblading expertise in a race down a harrowing street route termed \\"Devil's Backbone\\" against the preps to settle their score once and for all. On the day of the race, it is agreed upon that the first team with three members crossing the finish line will be deemed the winner. Jack and Mitchell have a silent moment where they at least grudgingly appear to bury the hatchet. The race begins and many skaters, including Auggie, are injured. Snake takes the lead, with two of the preps struggling to keep pace with him. Jack and Blane follow, and after some difficult struggles, Mitchell start to bridge the gap. The remaining preps fall behind when the Banducci twins forego racing altogether in favor of simply fighting them all. Snake is the first across the finish line, located on the harbor by Riverfront Stadium, followed closely by two preps. Mitchell loses sight of Blane and Jack, but catches up by jumping from a second-story parking lot and landing on a makeshift ramp provided by a flatbed truck. Jack falls, but Blane, with the finish line in sight, attempts to push Mitchell into the water. Mitchell stops short and Blane falls into the river. Mitchell goes back, helps up Jack and the two cross the finish line together to the cheers of their awaiting schoolmates. Mitchell has finally earned the respect of Jack and his friends, and he is lifted on the shoulders of a cheering crowd. Mitchell and Nikki reunite and share a kiss as the movie ends.

The website's consensus reads, \\"Airborne skates downhill with a threadbare story, flat characters, and wince-inducing dialogue.\\" In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman commended the production team for their efforts, praising cinematographer Okada for giving the film \\"a surprising natural light look\\" and composer Copeland for providing \\"a well above average rock score\\", and giving huge credit to second unit director Steve Boyum, stunt coordinator Pat Parnell and the skaters for making the skating scenes and finale \\"inherently cinematic\\". Willman added that, \\"Off the skates, it's at best mediocre Nickelodeon fare\\", writing that \\"[A]s the first major filmic celebration of in line skating and holy Rollerbladers, Airborne (citywide) is hell on wheels and itchy limbo off.

It replaced the cancelled Justice League International (formerly Justice League Europe) and ran for nineteen issues from 1994 to 1996. Overview Several heroes split from the main Justice League over dissatisfaction with the League's association with the United Nations. These characters form their own Justice League, based in Mount Thunder, Colorado. The team is led by Captain Atom and consists of Maxima, Blue Beetle (Ted Kord), Booster Gold, and Amazing-Man (Will Everett III). They were later joined by Firestorm (Ronald Raymond), Plastique, and the Wonder Twins (Zan and Jayna). Carol Ferris became the administrator of their Mount Thunder facility. The characters never referred to the team as \\"Extreme Justice\\" in the series; however, they were called that in an issue of Justice League America. Although at one point there were three Justice League groups in action (Extreme Justice itself plus Justice League America and Justice League Task Force), there was very little unity between the teams and a strong sense of rivalry among the respective leaders, Captain Atom, Wonder Woman, and the Martian Manhunter regarding which team would succeed in the pursuit of justice. Notably, Captain Atom led the team in an invasion of Bialya yet again.JLA Incarnations #6. DC Comics. This was when the current ruler, Queen Beatriz, was rebuilding the Extremists. Most of Extreme Justice, having lost friends to the group before, did not want to tolerate the existence of these entities. They invaded the country and destroyed what they thought were robots, but were in fact cyborgs made out of the Queen's own subjects. They had allegedly volunteered, a whole army's worth, but Captain Atom destroys all the facilities and threatens worse if Beatriz continues. This particular incident was the last straw and all versions of the Justice League were disbanded. In the summer of 1996, all three Justice League series were cancelled and soon replaced by an ongoing monthly titled JLA.

The dogs have been used as cattle catch dogs, hunting, and guarding. It was formerly use during Spanish bullfights, and is sometimes called the Spanish Bulldog in English.  History  The name of the breed comes from the Iranian tribe of Alani, nomadic pastoralists who arrived in Spain as part of the Migration Period in the 5th Century. These peoples were known to keep large livestock guardian dogs and pursuit dogs which became the basis for the many regional Alaunt types. The first written reference to the breed in Spain is in a chapter of the 14th century \\"Book of the Hunt of Alfonso XI\\" (Libro de la Monter√≠a de Alfonso XI) in which hunting dogs called Alani are described as having beautiful colours.Alano Espa√±ol in El Mundo del Perro Magazine, retrieved 23/02/2009 Dogs of this type traveled with Spanish explorers and were used as war dogs (as was their role in Eurasia before migration) in the subjugation of Indian (Native American) peoples, as well as in the capturing of slaves. Etching by Francisco Goya portraying the dogs in the bullfighting ring as they were used in 1816. Note that the dog's ears are uncropped, indicating they were only used for bull-baiting and not dog fighting. Bull-baiting, done in the bullfighting ring with dogs of this type, was recorded by Francisco de Goya in his series on La Tauromaquia in 1816.La Tauromaquia 25, \\"Echan perros al toro\\" They Loose Dogs on the Bull It was outlawed in 1880. In 1880, use of dogs in the bullfighting ring was outlawed, so the breed numbers began to dwindle as the work they performed began to change. Big game became rare, stockyards were modernized and no longer needed dogs to hold the cattle, using dogs in bullfights was outlawed, and by 1963 Alanos were thought to be extinct. Recognition In the 1970s a group of fanciers and veterinary students made house-to-house calls in western and northern Spain. They found a few examples of the dogs in the Basque areas of Enkarterri and Cantabria that were being used to herd semi-wild cattle and hunt wild boar. A breed standard was written and the dogs were documented and bred. In the early 1990s, breeders were involved in the recovery process of the small vulnerable population, and in 1995 the breeders organized into Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Criadores de Alano Espa√±ol (the National Association of Breeders of Spanish Alano). The Alano Espa√±ol was recognised as an independent breed by Real Sociedad Canina de Espa√±a (the Spanish Kennel Club) in 2004, and studies at the University of Cordoba clarified the Alano as distinct from any other breed at the genetic level. The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture (Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentaci√≥n) recognises the Alano Espa√±ol as an indigenous Spanish breed. The breed in Spain is still small in number and the breed has not yet been recognised by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. Examples of the Alano Espa√±ol have been exported to North America where a few breeders are promoting it for its temperament and hunting ability.  Characteristics  Alano espanol The Alano Espa√±ol is a very large dog of molossoid type, with a large, strong head. Males should be no smaller than at the withers, and should weigh with females somewhat smaller. The coat is short and thick but never velvety, and is most often a brindle of any color; leonardo (fawn); black and brindle; sable wolf. White chest flashes are acceptable but prevalence of white is not. The face may or may not have a black mask. The head is the shape of a cube and is brachycephalic. The muzzle is short with the lower jaw slightly concave, and has a very large, broad, black nose. The ears are set high and may be drop or cut short. The skin is very thick, with neck folds and some wrinkles on the face. Despite the sometimes used English name, the Alano is not a bulldog: it should never have a flat muzzle or show signs of prognathism. The cranio-facial proportion should be 65:35, meaning a significantly longer muzzle than for instance the Boxer has. Since the breed was used for hunting in packs, it is sociable with other dogs.

His best remembered movie roles were as the male lead in the Powell and Pressburger films Black Narcissus (1947), The Small Back Room (1949) and Gone to Earth (1950). According to one obituary, \\"He was particularly adept at conveying the weaknesses and human qualities in figures of authority and intelligence... and he could be considered an early exponent of 'anti-hero' roles.\\" In 1949 exhibitors voted him the ninth-most popular British star. Director Michael Powell once spoke of his handsome appearance and distinctive \\"violet eyes\\", and his exceptional timing in films. Powell also stated that had Farrar been more interested in cinema and cared more about his career he could have been a much more high-profile actor, as successful as any.Black Narcissus (The Criterion Collection) (2001) DVD commentary Career Farrar was born in Forest Gate, Essex (now part of east London). He joined the Morning Advertiser on leaving school at 14 and worked as a journalist for a number of years. He became an assistant editor at 17 and earned a BA through night school when 19 whilst becoming increasingly interested in amateur theatricals. =Early years= In 1932 Farrar received an offer to tour with a repertory company at ‚Ç§7 a week. He quit his job and went on tour for 18 months. He ran a repertory company with his wife for 18 months until 1937, then went on tour again. He was seen in a play by an employee of the American RKO studio who was interested in Farrar's potential as a film actor. His first film role was in the Jessie Matthews musical Head Over Heels (1937). He also had small roles in Return of a Stranger (1937), Silver Top (1938), and A Royal Divorce (1938). He played agent Granite Grant in Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror (1938) and had a small role in Q Planes (1939). Farrar returned to the stage and performed in a production of the Wandering Jew for seven months. However, after a bomb damaged the theatre he decided to try films again. =Leading man= Farrar had his first leading role in Danny Boy (1941), which he followed with Sheepdog of the Hills (1941) and Suspected Person (1942). These were \\"B\\" movies but Farrar had a good role in an \\"A\\", Went the Day Well? (1942), as a villainous German. He had strong roles in The Dark Tower (1943) and They Met in the Dark (1943), as well as the leads in Headline (1943) and The Night Invader (1944). He was a heroic commander of an air-sea rescue unit in For Those in Peril (1944), an accountant in The Hundred Pound Window (1944), and a pilot in The World Owes Me a Living (1945). Farrar starred as Sexton Blake in two films, Meet Sexton Blake (1945) and The Echo Murders (1945), and was an intelligence officer in Lisbon Story (1946). These low- budget thrillers were enormously popular in their day. By 1945 he was receiving 800 fan letters a week. =Stardom= Farrar was transformed into a star when he was cast as the British agent Mr. Dean in Black Narcissus (1947) who arouses the passions of the nuns played by Deborah Kerr and Kathleen Byron. Made by the team of Powell and Pressburger, the movie was popular and has since come to be regarded as one of the finest films in British cinema. Farrar followed it up by playing the officer who brings home a German wife (Mai Zetterling) in Frieda (1947), directed by Basil Dearden; it was the ninth biggest film in Britain of the year. Farrar played a charismatic school teacher in Mr. Perrin and Mr. Traill (1948) and was then reunited with Powell and Pressburger for The Small Back Room (1949) in which he played an alcoholic bomb disposal expert. According to his obituary, \\"Farrar was given a true star's entrance in the film, the camera tracking along a bar of customers until coming to rest upon the actor's back. His character's name is called and he turns to face the camera in full close-up.\\" Gainsborough Pictures next gave him the lead of a \\"British Western\\" shot in South Africa, Diamond City (1949), playing Stafford Parker but the film was a flop. He reunited with Dearden for Cage of Gold (1950) and Powell and Pressburger for Gone to Earth (1950), another box office disappointment. Farrar would later cite his three films for Powell and Pressburger, and Cage of Gold, as the artistic highlights of his career. However Farrar's stardom soon lost momentum with the low-key films The Late Edwina Black (1951), and Night Without Stars (1951). =Hollywood= He was offered an heroic part in The Golden Horde (1951), at Universal with Ann Blyth, and the film was a minor hit. He was in I Vinti (1953) in Italy, then played villains in Hollywood films such as Duel in the Jungle (1954), and The Black Shield of Falworth (1954). He supported Anna Neagle in Lilacs in the Spring (1955) and was a supporting actor in Escape to Burma (1955), The Sea Chase (1955), and Pearl of the South Pacific (1956). Farrar returned to the UK for the lead in Lost (1956), and then was back to supporting parts in I Accuse! (1958), The Son of Robin Hood (1958), Watusi (1959), John Paul Jones (1959), and Solomon and Sheba (1959). =Final films= He returned to Britain for Beat Girl (1960), and The Webster Boy (1962), but following his role as Xerxes in The 300 Spartans (1962) he retired from the screen. Farrar later admitted, \\"I'd always been the upstanding young man and I was afraid of the parts that were being hinted at for uncles or for the girl's father instead of her lover! I just felt 'the hell with it all' and walked out into the sunset.\\" Personal life After the death of his wife Irene in 1976, he moved to South Africa to be with their daughter, Barbara. He died on 31 August 1995 in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, ten days after his 87th birthday.

The album showcases a return to the band's hardcore punk roots. Recording and release The EP was released after the band realized that it had written too many hardcore punk songs for its next record. Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond later said, \\"When we first started working on Hello Nasty in New York, Awol was around helping us get set up. Along with the usual bunch of experimental jamming/sampling etc., we started playing a bunch of hardcore, putting song arrangements together really quickly. Then I started writing vocals. Soon we realized that we had way too many hardcore songs to possibly put on the next album, so we decided to release them all together as an EP.\\" \\"Aglio e Olio\\" means \\"Garlic and Oil\\" in Italian, a reference to one of the simplest pasta dressings used in Italy. According to Mike D, the title was chosen \\"to let the kids know, it's eight songs but only ten minutes. It's important to let the people know\\". Aglio e Olio was the first album released by the Beastie Boys since their 1982 EP Polly Wog Stew to feature entirely hardcore punk songs. All but one of the songs contained on the EP are under two minutes in length; each song is played quickly in the style of punk rock. Initial pressings of the CD and Vinyl release came with a small adhesive label affixed with the following warning to music buyers: \\"Only 8 songs, Only 11 minutes, Only cheap $.\\" The EP was released to digital streaming services in 2020. Critical reception Despite the EP only being about 10 minutes in length, the record received mostly positive reviews. Punknews.org complimented the album, saying that Aglio e Olio is \\"a testament to times when hardcore was about attitude, not drop D tuning, playing really fast, and listening to too much Pantera.\\" Similarly, Randy Silver, Amazon.com said, \\"[t]here are better hardcore albums out there, and there are better Beastie Boys discs, but fans will still enjoy Aglio E Olio.\\" Jam! Showbiz Music Reviews stated that the EP‚Äîand song \\"Deal with It\\" in particular, \\"is entirely representative of the faster-louder sound, which makes the Ramones seem like restless experimentalists by comparison.\\" Allmusic awarded the album two out of five stars, but did not publish a review.

The term has a broad range of uses. In banking, the term refers to the process of converting or establishing something into legal tender. While it usually refers to the coining of currency or the printing of banknotes by central banks, it may also take the form of a promissory currency. The term \\"monetization\\" may also be used informally to refer to exchanging possessions for cash or cash equivalents, including selling a security interest, charging fees for something that used to be free, or attempting to make money on goods or services that were previously unprofitable or had been considered to have the potential to earn profits. And data monetization refers to a spectrum of ways information assets can be converted into economic value. Still another meaning of \\"monetization\\" denotes the process by which the U.S. Treasury accounts for the face value of outstanding coinage. This procedure can extend even to one-of-a-kind situations such as when the Treasury Department sold an extremely rare 1933 Double Eagle. The coin's nominal value of $20 was added to the final sale price, reflecting the fact that the coin was considered to have been issued into circulation as a result of the transaction. In some industry sectors such as high technology and marketing, monetization is a buzzword for adapting non- revenue-generating assets to generate revenue. Promissory currency Such commodities as gold, diamonds and emeralds have generally been regarded by human populations as having intrinsic value within that population based on their rarity or quality and thus provide a premium not associated with fiat currency unless that currency is \\"promissory\\". That is, the currency promises to deliver a given amount of a recognized commodity of a universally (globally) agreed-to rarity and value, providing the currency with the foundation of legitimacy or value. Though rarely the case with paper currency, even intrinsically relatively worthless items or commodities can be made into money, so long as they are difficult to make or acquire. Debt monetization Debt monetization is the financing of government operations by the central bank. If a nation's expenditure exceeds its revenues, it incurs a government deficit which can be financed either by the government treasury, by way of *money it already holds (e.g. income or liquidations from a sovereign wealth fund) *issuing new bonds or by the central bank, through *money it creates de novo In the latter case, the central bank may purchase government bonds by conducting an open market purchase, i.e. by increasing the monetary base through the money creation process. If government bonds that have come due are held by the central bank, the central bank will return any funds paid to it back to the treasury. Thus, the treasury may \\"borrow\\" money without needing to repay it. This process of financing government spending is called \\"monetizing the debt\\".The Economics of Money, Banking, and the Financial Markets 7ed, Frederic S. Mishkin In most high-income countries the government assigns exclusive power to issue its national currency to a central bank, but central banks may be forbidden by law from purchasing debt directly from the government. For example, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (article 123) forbids EU central banks' direct purchase of debt of EU public bodies such as national governments. Their debt purchases have to be from the secondary markets. In China, the central bank, called as the People's Bank of China (PBOC), is forbidden by the PBOC Law of 1995 to give overdrafts to government bodies, or buy government bonds directly from the government, or underwrite any other government debt securities.China debates the monetisation of deficit to deal with Covid-19's Economic Impacts, China Banking News Monetizing debt is thus a two-step process where the government issues debt (Government bonds) to cover its spending and the central bank purchases the debt from secondary markets and perpetually rolls it over, leaving the system with an increased supply of money. = Debt monetization and inflation = When government deficits are financed through debt monetization the outcome is an increase in the monetary base, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the right leading to a rise in the price level (unless the money supply is infinitely elastic).The Economics of Money, Banking, and the Financial Markets 7ed, MishkinThe economics of the platinum coin option The Economist 9 January 2013 When governments intentionally do this, they devalue existing stockpiles of fixed income cash flows of anyone who is holding assets based in that currency. This does not reduce the value of floating or hard assets, and has an uncertain (and potentially beneficial) impact on some equities. It benefits debtors at the expense of creditors and will result in an increase in the nominal price of real estate. This wealth transfer is clearly not a Pareto improvement but can act as a stimulus to economic growth and employment in an economy overburdened by private debt. It is in essence a \\"tax\\" and a simultaneous redistribution to debtors as the overall value of creditors' fixed income assets drop (and as the debt burden to debtors correspondingly decreases). If the beneficiaries of this transfer are more likely to spend their gains (due to lower income and asset levels) this can stimulate demand and increase liquidity. It also decreases the value of the currency - potentially stimulating exports and decreasing imports - improving the balance of trade. Foreign owners of local currency and debt also lose money. Fixed income creditors experience decreased wealth due to a loss in spending power. This is known as \\"inflation tax\\" (or \\"inflationary debt relief\\"). Conversely, tight monetary policy which favors creditors over debtors even at the expense of reduced economic growth can also be considered a wealth transfer to holders of fixed assets from people with debt or with mostly human capital to trade (a \\"deflation tax\\"). A deficit can be the source of sustained inflation only if it is persistent rather than temporary, and if the government finances it by creating money (through monetizing the debt), rather than leaving bonds in the hands of the public.  Revenue from business operations  Web sites and mobile apps that generate revenue are often monetized via online advertisements, subscription fees or (in the case of apps) in-app purchases. In the music industry, monetization is achieved by placing ads before, after or in the middle of content on a platform that supports this, or posting the music on on-demand apps like Spotify and Apple Music. On-demand content sites like Spotify and Apple Music pay the artist a percentage of the monthly subscription fees they receive from their users. To put release music on streaming apps like Spotify and Apple music, an artist has to reach out to a distributor like TuneCore or Distrokid. They are the one who do make the music available on streaming sites. This is usually done for a percentage of the revenue generation. For each public viewing, the advertising revenue is shared with the artist or others who hold rights to the video content. A previously free product may have premium options added thus becoming freemium. Failure to monetize web sites due to an inadequate revenue model was a problem that caused many businesses to fold during the dot-com bust. Equally, David Sands, CTO for Citibank Equity Research, affirmed that failure to achieve monetization of the Research Analysts' models as the reason the de-bundling of Equity Research has never taken hold. Monetization of non-monetary benefits Monetization is also used to refer to the process of converting some benefit received in non-monetary form (such as milk) into a monetary payment. The term is used in social welfare reform when converting in-kind payments (such as food stamps or other free benefits) into some \\"equivalent\\" cash payment. From the point of view of economics and efficiency, it is usually considered better to give someone a monetary equivalent of some benefit than the benefit (say, a liter of milk) in kind. * Inefficiency: in the latter situation people who may not need milk cannot get something of equivalent value (without subsequently trading or selling the milk). * Black market growth: people who need something other than milk may sell it. In many circumstances, this action may be illegal and considered fraudulent. For example, Moscow pensioners (see below for details) often give their personal cards that allow free usage of local transport to relatives who use public transport more frequently. * Changes on the market: supply of milk to the market is reduced by the amount distributed to the privileged group, so the price and availability of milk may change. * Corruption: firms that should give this benefit have an advantage as they have guaranteed consumers and the quality of the goods supplied is controlled only administratively, not by market competition. So, bribes to the body that choose such firms and/or maintain control can take place. =Russian social welfare monetization of 2005= In 2005, Russia transformed most of its in-kind benefits into monetary compensation. Before this reform there was a large system of preferences: free/reduced price of travels on local transport, free supply of drugs, free health resort treatment, etc. for diverse categories of society: military personnel, the disabled, and separately, persons disabled due to World War II, Chernobyl liquidators, inhabitants of Leningrad during the siege, former political prisoners, and for all pensioners (that is, women 55+, men 60+). This system was a legacy of the Soviet Union, but it was heavily extended by populist laws passed by central and regional authorities during the 1990s. By the law 122-–§–ó of 22 August 2004, this system was converted into cash payments by various means: * abolition of preference, compensated by raising of wage (e.g. free use of local transport for military personnel) or pension (e.g. different preferences for Chernobyl liquidators) * for the three most important preferences (free local transport, 50%-price suburban rail transport, free supply of drugs): a choice between the preference and some extra money. The main causes of friction in the reform were the following: * technical and bureaucratic problems (e.g. for usage of the 50% discount for suburban rail transport, a person would need to present a paper from the local State Pension Fund office stating that he/she doesn't choose monetary compensation); * separation of all preference-recipients into federal and regional according to the body authorizing the preference. The largest group ‚Äì pensioners ‚Äì was regional, and this caused most of the problems: ** In poor regions, financial pressure caused the local government to abolish these preferences with little or no compensation to the former recipients. ** Even if the preferences were retained, they would apply only to pensioners of the region in question. Thus, pensioners from the Moscow Oblast (administrative region), for example, could not freely use the metro and buses in Moscow proper, because these are two different local governments. Later, most of these problems would be solved by a series of bi-lateral agreements between neighboring regions. A wave of protests emerged in various parts of Russia in the beginning of 2005 as this law started to take effect. The government responded with measures that eventually addressed the most pressing of the protesters' concerns (raising of compensations, normalization of bureaucratic mechanisms, etc.). The long-term effects of the monetization reform varied for different groups. Some people received compensation in excess of the services they had previously received (e.g. in rural areas without any local transport, the free transport benefit was of little value), while others found the compensation to be insufficient to cover the cost of the benefits they had previously depended on. Transport companies and railroads have benefitted from monetization as they now collect higher revenue from the use their services by pensioners who had previously ridden at the government's expense. (In some regions, more than half of the passengers formerly did not pay for municipal transport, but the government did not compensate the transport companies for the full fare of these passengers.) Effects on the medical system are controversial. Doctors and nurses have to fill out many forms in order to receive compensation from the government for services provided to pensioners, thus reducing the time that they have to provide medical services. =United States agricultural policy= In United States agricultural policy, \\"monetization\\" is a P.L. 480 provision (section 203) first included in the Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198) that allows private voluntary organizations and cooperatives to sell a percentage of donated P.L. 480 commodities in the recipient country or in countries in the same region. Under section 203, private voluntary organizations or cooperatives are permitted to sell (i.e., monetize) for local currencies or dollars an amount of commodities equal to not less than 15% of the total amount of commodities distributed in any fiscal year in a country. The currency generated by these sales can then be used: to finance internal transportation, storage, or distribution of commodities; to implement development projects; or to invest and with the interest earned used to finance distribution costs or projects.CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905 See also *Remonetisation *Legal tender#Demonetization *Data monetization *Software monetization *Patent monetization *Monetized Installment Sale ReferencesExternal links *Monetizing the Debt Category:Money ","title":"Monetization"},{"id":"2501681","text":"Bayan II was an Avar khagan between 602 and 617.

It is situated approximately south from Driffield town centre, and on the A164 road. The civil parish is formed by the village of Hutton Cranswick and the hamlets of Rotsea and Sunderlandwick. According to the 2011 UK Census, Hutton Cranswick parish had a population of 2,065, an increase on the 2001 UK Census figure of 2,015. History Hutton Cranswick is listed in the Domesday Book. Within the village is the remnant of a 13th- century monastic moat beside Sheepman Lane, marking the site of a former Cistercian Grange belonging to Meaux Abbey near Beverley. Less than north-west of Hutton are the remnants of Howe Hill Bronze Age round barrow. The diameter mound was excavated in 1892. Flint articles were found, and evidence of previous disturbance of the site, including burnt bones and a food vessel indicating a burial site. The mound later might have been used as a moot hill local meeting place. At the same site, to the north-west of Old Sunderlandwick Lane, is earthwork evidence of the deserted medieval village of Sunderlandwick --a settlement mentioned in the Domesday survey--with enclosures, hollow ways, ridges and furrows, and ditches. In 1823 Hutton Cranswick was a civil parish in the Wapentake of Harthill. The parish church was under the patronage of Lord Hotham. There existed a Methodist chapel and a Sunday school. Population at the time was 917. Occupations included nineteen farmers, two blacksmiths, two wheelwrights, two joiners, three shoemakers, four shopkeepers, three tailors, a rope maker, a butcher, a corn miller, and the landlords of The Pack Horse and the Decoy Inn public houses. Two carriers operated between the village and Hull, Beverley, and Driffield once a week. The village railway station opened in 1846, as part of the Scarborough Branch Railway. Under 1 mile south-west of Cranswick is the site of the Second World War military airfield RAF Hutton Cranswick, operational between 1942 and 1946. Aerial photographs show indications of landing strips and hangars. The village's history is detailed in the locally authored A Tale of Two Villages, Hutton and Cranswick, a book written in 1980 and updated in 2000. Culture and community St Peter's Church, Hutton Cranswick Originally comprising two villages, Hutton to the north, and Cranswick to the south, the expansion of the villages has merged them together to form a single village, Hutton Cranswick. However, the individual parts of the village are still often referred to by their separate names and both maintain their individual character. Hutton Cranswick is a regular competitor in the yearly \\"Village in Bloom\\" competition. The Hutton Cranswick newsletter, The Bulletin, contains local information. The village held bonfire nights but these ceased because of lack of funding. The church, dedicated to Saint Peter, was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1966 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The village school is Hutton Cranswick Community Primary School. Cranswick local shops include one currently run by SPAR, a farm shop run by a local farming family, and a butchers. There is a public house, a hairdresser, a fish and chip shop and garages selling both cars and petrol. At the south-west of the village is an industrial estate with businesses including Cranswick Mill. The large village green contains a pond, play-park area and mature trees. \\"Swinekeld Pit\\" (pronounced \\"Swinkle\\"), with a small stream, lies at the bottom of Southgate in Cranswick. The village has a small railway station, served by Northern services on the Yorkshire Coast Line. Blue Keld water spring and bottling plant is in the parish, south-east of Hutton Cranswick village. Sport The village has its own sports' area with football pitches, AstroTurf football and tennis courts, grass and hard tennis courts, and a social hall on Rotsea Lane. It also had a football club, Hutton Cranswick United, whose first team played in the Central Midlands League. However, in December 2011 the club ceased to exist. The only surviving football team in the village are Hutton Cranswick SRA, who play in Division Four of the East Riding County League. Hutton Cranswick United Under-14s were featured in the Sky Sports magazine after they lost 24‚Äì0 to Bridlington where every player in the 12-man Bridlington squad scored. The Association also has an Archery Club (Archers of East Riding), and a cricket club. The hall is used for children's soft play, youngsters dance classes and a youth club. The village green was used to hold cricket matches that are now played east of the village on a field adjacent to the road Meggisons Turnpike.

The first system was initially observed on May 27 and the last storm, Hurricane Four, dissipated over Central America on November 1\\\\. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. The first storm moved slowly north-northwestward, bringing heavy rains and extensive flooding to Cuba, which caused at least three fatalities and at least $1 million (1890 USD) in damage. It dissipated in the Gulf of Mexico on May 29\\\\. Tropical cyclogenesis went dormant for nearly two and a half months, until another system was observed near the Windward Islands on August 18\\\\. It traversed the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, grazing the Yucatan Peninsula and making landfall in Louisiana before dissipating on August 28\\\\. Impact from the storm was minimal. Of the season's four tropical cyclones, two reached hurricane status. One of these two strengthened into a major hurricanes, which are Category 3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The strongest cyclone of the season, the third hurricane, peaked at Category 3 strength, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). Rough seas produced by this storm sunk a ship in the vicinity of the Lesser Antilles, drowning 10 people. The final tropical cyclone was first observed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 31\\\\. Peaking as a strong Category 1 hurricane, it headed westward and made landfall in Nicaragua, before being last noted over Central America on November 1\\\\. The storm produced only minor damage in Nicaragua.

It crossed Cuba without weakening and emerged into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on May 28\\\\. Later that day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. The cyclone continued to strengthen and peaked with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) early on May 29\\\\. It was last noted about 125 miles (200 km) west-northwest of Dry Tortugas, Florida at around 1800 UTC. The storm brought heavy rains to Cuba, with observed in Havana in a 36-hour period. Flooding and mudslides caused extensive damage to several cities, including Calabazar, Chorrera, Havana, Puentes Grandes, San Antonio de los Ba√±os, and Rincon. Several people had to be rescued. Nearly all telegraphic and railroad services were interrupted by flooding. With damage estimates in the millions of dollars, the event was described as \\"the most disastrous rains that had ever visited Cuba.\\" At least 4 fatalities were confirmed after a ship capsized, while a \\"good number\\" of other persons drowned. =Tropical Storm Two= After no activity for over two months, the barque Aspatogan encountered \\"very heavy weather\\" associated with a tropical storm in the eastern Caribbean Sea on August 18. The system moved west- northwestward across the Caribbean Sea and strengthened slowly. Early on August 24, the storm attained its maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), while situated about south-southwest of Grand Cayman. Re-curving northwestward, it brushed the Yucatan Peninsula on August 25, shortly before entering the Gulf of Mexico. The storm again re-curved northward while located in the central Gulf of Mexico. At 1600 UTC, it made landfall near Dulac, Louisiana with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The system quickly weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over northern Mississippi on August 28\\\\. =Hurricane Three= The steamship Haytian encountered a storm equivalent in intensity to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, while located about east-northeast of Dominica on August 26\\\\. The cyclone headed northwestward and strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane early on the following day, becoming the only major hurricane of the season. Later on August 27, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 120 mph (195 km/h). The ship Portuense recorded a minimum barometric pressure of at 0700 UTC on August 28. However, the ship sunk in the rough seas later that day while situated about northeast of Anegada, British Virgin Islands, drowning ten people, including the ship's captain and nine crew members. After peak intensity, the storm began to weaken and fell to Category 2 strength on August 29\\\\. Later that day, the hurricane began re-curving northward and then accelerated northeastward on August 30\\\\. Although the storm passed well offshore the East Coast of the United States, rough seas caused \\"great damage\\" at beaches in New Jersey. While approaching Newfoundland on September 1, the system weakened to a Category 1 hurricane. Late on September 1, it weakened to a tropical storm, shortly before becoming extratropical about 465 miles (750 km) east-northeast of St. Lunaire-Griquet, Newfoundland and Labrador. =Hurricane Four= The steamship Gussie first encountered a hurricane with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) early on October 31, while located about northeast of Providencia Island, Colombia. The cyclone tracked westward and maintained its intensity as a strong Category 1 hurricane. Late on October 31, it made landfall in Nicaragua just south of Cabo Gracias a Dios. At 0000 UTC on November 1, the system weakened to a tropical storm. Six hours later, it was last noted over the Olancho Department of Honduras. Impact from this system in Central America is unknown.

It often features various artists, unlike a medley, which features one artist each. There may be only one verse or even just a brief chorus of each song used, sometimes in addition to samples of the same or other songs. It is common to use different samples to maintain and sometimes even ridicule the original. To unify the songs together smoothly, a single backing beat may be added as background throughout the megamix, although this is not a must. This backing beat is kept basic so as to simplify mixing and to not compete with the music. These mixes are usually several minutes long at minimum, going up to a half- hour or an hour, or even more sometimes. Ultimix is known for \\"flashback medleys\\" producing at least one or two every year based on popular songs of the year. Each is about 15 minutes long, usually with at least that many songs if not more. \\"Album megamixes\\" feature all tracks from a particular album edited and compiled into one continuous medley. The \\"artist megamix\\" is also popular, including songs spanning a musician's career, with prolific artists such as Michael Jackson having more than one, usually from different remixers. Duran Duran created a megamix single from their own hits for the 1990 greatest-hits album Decade: Greatest Hits. Subsequently, artists such as Madonna, Britney Spears, and Janet Jackson have also released megamixes as singles in order to promote their greatest hits albums or in the latter's case, studio album.

His name is Iranian, meaning full moon. Either under pressure from incoming Avars,; or in revolt against the Byzantine Empire, in the winter of 558, he led a large Kutrigur army that crossed the frozen Danube. The army was divided into three sections: one raided south far as Thermopylae, while two others the Thracian Chersonesus and the periphery of Constantinople. In March 559 Zabergan attacked Constantinople, and one part of his forces consisted of 7,000 horsemen, but Belisarius defeated him at the Battle of Melantias and he was forced to withdraw.James C. Bradford, International Encyclopedia of Military History The transit of such big distances in a short period of time shows that the Kutrigurs were mounted warriors, and Zabergan's raiders were already encamped near the banks of the Danube. However, once again Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) managed to persuade the Utigur chieftain Sandilch to attack the Kutrigurs, which resulted in the decimation of both. Nevertheless, according to the 12th-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian the remnant of those Bulgars were granted Dacia in the time of Maurice (r. 582-602). It is unknown if he is related to the Byzantine general Zabergan, who in 586 defended the fortress Chlomaron against the Romans. Honours Zabergan Peak in Antarctica is named after Zabergan.

Thereafter, the system headed out to sea for a few days, before re-approaching the Southeastern United States. Late on June 16, it was last noted about south- southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina. In Cuba, moderately gusty winds and torrential rainfall were reported from Santa Clara to Pinar del R√≠o, with the worst impact conditions being experienced in Matanzas. There, the San Juan and Yumur√≠ rivers overflowed, causing water to rise above most houses. Civil guards and troops assisted rescue work and evacuation of residents. Furniture in 325 houses were swept away by the floodwaters. About 450 head of cattle drowned. Additionally, 600,000 bags of sugar stored in warehouses were lost.

The resort consists of a casino, a convention centre with meeting rooms, theatre and two ballrooms along with 32 restaurants and bars, a nightclub and recreational facilities. It also features three hotels: the 405-room Crown Metropol Perth,https://www.crownperth.com.au/hotels/crown-metropol the 291-room Crown Promenade Perthhttps://www.crownperth.com.au/hotels/crown-promenade and the 500-room luxury hotel Crown Towers Perth, which was opened in December 2016.  History  1980s = In 1984, the Western Australian Government proposed at the suggestion of Perth businessman Dallas Dempster that a casino complex be constructed at Burswood Island on the Swan River, east of the Perth city centre. This was the site of a large landfill facility, which posed difficulties in the proposal, design and construction phases due to the risk of subsidence resulting from decomposition and also the risk of release of effluent into the adjacent river as a result of pile driving for the construction. The winning bidder to build the complex was Tileska Pty Ltd, a joint venture between Dallas Dempster and Genting Berhad, a Malaysian casino operator. At the time, there were allegations by rival bidders of misconduct against Dempster and Western Australian Premier Brian Burke, but, after a thorough investigation of these accusations, the WA Inc Royal Commission found no impropriety in that regard.State Law Publisher of Western Australia Findings of WA Inc Royal Commission, Vol. 2, Ch. 8. Retrieved on 2 February 2013. Quotation: It is understandable that others should feel aggrieved by the seemingly irresistible advance of the Dempster machine after the closing date and wonder how this \\"inside running\\" could have been achieved without some impropriety somewhere. But the fact remains that despite as thorough an investigation as has been open to the Commission, no impropriety in that regard has been established. This consortium planned a two-stage construction. The first stage was initially expected to cost A$200m, and involved futuristic-looking buildings comprising a 135-table casino, 400-room hotel, 18-hole golf course, convention and exhibition centre, tennis courts, amphitheatre and other amenities, together with a beautification of the Burswood Island area. The second stage of the plan involved the A$100m construction of another hotel on the site, but no time schedule was ever set for this and the second hotel was not constructed until two decades later. The Tileska joint venture took up 60% of the capital in the Burswood Property Trust, which was to own the complex. Genting would run the resort, having experience operating casinos in Malaysia's Genting Highlands. Construction of the resort was approved by the Western Australian Parliament in March 1985 in the Casino (Burswood Island) Agreement Act 1985. It was hoped that the hotel- casino complex would be ready in time for the 1987 America's Cup race, to be hosted by Perth and construction was to be to a tight schedule in order to achieve that deadline. The Burswood Property Trust was listed on Australian stock exchanges on 30 May 1985. When it opened on 30 December 1985, Burswood Island Casino (as it was then known) was the largest in Australia, and third- largest in the world. It was expected to receive two to three million visitors per year and have an annual gross profit of A$100m. The public interest in the casino proved so much in its early months of operation that it posted a gross profit of A$1 million per day for its first two months, far outstripping expectations. In its early weeks of opening, people were reportedly forced to queue at the entrance for hours as the gaming floor was at its full legal capacity. The Burswood Island Casino was opened several months ahead of schedule, and the other parts of Stage 1 (including the hotel, conference centre, theatre and indoor stadium) remained under construction throughout 1986 and much of 1987. By January 1987, the complex recorded its three millionth visitor. Not sharing in this financial success, the Burswood Property Trust encountered financial difficulties and sold the hotel operations in the under-construction Burswood Island Hotel to Japanese investor Brisney Pty Ltd, a joint venture between investment company Yunan Development Co Ltd and hotel operator Kanematsu Trading Co Ltd. On 28 August 1987, the Burswood Dome indoor sports stadium was opened to the public, and was noted as being by far the largest auditorium in the southern hemisphere. Crown Metropol which opened as the Burswood Island Hotel in 1987 The foyer of Crown Metropol after the hotel's rebranding in 2012 The hotel's opening was delayed by 85 days, largely as a result of inclement weather and industrial disputes. This delay meant that the hotel and conference centre was not available during the early stages of the America's Cup race, necessitating refunds to overseas visitors. Although the 417-room Burswood Island Hotel opened its doors to the public on 4 October 1987, the hotel's management reportedly allowed one of the casino's highest rollers to stay there a day early, during which time he won A$1.4 million, which was believed at the time to be the highest amount ever won by an individual in an Australian casino. The Burswood Convention Centre was opened on 20 November 1987, and on 8 April 1988, the entire Burswood Island complex had its official opening. = 1990s = The casino was expanded in 1990, and an improved International Room (for high-rolling punters) was unveiled in 1995. 1998 saw the corporatisation of the Burswood Property Trust, and also saw the complete renovation of the Burswood Theatre. In 1999, the management of Burswood undertook an extensive refurbishment program of the hotel rooms. In 1996, pop superstar Michael Jackson performed three sold-out shows at Burswood Dome, on 30 November, 2 and 4 December, as part of his HIStory World Tour in front of 60,000 attendees. = 2000s = In 2000, a $96 million resort renovation and improvement program was undertaken. 2001 and 2002 saw the opening of the Ruby Room nightclub and Champion's Bar, both within the casino, and also the opening of the Grand Ballroom. In 2003, Burswood entered into a deal with land developer Mirvac Fini for the residential development of vacant land between the complex and the Graham Farmer Freeway. Picking up from the long-neglected Stage 2 of the Burswood development plan, in the early 2000s the management of Burswood made various plans to build a second hotel on the site. Eventually, in 2003 they entered into a joint venture deal with the InterContinental Hotels Group to run the existing Burswood Resort Hotel (to be re-branded as Burswood InterContinental Hotel) and a new, 291-room Holiday Inn hotel to be constructed adjacent to the Burswood Theatre. In 2004, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, whose principal shareholder was Kerry Packer, acquired full control of the Burswood International Resort Casino, and in 2005 re- branded the site as \\"Burswood Entertainment Complex\\". On 1 August 2005, the Holiday Inn Burswood opened for business after 29 months of construction. Construction finished three months early and was A$2 million under budget. The promoters proclaimed that it was \\"Perth's first purpose-built hotel in more than 12 years\\". In 2006, Burswood closed its renowned fine-dining Windows Restaurant in order to make way for a newer, expanded VIP room for high rollers. This new facility, called The Pearl Room, opened in late 2006 featuring 180-degree Swan River views. It replaced the old International Room which closed its doors following the unveiling of The Pearl Room. In 2007 Publishing and Broadcasting Limited vested its gaming interests, which included Burswood, into Crown Limited, a company controlled by James Packer, the son and heir of Kerry Packer, who died in December 2005. Also in 2007 Burswood opened The Meridian Room - a new gaming room featuring higher stakes open to the general public. The Meridian Room is located at the site of the old International Room, and has been refurbished to feature a contemporary design. MINQ, an exclusive late night bar, accessible only by a hosted lift at the entrance of The Meridian Room, opened in August 2007. Carbon Sports Bar opened in December 2007 and features a giant 12.5 x 4m wide screen and 16 x 52-inch plasmas. In December 2008, Burswood opened its new world-class dedicated poker room featuring plasma screens, dedicated bar and lounge area. In November 2009, Britney Spears performed 2 shows at the arena for her highly anticipated The Circus Starring Britney Spears tour. The shows at Burswood were Spears' first concerts in Australia. She was originally supposed to perform 5 shows in Australia during her 2004 Onyx Hotel Tour (including one at the Burswood Dome), but the shows were canceled after Spears injured her knee while filming her video \\"Outrageous\\". In April 2010 the world-renowned musical \\"Cats\\" performed the first of many shows over a 3-week period at Burswood Theatre. = 2010s = The Crown Towers luxury hotel opened in December 2016 On 14 December 2011, James Packer as the Executive Chairman of Crown Limited announced the re-branding of Burswood Entertainment Complex as Crown Perth. In March 2012 it was confirmed that the hotels on site would also be re-branded in line with sister complex Crown Melbourne upon completion of a $750 million refurbishment. InterContinental Burswood became Crown Metropol Perth from 27 June 2012, while the Holiday Inn Perth Burswood was officially rebranded Crown Promenade on 20 June 2012. On 1 August 2012 it was revealed a new 500-room \\"six star\\" hotel would be built at Burswood at a cost of $568 million. The hotel, Crown Towers, was built by Multiplex and opened in December 2016 and is Perth's largest, taking the casino's hotel capacity to 1,200 rooms. Colin Barnett, the then-premier of Western Australia also made the announcement saying his government was also backing a bid by Crown to increase its number of poker machines by 500, and the number of gaming tables by 130. Casino The casino operates 24 hours, 7 days a week. it is the monopoly casino operator in Perth, Western Australia. There are up to 2,400 coin-operated game machines with a variety of games such as Keno, Video Poker and others involving dice, dominoes and balls. Jackpots are linked to many of these games. Reel-slots, operated with a pull-down lever, are not permitted in Western Australia. The table games include Baccarat, Mini Baccarat, Blackjack, Roulette, Poker (Texas Hold'Em, Omaha), Three Card Poker, Casino War, Progressive Texas Hold'Em, Pai Gow, Money Wheel, Sic Bo and Caribbean Stud. On 1 August 2012, Crown Limited announced it was seeking a \\"massive\\" expansion of gambling facilities, increasing the number of poker machines to 2,500 and gaming tables will increase from the present number of 220 to 350, an increase of nearly 60%. The Government of Western Australia is backing Crown's application to the state's Gaming and Wagering Commission, and the proposal has the personal support of WA premier Colin Barnett, who described the increase in gambling facilities \\"as natural growth,\\" and said it was \\"common sense\\" for the expansion as it was being made in line with the development of a new six-star hotel in the casino complex.http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/a/-/news/14432567/barnett-defends- huge-rise-in-gambling-tables/ The West Australian Crown has entered into an agreement with the state government to build the hotel on land the government will provide for $60 million. The government's agreement not to object to the increase in gambling facilities is part of the deal. Crown Perth is the only venue in Australia's biggest state that is allowed to operate poker machines. In all other Australian states and territories almost every hotel is equipped with poker machines, while licensed clubs packed with poker machines are widespread. The proposal to upscale gambling facilities is controversial. Independent senator Nick Xenophon said \\"James Packer knows he has just been handed the gift that will give him hundreds of millions of dollars for years to come.\\" Ian Carter, chief executive of Anglicare WA, told ABC Radio \\"The Productivity Commission report and a whole range of other reports around this country have clearly highlighted the cost to our community of gaming machines and poker machines.\\" Burswood Park The parklands surrounding the casino is known as Burswood Park. It was originally a rubbish tip, and also the location of a cement works on the eastern side, from the mid-1940s. The construction of the casino complex also saw the parklands regenerated into a public recreational facility, in the early 2000s. The park contains wildflower displays, and a heritage trail with various statues. It also initially featured a public golf course that was closed for redevelopment in 2013,Parker, Gareth Sale spells the end for golf course, The West Australian 2 August 2010, at news.yahoo with The Camfield, a large pub and micro brewery built adjacent to Perth Stadium now occupying the site.The newest pub takes shape next to Perth Stadium, The West Australian 10 October 2017, at thewest.com.au Over the year a number of community events take place in Burswood Park, including Movies at Burswood with proceed going to Telethon Perth, and Have a Go Day, an event for over 55s.

The dome was 8,800 square metres in size, with seating for 13,600 people. The whole arena was pressurised so that the fibreglass roof was suspended 35 m above the ground. It was a venue for indoor sports, notably the Hopman Cup tennis tournament, which was moved to the Perth Arena for the 2013 and future events, and for pop music concerts. Many notable artists performed there, the record attendance being 20,000 for Cliff Richard & The Shadows. Other performers since 1987 have included AC/DC, Kiss, U2, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Pink, Lady Gaga, Kylie Minogue, Elton John, Iron Maiden, Britney Spears, Beyonc√©, The Black Eyed Peas, Guns N' Roses, Florence and the Machine, George Michael, Christina Aguilera, Delta Goodrem, Gwen Stefani, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Roger Waters and Top Gear Live.Burswood Dome (Australia) at TVtrip It was the hosting venue for the Hopman Cup from 1989 until 2012. As a sports venue, the Dome was the home of the Hopman Cup and occasionally hosted Perth Wildcats' National Basketball League games. At one time the dome was also considered as a possible home venue for the A-League's Perth Glory while renovations were taking place at their usual home, Perth Oval, though the Glory eventually decided to stay at the Oval rather than play inside the Dome on an artificial surface. The Dome was also the venue used for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) shows in Perth while on their Australian tours. The Dome at Crown being demolished, August 2013 , firm plans for Crown's major new hotel development and for a state-controlled Perth Stadium on nearby land have ensured that the dome will be removed, probably to provide an additional 2.2 hectares of car parking. Government approval for demolition was granted on 31 May 2012, and demolition works started in July 2013 with the land to be used for 1000 car parking bays. The roof was deflated on 28 June 2013.

The dramatic performance is presented on the first night of the annual encampment as an allegorical banishing of worldly cares for the club members and \\"to present symbolically the salvation of the trees by the club\\",Garnett, 1908, p. 25. but the secretive nature of the Bohemians and the political power of some of its members have been criticized. History In 1878, the Bohemian Club of San Francisco first took to the woods in Taylorville, California (present-day Samuel P. Taylor State Park) for a summer celebration that they called Midsummer High Jinks.Garnett, 1908, p. ix. Poems were recited, songs were sung, and dramatic readings were given; the practice was repeated each summer in other areas, primarily near the Russian River in Sonoma County. In 1881, the ceremony of the Cremation of Care was first conducted after the various individual performances, with James F. Bowman as Sire.Garnett, 1908, pp. 19‚Äì20. The ceremony was further expanded in 1893 by a member named Joseph D. Redding,Domhoff, 1974. with a Midsummer High Jinks entitled The Sacrifice in the Forest, or simply \\"Druid Jinks\\", in which brotherly love and Christianity battled and won against paganism, converting the druids away from bloody sacrifice.Garnett, 1908, p. 21. Redding formed the framework of the ceremony but the main actors, including George Tisdale Bromley as High Priest, were asked to supply their own major speeches. In 1904, the prologue to William Henry Irwin's Grove Play The Hamadryads included text such as \\"Touch their world-blind eyes with fairy unguents.\\" The play depicted the intrusion, the battles, and the symbolic death of the maleficent Spirit of Care.Garnett, 1908, pp. 4‚Äì5. In the earliest productions of the Grove Play, several restrictions were imposed upon the Sire (host, chief planner, and master of ceremoniesGarnett, 1908, p. 17.) including that the stage setting be the natural forest backdrop and that the \\"malign character Care\\" be introduced in the plot, to wreak havoc with the characters and then be faced down and vanquished by the hero. In these early productions, the Cremation of Care immediately followed, and lasted until midnight.Garnett, 1908, p. 27. The end of the ceremony was signaled by a lively Jinks Band rendition of There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight,Ogden, 1990, p. 25. and the club members sat down to a late dinner and revelry.Garnett, 1908, p. 30. From 1913, the Cremation of Care was disengaged from the Grove Play, and rescheduled for the first night of the summer encampment. The Grove Play was set for the final weekend.Garnett, 1908, p. 36. A different Sire was appointed for the Cremation, and some concerns were raised in subsequent years that the Cremation of Care was growing into its own secondary Grove Play. Some Sires experimented with a satirical treatment, or topical themes such as a patriotic World War I treatment in 1918 and an unpopular Prohibition script in 1919. \\"Care\\" was not killed, let alone cremated, in the 1922 version. In response to member complaints about the unpredictable quality of the opening night fare, Charles K. Field was asked in 1923 to standardize the script for what became the basis for every subsequent Cremation of Care ceremony.Garnett, 1908, pp. 37‚Äì39. Staging The Owl Shrine covered in moss, standing among trees behind a stage at one edge of a man-made pond. The ceremony involves the poling across a lake of a small boat containing an effigy of Care (called \\"Dull Care\\"). Dark, hooded figures receive from the ferryman the effigy which is placed on an altar, and, at the end of the ceremony, set on fire. This \\"cremation\\" symbolizes that members are banishing the \\"dull cares\\" of conscience.Phillips, 1994. At the time the script was developed, the primary meaning of the word 'care' (< O.E. cearu, \\"anxiety, anguish\\") was synonymous with 'worry', having more negative connotations than in modern times when it tends to be associated more positively with compassion.\\"History of the Notion of Care\\", Encyclopedia of Bioethics (1995) The ceremony takes place in front of the Owl Shrine, a hollow owl statue made of concrete over steel supports. The moss- and lichen-covered statue simulates a natural rock formation, yet holds electrical and audio equipment within it. During the ceremony, a recording is used as the voice of The Owl. For many years the recorded voice was club guest Walter Cronkite.Philip Weiss, Masters of the Universe Go to Camp: Inside the Bohemian Grove. Spy Magazine, November 1989 Music and pyrotechnics accompany the ritual for dramatic effect. Controversy On July 15, 2000, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his cameraman, Mike Hanson, infiltrated the Bohemian Grove expecting to uncover the owl statue being worshipped as Moloch, and finding simulated human sacrifices by having the effigy of humans thrown into its fiery interior.Jones, Alex. Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove. 2000. He also states that they might actually be real human sacrifices. With a hidden camera, Jones and Hanson filmed the Cremation of Care ceremony. The footage was the centerpiece of Jones' documentary Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove. Jones claimed that the Cremation of Care was an \\"ancient Canaanite, Luciferian, Babylon mystery religion ceremony\\". The Grove and Jones' investigation were covered by Jon Ronson in Channel 4's four- part documentary Secret Rulers of the World. Ronson documented his view of the ritual in his book Them: Adventures with Extremists, writing: \\"My lasting impression was of an all-pervading sense of immaturity: the Elvis impersonators, the pseudo-pagan spooky rituals, the heavy drinking. These people might have reached the apex of their professions but emotionally they seemed trapped in their college years.\\" =Protests= Outside of the main entrance to the Bohemian Grove, protesters against club members and their guests have held a ceremony called the \\"Resurrection of Care\\", intended to symbolically reverse the effects of the Cremation of Care, to prevent the attendees from temporarily abandoning their cares. The counter ceremony was first held in 1980, organized by Mary Moore, a former beauty queen turned left-wing activist. Moore was less concerned about the Cremation of Care ceremony than with the likelihood that club members with corporate interests would gain influence in government.

Plot After the New York Yankees' latest prospect suffers a humiliating bout of stage fright in his debut for the team, scout Al Percolo, who discovered the young man, is punished by being sent to the Mexican countryside to look for his next find. Al's efforts are fruitless until he encounters Steve Nebraska, a young American with a consistent 100+ MPH fastball and a perfect batting average. The childlike Steve immediately agrees to join the Yankees when Al asks him, but when Al calls the team's general manager to report his find, he is fired and told not to return. Al defies the order and brings Steve back to the States anyway. The first indication that all may not be right with Steve occurs when he panics at Newark International Airport when he and Al are momentarily separated. Later, at Al's apartment, Steve thrashes in his sleep, screaming at an unseen assailant. Al arranges an open audition at Yankee Stadium in front of representatives from every Major League Baseball team. After Steve strikes out Keith Hern√°ndez and homers off Bret Saberhagen, a bidding war breaks out. The Yankees win the bid war, signing Steve to a $55 million contract, but after Steve violently snaps at press photographers, team management demands that he be psychiatrically evaluated and cleared before he plays his first game. Al picks the first listed psychiatrist in the phone book, a Doctor H. Aaron, and hopes that the evaluation will be swift, so that he and Steve can get on with life. After examining Steve, however, Dr. Aaron finds him to be deeply troubled and so severely abused as a child that he has blocked almost every memory of his early life. Desperate for Steve to play so that both can get paid, Al begs Dr. Aaron to clear Steve for play, on the condition that she sees Steve everyday before making his MLB debut. Life with Steve proves difficult for Al; Steve throws plates at reporters outside the apartment, upstages Tony Bennett at his own show, and argues with Al over what he does with his free time. At a press conference, Al lies about Steve's past. Dr. Aaron is livid when she finds out, but Al points out that Steve's behavior stems from her helping him acknowledge and deal with his past. Al pleads with Dr. Aaron to continue the good work she is doing for Steve. When the Yankees reach the World Series, however, Steve is suddenly depressed. Worse yet, he is contractually obligated to pitch in Game 1. A sold-out Yankee Stadium waits for Steve's debut in Game 1 of the World Series. When Steve is spotted on the roof of the stadium, Al sends for a helicopter to fetch him, then climbs up to plead with him to come down. Steve adamantly refuses, and Al, risking his own career, tells Steve that he can walk away from it all, no strings attached. Touched by Al's selflessness, Steve relents. His spirits greatly lifted, he boards the copter to make his grand entrance. Steve pitches a perfect game, striking out 27 St. Louis Cardinals batters on 81 consecutive strikes, and hits two solo home runs in a 2-0 Yankees victory. As Steve acknowledges Al as the Yankees celebrate his efforts, Al smiles proudly. Cast * Albert Brooks as Al Percolo * Brendan Fraser as Steve Nebraska * Dianne Wiest as Doctor H.

Bergman wrote his script for Peter Falk to play the scout and Jim Belushi to play the player. \\"There were honestly five different versions of this movie,\\" says Bergman. \\"The original version was, he found this guy in Mexico who‚Äôs the second white man ever to receive these injections, the first being Babe Ruth. And it was this political guy on the run. It was a completely different kind of movie.\\" Falk was not available then Walter Matthau was going to make it with Michael Ritchie. The project did not proceed until years later with Ritchie directing and Albert Brooks playing the scout. \\"That wasn‚Äôt my conception at all,\\" said Bergman. \\"The original conception was much more bananas. The Scout still has glimmers of the original, but not doing the original is high up on my very large list of regrets, because Peter was born to play that guy. He‚Äôs so obtuse and that tunnel-vision thing he had was just great.‚Äù In a July 1999 interview with Gavin Smith in Film Comment, Brooks said that The Scout was originally intended for Rodney Dangerfield. \\"It was lying around, never going to get made, and I said I would like to do that.\\" Brooks said that he contributed to a rewrite of the script because \\"it was written very silly.\\" The version he worked on, he said, \\"did not end like 'Rocky' with that bullshit big ending.\\" But according to Brooks, the studio forced Ritchie to change the ending.McGilligan, Patrick.

Reception The Scout was a box-office flop. Reviews were predominantly negative, with TV Guide stating, \\"'The Scout' feels like a classic case of too many cooks spoiling the broth.\\"The Scout TV Guide Variety also negatively reviewed the film, saying that Brooks and Ritchie \\"never quite commit to either of the movie's disparate chords -- bailing out of the batter's box in terms of the psychological drama and, after some amusing moments at the outset, generally steering clear of broad comedy.\\"The Scout Variety Time magazine's Richard Schickel praised the film, writing, \\"The Scout is the best comedy-fantasy about baseball ever made, which goes to show that if Hollywood keeps trying, eventually someone will get it right.\\"CINEMA: Fast Pitch TIME The film holds a 22% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 23 reviews.

It is a part of the family Eosimiidae, and includes three known species: Eosimias sinensis, Eosimias centennicus, and Eosimias dawsonae. It provides us with a glimpse of a primate skeleton similar to that of the common ancestor of the Haplorhini (including all simians). The name Eosimias is designed to mean \\"dawn monkey\\", from Greek eos \\"dawn\\" and Latin simius \\"monkey\\". Dating has proven this genus lived from 45 to 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene. The genus Eosimias is unique because of the presence of primitive and derived traits. It provides new insight into the phylogenetic relationships between simians and prosimians (especially the phylogenetic position of the haplorhine prosimian tarsiers). It can best be described as a likely tree dweller that relied on a steady diet of insects and nectar. Most eosimiid species are documented by unique or fragmentary specimens. This, as well as the strong belief that simians originated in Africa has made it difficult for many to accept the idea that Asia played a role in early primate evolution. Although some continue to challenge the anthropoid resemblances found in Eosiimidae, extensive anatomical evidence collected over the past decade substantiates its anthropoid status.  Eosimias sinensis  Eosimias sinensis (, ) was first discovered in China in 1992 by Christopher Beard. It was found in a mountain near Liyang City, Jiangsu province, China. The species is believed to have lived 45 million years before present, in the Eocene epoch. E. sinensis was tiny, as small as the smallest monkey presently, the pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea) of South America, and could fit in the palm of a human's hand. Its teeth are considered more primitive than those of early higher primates known from Africa, including Algeripithecus. Due to its highly primitive nature, some paleontologists consider E. sinensis to be evidence that higher primates may have originated in Asia rather than Africa. Christopher Beard was the lead member of the team that discovered Eosimias sinensis in 1994. Beard recovered a right mandible, cataloged as IVPP V10591, which preserved P4‚ÄìM2 and roots or alveoli for C1, P2‚Äì3, and M3. Although it retains primitive characters such as a small body size (mean estimates range from ) and an unfused mandibular symphysis, it appears to be a primitive simian based on its dental characteristics, including a lower dental formula of 2.1.3.3. Eosimias sinesis has incisors which are vertical and spatulate. These creatures are known primarily from lower jaws and teeth, no cranial remains have been able to indicate whether Eosimias was diurnal or nocturnal.John G. Fleagle, Primate Adaptation & Evolution, ch. 10  Eosimias centennicus  Holotype of E. centennicus, Paleozoological Museum of China Eosimias centennicus was found in 1995 while doing fieldwork in the Yuanqu Basin of the southern Shanxi Province in China. Among these recovered fossils is the first complete lower dentition of Eosimias, catalogued as IVPP V11000. All anatomical information yielded from these fossils confirms the anthropoid-like traits found in E. sinensis. Biostratigraphic evidence also suggests these fossils are younger than E. sinensis, which is consistent with the anatomy of eosiimids because the dentition of E. centennicus is slightly more derived than that of E. sinensis. This species was also found to be a very tiny primate, with mean estimates of body mass ranging from . E. sinesis was originally described on the basis of fragmentary fossils, but with the discovery of E. centennicus and a complete lower dentition, Eosimias can more definitively be described as an early anthropoid.  Eosimias dawsonae  Eosimias dawsonae is the newest of the Eosimias species. It is categorized by the type specimen IVPP V11999, which includes a left dentary fragment and roots of the alveoli. It was collected by Christopher Beard in 1995. Analysis of these remains has led to the conclusion it was the largest of the known species of Eosimias, yielding a body mass ranging from . Stratigraphic evidence also shows E. dawsonae is older than E. centennicus.  Unidentified fossils  Additionally, an expedition team discovered evidence of a new, small eosimiid from Myanmar in 1999. The new specimen, represented by a right heel bone cataloged as NMMP 23, was found in wash residue in the Pondaung Formation. This specimen is very morphologically similar to the Eosimias discovered in the Shanghuang region of China. The best estimate for NMMP 23 includes an overall mean weight of about 111 grams, which places it in the upper-sized end of Eosimias fossils discovered. The presence of eosimiid in Myanmar, as well as a high species diversity found in China leads to an apparent conclusion that they had a relatively wide distribution. = Eosimias paukkaungensis = A new species of eosimiid primate, Eosimias paukkaungensis, from the latest middle Eocene of Pondaung, central Myanmar, was discovered in the early 2000s. The specimen consists of left and right mandibular fragments preserving only the M3, so that its generic status is provisional. The E. paukkaungensis fossil is much larger than homologues of the two Eosimias species from China.

He was a candidate for the United States Senate in West Virginia in 2018. He was Chairman and CEO of the Massey Energy Company‚Äîthe sixth-largest coal company (by 2008 production) in the United States‚Äîfrom 2000 until his retirement in 2010.T Allen, \\"Investors Tout Their Role in Massey's Leadership Change \\" (December 7, 2010) Riskmetrics On December 3, 2015, Blankenship was found guilty of one misdemeanor charge of conspiring to willfully violate mine safety and health standards in relation to the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion, and was sentenced to one year in prison. He has frequently spoken out about politics, the environment, unions, and coal production. In 2018, Blankenship lost a three-way Republican primary for the U.S. Senate to Patrick Morrisey. Citing false information, dirty politics and a personal unwillingness to quit, Blankenship attempted to run as the Constitution Party nominee but was unable to get on the ballot and later endorsed Morrisey.thehill.com May 21, 2018: Blankenship third-party bid worries Senate GOP Blankenship launched his campaign in the 2020 United States presidential election as a member of the Constitution Party on October 18/19, 2019 during a meeting of the Constitution Party national committee. According to the Constitution Party website, Don Blankenship secured the nomination for President, along with running mate Bill Mohr. Early life and education Blankenship was born in Stopover, Kentucky and raised in Delorme, West Virginia. His father served in the Korean War and his mother, Nancy McCoy, was a member of the McCoy family. The two divorced soon after Blankenship was born, and the money from her divorce settlement Blankenship's mother ran a convenience store and gas station for 4 decades. After graduating from Matewan High School in Matewan, West Virginia in 1968, Blankenship earned a bachelor's degree in accounting from Marshall University in 1972 in three school years, having worked as a coal miner during summertime.Leamer 2013, p. 51. Blankenship is certified as a public accountant. In 2002, he was inducted into the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Business and Industry Hall of Fame Blankenship has also been included in the Tug Valley Mining Institute Hall of Fame. Business career Blankenship joined Massey Energy subsidiary Rawl Sales & Processing Co., in 1982. He went on to serve Massey Energy in a number of capacities. He was promoted to president of Massey Coal Services, Inc. (1989‚Äì1991), then president and chief operating officer from 1990 to 1991. In 1992, Blankenship was named president, chairman of the board of A.T. Massey. He is the first non-Massey family member to be in charge of the company. When A.T. Massey was spun off from Fluor Corporation as Massey Energy in 2000, Blankenship became the newly independent company's chairman and CEO. On December 3, 2010, Blankenship announced that he was retiring as CEO at the end of the year and would be succeeded by Massey President Baxter F. Phillips Jr. Blankenship had a reputation for resistance to spending money, willingness to litigate for contract difficulties, and personally going into mines to persuade workers to abandon union organizing efforts. In a 1980s documentary, he said, \\"It's like a jungle, where a jungle is survival of the fittest. Unions, communities, people‚Äîeverybody's gonna have to learn to accept that in the United States you have a capitalist society, and that capitalism, from a business standpoint, is survival of the most productive.\\"Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco (2012). Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt. p. 168. Nation Books. In 1996, Blankenship was elected to the board of directors of engineering and construction company Fluor Corporation. He also serves as a director of the Center for Energy and Economic Development, a director of the National Mining Association, Mission West Virginia Inc, and was on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce board of directors. Blankenship was paid $17.8 million in 2009, the highest in the coal industry. It was a $6.8 million raise over 2008, and almost double his compensation package in 2007. Blankenship also received a deferred compensation package valued at $27.2 million in 2009. In 2011, Blankenship incorporated McCoy Coal Group, a coal company in Kentucky (not to be confused with the James River Coal Company subsidiary McCoy-Elkhorn Coal Corp). McCoy has yet to seek mining permits. Political campaigns Blankenship is an active participant in West Virginia politics. During a speech at the Tug Valley Mining Institute on November 20, 2008, Blankenship called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator Harry Reid and former Vice President Al Gore \\"crazies\\" and \\"greeniacs.\\" He has spoken out against media coverage and what he calls false attacks by liberal media. He has also said \\"the truth needs to be told about what happened at the Upper Big Branch coal mine\\" on the basis that a single individual from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration was chosen to investigate the disaster. =2018 U.S. Senate campaign= Citing his displeasure with federal handling of the coal industry, and his longtime criticisms of the condition of West Virginia politics in general, Blankenship ran for U.S. Senate in the 2018 Senate election, challenging incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Joe Manchin. His television ads were aimed at \\"getting the truth out\\" about the Upper Big Branch explosion and \\"exposing the government cover-up.\\" The ads further claimed Blankenship had documents showing that the MSHA Upper Big Branch internal report was falsified and that the company was forced by the MSHA to use a defective ventilation system. He also expressed a belief that Donald Trump's proposed Mexico-United States border wall in conjunction ending sanctuary cities would help stop drug trafficking. Blankenship said he was \\"Trumpier than Trump\\" but that the establishment was misinforming him because they did not want him \\"to be in the U.S. Senate and promote the president's agenda.\\" The national Republican leadership and allied groups made statements and ran ads against Blankenship, and the day before the Republican primary, Trump posted a tweet urging voters to vote for either of Blankenship's major primary opponents, Evan Jenkins and Patrick Morrisey, because Blankenship would not be competitive in the general election. Trump's tweet came in the wake of reporting that internal Republican polling had shown a surge in Blankenship's support among likely primary voters. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom Blankenship harshly criticized in his campaign, reportedly urged Trump to express opposition to Blankenship. During the Republican primary campaign, Blankenship received criticism for calling McConnell's wife a \\"China person.\\" After Patrick Morrisey won the primary, Blankenship reentered the race as the nominee of the West Virginia Constitution Party. Throughout his campaign he made a claim that the Upper Big Branch explosion was caused by the negligence of Mine Safety and Health Administration officials. =2020 U.S. presidential campaign= Blankenship presidential campaign logo Blankenship launched his campaign for the Constitution Party nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election in October 2019 during a meeting of the Constitution Party national committee. He was nominated for President at the virtual Constitution Party Convention on the second ballot on May 2, 2020, with William Mohr as his running mate. Political positions Blankenship supports Friends of Coal, a West Virginia advocacy group founded as a countermeasure to environmental protection movements. He later released statements urging President Trump to avoid legislation enacting harsher punishment for coal mine supervisors that violate health and safety protocols, saying that \\"coal supervisors are not criminals\\", and that harsher laws would not improve mine safety. In 2016, Blankenship supported conservative advocacy groups to remove Democrats from Legislature. That same year, Blankenship was criticized by Hillary Clinton's campaign after his appearance at her campaign stop in Williamson, West Virginia. =Climate change= Blankenship rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In a speech at the Tug Valley Mining Institute, he said, \\"I don't believe climate change is real.\\" Blankenship reiterated his views on global warming in interviews with The Hill and Forbes. In an October 30, 2009, letter to the editor of The Charleston Gazette, Blankenship denied that climate change, or global warming, exists, and said, \\"Why should we trust a report by the United Nations? The United Nations includes countries like Venezuela, North Korea and Iran.\\" According to Blankenship, \\"the environmental movement isn't a great cause, it's a great business\\", and in addition to lying about the Upper Big Branch mine disaster, the government has also lied \\"about the science of global warming.\\" In 2018, at a Senate campaign town hall, Blankenship said that \\"climate change is probably a fact\\", but added that American-made climate change is not, arguing that China's increase in coal production is the reason. =Mine safety= At a 2009 Labor Day rally in West Virginia, Blankenship said that federal and state mining regulators are ineffective at improving mine safety, and that the mining companies themselves are better suited to the task and should have less oversight, saying, \\"Washington and state politicians have no idea how to improve miners' safety.\\" Before and during his 2018 Senate campaign, Blankenship blamed the federal regulators of the MSHA for the Upper Big Branch Disaster for directing airflow targets in the mine. ControversiesDeborah May= A former employee of Blankenship, Deborah May, similarly filed a lawsuit claiming that stress from personal abuse forced her to quit her job in November 2005. The lawsuit claimed that such comparatively minor mistakes as a wrong breakfast order from McDonald's, misplaced ice cream in the freezer, and an improperly hung jacket in the closet caused difficulties with Blankenship. In June 2008, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled that May was entitled to unemployment benefits because due to \\"the unrefuted evidence\\" that Blankenship had \\"physically grabbed\\" May, had thrown food after she brought back the wrong fast-food order, and tore a tie rack and coat hanger out of a closet after she forgot to leave the hanger out for his coat. Blankenship‚Äôs conduct, referred to as \\"shocking\\" by the court, contributed to their decision that May should get unemployment benefits as she was in effect fired because she was put in a position where she felt compelled to quit. =Upper Big Branch explosion= On April 5, 2010 an explosion at Massey's Upper Big Branch mine killed 29 miners. It was the worst U.S. coal mining disaster since 1970, when an explosion killed 38 in Hyden, Kentucky. NPR reported Massey executive Stanley Suboleski as saying that MSHA ordered airflow changes, made hours before the explosion, \\"were changes the company opposed but complied with anyway.\\" On April 12, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund which held 303,550 shares of Massey stock, called for Blankenship to resign immediately. \\"This tragedy was a failure both of risk management and effective board oversight. Blankenship must step down and make room for more responsible leadership at Massey.\\" On April 22, Massey Energy's lead independent director Bobby R. Inman announced that \\"Blankenship has the full support and confidence of the Massey Energy Board of Directors.\\" On April 25, President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and state officials paid tribute to the 29 coal miners at a memorial service in Beckley, West Virginia. \\"Prosecutors said Massey manipulated the ventilation system during inspections of the Upper Big Branch mine to fool safety officials and disabled a methane monitor on a cutting machine a few months before the explosion on April 5, 2010.... In March 2013 Blankenship was directly implicated in conspiring to skirt safety regulations when a former Massey Energy official accused Blankenship of conspiring and plotting to hide safety violations from federal safety inspectors. The implication was that Blankenship would order his officials to warn mine operators when the federal inspectors were coming for \\"surprise\\" visits, and to quickly cover up any safety violations. Blankenship was convicted of a single misdemeanor charge of conspiring to violate federal mine safety standards and went on to serve a one-year prison sentence. He called himself a \\"political prisoner\\", feuded with United States Senator Joe Manchin and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) over the explosion, considered running against Manchin for the Senate, and called for a new investigation into the explosion. On May 25, 2017, he formally appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court. His petition argued that the U.S. District Court in Charleston and the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, \\"both erred in rulings, and they claim Blankenship was a victim of politics.\\" In August 2017, Blankenship funded a television ad featuring the sister of one of the miners killed in the Upper Big Branch coal mine explosion. The sister, Gwen Thomas, asks in the ad \\"if the United States Mine Safety and Health Administration insisted that changes be made which reduced Upper Big Branch's airflow before the explosion.\\" She asks the government to publicly release the gas analyses taken after the explosion, and she asks for help from President Donald Trump and U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) in getting answers. The US Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) found that the initial explosion could have been prevented by MSHA forcing Massey to avoid a build up of gas, and that subsequent injury could have been prevented by forcing Massey to avoid build up of coal dust. The NIOSH's page on Mining, says that to avoid Methane buildup \\"Large fans circulate air in mines to provide ventilation to the working areas.\\" In August 2018, Blankenship for Senate released a statement outlining a finding of the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (DOJ-OPR) which had investigated Booth Goodwin and Steve Ruby, the prosecuting attorney's in Blankenship's federal trial. The DOJ-OPR found that both prosecutors were responsible for \\"recklessly\\" disregarding their discovery obligations. According to the release, at least 61 memoranda of witness interviews were not provided to Blankenship's defense team, and Blankenship's attorney believes these showed Blankenship had done nothing illegal. =Groundwater= Blankenship has been accused of withholding knowledge of pollution. According to accusations made in Rolling Stone, groundwater pollution from coal slurry injection by Massey Energy was contaminating wells around Blankenship's home. Blankenship had a water line built to his home from a nearby town. According to the accusation, Blankenship did not offer to provide uncontaminated water to any of his neighbors, and failed to inform them of any problem.Goodell, Jeff (November 11, 2010). Don Blankenship: The Dark Lord of Coal Country. Rolling Stone. Retrieved December 10, 2010 =Campaign against Warren McGraw= In 2004, Blankenship contributed $3 million to the \\"And For The Sake of the Kids\\" PAC, campaigning against the reelection of West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Warren McGraw. Brent Benjamin went on to defeat McGraw in the general election. Speaking about the election, Blankenship said, \\"I helped defeat a judge who had released a pedophile to work in a local school, who had driven doctors out of state, and who had cost workers their jobs for thirty plus years. I think this effort helped unchain West Virginia's economy and benefited working families.\\" USA Today called Blankenship's ads \\"venomous.\\" According to a USA Today editorial dated March 3, 2009, Blankenship \\"vividly illustrated how big money corrupts judicial elections. It puts justice up for sale to the highest bidder.\\" Notably, Blankenship's coal company Massey Coal had recently lost a civil case in West Virginia state court prior to the judicial campaign and had been ordered to pay a $50 million judgment. Blakenship's case was pending on appeal as he sponsored Brent Benjamin's campaign for a seat on the West Virginia Supreme Court. When the case was taken up on appeal, Benjamin was one of the judges in a position to decide the case. The plaintiff requested that Benjamin recuse himself owing to a conflict of interest stemming from Blakenship's contributions to his campaign, but he refused. Benjamin ultimately cast a decisive vote to vacate the lower court's judgment in a 3‚Äì2 decision. In Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., the Supreme Court ruled that Benjamin's refusal to recuse himself in light of such an obvious conflict of interest constituted a violation of the plaintiff's constitutional right to due process and remanded the case to the West Virginia Supreme Court. Washington political journalist Michael Tomasky, also a native West Virginian, claimed that Blankenship was \\"famous in West Virginia as the man who successfully bought himself a State Supreme Court Justice in 2004 and then tried to buy himself the state legislature, failing spectacularly at the latter effort.\\"Tomasky, Michael, \\"Night Comes to the Appalachians\\" New York Review of Books, Volume 55, Number 14; September 25, 2008. In his 2008 book Coal River, Michael Shnayerson reports that no such foundation was ever set up.Shnayerson, Michael (2008), Coal River, New York, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux Although Blankenship was the primary donor to \\"And For the Sake of Kids,\\" other groups, including Doctors for Justice, contributed over $1 million to ASK. Another group, Citizens for Quality Health Care, funded in part by the West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, spent over $350,000 to defeat McGraw.Nyden, Paul (January 7, 2005, Charleston Gazette), \\"Coal, Doctor's Groups Donated to Anti-McGraw Effort.\\" Meanwhile, several groups spent millions opposing Benjamin and supporting McGraw, including West Virginia Consumers for Justice and Hugh Caperton, CEO of Harmon Development Corporation.O'Brien, John (West Virginia Record January 24, 2008) \\"Caperton was Anti-Benjamin from the Start.\\" Blankenship is featured in Laurence Leamer's 2013 book The Price of Justice: A True Story of Greed and Corruption and in Peter Galuszka's 2012 book Thunder on the Mountain: Death at Massey and the Dirty Secrets Behind Big Coal. =Conflict of interest with Spike Maynard= On January 15, 2008, photographs of Blankenship vacationing on the French Riviera with West Virginia Supreme Court Justice Spike Maynard, while Massey had a case pending before that court, appeared in The New York Times. On April 3, 2008, ABC News reported that Blankenship attacked an ABC News photographer at a Massey facility near Belfry, Kentucky as the photographer attempted to question Blankenship about the photos. \\"If you're going to start taking pictures of me, you're liable to get shot!\\" Blankenship stated in the video. Maynard later lost his bid for reelection to the West Virginia Supreme Court in the primary election. On February 14, 2009, Blankenship told The New York Times, \\"I've been around West Virginia long enough to know that politicians don't stay bought, particularly ones that are going to be in office for 12 years... So I would never go out and spend money to try to gain favor with a politician. Eliminating a bad politician makes sense. Electing somebody hoping he's going to be in your favor doesn't make any sense at all.\\" =Comments on Mitch McConnell= In April 2018, Blankenship released an ad in which he calls Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \\"cocaine Mitch\\", urging potential voters to \\"ditch\\" McConnell. In May 2018, he released another ad attacking McConnell, his wife, Elaine Chao, and his in-laws as his \\"China family\\", and again called McConnell \\"cocaine Mitch\\". The premise of the moniker was that McConnell's father-in-law owns a shipping company that in 2014 was found to have of cocaine on one of its vessels set to leave Colombia. The Colombian authorities did not accuse the company of conspiring to transport the cocaine, and the company was never investigated for the matter. McConnell, who has no role in the operation of his father-in-law's shipping business, was never suspected by any authorities of having any involvement in the incident. The Washington Post's Fact Checker column investigated the \\"cocaine Mitch\\" claims and gave them a \\"Four Pinocchios\\" rating, concluding that \\"Blankenship has no evidence to support his crude and incendiary attack.\\" After Blankenship lost his primary race, an official campaign account for McConnell posted a photoshopped picture of McConnell surrounded by a cloud of cocaine dust with the accompanying text, \\"Thanks for playing, Don.\\" The picture was based on promotional materials for the Netflix TV show Narcos. When asked if Blankenship's rhetoric in the \\"China Family\\" political ad was racist, McConnell suggested that his answer would depend on the results of the Republican primary election. When pressed on the ad's alleged racism, Blankenship said that his ad was not racist because the Chinese are not a race. He said, \\"Races are Negro, White Caucasian, Hispanic, and Asian.\\" Personal life Blankenship has two children. He was profiled in a 2005 West Virginia Public Broadcasting documentary, The Kingmaker.

The name refers to Mount Tabor, Israel. It was named by Plympton Kelly, son of Oregon City pioneer resident Clinton Kelly. Neighborhood Mount Tabor Reservoir The Mount Tabor neighborhood lies between SE 49th Ave. (SE 50th Ave. south of SE Hawthorne Blvd.) on the west and SE 76th Ave. on the east, and between E Burnside St. on the north and SE Division St. on the south. It is bordered by Sunnyside and Richmond on the west, North Tabor on the north and west, Montavilla on the north and east, and South Tabor on the south. Mount Tabor Parkhttp://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?&propertyid;=275&action;=ViewPark is the neighborhood's principal feature. The campus of Warner Pacific University (affiliated with the Church of God (Anderson) is located just south of the park. The neighborhood also marks the eastern end of the Hawthorne District. The campus of Western Seminary is located on the western slope, overlooking downtown Portland. Before becoming part of Portland in 1905, Mount Tabor was a rural farming community dating back to the 1850s. It became a city-recognized neighborhood (encompassing a far smaller area than its historical boundaries) in 1974. Reservoir controversy The Mount Tabor reservoirs, along with those in Portland's Washington Park, have been the subject of a decade-long controversy surrounding lucrative engineering contracts to replace the historic open reservoirs with underground storage tanks. Concern has been raised about the possible relationship between City officials and the engineering firms receiving the no-bid reservoir decommissioning contracts; and about the role these parties may have played in lobbying for pro-underground-tank modifications (the \\"LT2\\" rule) to the Safe Drinking Water Act. On June 15, 2011, a man was observed urinating in a nearly 8,000,000 gallon reservoir, prompting city officials to drain the water at a cost of around $36,000. Under LT2 several hundred of the country's historic open reservoirs were decommissioned. Following pressure from other open- reservoir cities, in 2011 the EPA softened its stance on the LT2 rule and allowed the country's remaining open reservoirs to halt burial plans; but despite public outcry Mount Tabor's open reservoirs remain slated for decommissioning. In August 2015 the Portland City Council voted for decommissioning, considered to be the final vote on the issue.

(c. 1792 - July 14, 1850) was an Irish-born Friar Minor who served as the Roman Catholic Church bishop of the Diocese of St. John's, Newfoundland. He was principally responsible for changing a small mission with several priests in four parishes into a large diocese with over 40,000 congregants and was the single most influential Irish immigrant to come to the Colony of Newfoundland in the 19th century. He was the principal creator of the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in St. John's. BiographyEarly life= Fleming was born about three miles from Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary, Ireland. As a boy, Fleming studied the classics for two years at Stradbally, County Waterford, under a Protestant pastor. Encouraged by his uncle, Martin Fleming, O.S.F., he entered the novitiate of the friars in Wexford, and then entered the Franciscan seminary there. Fleming was ordained a Catholic priest on 15 October 1815, after which he was assigned to the friary at Carrickbeg, where his uncle was guardian. His experience in helping to rebuild the Franciscan chapel there marked him at an early age as a \\"builder\\", and stood him in good stead for his later work in the Newfoundland. =Mission to Newfoundland= In 1823, at the invitation of Thomas Scallan, O.S.F., the Vicar Apostolic for Newfoundland, and the Benevolent Irish Society, Fleming was recruited to come and serve as a priest in the colony. From the outset, Fleming proved to be of a very different temperament from Scallan. His ideas about the place of the Irish and Catholicism in Newfoundland were informed by his experience of his close friend Daniel O'Connell's nationalist politics in Ireland. Despite their very different perspectives on many matters, Fleming was promoted by Scallan as his successor, and he was appointed coadjutor bishop of the vicariate by Pope Gregory XVI on 10 July 1829, with the titular see of Carpasia. =Bishop= Soon after Fleming was consecrated as a bishop by Scallan in the Chapel in St. John's on 28 October 1829, he implemented his Ultramontanist ideology, taking over control of the existing Catholic institution the Orphan Asylum from its lay administrators, the members of the Benevolent Irish Society. Upon Scallan's death on 29 May 1830, he automatically succeeded him as Vicar Apostolic. He then embarked on a systematic expansion of institutional Catholicism in Newfoundland. This included the construction of new parish churches, the subdivision of existing parishes into new parishes, the recruitment of Irish priests, and the introduction of two religious orders of Irish women to teach young female children. He took pains to visit outport Newfoundland, and during the winter of 1835 lived in a fishing room at Petty Harbour, administering smallpox vaccine to the whole community of Catholics and Anglicans, and remaining in quarantine with them when no physician or other clergyman would go there. Fleming‚Äôs influence was not limited to the religious sphere. As Vicar Apostolic, and later as Bishop, he promoted the interest of the Irish Catholics in Newfoundland‚Äôs political sphere. Through petitioning the governor and the Colonial Office, Fleming was instrumental in enforcing the Emancipation Act for Irish Catholics in Newfoundland in 1832. In addition, with the parallel granting of Representative Government for the colony, Fleming was outspoken in the political process, lending support to candidates, both Catholic and Protestant, who furthered the rights and privileges he felt were important for the Irish Catholic population in the colony. Whether in church administration, education or political activities, Fleming‚Äôs bold actions and attitude marked a significant departure for the Catholic clergy in the Newfoundland colony. Because of his deliberate political influence, Fleming, himself an \\"Irish nationalistic\\", was viewed by many English and Protestants as a disruptive force in Newfoundland politics, and by many of his supporting Irish congregants as a constructive force in Newfoundland politics. He saw himself as the leader of the Irish community and was not shy about taking on the local British establishment, much as his friend and countryman Daniel O'Connell was doing at home, especially since he felt threatened by the Church of England's attempts to counteract growing Catholic influence. The struggle spilled over into inflammatory newspaper editorials, and lawsuits between increasingly bitter rivals. Tensions were made worse by the actions of partisans on both sides of the divide. Fleming intervened to get particular men elected, raising in the Tory minds the specter of a \\"priests' party\\" dominating the Assembly. From this point, church influence remained a dominant factor in Newfoundland politics from the 1830s onward. =Newfoundland tricolour= 20px Newfoundland Tricolour (flag ratio: 1:2) In popular legend, Fleming is credited with creating the \\"Pink, white and green\\" tricolour flag of Newfoundland. It is told that during annual wood hauls for the Anglican cathedral and Roman Catholic cathedral, considerable rivalry developed between the two groups involved. The Protestant English marked their wood piles with the pink flag of the Natives' Society, while the Catholic Irish used green banners. The threat of violence was such that Bishop Fleming intervened, and persuaded them to adopt a common flag, on which the pink and green would be separated by a white stripe to symbolize peace. The pink symbolized the Tudor Rose of England (The Protestants) and the Green symbolized St. Patrick's Emblem of Ireland (The Catholics). The White is taken from St. Andrew's Cross (St. Andrew is the Patron Saint of Fishermen and Scotland). This legend, its symbolism and origins, have all been disproven by historical evidence. In reality, the Newfoundland \\"pink, white and green\\" tricolour did not appear until at least 41 years after the inception of the Irish tricolour and was almost certainly based on the Irish flag.Newfoundland Tricolour. There is not a shred of primary source documentary historical evidence contemporary to Fleming's time linking Fleming with the creation of the tricolour; any associations are purely fanciful, and largely originated with the writings of the amateur Newfoundland historian Paul O'Neill. =Expansion= Fleming's greatest domestic projects, the ones for which he became best remembered, were the recruiting of two orders of Irish religious women to work as teachers, and the construction of a new cathedral for St. John's. In 1833 at Fleming's request, the Presentation Sisters came to Newfoundland from Galway and opened a school for children. Within weeks the sisters were inundated with new pupils, the children of the Irish of St. John's, who saw education as the best means of economic and social advancement. In 1842, Fleming invited the Sisters of Mercy to come to teach girls and to help create a Catholic middle class. Through Fleming's influence, the Education Act of 1836 introduced the precedent of granting state funds to denominations for educational purposes. In 1847, Bishop Fleming recruited four brothers of the order of Irish Franciscasns to come to Newfoundland to teach at the Benevolent Irish Society's school. Through the 1830s, Fleming pursued a grant of land on which to build a cathedral. By 1838 the land was awarded, and construction began, continuing until 1855. The cathedral was the largest building project in 19th century Newfoundland, and thereafter became the definitive icon of Newfoundland Catholicism. Fleming died in 1850 and was buried in his cathedral. Honors Plaque for Bishop Fleming On 9 September 2005, the 150th anniversary of the consecration of Fleming's cathedral, a plaque was unveiled by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada designating Fleming as a person of Canadian National Historic Significance. At the time of its consecration, the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. John's was the largest Irish Neoclassical cathedral in the New World.

After their previous release, Paranoid Time, sold out its 300-copy pressing, Greg Ginn invited the band to record another album. Less than half the length of most LPs, the total playing time for all 18 songs is a mere 15 minutes. The album was an early milestone release for the band and SST. The Punch Line hit record store shelves three months after the release of Joy although Joy was recorded after The Punch Line. The Punch Line also appears on the My First Bells cassette and the Post-Mersh Vol. 1 CD. The opening track, \\"Search\\", represented Minutemen on the second Rodney on the ROQ compilation album on Posh Boy Records, while four other songs, including the title track, were featured on the compilation cassette The Future Looks Bright Ahead, jointly issued by Posh Boy and SST in 1981. \\"Boiling\\" and \\"Games\\" were featured on the seminal SST compilation The Blasting Concept. Recording Minutemen, seeking to be as economical as possible in recording their first album, recorded The Punch Line during one late-night session (when studio time was the cheapest), recorded on previously used tape, and recorded the songs exactly in the order in which they appeared on the record. Overdubs were minimal if anything; Hurley's vocal on \\"Ruins\\" was actually cut during the basic track stages and picked up by the overhead drum mics. Spot revealed during his interview for the Minutemen documentary We Jam Econo (preserved in the DVD's deleted scenes section) that the first pressing of the record was done with what he considered to be an inferior mastering job and set of stampers; he took possession of the stampers in order to prevent further pressings from being done, forcing a remaster that was used on all vinyl pressings since then. The remastered vocals sound significantly different from the original pressing in which the voices are deeper and slightly muffled. Content The Punch Line is also notable for being the only album to feature lead vocals from all three Minutemen. Bassist and primary songwriter Mike Watt sings lead vocals on several tracks, including the opening track \\"Search\\", \\"Ruins\\", and the last 3 of the album, \\"Gravity\\", \\"Warfare\\" and \\"Static\\", while drummer George Hurley does a lead vocal (referred to on the album's back cover as \\"giv(ing) a speech\\") in the middle of \\"Ruins\\". The title track makes fun of General George A. Custer's death at the hands of Sitting Bull during the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Another track on the album, the instrumental \\"Song For El Salvador\\", reflects D. Boon's support of the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front in El Salvador. (He was a member of the NGO Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, or CISPES). Even though the group's name was a reference to their personal and political ideology and not a reflection of the average length of their songs, only two songs on The Punch Line pass the one-minute mark.

It is the professional wrestling equivalent of a three-volley salute. It is typically given at the beginning of a card, with the current members of the promotion either in the entryway, in the ring, or around the ring. Both the wrestlers and audience observe a moment of silence while the bell is rung. In Japanese wrestling, ten-bell salutes (‚Äúten-count gongs‚Äù) are held not only for deceased wrestlers but also for retiring wrestlers to mark the end of their careers. Retirement ten-count gongs are often preceded with a retirement ceremony for the retiree where he or she is present with gifts, flowers and career memorabilia from the active roster, high-ranking officials of the promotion and special guests.

The most recent instance was in June 2007 for Mr. McMahon (WWE chairman Vince McMahon's on- screen persona), as part of an angle in which he was inside a limousine that exploded, and was presumed dead. In 1988, Harley Race was \\"honored\\" with ten bells as part of a promo by Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan, wherein Heenan accused Hulk Hogan of causing serious injuries to Race. This angle grew out of a match during which Race was legitimately injured during a match against Hogan, due to a mistimed move, and was forced to take a hiatus. On a Raw Is War broadcast shortly after the Royal Rumble in January 1998, Paul Bearer and Kane rang the bell ten times in ring to mock The Undertaker, with whom they were feuding at the time. Their actions grew from an incident at the Royal Rumble where, in the storyline, Kane and Bearer had locked The Undertaker in a casket and set it ablaze, presumably killing Undertaker. However, that failed when Undertaker returned and accepted Kane's challenge for a fight, setting the stage for WrestleMania XIV.

It was founded by Bonnie Ora Sherk and Jack Wickert in 1974. The open space incorporated a major freeway interchange and is now site of Potrero del Sol Park, which was originally inspired by The Farm. Adults and children would gather at the Farm across a park from Buena Vista Elementary School. Children from Buena Vista would visit the Farm for field trips or go to the Farm after school. The Farm had a two-story building; the lower story contained an actual farm, with vegetable gardens, chickens, geese, rabbits, and goats. Upstairs was a library and an art gallery. Also on the bottom level was a pre-school. The Farm would put on DIY shows to raise funds. Sherk departed in 1980 after the city parks department decided to reclaim one of the Farm's lots and turn it into a traditional urban park. Later directors turned the Farm into a punk rock showcase by night, by partnering with mobile garage productions run by Craig Shell and Bill Gould (of faith no more), infamous for staging seminal 1980s punk rock bands such as Frightwig, Discharge, Camper Van Beethoven, the Descendents, the Mentors, 7 Seconds, MDC (Millions of Dead Cops), RKL (Rich Kids on LSD), Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, Raw Power, the Accused, Redd Kross, Soundgarden, the Gits, the Lookouts (early band of Green Day drummer), Bad Brains, and many more. Buildings in the same complex also housed Survival Research Laboratories, Goforaloop Gallery, Subterranean Records, and CoreOS.

Lewis. It tells the story of a raccoon, a turtle, a squirrel, and their friends, who come to terms with their woodlands being taken over, by suburbia, trying to survive the increasing flow of humanity and technology while becoming enticed by it at the same time. The strip debuted June 12, 1995. Main Characters * RJ ‚Äî RJ is a raccoon con artist. He takes pride in being extremely apathetic. He apparently envisions himself as an intellectual; however, his ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are obviously false. He is sometimes shown without a brain, using his brain cavity to store his ‚Äúhanky‚Äù and breath mints. He loves to burgle human homes for food, as well as watch them, and their televisions, through the windows. He enjoys commenting on human life, and has studied humans, and knows their ways of getting food, and even has slightly imprinted on them. He was shown to care for Clara, even before she was born (after he learned that babies can hear some things outside of the mother from Verne) by reading The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and singing a horrible version of ‚ÄúStairway to Heaven‚Äù. RJ is shown to have the ability to expand to fit a massive amount of food, and is known as ‚Äúthat horrible raccoon kid‚Äù on Halloween. His favourite food is Twinkies. * Verne ‚Äî Verne is a cautious, easy going, lactose abhorrent turtle, who is reflective, and prone to allergies. Verne is a true renaissance turtle, an intelligent and quick witted observer with a deep spiritual side and a tingling feeling in his tail when something is not right. He is one of the most caring characters (second to ‚ÄúThe Tree That Knows Stuff‚Äù), but he sometimes lacks basic common sense. His proudest achievement is gathering all of the air conditioners out of Suburbia, and shouting, ‚ÄúLET THE GLOBAL COOLING COMMENCE!!!‚Äù, just as RJ was about to plug them all in. He is a computer nerd, and he once ‚Äúbroke‚Äù the Internet. Most recently, his shell was used as a hotspot for Queen Izzy, the Ant Queen, and her ant subjects, forcing him to first wear one cereal box of Lucky Charms, and then one utilikilt. * Hammy ‚Äî A hyperactive squirrel, Hammy is the least intelligent, though also the most lovable character in the strip, spouting random comments at random moments. His comments usually state an unusually short lecture on a topic of little interest to the other characters. The character started the strip as ‚ÄúHammy‚Äù. He was later renamed as ‚ÄúSammy‚Äù, one continuity error that was assigned a fanciful explanation, when the film was in production, in May 2005. The character swapped places in December 2005, with his duplicate, also named ‚ÄúHammy‚Äù, from the other side of a mirror. RJ has addressed the character as ‚ÄúHamilton‚Äù. * Clara ‚Äî A human infant, who can speak to and understand the animals, with surprising intelligence. She gets along best with RJ, often adding insight to his plans. Film adaptation A computer animated film adaptation, written by Travis Gibbons and T. Lewis, and produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount Pictures, was released on May 19, 2006 (June 30, 2006 in Britain). The film adaptation features RJ befriending a group of woodlanders (two of whom are Hammy and Verne) and introducing them to suburbia, with an ulterior motive of helping him replenish the food supply, he stole from a bear, named Vincent. Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, William Shatner, Wanda Sykes and Nick Nolte star as RJ, Verne, Hammy, Ozzie (an opossum), Stella (a skunk), Lou and Penny (porcupines) and Vincent (a bear), respectively. The film is also notable, for containing Avril Lavigne‚Äôs first major film role, as Heather, Ozzie‚Äôs continuously embarrassed teenage daughter. The film grossed $336 million worldwide.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on July 4, 2001. In the episode, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny discover the magician David Blaine performing in South Park and decide to join his cult, the Blaintologists. Stan quickly finds out that the Blaintologists are not as nice as everyone thinks and tries to convince the other boys they've been brainwashed. Teaming up with Jesus, Stan calls upon the Super Best Friends, a parody of the Super Friends, to destroy Blaine and thwart the mass suicide pact he has launched. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA in the United States. It depicts several religious figures, including Muhammad, whose appearance at the time of the original airing caused little to no controversy. Following Islamists' death threats regarding Muhammad's portrayal in the 2010 episode titled \\"201\\", the South Park Studios website no longer streams \\"Super Best Friends\\", nor is it available for streaming or purchase from online stores. The episode has been replaced on the South Park Studios with a notice: \\"We apologize that South Park Studios cannot stream Super Best Friends.\\" The episode was also featured in syndication, but was permanently removed after the threats. It is one of five episodes which are unavailable on HBO Max, along with season 14's \\"200\\", and the aforementioned \\"201\\", as well as season 10's \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\" and \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\". In 2013, fans voted \\"Super Best Friends\\" as the best episode of Season 5. Plot David Blaine visits South Park, impressing the town's residents, including Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny, with his street magic. Mesmerized, the boys join the cult of \\"Blaintology,\\" hoping to learn more about magic. Stan becomes progressively more disturbed by the cult and soon leaves, but Kyle refuses to join him, and so Stan asks Jesus for help. Meanwhile, Kyle and Cartman go door to door in a recruitment drive, sporting nametags labeled \\"Elder Kyle\\" and \\"Elder Cartman.\\" Jesus appears at Blaine's show in Denver, and challenges him by performing the miracle of the loaves and fish... after requesting that everybody in the audience turn around; Blaine manages to win the crowd with much more powerful enchantments. Jesus promptly requires the assistance of the Super Best Friends: a group of major religious figures including Muhammad, Buddha, Moses, Joseph Smith, Krishna, Laozi and \\"Sea Man\\", an Aquaman-like character.Amos N. Guiora, Freedom From Religion: Rights and National Security, Oxford Univ Pr, 2011, p. 128. They are dedicated to defending the world against evil (except for Buddha, who \\"doesn't really believe in evil\\"). The Blaintologists, meanwhile, petition the government for tax-exempt status. Their request is denied, and all the Blaintologists are told that they are to commit mass suicide in Washington, D.C. Kyle is shown to have escaped the cult's control, but when he tries to convince Cartman that they should flee, Cartman reports him, and Kyle is imprisoned in a glass bubble and forced to participate at the mass suicide. When word about the mass suicide reaches the Super Best Friends, they consult Moses (previously seen in \\"Jewbilee\\") for advice. In D.C., the Blaintologists begin to drown themselves in the Reflecting Pool even though it is only approximately a foot deep, while Cartman installs a hose in Kyle's glass bubble to fill it with water, so as to drown him. The Super Best Friends arrive at the scene, to which Blaine responds by animating the statue of Abraham Lincoln to fight them. Meanwhile, Stan searches for his friends, first finding Kenny drowned in the pool and shouting \\"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!\\", to which Kyle replies \\"You bastards!\\"; they alternately repeat their catchphrases in Marco Polo fashion to find each other. In order to defeat the Abraham Lincoln statue, the Super Best Friends create a giant animated John Wilkes Booth statue, which shoots it in the head, causing it to fall over and shatter Kyle's prison. Afterwards, Joseph Smith uses his ice powers to freeze the reflecting pool so as to prevent more suicides. It is revealed that Cartman has not managed to kill himself, as he keeps coming up for air. Blaine curses the Super Best Friends for ruining his plans and flies away in a rocket ship. Stan finally announces that any religion which forces people to relinquish their money or control over their lives is really a cult. After his speech, Kyle reconciles with Stan, they amuse themselves with kicking a taunting Cartman in the testicles, and the episode ends with the Super Best Friends flying away. References to Scientology In the DVD commentary, Parker states that the episode's references to real-life magician David Blaine and Blaintology were allusions to Scientology.Season 5 DVD commentary Depiction of Muhammad Muhammad, as portrayed in \\"Super Best Friends\\", is described as \\"the Muslim prophet with the powers of flame\\" In 2005, cartoon depictions of Muhammad became more controversial during the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. The creators of South Park returned to this theme in later episodes, parodying censorship attempts and portraying Muhammad again in the 2006 episodes \\"Cartoon Wars Part I\\" and \\"Cartoon Wars Part II\\" and again in the 2010 episode \\"200\\". Further controversy ensued, and one group, \\"Revolution Muslim\\", warned that South Parks creators would \\"probably wind up like Theo van Gogh\\". Around this time, the original \\"Super Best Friends\\" episode was removed from the South Park Studios website. Home release \\"Super Best Friends\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park: the Complete Fifth Season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. The episode was included in the re-release of the fifth season on Blu-ray, released on December 5, 2017. This was the first time the episode was made available in HD, as the episode was not released alongside the rest of the season when it debuted in HD on iTunes in 2011.https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/south-park-season-5/id213888284 The episode is shown in its original presentation, without Muhammad's image being obscured as in later episodes of the series.http://www.thedigitalbits.com/item/south-park-season-5-brd ReferencesExternal links * \\"Super Best Friends\\" episode guide at Comedy Central * * Category:Cultural depictions of Gautama Buddha Category:Cultural depictions of John Wilkes Booth Category:Cultural depictions of Joseph Smith Category:Television episodes about religion Category:Cultural depictions of Laozi Category:Cultural depictions of Moses Category:Cultural depictions of Muhammad Category:Cultural depictions of George W.

It can also be used to increase a feeling of safety. Lighting is integral to crime prevention through environmental design.  Planning considerations  Security lighting can be counter-productive. Turning off lights halved the number of thefts and burglary in √ñvertorne√• Sweden. \\"Outdoor Lighting and Crime, Part 2\\" by Barry Clark 2003, p. 18 and Figure 5 \\"Svenska Dagbladet\\": \\"Halverad brottslighet i m√∂rk kommun\\" (Halved crime in the dark city.) 2007 (The number of thefts and burglaries have halved in √ñvertorne√• since the city was dark in the fall because of the nationwide family dispute with Ekfors Kraft. We thought it would be the opposite, says S√∂ren Mukkavaara, police constable in √ñvertorne√•.) A test in West Sussex UK showed that adding all-night lighting in some areas made people there feel safer, although crime rates increased 55% in those areas compared to control areas and to the county as a whole. \\"Light and Crime\\" Bright, unshielded floodlights often prevent people from noticing criminal activity, and help criminals see what they are doing.\\"The Dark Side: Making war on light pollution\\" by David Owen 2007 While adequate lighting around a physical structure is deployed to reduce the risk of an intrusion, it is critical that the lighting be designed carefully as poorly arranged lighting can create glare which actually obstructs vision. Studies have shown that many criminals are aware of this effect and actively exploit it. The optimal design will also depend on whether the area will be watched directly by humans or by closed- circuit television, and on the location of the observers or cameras. Security lighting may be subject to vandalism, possibly to reduce its effectiveness for a subsequent intrusion attempt. Thus security lights should either be mounted very high, or else protected by wire mesh or tough polycarbonate shields. Other lamps may be completely recessed from view and access, with the light directed out through a light pipe or reflected from a polished aluminium or stainless steel mirror. For similar reasons high security installations may provide a stand-by power supply for their security lighting. Some typical considerations include: * Reduce and prevent glare and situations mentioned above ** Shielded or full cut-off (FCO) lamp housings which conceal the bulb could be used, which should direct light onto the ground or target and away from observers. These lights should send no light above 80 degrees from the nadir. Lighting should be bright enough, and not \\"as bright as possible\\". In many cases a good rule of thumb is 0.5 watts per square metre (0.05 watts per square foot). This might need to be increased in very confused environments, but conversely can be reduced in very open environments. Multiple lamps of moderate power instead of a few powerful lamps will reduce glare, provide more even illumination with reduced pools of shadow, and provide some redundancy if one lamp's bulb blows out or develops a bad ballast. * Prevent malicious tampering or interference. This means that besides the lamp itself, the entire circuit from the source (electric company or generator), through the wires, to the lamp and back should be protected. ** Luminaires should be accessible so that the maintainer can replace blown bulbs as quickly as possible and clean the luminaires periodically. However they should be protected or somehow made inaccessible to tampering. ** Ensure the electric meter box is locked or inaccessible, or else power the lights from a different line. ** Control and power lines, where outside or vulnerable, should be either buried well underground (in conduits preferably) or at a height of at least 8 metres (about 24 feet). ** Ideally multiple circuits should be used to prevent an accidental or malicious short or cut causing all illumination to fail.  Use  A sodium vapor light. This type is often used as security lighting. Security lighting can be used in residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, and military settings. Some examples of security lighting include floodlights and low pressure sodium vapour lights. Most lights intended to be left on all night are high-intensity discharge lamps as these have good energy efficiency, thus reducing the cost of running a lamp for such long periods. A disadvantage of low pressure sodium lamps is that the colour is pure yellow, so the illuminated scene is seen without any colour differentiation. Consequently, high pressure sodium vapour lamps (which are still yellowish, but closer to golden white) are also used, at the cost of greater running expenses and increased light pollution. High pressure sodium lamps also take slightly longer to restrike after a power interruption. LED- based security lighting is becoming increasingly popular, due to its low electrical consumption (compared to non-LED lighting technologies), long lifespan, and options for different color spectrum ranges. Other lights may be activated by sensors such as passive infrared sensors (PIRs), turning on only when a person (or other mammal) approaches. PIR activated lamps will usually be incandescent bulbs so that they can activate instantly; energy saving is less important since they will not be on all the time. PIR sensor activation can increase both the deterrent effect (since the intruder knows that he has been detected) and the detection effect (since a person will be attracted to the sudden increase in light). Some PIR units can be set up to sound a chime as well as turn on the light. Most modern units have a photocell so that they only turn on when it is dark.  Limitations  An important limitation to the usefulness of security lighting is the simple fact that it is only useful at night. This is particularly significant for home owners because, contrary to a widespread myth, most household burglaries occur during the day,\\"Sourcebook of criminal justice statistics Online\\": \\"Percent distribution of burglaries known to police. By place and time of occurrence, United States, 1976-2007\\"\\"Lighting & Crime\\" from the British Astronomical Association's Campaign for Dark Skies when the occupants are away at work or shopping. As with any lighting, security lighting can reduce night vision, making it harder to see into areas that are unlit or are in shadow. Non-uniform illumination may also interfere with surveillance systems, as the wide dynamic range of security cameras may have difficulty adjusting to the changes in light intensity.

This section includes the Kappu, the very first part; it tells of the Detchanam, and describes the political and sociological situation in the early world.  The Kappu  The word, Kappu, in Tamil means \\"the act of the author taking refuge in the Almighty before writing a book\\". Almost all the ancient works in Tamil begin with Kappu. In this case, however, the Kappu on the one hand functions as an act of the author taking refuge, and on the other hand, reveals the personal liberation of each and every life in the Universe. In this section the author says that, because of the coming of the Kaliyan, God incarnates the Santror to save and rule the universe under One Word, and I am he who heard which God says about that.  Noolcchurikkam  This part provides a summary, in a grand style, of all the events of the Akilam from the beginning of the Universe to the end. It gives a little more information about the Vaikunda Avatharam. This part also includes the spread of God in the mind of the author before writing, and also Adiyeduttharulal (the act of giving the first verse of Akilam, by God to the author).  Benefit of the Book  This is the part in which Akilam narrates briefly the benefits of it in a religious way. It says that one who hears its reading will attain Ultimate Completeness, and one who abuses it will be sentenced to Hell.  Novelty of Detchanam  According to Akilathirattu, Santror took birth in this world before the Kali Yukam in Detchanam, and so this Detchanam is the Land of the earliest civilization of Human Beings. In this part, the novelty, sociology, and theology of the civilization were deeply narrated.  Justice of Governance  This part tells about the way in which Chozhan (not to be confused with later Cholas), the king of Detchanam, rules his country at an early age, and so suggests the path by which a king should rule his country.  Justice of Divinity  This part tells about the thought of people about the Almighty and about their religious harmony during that age, and tells the way by which one should be divinized.  Justice of Common Man  This part of the book tells us about the moral character of the people, and also their way of life in harmony with nature, particularly women.  Integrity of Castes  This part describes the caste system in the early days. It says that although there were several castes, it was merely a classification; the people of different castes lived as one caste without antipathy.  Neetiya Yukam  The very first yukam (which is pronounced yugam in Tamil, and which means \\"aeon\\") was called Neetiya Yukam. During this time, divine, human, and all other virtues flourished without hindrance. The human race lived united as a family, without distinctions of caste, and were not subjected to uliyams (pronounced oozhiyam, and meaning slavery or severe labour). They did not fear demons, and there was perfect harmony among the creatures of the Earth, as well as among those who lived in the Fourteen Worlds. In this yukam, the king was righteous and did not oppress his people through taxes or other means. During this peaceful time, Kroni was born. Kroni, who is analogous to Satan in the Christian tradition, is viewed as a primordial personification of evil. Though Kroni is said to have been born with multitudinous limbs, each the size of a mountain, he nevertheless assumes different forms in different yukams: for example, as Ravana or Duroyodhana. In opposition, Vishnu also incarnates in different yukam with different Avatars, for example Rama or Krishna. In order to quell the ravenous hunger in his stomach, Kroni drank all of the waters of the sea. With these waters being insufficient, he swallowed Kailayam, the abode of Sivan (Shiva), then proceeded to devour the entire universe. Mayon, residing with Isvaran (another name for Shiva) in Kailayam, escaped to undertake tavam (tapas, meaning \\"austerity\\") to receive permission from Isvaran to destroy Kroni. Isvaran granted this permission, but made Mayon aware of the necessity to appear in different forms in the successive six Yukams in order to destroy the Six Fragments of Kroni. Following this advice, Mayon sliced Kroni into six fragments, and saved the universe. The first yukam thus came to an end.  Chathura Yukam  According to Ayyavazhi mythology, in the second yukam, called Chathura Yukam, one of the six Pieces of Kroni was formed as a creature called Kuntomasali in the shape and size of a mammoth leech, and when it disturbed the tavam of those in Thavalokam, Mayon destroyed it by catching it in a hook.  Request of Devas  After the two Yukams are completed, Devas requested of Sivan that as they did not find anyone claiming boons in the previous Yukams, so in the following Yukams, the Asuras should be created with the capability of thinking and looking smart, and they should claim boons, and so live prosperously.  Netu Yukam  In the ensuing Netu Yukam, according to Ayyavazhi mythology, another fragment of Kroni was created into two wicked persons called Thillaimallalan and Mallosivahanan. They ruled over the people most wickedly, by extracting Uliyam and Iraikal (taxes) from them. When it became unbearable, the Thevarkal (celestial beings) complained to Isvaran, who in turn, commissioned Mayon to carry out the destruction of the wicked rulers, which he later did.  Kretha Yukam  This part tells about the fourth aeon, called Kretha Yukam. The third fragment of Kroni was, once again, made into two siblings called Suraparppan and Sinkamuka Suran, and they were given responsibility to rule the earth. The wicked rulers began to crush the Thevarkal, who once again reported it to Mayon.

Kaju literally means cashew nuts and barfi is a type of Indian sweet, usually in a lozenge shape. Barfi is often but not always, made by thickening milk with sugar and other ingredients (dry fruits and mild spices). It is then spread in a flat, shallow dish and cut into bite-sized pieces. These pieces are sometimes decorated with edible silver foil. Kaju katli, on the other hand, is made with cashew nuts soaked in water overnight (it is not prepared using milk) and ground the next day; then sugar, saffron (kesar) and other dried fruits are added. It is usually white or yellow in colour. If pistachios are used in the preparation, it can be green in colour. Kaju barfi is one of the more expensive Indian sweets when compared to other barfis.

The town lies on Kaniyang land within the Noongar nation.AIATSIS Map of Indigenous Australia, Aboriginal Studies Press, AIATSIS, 1996. The name Boyup is derived from the name of a nearby pool \\"Booyup\\", an Aboriginal term meaning \\"place of big stones\\" (large granite outcrops common in the area) or \\"place of big smoke\\" (from burning the many surrounding grass trees). The town's economy is primarily agricultural. It is a Cooperative Bulk Handling receival site. History About 1839, John Hassell brought sheep and cattle from the eastern states of Australia via Albany, and acquired a lease of land along what would later become Scotts Brook, south of the current town site. Although he grazed this stock in the area, the leases did not become permanent, and Hassell later moved to Kendenup. In 1845, Augustus Gregory followed the Blackwood River from the junction of the Arthur and Beaufort Rivers downstream for about . He carved his initials and the date into a jarrah tree, approximately north-east of where the town now lies. That tree is now dead, but the stump and the markings remain. The stump ‚Äì now known as the Gregory Tree ‚Äì has been covered for preservation. The first permanent settlement in the area was a lease, south of the current town site, along what became known as Scotts Brook. This lease was granted to William ScottSome sources refer to Scott as \\"Commander\\", \\"Commodore\\" and/or \\"Captain\\". Schorer 1968 uses all three titles, but Erickson 1979, 1988 doesn't mention any title. and his wife Mary ( Keane), who arrived in 1854, having travelled from Albany. They named the property Norlup, and in about 1872 built a new house that remains to this day (albeit with more recent extensions and renovations), and is now listed on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's register. In 1861 James George Lee Steere, in partnership with Mr J H Monger, took up a lease near the Blackwood River. Shortly afterwards, his wife CatherineThe history page on the shire's web site shows her name as Caroline, but all other references list her as Catherine. and their baby son travelled from Bunbury to join him. In 1871 William ForrestWilliam was the brother of Sir John Forrest. moved into the area, to a farm called Dwalganup. By 1882 there were nineteen families in the area. In 1896 land was set aside for a future town and the Upper Blackwood Road Board district (which became the Shire of Boyup Brook in 1961) was created as a separate local government area. Boyup Brook was declared a town on 9 February 1900. The district had an area of , and in December 1900 an estimated population of 400. Milestones in the town's early history include: * 1900 ‚Äì The town's first building was opened, a school, with 15 students. * 1909 ‚Äì A railway line from Donnybrook reached Boyup Brook. * 1910 ‚Äì The Agricultural Hall was opened. * 1911 ‚Äì A permanent policeman was assigned to the town. The hotel was opened. The railway line was extended from Boyup Brook to Kojonup and Katanning. * 1912 ‚Äì An official post office was established. (An unofficial post office had existed for three years prior to that.) * 1914 ‚Äì Land in the town site was opened for leasing. * 1924 ‚Äì The Upper Blackwood Soldiers' Memorial Hospital was opened. * ‚Äì Electricity was generated and distributed within the town site. * 1936 ‚Äì The town hall was opened. =Name of the town= The town was originally gazetted as Boyup by an Executive Council minute dated 31 January 1900. However the name Boyup Brook was in common use by the locals,Lands and Surveys file on Boyup Brook at the State Records Office the Progress Committee and the Upper Blackwood Road Board. In 1908 residents suggested that the town be renamed to Boyup Brook, to avoid confusion with the similarly named Boyanup. Lee Steere, by now the Speaker of the Assembly and member for Nelson, which included the area, strongly supported the use of the name over that of \\"Throssell\\", which had been advocated by some at the time. The name was ultimately changed to Boyup Brook on 5 February 1909 to match the railway station that was built in 1908‚Äì1909.File 1378/99 v1, Upper Blackwood Progress Townsite Boyup Brook, Department of Lands and Surveys. Accessed at State Records Office, Perth. Even after the change, there was still confusion about the name within the government, as can be seen in the name and text of the Boyup-Kojonup Railway Act 1909, assented some 10 months after the official change of name. Country music festival The town hosts the Boyup Brook Country Music Festival, an annual event, held in February each year. The festival has been held since 1986 and the attendance at the event has increased from 500 at the first festival to over 13,000 in recent years. It was originally held on the town's football oval, but in 2007 the purpose-built \\"Music Park\\", with a permanent stage and sound shell, was officially opened and the festival has been held there each year since. Sport Boyup Brook has many sporting teams within the community. In summer, cricket, tennis, swimming and lawn bowls are prominent, while in winter, Australian rules football, field hockey, netball and golf are played. In cricket, Boyup Brook currently participates in the Warren Blackwood Association, having competed in the now disbanded Donnybrook Blackwood Cricket association. They have won five premierships, in 2001, 2006, 2008, 2012 and 2013. The Boyup Roos football team participates in the Lower South West Football League. The Roos have won two premierships, in 1981 and 2012. The tennis and netball clubs run both juniors and seniors. The hockey club has their own junior club, as well as a ladies team that participates in the Bunbury competition. Golf is played during the winter weeks.

Perkins, 19th century Charles Callahan Perkins (March 1, 1823 ‚Äì August 25, 1886) was an art critic, author, organizer of cultural activities, and an influential friend of design and of music in Boston. Biography Charles C. Perkins was born in Boston on March 1, 1823, to James and Eliza Greene (Callahan) Perkins. His father, descended from Edmund Perkins who emigrated to New England in 1650, was a wealthy and philanthropic merchant. His mother was a gracious, cultivated woman. The family was wealthy. Perkins was the great nephew of Thomas Handasyd Perkins, who founded the Perkins shipping empire J. & T.H Perkins with Charles' grandfather James. Perkins attended several schools before entering Harvard College, where he found the prescribed academic course irksome. He graduated in 1843. He had previously drawn and painted and went abroad soon after graduation to study art. In Rome he became friendly with and encouraged the sculptor Thomas Crawford, then struggling economically. In 1846, Perkins took a studio at Paris, where he had instruction from Ary Scheffer. Later he pursued studies in the history of Christian art in Leipzig. Returning to Paris he took up etching with Bracquemond and Lalanne. He made many etchings to illustrate his own books. Perkins, independently wealthy, devoted his life to interpreting the art of others. In 1850-51 and from 1875 until his death he was president of the Handel and Haydn Society, Boston, and sometimes conducted their concerts and wrote music the ensemble performed. (The German publisher Breitkopf and H√§rtel, the world's oldest music publishing house, issued Perkins's Piano Trio and two string quartets in 1854 and 1855 respectively; Perkins's compositions were the first works by an American ever published by that firm.) He married on June 12, 1855, Frances Davenport Bruen, daughter of the Rev. Matthias Bruen, of New York. They gave many concerts and recitals at their home. Perkins was the largest subscriber to the construction of the Boston Music Hall, forwhich he also contributed the great bronze statue of Beethoven, modeled by his friend Crawford, which since 1902 has stood in the entrance hall of the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston. An invitation extended to Perkins in 1857 to give some lectures at Trinity College, Hartford, on \\"The Rise and Progress of Painting,\\" started him as a lecturer. He possessed charm and magnetism on the platform. After another European sojourn ended in 1869, he lectured frequently on Greek and Roman art before Boston school teachers, and on sculpture and painting at the Lowell Institute. he served for thirteen years on the Boston school committee. He brought to Boston the South Kensington methods of teaching drawing and design to children, and he was instrumental in founding the Massachusetts Normal Art School, now the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. As a committeeman he was also assigned the third division of the school system, comprising the North and West Ends. He took pains to know personally all teachers of his division, often entertaining them at his home. Prior to 1850, Perkins had proposed an art museum for Boston but had found the plan premature. When others revived this project twenty years later he supported it. He was second among the incorporaters of the Museum of Fine Arts, secured for its opening a gift of Egyptian antiquities, and made valuable suggestions for arranging its exhibits. He advocated showing contemporary work as well as the arts of antiquity. He was also elected president of the Boston Art Club, a post he held for ten years. He systematically devoted part of each day to writing Tuscan Sculptors, published in London in 1864, which brought him a European reputation. It was followed in 1868 by Italian Sculptors, with illustrations drawn and etched by the author. He edited, with notes, Charles Locke Eastlake's Hints on Household Taste (1872), Art in Education (1870), Art in the House (1879) from the original of Jakob von Falke, and Sepulchral Monuments in Italy (1885). In 1878 he brought out, with illustrative woodcuts which he had designed, Raphael and Michaelangelo, dedicated to Henry W. Longfellow, and included Longfellow's previously unpublished translations of the sculptor's sonnets. His Historical Handbook of Italian Sculpture appeared in 1883, and in 1886, in French, Ghiberti et son √âcole. At the time of his death he had nearly finished his closely documented History of the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, Massachusetts, which others completed. He was also critical editor of the Cyclopedia of Painters and Paintings, edited by Champlin.New International Encyclopedia He was the grandfather of editor Maxwell Perkins and the great-grandfather of Archibald Cox. Perkins died on August 25, 1886, in Windsor, Vermont in a carriage accident while he was driving with U.S. Senator William M. Evarts of New York.

It was used to pump water out of Elsecar New Colliery and ran from 1795 until 1923 when it was replaced by electric pumps. The date over the door of the Engine House is 1787, but there is some dispute that the engine was not actually installed until 1795. In 1836 the Graham brothers, a local partnership cast a new beam and two parallel motions for the Newcomen engine. It also ran briefly in 1928 when the electric pumps were overwhelmed by flooding. At its peak it could draw 600 gallons a minute. In 1972 the engine was classified as a scheduled ancient monument. The engine was restored to working order (worked by hydraulics) over the period 2012-14.

He is the author of many books that include *Death of the State *War and Democracy *Logic as Philosophy *A History and Philosophy of the Social Sciences *A Realist Philosophy of the Social Sciences *Social Process in Hawaii *Rescuing Dewey: Essays in Pragmatic Naturalism Following description of his book: A History and Philosophy of the Social Sciences, provides some of the core elements of his thought which are radically different from mainstream views. This book is in three main parts: (I)It deals first with the history of certain key ideas from the early modern period (assessing thinkers from Hobbes and Marx to Hegel, Weber and Kuhn, (II) before exploring the institutional and social features which have shaped the emergence of modern social science,(III) concluding by suggesting an alternative realist philosophy for the future. This ambitious critical history of the variety of the disciplines we group together as social sciences argues that the defining characteristic of social science, both historically and in the present, is ideology. Based originally on a flawed idea of science, the ‚Äòsocial sciences‚Äô have incorporated and refined a set of assumptions about the nature of state and society, assumptions which have been institutionalized with the growth of modern universities. A deep moral vision informs this study. A (if not the) principle moral of Professor Manicas's historical sketch is that ‚Äòthe modern social sciences have been, unwittingly or not, defenders of the status quo; (p. 276)‚Ä¶ Despite this history, ‚Äòsocial science is potentially liberating‚Äô (ibid.). But, the human sciences can be liberating disciplines, humanizing practices, only if they empower people to see that ‚Äòwhile social reality is real enough, it is not like unchanging nature, but is just that which is sustained by human activities, activities regarding which human have the only say‚Äô (ibid.). This means, in effect, empowering human beings to see themselves as ‚Äúcausal agents‚Äù and as such, beings ‚Äòcapable of re-fashioning society in the direction of greater humanity, freedom, and justice‚Äô (p. 277).

He was born in Fort Worth, Texas to Clyde Lanham Hurley and Esther Brown. Scott Yanow describes Hurley as \\"a fine trumpeter with a fat tone and a hard-driving style\\". He died of a coronary occlusion in Fort Worth leaving two sons and a former wife. Career Self-taught, he learned to play the trumpet by playing along with Louis Armstrong records. He studied music at the Texas Christian University in Fort Worth from 1932 to 1936 where he participated in the school's jazz band. He began his career working with territory bands. In 1937, while drummer/band-leader Ben Pollack was touring through Texas he heard Hurley and invited him to join his orchestra where Hurley soloed on \\"So Unexpectedly\\". After a year with Pollack, while on tour in Los Angeles, Hurley left to become a studio musician. Hurley was playing with Paul Whiteman when Glenn Miller sent for him to join the Miller band on its Glen Island Casino opening in May 1939, the year following fellow Fort Worthian Tex Beneke joining Miller's band. Beneke recommended Hurley to Miller. During the time he was with Miller, Hurley was one of the key soloists. He appeared on the band's studio recordings and live performances throughout America, including Carnegie Hall, Cafe Rouge in Hotel Pennsylvania and the Paramount Theatre, New York. He shared trumpet solo honors with John Best, with Hurley taking the \\"hot\\" solos and Best taking the rest. Hurley played the trumpet solo on Glenn Miller's \\"In The Mood\\", \\"Slip Horn Jive\\" and \\"Tuxedo Junction.\\" After a difference of opinion with Miller over the style of music the band was playing, Hurley left Miller in May 1940 to work with Tommy Dorsey and then joined Artie Shaw in 1941. After his stint with Shaw, he did freelance work for the movie studios. In 1941 he played the trumpet track for the classic Walter Lantz cartoon \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B.\\" He worked for MGM from 1944 to 1949 and for NBC from 1950 to 1955. During the late 1950s, Hurley played in Dixieland groups, recording with Matty Matlock's Rampart Street Paraders. In 1954, he recorded live with Ralph Sutton and Edmond Hall at the Club Hangover. His studio work in the 1950s included sessions with Paul Weston. He played solo on \\"Memories of You\\" on Weston's \\"Solo Flight\\" album.

This parts includes the whole of the Thretha Yukam and a few events of the Dwapara Yukam, such as creation of bodies of the god-heads and subjects of the yukam. Creating Thretha Yukam After the destruction of the asuras of the previous Kretha Yukam, Nathan stayed in the sea-shore of Thiruchendur as Kantha. At that time, Sivan and Vethan meet Nathan for discussing the further events to be done. At that time Sivan remembered to Nathan that, \\"The ancient Kroni had been sliced and all but three more fragments are remaining to be given birth in the world.\\" Hearing this all of them discussed about and decided to give birth to the next fragment and thereby create the next Yuga. During the creation Nathan told Sivan that, at his previous manifestation during his death, he insulted me by saying, \\"Only with your ten nails which were made of ten mountains you were able to kill me and otherwise not.\\" So in this yuga, he should be created as a mighty being with ten heads, twenty eyes, twenty ears and with appropriate body parts and Tatvas etc. As per the instructions Ravana was created. Then from the 'blood of Kroni' which is taken from the pit where it was gathered during the destruction of Kroni, the Asura race was created. When these people are created, Nathan assembled some sweat from his golden body and created a person with the name Vibhishana and made him the brother of Ravana. And Afterwards ordered him that, \\"Besides all the activities of Ravana you should remain polite.\\" Ravana Claiming boons Ravana for claiming boons, stood humbly in front of Sivan. Seeing this Sivan asked him to ask what ever needed. Ravana replied that Sivan should promise on Ganapathi that he will give what ever asked by Ravana. Then on the promise of Sivan, Ravana started claiming. * I should be mighty enough that the Devas, Rishis and the weapons of the three Logas must not defeat me. * The Sun, Moon and all celestial objects should revolve around my forts. * Yourself Sivan should give ten million boons * The God of Creation, - Brahma should give ten million boons * The Umaiyaal should give me ten million boons * Indra should give half a crore of boons. Ravana claimed all these boons and Sivan prepared himself to offer the boons. At that time Lekhsmi arrived there and seated near Parvati. On seeing the beauty of Lekhsmi, Ravana in lust stood passionate. At that very moment, Sivan understood the stunned mind-situation of Ravana and offered the boons claimed by him immediately. So Ravana while possing the boons was not much deliberated. On the way of Ravana, returning from Kayilai, Nathan deliberately snatched away thirty million boons from him and minimised the number to five million boons. So soon, Ravana got such a large quantity of boons, had to loose almost all. Brutal reign of Ravana Ravana ordered the Trimurthis and Devas around like slaves. He demanded Vayu to clean his bell-towers or he will be murdered. Ravana ordered the Sun and Moon to bow their heads when they approach his nation or otherwise be destroyed by his arrows. The 'Deva-Kannis' (Virgin Angels) were instructed to stand beside him and fan him or they will be bound in a tree. All four Vedas and six Shastras were to carry milk-pot and stand respectfully before him or they would be murdered too. The Devas were to praise him with strewing flowers. He even stated for all the kings in the world to obey him and pay him tributes. =Invocation of Devas= While Ravana ruled cruelly, the time for karma arrived. The Devas and the human beings of the Bhoologa, being unable to withstand the cruelty of Ravana, invocated to Thirumal. Thirumal on hearing the plea, calmed them and went to Kayilai to visit Siva. Thirumal meeting Sivan There in Kayilai, Thirumal met Sivan and told, \\"Since you offered several crores of boons to Ravana he, as setting the Devas, Indra and other devine beings as shielders on all directions of his fort was ruling as an un-counterable king. His cruel activities towards his subjects are innumerable. I can't ignore their plea and sleep peacefully in Vaikundam. There is nobody is there to save them other than us. So for destroying him, what is to be done to kill him? What kind of avatar should I need to come with? Please tell, the uncomparable supreme.\\" Sivan replied, \\"I can't snatch away the boons which I granded him once.\\" Hearing this, Thirumal get disappointed and think deep in search of any other ways. Then he told, \\"King Dasarata is performing austrity that I must born as a son to him and on the other hand Dinakaran is on austrity that Lekshmi should born as a daughter for him.

A 'bad' is anything with a negative value to the consumer, or a negative price in the marketplace. Refuse is an example of a bad. A bad is a physical object that lowers a consumer's level of happiness, or stated alternately, a bad is an object whose consumption or presence lowers the utility of the consumer. With normal goods, a two-party transaction results in the exchange of money for some object, as when money is exchanged for a car. With a bad, however, both money and the object in question go the same direction, as when a household gives up both money and garbage to a waste collector being compensated to take the garbage. In this way, garbage has a negative price; the waste collector is receiving both garbage and money and thus is paying a negative amount for the garbage. Goodness and badness are an inherently subjective declaration, however. As an example: two diners at a restaurant discover that the \\"secret ingredient\\" in the house specialty is peanuts. One of the diners is a peanut-lover, and the other is allergic to peanuts. In this case, peanuts are, in the same time and in the same place, both a good and a bad in economic terms. Additionally, a good consumed by the same individual can turn into a bad over time, and vice versa; the nicotine from cigarettes may give a smoker a feeling of relieved anxiety and reduced stress. Continuing, long-term consumption of cigarettes, however, may have serious adverse effects on a smoker's health, thus turning the utility of cigarettes into the negative. On the other hand, some forms of medical treatment or side effects of medication may seem rather unpleasant to a patient at the time of treatment, but will greatly improve their health and well-being in the long run.

This section narrates the prosperous life of Santror after their marriage with the daughters of King Nirupathi. It also describes the birth of Kaliyan, his cruel activities and its impact in the world. This section describes the genesis of modern human civilization and the universal transformation which is initiated by the beginning of Kaliyuga, thereby causing a rapid decline of the divine powers which exist until then. It also profess that all the ruling powers were surrendered to Vishnu from Sivan and other god-heads at the start of the Kaliyuga. The life of Santror After their marriage, the Santror lived a divine life as per the Neetham in the palaces which was offered by Kali to them. Before the advent of Kali the Santror beget children. This dynasty gradually learned the various life arts including, trade, deep-sea navigation, etc. But on the other hand, they didn't fail to respect Palmyra and treated the juice of it as celestial nectar. The then Chola wondered about the talents of Santror and ordered his troops to fulfill all the wants and needs of them. He also craved the efficiency of Santror in his Palace. The Santror served as the protective agents of the ancient Chozha Kingdom. Thus Santror lived in harmory with the Chozha dynasty. Creation of Kaliyan After a long period, a saint named Kuru visited Kailash. He reminded Sivan that as previously planned, only five fragments of Kroni have been given birth and the final fragment is yet to take birth. It is the right time to give birth to the sixth fragment of Kroni in the world. Sivan told that, Vishnu is yet to come by finishing the sixth Yuga and on his return, he would inform about it to him. The Kuru saint replied that Vishnu, by ending his previous Avatar and was on a divine sleep to take birth again. To get the opinion about this from the Devas, Siva assembled the devas of all logas and ask for their feedback. Devas unanimously accepted to give birth to the final fragment. And Siva decided to create the next fragment as Kaliyan. The moment he made the decision, the fragment took birth inverted (head-down and legs-up) in the world. On hearing heard this, Sivan asked qualities of the Kaliyan to Chithrabuthira. Chithrabuthira detailed the qualities, the physical body, the mind-set of Kaliyan. Then Sivan ordered devas to bring Kaliyan in front of him.  Boons to Kaliyan  As per the order Kaliyan was brought before Sivan. And the devas told Kaliyan that Sivan was the one who created you and he will offer you whatever you need. First refused to accept that, but when a beautiful women named Kalicchi was created for him, he believed the words of Devas. He was then asked to claim what ever he wants. So Kaliyan started demanding the terrible boons that he wanted. On hearing this everyone was shocked. For offering the boons claimed by Kaliyan, Sivan created Agatheesar from his mind and ordered him to give whatever Kaliyan needs, and Agatheesar did so. Then Kaliyan, along with Kalicchi enters the world. The rule of Kaliyan On his way, Vishnu met Kaliyan and made him to promise that, if he disturbs any Pantaram (Sanyasins) in the world, he himself will go to hell. Then he cursed the Chakra as Money and offered to Kaliyan. When Kaliyan entered the world, all good or white beings left the world. Then Kaliyan with his cruel and powerful boons started ruling the world, breaking the rule of Neetham. So Devas, unable to tolerate the cruelty of Kaliyan requested Sivan to find solution in the matter of Kaliyan. Sivan discussed with the devas to call Vishnu for their rescue. Devas accepted for that and so Sivan performs Tavam towards Vishnu. Hearing about the Tavam of Sivan, Vishnu went to Kailash. Sivan told about the cruelty of Kaliyan and asked the method of destroying him. Vishnu gave some solution for Sivan for the destruction of Kaliyan.

It narrates the cruel reign of Kaliyan, the death of two Santror and the subsequent curse given to Kali. It also hints about the start of the Kalineesan dynasty that tortured Vaikundar. The final passages confess that Narayana as Anantha Padmanabha Swamy deserted Thiruvananthapuram and challenged him that he will come one day to destroy Kali.  Break down of Vaigai  Because of the serious and cruel nature of Kali, all beings caught hold of the evil spirit of Kali. The caste system which was until than a social organisation changed its color as a matter of social dignity with respects to their works. People lost their divine mindset and everyone longed to create an individuality which results in cold-tensions between them. The concept that \\"all are one\\" was completely driven out from the society by Kali. Meanwhile, heavy rainfall caused the Vaigai Dam to break off and much of the lands in the Chola country was sunk in waters. People requested the king for their rescue. For rectifying the damage, the King ordered that one person from each house should go for the work of the dam. Though everyone worked hard, they were not able to rebuild the dam and stop the floods. They admitted this to the King and told that only the Mighty Santror of Puttapuram can accomplish this. The King immediately ordered his minister to bring Santror to his court. They were brought in front of the king, and he ordered the Santror to repair the damage. But Santror refused to accept his order, saying that carrying mud on their head will affect their social dignity. Since they refused the order of the King one of them was killed but cutting down the head by an elephant. And told to the other Santror that they will also be killed if they refused. They too disagreed and another man was also killed. Thirumal at Vaigai All the Seven Logas were stunned by this incident. By now, two of the Santror were killed, and Mother Kaali(Durga) was sent to jail, since she had earlier promised that if she allows any damage to the Santror, she herself will go to jail. By the time, Saint Vidhyadara pleaded for the rescue of the remaining Santror. So Thirumal, in the state of Para brahmam went to Vaigai as the representative of Vanthi (a steamcake seller in Chozha country) and filled the Dam and it got repaired. He then return to Srirangam. Kaali being struck by the activities of Chola king, cursed him and his nation. The wives of the died Santror too cursed the Chola King and they started performing austerity towards Thirumal for rescuing the Santror from this disaster. Meanwhile, the curse of them began to react in the Chola country. It began from the palace of divinity, Srirangam itself. The priests lost their divine thought and started misbehaving even in the temple. They even started stealing things there in temple which was donated for divine rituals.  The Velvi of a Priest  Observing the happenings in the Chola country, a genuine Poojari(Priest) there in the temple guessed that something bad is going to happen to the country. He advised the other priests to be genuine, but they did not listen. So he started performing Velvi (ritual) towards Thirumal. Since he didn't appear before him he ought to destroy himself jumping into the fire of Velvi. So for his rescue, Thirumal appeared before him and the priest told about the unusual activities of the other priests. Thirumal advised them to go to Thiruvananthapuram. He added that it is no more good time for Chola Kingdom and so we have to go to Thiruvananathapuram. So he advised the priest to be prepared for that. Meanwhile, Sethira Balakan (a temple boy) and some other priests came to know about this and they went to Kailash and pleaded in front of Sivan. So all the devas of Siva Loga along with the Sethira Balakan, pleaded Thirumal that \\"Why he should go to Thiruvananthapuram?\\" Journey to Thiruvananthapuram Thirumal told that the Neetham can no more be preserved in the Chola Kingdom, and so he has to leave the place. The Devas said that the land of Thiruvananthapuram is already ruled by Kalineesan and that the cruelty of Kali is intolerable. Thirumal told that he knew it very well but He had to go there since, once a saint called Sugu Muni had cursed Him that he must be in Thiruvananthapuram for some time. Saying this Thirumal started his journey to Thiruvananthapuram. He took Sethira Balakan, Aruna Mamuni and some other devas with him. On the way they come across 55 statues grouped at one place, which were all devas of Brahma Loga once cursed to be as statues and so they were there. Thirumal touched them with his hands, instantly they all got life. They all demanded life in the Bhoologa (world) and so they were granted boons to be so in across 55 nations. Afterwards Thirumal continued his journey and when close to Ananthapuram, they come across a rock which was Ekkala Durga who was once cursed for disobeying the words of Sivan. She was also told that when Thirumal touch you, your cursed will be finished. So now being touched by Thirumal she stood up. Thirumal asked for the reason of her curse. She told that, \\"I was then a beautiful woman, the wife of Senthi Rishi. Once Yama saw me and he wanted to take me with him and for that he killed my husband. So I performed austerity towards Sivan to kill Yama. But Sivan appeared before me and told that this is not the time to do so. I didn't agree with, so he cursed me.\\" Hearing this Thirumal told that by the advent of Dharma Yukam, your Tavam will be fulfilled and till then you continue to perform Tavam. Hearing this, Thirumal proceeded to Ananthapuram. On the way they found devas of four Logas performing austerity there. Thirumal asked the reason and they replied that as per the fate and the words of Vethan they all should be born in the world in the Kali Yuga. They also pleaded to Thirumal that in Kali yuga they need to be born in the gene of Santror. Thirumal accepted their demand and wished them for their Tavam and continued his journey. After some time they again come across a case where a Cow and a woman performing austerity. Thirumal asked the cow for the reason for the Tavam. The cow told that this woman is under Tavam for killing my son. So even if my son died, I want him again to resurrect as my son. Then Thirumal asked the reason for the Tavam with the woman. She told that, the lady who was performing Tavam as a cow over there had a son who was in love with me. As I refused, he killed my 14-year-old boy. So I want his boy also to be killed. Hearing this, Thirumal told the lady that you will achieve the aim of the Tavam and told the cow that even if your son would be killed, he will take birth as your son in your next birth (reincarnation) and will be made to perform the Panividai for Vaikundar. Saying this they again proceeded to Thiruvananthapuram. Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram Thirumal reached Thiruvananthapuram and slept (Palli Kolluthal) over there as Anantha Padmanabha Swamy. A Pulayar woman identified the presence of God over there and informed the King about it. So the king built a Temple for him there. Then the Kalineesan who was ruling the land of Thiruvananthapuram had no children. As per the advice of Anantha Padmanabha Swamy, he went to Kasi and performed Tavam for the begetting a child. There his Tavam met with failure but through a crane he had a son named Venneesan. Then he returned to Ananthapuram and from then onwards the son-in-law rule was adopted in the Travancore kingdom. The reign of Kalineesan was cruel as he tortured the Santror very much and treated them as slaves. Thirumal advised the king (Kalineesan) to stop torturing them. On his refusal Thirumal deserted Thiruvananthapuram and came to Tiruchendur and slept over there.

Life Remy was born in Nogent-le-Rotrou. A nobleman (under the tutelage of the Lorraine family), he did his studies under Marc Antoine Muret and George Buchanan. As a student, he became friends with the young poets Jean de La P√©ruse, √âtienne Jodelle, Jean de La Taille and Pierre de Ronsard and the latter incorporated Remy into the \\"La Pl√©iade\\", a group of revolutionary young poets. Belleau's first published poems were odes, les Petites Inventions (1556), inspired by the ancient lyric Greek collection attributed to Anacreon and featuring poems of praise for such things as butterflies, oysters, cherries, coral, shadows, turtles. In the 1560s, Belleau tried his hand at a mixed verse and prose form modeled on the Italian pastoral Arcadia by Jacopo Sannazaro (French translation, 1544): this became La Bergerie (1565-1572), in which narration (in prose) is interspersed with poems on love and the countryside. His last work, les Amours et nouveaux Eschanges des Pierres precieuses (1576), is a poetic description of gems and their properties inspired by medieval and renaissance lapidary catalogues. He died in Paris on 6 March 1577, and was buried in Grands Augustins. Remy Belleau was greatly admired by poets in the twentieth century, such as Francis Ponge.

Early life He was born as Herbert Richard Imber in Newark, New Jersey to the owner of a chain of meat stores. His parents gave him violin lessons, but when they found him performing in a seedy Newark dive, they took the instrument away from him and sent him to military school. In 1915, he stole away into New York City, where Sophie Tucker heard him play and hired him as a novelty act to play with her and the Five Kings of Syncopation where Himber was the highlight of the cabaret act. He worked his way through Vaudeville and down Tin Pan Alley. He managed Rudy Vallee's orchestra service, which sent out bands for private parties and society functions. A suave salesman and irrepressible idea man, he soon had his own band booking agency. In 1932, he acquired the first known \\"vanity\\" telephone number, R-HIMBER, answered 24 hours a day. Later that year, Himber finally formed an orchestra of his own, parlaying a gig at New York's Essex House Hotel into national NBC radio exposure. Among the top-notch professionals in its ranks were Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw and many other future stars of the music world. Career In 1933 Richard Himber made his first records, for Vocalion under the name \\"Dick Himber,\\" which intimates always called him. Among the selections was his own theme song, \\"It Isn't Fair,\\" a song he wrote which became a hit. In 1934 after a single session for Victor's budget label Bluebird, he began recording for the full- priced Victor label until 1939. He led one of the most sophisticated \\"sweet\\" dance bands of the era, featuring Joey Nash as his vocalist (1933‚Äì1935), who was replaced by Stuart Allen (1935‚Äì1939). Himber was also a skilled magician, and invented many magic tricks including \\"The Himber Wallet,\\" \\"The Himber Ring,\\" and the \\"Himber Milk Pitcher.\\" In later years, his band act often included an interlude of magic and he conjured on many television shows as well. Himber was the publisher of the R-H Log, a weekly survey of the most popular tunes on radio and television. To the annoyance of most music publishers, he refused to accept payola. He once ordered his secretary to phone every major publisher and tell them he had a stroke, to which many of them joyfully replied, \\"It's about time.\\" Other popular tunes that Himber composed were \\"Moments in the Moonlight,\\" \\"After the Rain,\\" \\"Monday in Manhattan,\\" \\"Haunting Memories,\\" \\"Time Will Tell,\\" \\"Am I Asking Too Much,\\" and \\"I'm Getting Nowhere Fast with You.\\" In 1957 he wrote a TV theme for NBC's Tonight! America After Dark when Jack Lescoulie was the interim host‚Äîbefore Jack Paar took over. In the late 1930s Himber's band was featured in short- subject films produced in New York by Paramount Pictures and Himber was also the maestro for New York's annual Harvest Moon Ball. Sense of humor Himber, always known for his sense of humor, took careful notice of the gimmicks and arrangements employed by his fellow bandleaders, and then satirized them. Today Himber is perhaps best known among swing-music enthusiasts for his 1938 series, \\"Parade of Bands.\\" This six-sided record set offers surprisingly accurate imitations of then-popular bands and singers, including lampoons of his former employees Goodman, Dorsey, and Shaw, as well as Guy Lombardo, Larry Clinton, Ted Lewis, Count Basie, and other \\"name\\" bandleaders. Although he is now remembered primarily for his musical legacy, his contemporaries recall his incessant practical joking. The employees of Toots Shor's 51st Street Chophouse in New York City, which he frequented, lived in fear of him, as he constantly engaged in the act of \\"butter snapping\\" (artfully placing a pat of butter in the center of a napkin, so that when thrown upward, it would adhere to the ceiling) and \\"bread crumbing\\" (rolling bread into hard pellets and tossing them at female restaurant patrons, so that the bread would hit them at the neckline and then descend into their bosom). Famous celebrity victims of Himber's pranks included Ben Blue, the chanteuse Hildegarde and Charles Laughton. At home, Himber would boast of his cooking skills, and when his wife asked for veal cutlets, he breaded the inner sole of a shoe. Fond of the grand gesture, Himber could be as generous as he was unpredictable. A wearer of brightly patterned sportcoats, he once complained that a friend's coat was too loud and promptly tore out the back seam. Before the astonished friend could object, Himber steered him into a clothier's shop where an exact copy of the coat was waiting - paid for ahead of time by Himber himself. A portly yet youthful-looking man with flaming red hair, Himber frequently lied about his age, giving birth dates of 1902, 1904, 1907, and 1909 at various times. He married only in his forties, to prominent model Nina McDougall, with whom he had a son. Their acrimonious divorce was the talk of New York tabloids a decade later. Among Himber's novel promotions was a traveling bandstand on a flatbed truck, sponsored by Pepsi-Cola. The orchestra used it for free outdoor concerts in the New York City area in the 1960s. It was during one of these concerts in 1966 that Himber suffered a heart attack, dying several hours later.

It was organized on June 15 with William Robinson Jr. as president, and construction began on July 4, 1849. The first section, from Allegheny City west to New Brighton, opened July 30, 1851. Extensions opened to New Galilee on October 22 and Enon Valley November 19. On November 27, 1851, a section between Salem and Alliance, Ohio, was completed, not yet connected to the rest. On December 8, the east section was extended west to East Palestine, Ohio, with a stagecoach transfer provided for through travel. Further sections opened January 3, 1852, west to Columbiana, and on January 6 the gap between Columbiana and Salem was filled. In conjunction with the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad, connecting at Alliance, a through line was provided between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. On March 11, 1852, an extension west to Massillon was opened with an excursion. On August 10, 1852, a further extension from Massillon west to Wooster opened. The line west to Mansfield was finished April 8, 1853, and the full line to Crestline opened April 11.

On July 26, 1856, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Rail Road was formed as a consolidation of the Fort Wayne and Chicago, Ohio and Indiana, and Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroads. Extensions opened west to Warsaw September 28, Plymouth November 10, Englewood, Illinois (south of Chicago) on November 29, 1858, and Van Buren Street in Chicago on December 25, 1858. On January 1, 1859, trains started running to Chicago, with a terminal at the future location of Union Station. The part west of Plymouth was built with rails removed from the New Portage Railroad. From the early days, the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) had been involved with the project, supplying funds. Once the Fort Wayne Railroad Bridge at Pittsburgh was finished in 1857, trains began to run through from Philadelphia. In 1858 the PFW&C; began using the first Union Station in Pittsburgh, shared with the PRR. On July 1, 1859, the PFW&C; defaulted on its debts, and was sold at foreclosure on October 24, 1861. It was reorganized as the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway February 26, 1862. On July 1, 1865, the PFW&C; leased the New Castle and Beaver Valley Railroad, giving it a branch from Homewood, Pennsylvania north to New Castle. The Lawrence Railroad, branching west from Lawrence Junction on the NC&BV; to Youngstown, Ohio, was leased on June 27, 1869. On June 1, 1887, the Lawrence Railroad became part of the Youngstown, Lawrence and Pittsburgh Railroad, which on August 1 merged into the PRR's Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railroad, and on January 9, 1906, that merged with the New Castle and Beaver Valley to form the Pittsburgh, Youngstown and Ashtabula Railway, still leased to the PRR. The PFW&C; bought the Cleveland, Zanesville and Cincinnati Railroad by deed on July 1, 1865, making it its Akron Branch. The line ran from Hudson, Ohio, on the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad south through Akron, crossing the PFW&C; at Orrville and continuing to Millersburg. In 1868 a short 3.5 mile (5.5 km) extension to the south was built, and on November 4, 1869, the PFW&C; sold the line to the Pittsburgh, Mt. Vernon, Columbus and London Railroad. That company later became part of the PRR's Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway. On May 22, 1869, the PFW&C; leased the Massillon and Cleveland Railroad, giving it a short branch from Massillon north to the Akron Branch at Clinton. On July 1, 1869, the PRR leased the PFW&C; and began operating it directly, but on April 1, 1871, the PFW&C; was transferred to the newly formed Pennsylvania Company. On December 1, 1871, the Pennsylvania Company leased the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad. Since January 25, 1860, the C&P; had been operated jointly by itself and by the PFW&C;, providing a branch of the PFW&C; from Rochester, Pennsylvania, west and north, crossing the PFW&C; at Alliance, Ohio, and continuing to Cleveland. Operation was transferred back to the Pennsylvania Railroad from the Pennsylvania Company on January 1, 1918. ca. 1874 Pennsylvania Railroad map, including the PFW&C; On February 1, 1968, the PRR was merged into Penn Central. The PFW&C; stayed separate, filing for bankruptcy on July 14, 1973, over three years after Penn Central's 1970 bankruptcy. On April 1, 1976, the PFW&C; became part of Conrail. Conrail downgraded the line, preferring other parallel lines. On June 2, 1994, the Norfolk Southern Railway bought 18 miles (29 km) from Gary to Valparaiso, which had been out of service since 1991, for $1.4 million. They soon bought 61 more miles (98 km), from Valparaiso east to Warsaw, and acquired trackage rights east to Fort Wayne. With the August 22, 1998, breakup of Conrail, the line was split at Crestline, Ohio. West of Crestline, including the section that had been owned by Norfolk Southern since 1994, went to CSX Transportation, along with the intersecting Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway (better known as the Big Four, a part of the New York Central Railroad system until 1968). Tracks east of Crestline went to Norfolk Southern, which also obtained trackage rights west of that Ohio city. At the western end of the route, the original PFW&C; line has been abandoned from Buffington (an area of far northwestern Gary, Indiana, abutting East Chicago) northwest for a little over four miles to Whiting, Indiana; at both of these locations there are connections to the parallel tracks of the old Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (New York Central Railroad). Northwest of Whiting, the LS&MS; itself disappears, and the present-day line goes back to using the old PFW&C; tracks, which run the rest of the way into Chicago, carrying both Norfolk Southern freight trains and several Amtrak passenger services. On August 1, 2004, the Chicago Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad, a new short line owned by RailAmerica, leased the western part of the line, from Crestline, Ohio, west to the Gary, Indiana, neighborhood of Tolleston, from CSX. It also obtained overhead trackage rights along the formerly out-of-service line from Tolleston, at the junction with the old Michigan Central Railroad (now CSX), northwest to Clarke Junction (also in Gary, just north of the Gary-Chicago International Airport), and then west along the former Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (now CSX) to Blue Island, Illinois. Norfolk Southern continues to own the line east of Crestline, Ohio, as well as the part west of Whiting, IN.

Boon and Mike Watt (of The Minutemen) and longtime friend and associate Martin Tamburovich. They were inspired by the example of their friends in southern California band Black Flag who had earlier formed SST Records. The existence of SST led Watt to understand, according to a 1987 interview he gave to Musician magazine, how easy it was to get a record made: \\"All you had to do was pay the record plant man.\\" The label's first release was the 1980 various-artist compilation Cracks in the Sidewalk, which included tracks by the Minutemen, Black Flag, and Saccharine Trust. Other early releases on New Alliance included H√ºsker D√º's first album Land Speed Record and the Minutemen's second-ever release, the seven-inch EP Joy. Eventually the label grew to nurture the early career of the Descendents, issue additional compilation albums (Chunks and Mighty Feeble), and release other recordings by the Minutemen (The Politics of Time), Secret Hate (Vegetables Dancing), and H√ºsker D√º (the In a Free Land EP). The label also showcased a number of post- punk bands from the South Bay area of southern California, notably Slovenly, Phantom Opera, and Invisiblechains. After D. Boon's car-accident death in 1985 and the increasingly busier schedule of Watt's post-Minutemen band Firehose, Watt and Tamburovich sold New Alliance to SST in 1987. Greg Ginn, SST's owner and Black Flag's guitarist, proceeded to transfer all of the Minutemen and Descendents back catalog and H√ºsker D√º's Land Speed Record to SST and turned New Alliance into a subsidiary label of SST that concentrated on more adventurous and non-mainstream records, including jazz, instrumental, poetry, and spoken-word releases. New Alliance also released the debut single of Ciccone Youth and material from The Coachmen, both of which were Sonic Youth- related projects. New Alliance ceased its operations in 1998 in order to save money. Its back-catalog has been deleted, its releases are no longer available through SST Records, and there is no mention of the label or its artists on SST's website. Label co-founder Tamburovich died of a bacterial infection in 2003. Rapp Records founder Rad Ramsey & Martin Tamburovich reactivated New Alliance in 2000 as a Rapp Records sublabel. It also brought back its back- catalog. This time it was specialized for Rap, Rock & Reissuing its old material. However, in 2006, SST filed a case against Rapp & forced Ramsey to close down New Alliance.

() was one of the largest banks in the Philippines, being the third-largest bank in terms of assets. It was the largest bank before it was overtaken by Metrobank in 1995. It is the result of the merger of Equitable Banking Corporation and Philippine Commercial International Bank or PCIBank. It was known for a wide range of services from savings to insurance and, through its wholly owned subsidiary Equitable Card Network, was the largest Philippine credit card issuer. The bank merged with Banco de Oro Universal Bank in early 2007, and is now branded as BDO as its new identity as part of the new Banco de Oro Unibank, Inc. Equitable PCI Bank history The shares of the Lopez and Gokongwei families were sold to the SSS and GSIS, which acquired 78% of PCI Bank shares that were bought by the Go-Led Equitable Banking Corporation. They merged in 1999 and were approved by the Bangko Sentral and other agencies that had created the third largest Philippine bank, with Equitable as the survivor of the merger. The name Equitable PCI Bank was adopted. Head offices at the former PCI Bank Towers I and II were renamed to the Equitable PCI Bank Towers I and II, and the Equitable Banking Corporation Binondo Center and at the Equitable Banking Corporation Tower, also in Makati. The bank played an important role in the impeachment trial of the former president Joseph Estrada. The bank produced fifteen witnesses (along with nine banks: Citibank, Philippine Savings Bank, Bank of the Philippine Islands, Security Bank, Land Bank of the Philippines, Urban Bank, Export and Industry Bank, Asia United Bank and Keppel Bank) to prove that the 'Jose Velarde' account was owned by Estrada (which also invested on the merger of the Equitable Banking Corporation and then the Lopez-Gokongwei led Philippine Commercial International Bank). On August 5, 2005, the SM Group of Companies and Banco de Oro Universal Bank announced that they have purchased a 24.76% stake of Equitable PCI from the Go family (Equitable Banking Corporation), the family that founded the bank, along with a 10% stake in Equitable CardNetwork. Subsequent acquisitions by Banco de Oro enabled it to gain a 34% share in the bank. On January 6, 2006, Banco de Oro Universal Bank submitted a merger offer to the bank, with Banco de Oro as the surviving entity. Under the proposed offer, Banco de Oro would swap 1.6 of its shares for every 1 share of Equitable-PCI (The merger occurred, but BDO Shareholders were to swap 1.8 BDO shares for every EPCI share). As a second option, Banco de Oro also offered to base the swap ratio on the book values of both banks to be assessed by an independent accounting firm using international accounting standards. With the success of this merger, Banco de Oro became the second largest bank, with assets of P613 billion, after the current industry leader, Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, with assets of more than P641.5 billion. The merger demoted the Bank of the Philippine Islands to third place, with P582 billion in assets. BDO has since surpassed Metrobank in asset, loan and deposit sizes to become the largest lender in the Philippines. =Equitable Bank history= On June 17, 1950, Equitable Banking Corporation was founded by Go Kim Pahhttp://www.gokimpahfoundation.com/story.htm as the first commercial bank in the Philippines, licensed by the newly formed Central Bank of the Philippines (now Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas). Other commercial banks like Bank of the Philippine Islands were formed and licensed during the Spanish or American regimes. However, it was not until 1955 that Equitable opened its first branch in Divisoria. In 1958, Equitable established the only direct telex service between the Philippines and Japan at the time, with initial messages exchanged between Equitable and Chase Manhattan Bank of Tokyo. On August 15, 1963, Equitable established its first branch outside the Philippines in Hong Kong and only International Branch, the first time a Philippine bank opened a branch in the city. Two years later, on March 26, 1965, Equitable opened its first provincial branch in Cebu City. By 1972, Equitable emerged as the country's premier bank. In 1989, Equitable turned its credit card department into a wholly owned subsidiary, Equitable CardNetwork. With three other banks, namely Far East Bank and Trust Company (since merged with BPI), Philippine National Bank and United Coconut Planters Bank, it formed Megalink, then the Philippines' largest ATM network. On July 27, 1996, Equitable Savings Bank was established as Equitable's savings bank arm. Equitable listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange on April 3, 1997, and in 1999. In 1977, the bank received its foreign currency license from the BSP and in 1980, issued its first credit cards under the VISA (credit card) and Visa brand. In 1987, Equitable became a universal bank and was appointed the clearing house of the Makati Stock Exchange, now the Philippine Stock Exchange. PCIBank history PCIBank has a diverse and unique history. It was established in July 1938 as the Philippine Commercial Industrial Bank, with its head office in Dasmarinas Street, Binondo Manila. In 1966 it moved its head office to the corner of T.M. Kalaw and A. Mabini Streets (building now demolished). In 1976, it merged with the Philippine Bank of Commerce and Merchants Banking Corporation, creating then the largest branch network. The 1980s was a very significant decade in the bank; in 1982 it officially decided to adopt the history of the Philippine Bank of Commerce, resulting in it becoming the first Filipino-owned private commercial bank in the country. It established its ExpressPadala Center in Ermita, and pioneered the remittance business in the country. In 1983, it decided to change the \\"I\\" in PCIBank from \\"Industrial\\" to \\"International\\", to reflect the wide foreign office network of the bank. In 1985, it merged with the Insular Bank of Asia and America. In 1987, John Gokongwei bought shares in the bank, becoming the second largest stockholder. He appointed Rafael Buenaventura to head PCIBank as President and CEO. PCI Bank has won a string of \\"Bank of the Year\\" awards from the editors of Euromoney and Asiamoney. The bank has also been cited for its export financing, specialized lending and consumer finance activities by the Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation, the Development Bank of the Philippines, and the Home Insurance and Guaranty Corporation. Addressing the various needs of its customers, PCI Bank set up subsidiaries to provide services ranging from leasing, investment banking and stock market transactions to credit cards, consumer loans, insurance, and overseas remittances. The 1980s proved hard for the Lopezes because all of their businesses were seized by President Marcos. To this day The Romualdez-Lopez dispute case still remains at court. Also in the 1980s, when Gokongwei entered PCIBank, he also owned Far East Bank and Trust Co, and talks of a merger surfaced which would have created the largest bank in the Philippines. In 1991, PCIBank formed BancNet along with Security Bank, Chinabank, RCBC, Allied Bank (merged with PNB), Metrobank, International Corporate Bank (now part of UnionBank) and Citytrust Savings Bank. BancNet was also the brainchild of one of PCIBank's senior officers, Ramon Arceo, Jr., the Senior Vice President. The PCIBank Group also had three companies/subsidiaries listed at the Philippine Stock Exchange, namely the mother bank itself (PSE:PCI); Bankard, now an affiliate of RCBC (PSE:BKD); and PCI Leasing and Finance (PSE:PCIL), now named BDO Leasing and Finance (PSE:BLFI).

Marienfeld at dusk after the vigil with the Pope - Final Saturday night of World Youth Day 2005 Marienfeld is a large (2.6 km¬≤ / 640 acres) grassy field on the reclaimed site of a former open-pit lignite mine about south-west of Cologne Cathedral in the city of Cologne, Germany, straddling the towns of Frechen and Kerpen. The mine area was named Marienfeld (German: Mary's Field) and landscaped in order to serve as the site of the Catholic Church's 20th World Youth Day in 2005. Overview Preparations for the World Youth Day began in September 2004. A 10-m (33-ft) Pope Hill (German: Papsth√ºgel) was constructed since April 2005, so Pope Benedict XVI could be visible amidst an estimated 1 to 2 million visitors when he presided over the festival's concluding Sunday Mass on August 21, 2005. An altar was built at the top of the hill, which was christened the Mountain of the 70 Nations by Cardinal Meisner, because little pieces of earth were brought from church delegates of 70 different countries. The hill was built by Bilfinger Berger AG, which poured over 80,000 m3 (2.8 million cu. ft) of earth carried in around 200 trucks per day. The name Marienfeld is derived from a Piet√† sculpted in 1420 from French limestone that has been a destination for pilgrims seeking to venerate the Virgin Mary for centuries. The sculpture has moved numerous times. It was first placed in a chapel at a location around 1 km from the present Marienfeld, then near the town of Grefrath. It was moved in 1730 by the nuns from the nearby convent of Bottenbroich to the parish church of Bottenbroich, the Church of the Assumption of Mary (St. Maria Himmelfahrt), an old church (built between 1479 and 1484) located in part of what is now Marienfeld. In 1948, the church was demolished, partly due to heavy damage sustained during World War II and partly as part of the resettlement of the town of Bottenbroich to make way for an open-pit lignite mine being opened on the site. The parishes of Bottenbroich and Grefrath were combined, and the Piet√† was moved to a new parish church in Grefrath, built in 1949. However, Grefrath itself was gradually resettled between 1952 and 1965 to make way for the expansion of the lignite mine, so the Piet√† was moved again in 1963 to its present location at the parish church of Frechen-Grefrath (2 km from Marienfeld), where it remains on display. The area used for the World Youth day celebrations should not be confused with the town of Marienfeld in the Gutersloh district of Germany, where the Portugal national football team stayed and used as a training area during the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

The Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company was incorporated on 1 August 1849 by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Company Act 1849 (12 & 13 Vict. c.83) of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It had a share capital of 50,000 pounds. On 21 August 1847 it entered into a formal contract with the East India Company for the construction and operation of a railway line, 56 km long, to form part of a trunk line connecting Bombay with Khandesh and Berar and generally with the other presidencies of India.Rao, M.A. (1988). Indian Railways, New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15 The Court of Directors of the East India Company appointed James John Berkeley as Chief Resident Engineer and Charles Buchanan Ker and Robert Wilfred Graham as his assistants. It was India's first passenger railway, the original 21 miles (33.8 km) section opening in 1853, between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tanna (Thane). On 1 July 1925 its management was taken over by the Government. On 5 November 1951 it was incorporated into the Central Railway. Incorporation in London Incorporated as a company in 1849, with its head office in London, the Great Indian Peninsula railway was initially proposed for a length of 1300 miles, to connect Bombay with the interior of the Indian peninsula and to Madras(Chennai) major port on the east coast. It was originally meant to connect the towns of Poona (Pune), Nassuek (Nashik), Aurungabad (Aurangabad), Ahmednuggur (Ahmednagar), Sholapoor (Solapur), Nagpur, Oomrawutty (Amravati), and Hyderabad. It was meant for the purpose of increasing the export of cotton, silk, opium, sugar and spices. The management committee consisted of 25 British men, including officials of the East India company and banks in London, most of whom resided in Britain and some who had resided in India. The original 25 person board consisted of: people such as John Stuart Wortley and W.J Hamilton (both M.P.s from Britain who became the company's chairman and Deputy chairman), Frederick Ayrton (ex- East India Company), Cavalrymen such as Major Clayton and Major-General Briggs, Bombay residents John Graham, Col. Dickenson and Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy , bankers such as John Harvey (Commercial Bank of London) and S. Jervis (Director of the London and County Bank, Lombard Street), and Directors of other railway companies such as Richard Paterson (Chairman of the Northern and Eastern Railway Company) and Melvil Wilson (Director of the Alliance Assurance Office). Railways around Bombay On 16 April 1853 at 3:35 pm, the first passenger train of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway left Boree Bunder station in Bombay (present day Mumbai) for Tanna (present day Thane). The train took fifty-seven minutes to reach Tanna.Rao, M.A. (1988). Indian Railways, New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.17 It covered a distance of 21 miles (33.8 km). Three locomotives named Sultan, Sindh and Sahib pulled the 14 carriages carrying 400 passengers on board. The portion of the line from Tanna to Callian (present day Kalyan) was opened on 1 May 1854. The construction of this portion was difficult as it involved two-line viaducts over the estuary (see picture on right) and two tunnels. On 12 May 1856 the line was extended to Campoolie (present day Khopoli) via Padusdhurree (present day Palasdhari) and on 14 June 1858 Khandala-Poona (present day Pune) section was opened to traffic. The Padusdhurree-Khandala section involved the difficult crossing of the Bhore Ghat (present day Bhor Ghat) and it took another five years for completion. During this period, the 21 km gap was covered by palanquin, pony or cart through the village of Campoolie. The Kassarah (present day Kasara) line was opened on 1 January 1861 and the steep Thull ghat (present day Thal Ghat) section up to Egutpoora (present day Igatpuri) was opened on 1 January 1865 and thus completed the crossing of the Sahyadri. Bombay to Madras Beyond Callian, the south-east main line proceeded over Bhor Ghat to Poona, Sholapore (present day Solapur) and Raichore (present day Raichur), where it joined the Madras Railway. By 1868, route kilometerage was 888 km and by 1870, route kilometerage was 2,388.Rao, M.A. (1988). Indian Railways, New Delhi: National Book Trust, pp.17-8 Bombay to Calcutta Beyond Callian, the north- east main line proceeded over the Thull ghat to Bhosawal (present day Bhusawal). From Bhosawal, there was a bifurcation. One passed through great cotton district of Oomravuttee (present day Amravati) and was extended up to Nagpore (present day Nagpur) and then to Raj-nandgaon in Drug district (Present day Durg). The other was extended up to Jubbulpore (present day Jabalpur) to connect with the Allahabad-Jubbulpore branch line of the East Indian Railway which had been opened in June 1867. Hence it became possible to travel directly from Bombay to Calcutta. The Howrah-Allahabad-Mumbai line was officially opened on 7 March 1870 and it was part of the inspiration for French writer Jules Verne's book Around the World in Eighty Days. Although, in the novel it is erroneously claimed that the line passes through Aurangabad, which is, again erroneously claimed as the capital of the Emperor Aurangzeb Alamgeer. At that time period, line had not reached Aurangabad but rather moved northward after reaching Bhusawal towards Jabalpur. At the opening ceremony, the Viceroy Lord Mayo concluded that ‚Äúit was thought desirable that, if possible, at the earliest possible moment, the whole country should be covered with a network of lines in a uniform system‚Äù.

Along with the Brafferton and President's House, these buildings form the College's Ancient Campus. With a construction history dating to 1695, it is the oldest academic building in continuous use in the United States. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Construction of the first building on this site began August 8, 1695 and was completed by 1700. After several fires and rebuildings, the Wren Building was the first major building restored or reconstructed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr., after he and the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin began Colonial Williamsburg's restoration in the late 1920s. The building's current state dates to the 20th-century restoration by Boston architects Perry Shaw & Hepburn. The College named the building in honor of the English architect Sir Christopher Wren, after the Reverend Hugh Jones, a William and Mary mathematics professor, wrote in 1724 that the College Building was \\"modeled by Sir Christopher Wren\\". However, it is unknown how Jones came to this conclusion, since there are no actual documents tying Sir Christopher Wren to the design of the building; he never even visited North America.https://www.amazon.com/So-good-design-colonial- background/dp/B00B0K3GPK Perry Shaw and Hepburn's restoration reflects the building's historic appearance from its reconstruction in 1716 after a 1705 fire to 1859, when it burned again. The building is constructed out of red brick in the style of Flemish and English Bond, as was typical for official buildings in 17th- and 18th-century Williamsburg, including several walls remaining from previous structures, and it contains classrooms, offices, a refectory (known as the Great Hall), kitchen, and a chapel (added as a south wing in 1732). The crypt beneath the chapel is the resting place of several notable Virginians, including royal governor Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt, Speaker of the House of Burgesses Sir John Randolph, and his son Peyton Randolph, the first President of the Continental Congress. On the top of the building is a weather vane with the number 1693, the year the College was founded. In the early 1770s, plans were drawn up to complete the building as a quadrangle. Alumnus Thomas Jefferson (class of 1762) drew up a floorplan submitted to Governor Dunmore and foundations were laid in 1774. The looming War of Independence halted further construction, however, and the fourth wing was never completed. The foundations, however, still exist. The first and second floors of the building are still open for public viewing. Guided tours of the Wren Building are offered whenever classes are in-session by the Spotswood Society, named after the influential Virginia governor, Alexander Spotswood. Guests are welcome to learn more about the Spotswood Society and the Wren Building during their virtual tour.

The Wren Building, previously known simply as \\"The College\\" or \\"The Main Building\\" was effectively the school's only academic building until the completion of the Brafferton building and President's House in the 1720s and 1730s. The campus only began its westward expansion in the first part of the twentieth century. Students studied, attended religious services, and lived in the Wren Building. After the destruction of Virginia's former capital of Jamestown, Virginia's legislature met in the building's Great Hall as a temporary meeting place from 1700 to 1704 while the Capitol was under construction. In fact, the College was critical to Williamsburg becoming the new capital of Virginia after William & Mary students made speeches on May 1, 1699 from the College Building about how they would help build the town to its full potential. When the Capitol burned in 1747, the legislature moved back into the building until the Capitol was reconstructed in 1754. The building also housed a grammar school and an Indian school, which was moved to the Brafferton building, in 1723. The building was used as a military hospital by the French during the American Revolutionary War and by the Confederacy during the American Civil War. The Wren Building today has historical and ceremonial importance in addition to its academic use. Each year during the opening convocation ceremony, incoming William and Mary freshmen enter the building from the courtyard, pass through the central hall, and exit on the opposite side. As seniors, students pass through the building in the opposite direction on their way to the graduation ceremony. The Yule Log Ceremony, the College's holiday celebration, is held every year at the Wren Building, typically during the second weekend in December. Each fall incoming freshmen take the school's Honor Code Pledge in the building's Great Hall.Cameron, Gabi. \\"Class of 2009 Arrives for Orientation.\\" Dog Street Journal. article The DoG Street Journal, printed August 23, 2005. Retrieved April 23, 2008. The Bishop James Madison Society, the College's second-oldest secret society, is rumored to meet in the Wren Building. Historic setting Earliest known drawing of the building by Swiss traveler Fran√ßois-Louis Michel, 1702 After the completion of the President's House and the added chapel wing in 1732, the College's layout and overall architectural organization changed little until the construction of additional academic buildings in the early-twentieth century. For nearly one hundred and fifty years, the campus consisted of the three buildings- the Wren Building, the Brafferton, and the President's House- proportionally arranged in the College yard. With the Wren Building (or \\"College\\" as it was called) placed in the middle and bounded by the Brafferton to the south and the President's House to the north, the view gave visitors a sense of balance and proportion, important tenets of the Enlightenment and visible in Jacobean, Anglo-Dutch, and Georgian architecture of the period. To complete the view, a formal geometric garden of hedge rows, topiaries, planting beds, and marl paths was laid out in the College yard facing Duke of Gloucester Street, and a botanical and scientific garden was laid in the back, which led to acres of woodlands and streams. Archaeological and historical evidence points to the formal garden in the front having been destroyed by the late-eighteenth century. Plans drawn up by French engineers of Williamsburg in 1782 show plain rectangular beds ornamenting the front, and later nineteenth-century engravings and photographs show rows of trees and even cows lounging in the College yard. Any remaining physical trace of the gardens were finally obliterated in 1862, when massive earthworks were built during the Siege of Williamsburg. However, it is worth noting that the Brafferton Building was most likely facing the opposite way and was therefore excluded from this garden area. The \\"Bodleian Plate\\", ca. 1747, was used during the restoration of the Wren Building (top row and middle of center row) in the early 20th century. Recorded descriptions of the grounds appearance are few. One possible view was discovered in the late-1920s when researchers discovered a ca. 1747 printing plate in England's Bodleian Library depicting Williamsburg landmarks, including the College. Although this \\"Bodleian Plate\\" served as the blueprint for the Wren Building's restoration in the 1920s and 1930s, little was known about the plate's authenticity with regard to the gardens until College archaeologists and students began digging for evidence in 2005. Since these initial archaeological discoveries, the Bodleian plate has proved remarkably faithful in its depiction of the College yard's early garden layout. Although the two side structures are not entirely balanced (there is a slight size discrepancy between the Brafferton and President's House), the sight of the College would have been impressive for an 18th-century Virginian. Native- and foreign-born visitors alike marveled at the College's design. Fires Italianate towers The building has been gutted by fire three times (1705, 1859, and 1862). The first fire was accidental and began in a basement in the North Wing of the building in 1705. Reconstruction after this fire, commanded by Governor Alexander Spotswood, was completed by 1716 with partial funds from Queen Anne. A second fire ravaged the building in 1859, and when it was rebuilt, the Wren Building had a newly fashionable Italianate design. A third fire was set intentionally by Federal troops during the Civil War in 1862. Each reconstruction incorporated the surviving exterior walls, but the overall look of the building has varied considerably over time. Sir John Randolph, a Speaker of the House of Burgesses, an Attorney General for the Colony of Virginia, and the youngest son of William Randolph and Mary Isham, was interred at the chapel of the Wren Building after his death in 1737. After the burial vaults were disturbed in the 1859 fire, a physician who examined the contents of Randolph's tomb discovered the bones of Randolph and an unknown second person. Botetourt statue The Statue of Lord Botetourt that stands in front of the building. Popular Virginia Governor Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt, better known as Lord Botetourt, who died in office in 1770 and had been a member of the College's Board of Visitors, was buried in the crypt under the building's chapel. A statue of Lord Botetourt was acquired by William and Mary in 1797 and moved to the campus from the former Capitol building in 1801. Previously displayed in the piazza of the Capitol Building at the opposite end of Duke of Gloucester Street, the statue was a landmark in front of the building for several centuries. After years of weathering, it was removed in 1958 and in 1966 was placed in its new location inside the College's Swem Library. In 1993, as the College celebrated its Tercentenary (300th anniversary), a new statue of Lord Botetourt, created in bronze by William and Mary alumnus Gordon Kray, was installed in the College Yard, in the place occupied for so many years by the original.The College of William & Mary Priorities of the College The plaque A large plaque was presented by the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities in 1914 which lists some of the notable firsts for William and Mary: *First college in the United States, the claim being that its antecedents go back to the college proposed at Henrico (1619). *First American college to receive its charter from the Crown under the Seal of the Privy Council, in 1693.

At the , Wyalkatchem had a population of 498.Australian Bureau of Statistics (2018 Census) The town won the state tidy town award in 2000 and 2002 and then won the national award in 2003. History Wyalkatchem is an Aboriginal name first recorded for a waterhole spelt Walkatching in the 1870s. The spelling Walcatching was used in 1881 when the Toodyay Road Board referred to a tank to be built there, and when the road from Northam to the Yilgarn Goldfield was surveyed in 1892 the spelling Wyalcatchem was used for the tank. The Walkatching spelling is probably the most accurate, as Aboriginal names in this region rarely end in em. The change of spelling from Wyalcatchem to Wyalkatchem in 1911 was done by the Department of Lands & Surveys according to rules the Department had adopted for spelling Aboriginal names. The meaning of the name is not known. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. When the extension of the railway east from Dowerin was planned in 1908 land was set aside for a future townsite in the area of Wyalcatchem Tank. The route of the railway and site for a station was not fixed until 1910, and action followed to then fix the position of the townsite and survey town lots. Following the survey of the lots the townsite was gazetted spelt Wyalkatchem in 1911. When the railway from Dowerin opened in February 1911, Wyalkatchem was a minor siding only, but its importance grew when it was selected as the turnout point for a branch line leading north and then east to the Mount Marshall district. Thus a small village quickly blossomed on the town site. The branch line to Bencubbin opened on 1 February 1915 and the line from Dowerin was extended to Merredin in August, 1911.All Change at Wyalkatchem Milne, Rod Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, July 1991 pp 155‚Äì162 A bioblitz was conducted in 2012 in a bush reserve between Korrelocking and Wyalkatchem. 54 people took part and collected samples of scorpions, pseudoscorpions, isopods, spiders and centipedes, including some new species. Commercial area The extensive railway barracks in town are leased by the shire council from the Western Australian Governments Railway Commission. The barracks represent one of the few intact examples of its kind in Australia and are currently used as accommodation during Dowerin Field Days and as the headquarters of a hang- gliding club. Home to a Cooperative Bulk Handling receival point that can hold nearly 120,000 tonnes of grain and crops, the primary industry in the area are wheat and sheep farming. The town also supports a gypsum mine that is situated just outside town at Lake Cowcowing. In 2013 Wyalkatchem hosted the inaugural Racewarshttp://racewars.com.au event, organised by The Racewars Group. The event saw 200 competitors and over 3000 spectators witness some of Western Australia's fastest vehicles race head-to-head and against the clock on the 1500m airstrip at the Wyalkatchem airport. After the success of the inaugural event, Wyalkatchem has agreed to host the event for another 5 years.

She was a prisoner during the Holocaust at Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where she died from starvation. Biography Early life = Edith was the youngest of four children, having been born into a German Jewish family in Aachen, Germany. Her father, Abraham Holl√§nder (1860-1928) was a successful businessman in industrial equipment who was prominent in the Aachen Jewish community together with Edith's mother, Rosa Stern (1866‚Äì1942). The ancestors of the Holl√§nder family lived in Amsterdam at the start of the 18th century, emigrating from the Netherlands to Germany around 1800. Edith's last name, Holl√§nder, is German for \\"Dutchman\\" (literally: \\"Hollander\\").Edith Frank- Holl√§nder, Anne's mother, Anne Frank House Edith had two older brothers, Julius and Walter, and an older sister, Bettina. Bettina died at the age of 16 due to appendicitis when Edith was just 14. Both Julius and Walter made it to the United States, surviving afterwards. The Holl√§nder family adhered to Jewish dietary laws and was considered to be religious. Nevertheless, Edith attended the Evangelical Higher Girls‚Äô School and passed her school-leaving exams (Abitur) in 1916. Afterwards, she worked for the family company. In her free time, she read copiously, played tennis, went swimming and had a large circle of friends. =Family= She met Otto Frank in 1924 and they married on his 36th birthday, 12 May 1925, at Aachen's synagogue. They had two daughters born in Frankfurt, Margot, born 16 February 1926, followed by Anne, born 12 June 1929. =Immigration= The rise of antisemitism and the introduction of discriminatory laws in Germany forced the family to emigrate to Amsterdam in 1933, where Otto established a branch of his spice and pectin distribution company. Edith found emigration to the Netherlands difficult. The family lived in confined conditions and she struggled with the new language. She remained in contact with her family and friends in Germany, but also made new friends in Amsterdam, most of them fellow German refugees. Edith was an open-minded woman who educated her daughters in a modern way. Her older brothers Walter (1897‚Äì1968) and Julius (1894‚Äì1967) escaped to the United States after 1938, and Rosa Holl√§nder-Stern left Aachen in 1939 to join the Frank family in Amsterdam, where she died in January 1942. Anne Frank's cousin Bernhard (\\"Buddy\\") Elias has said that \\"Edith never felt well in Holland. Edith was German, and she missed Germany. She did not learn Dutch very well. She did not feel at home in Amsterdam.\\". IMG Entertainment. Originally broadcast on BBC in 1996. =Persecution and death= A Stolperstein for Frank at the Pastorplatz in Aachen, Germany In 1940, the Nazis invaded the Netherlands and began their persecution of the country's Jews. Edith's children were removed from their schools, and her husband had to turn over his business to his Dutch colleagues Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler, who helped the family when they went into hiding at the company premises in 1942. The two-year period the Frank family spent in hiding with four other people (their neighbours Hermann van Pels, his wife Auguste Van Pels and his son Peter Van Pels, and Miep Gies's dentist Fritz Pfeffer) was famously chronicled in Anne Frank's posthumously published diary. In her diary, the adolescent Anne frequently writes about the disagreements, conflicts, mutual lack of understanding, and the pessimism of her mother, which she wants to disassociate herself from. However, she repeatedly also describes her mother as an understanding and loyal woman who stands up for her daughters and protects them against verbal attacks from the other inhabitants. The diary ended three days before they were anonymously betrayed and arrested on 4 August 1944. After detainment in the Gestapo headquarters on the Euterpestraat and three days in prison on the Amstelveenweg, Edith and those with whom she had been in hiding were transported to the Westerbork concentration camp. From there, they were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp on 3 September 1944, on the last train to be dispatched from Westerbork to Auschwitz. Edith and her daughters were separated from Otto upon arrival, and they never saw him again. Edith looked for ways of keeping her children alive. Survivors later described them as an inseparable trio. On 30 October, another selection separated Edith from Anne and Margot. Edith was selected for the gas chambers, and her daughters were transported to Bergen-Belsen. Edith escaped with a friend to another section of the camp, where she remained through the winter. While here she hid every scrap of food she got and saved it for her daughters. Because she refused to eat any of the food she was saving for her daughters, she died from starvation on 6 January 1945, three weeks before the Red Army liberated the camp and 10 days before her 45th birthday. Her daughters outlived her by one month. Her daughter's diary  When Otto Frank decided to edit his daughter's diary for publication, he was sure that his wife had come in for particular criticism because of her often difficult relationship with Anne, and he deleted some of the more heated comments out of respect for his wife and other residents of the Secret Annex. Nevertheless, Anne's portrait of an unsympathetic and sarcastic mother was duplicated in the dramatizations of the book. Anne's portrayal of her mother was countered by the memories of those who had known her as a modest, distant woman who tried to treat her adolescent children as her equals. In 1999, the discovery of previously unknown pages excised by Otto showed that Anne had discerned that, although Edith very much loved Otto, Otto ‚Äî though very devoted to Edith ‚Äî was not in love with her; and that this understanding was leading Anne to develop a new sense of empathy for her mother's situation. By the time Edith and her daughters were in Auschwitz, Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Auschwitz survivor interviewed by Willy Lindwer in The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank (page 129), observed that \\"they were always together, mother and daughters. It is certain that they gave each other a great deal of support. All the things a teenager might think of her mother were no longer of any significance.\\" After their arrest and transfer to camp Westerbork the relationship between Anne and her mother improved as can be seen from a letter sent by Otto Frank to his cousin Milly on 16 November 1945: Further reading  * The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition, Anne Frank, edited by David Barnouw and Gerrold Van der Stroom, translated by Arnold J.

Remains labeled \\"Milliarium Aureum\\" in the Roman Forum The Milliarium Aureum (; ), also known by the translation Golden Milestone, was a monument, probably of marble or gilded bronze, erected by the Emperor Caesar Augustus near the Temple of Saturn in the central Forum of Ancient Rome. All roads were considered to begin at this monument and all distances in the Roman Empire were measured relative to it.Cassius Dio 54.8.4; Plutarch, Galba 24.7; Pliny, Naturalis Historia 3.66; Tacitus, Historiae 1.27; Suetonius, Otho 6.2. On it perhaps were listed all the major cities in the empire and distances to them,No direct ancient evidence seems to support this interpretation: Z. Mari, 'Miliarium Aureum', in E. M. Steinby (ed.) Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae (1996) vol. 3, pp. 250-251 (Italian). ; 'Miliarium Aureum,' in L. Haselberger (ed.) Mapping Augustan Rome p. 167. though the monument's precise location and inscription remain matters of debate among historians. According to Philip Schaff,Schaff, P. (1867/1886). Ante-nicene fathers: The Apostolic fathers, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus [Roberts, A. & Donaldson, J, Eds]. [Electronic reprint] Grand Rapids, MI, USA: CCEL. 1886, v.1 p. 1 the phrase \\"all roads lead to Rome\\" is a reference to the Milliarium Aureum‚Äîthe specific point to which all roads were said to lead. A marble structure speculated to be the base of the milestone is present in the Roman Forum. History Augustus, as curator viarum, erected the monument in 20 BCE.Cassius Dio, Historiae Romanae, 54.8.4 It probably received the name Milliarium Aureum soon after its inauguration. It symbolized the starting point of the Roman road system to the rest of Italy and to all the imperial possessions. Architecture and style The plan of the monument is among those missing from the recovered fragments of the Forma Urbis. The remaining fragments for this area of the Roman Forum are all in the so-called slab V-11, Stanford University #19 (Temple of Saturn with the frontal section and staircase, but the Rostra section is missing, Temple of Concordia, and Temple of the Deified Vespasian). Information from ancient authors is also very scarce, so there are many problems of interpretation concerning the exact nature of the Milliarium Aureum. =Location= It is certain that it was \\"hard by [under] the Temple of Saturn at the head of the Roman Forum\\", but its exact location is still unknown. Due to archaeological data from excavations by K√§hler in 1959, which seem to confirm data from excavations by Bunsen in 1833, many scholars now believe that it was located at the southeast corner of the podium of the Rostra Augusti on a symmetrical axis with the Umbilicus Urbis Romae.H. K√§hler, Das Funfs√§ulendenkmal f√ºr die Tetrarchen auf dem Forum Romanum [Cologne 1964], 23, 58-59B. Frischer, D. Favro and D. Abernathy, University of California Los Angeles, 2005 =Style, structure, and dimensions= The Milliarium Aureum seems to have been a marble column sheathed in gilded bronze; according to C. H√ºlsen, a huge marble cylinder was found in 1835 near the Temple of Saturn and it still had bronze hooks. The whole monument likely had the standard form of a Roman milestone. Some scholars think that the Milliarium Aureum was made entirely of gilded bronze, while others believe only the inscribed letters were gilded bronze.R.A. Staccioli, La Roma di Augusto, Novara 1985 Probable dimensions for the structure include a height of , and a diameter of (column only) or if including the alleged base (i.e. the carved marble fragments labeled \\"Milliarium Aureum\\" in the Roman Forum). =The problem of the inscription= Ancient sources never directly say what was inscribed on the Milliarium Aureum, so every idea one may have about the inscription must be considered a modern inference based on the typical form, structure and function of Roman milestones. The main hypotheses about the inscription suggest that it included: * Nothing, except for the name and title of the Emperor. * The names of the most important cities of Italy and of the Roman Empire in 20 BCE, with the distances of these from Rome.C. H√ºlsen, Bretschneider and Regenberg, 1904 According to a vague sentence by Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia, 3.66), the distances in Roman miles were measured starting from the city gates and not from the location of the Milliarium (thus with a difference of ca. 1 mile): Via Appia from Porta Capena (to Brundisium, Greece and the Oriental Provinces); Via Salaria and Via Nomentana from Porta Collina and Via Flaminia (to Northern Italy, Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and Illyricum); Via Aurelia (to the Galliae and Hispaniae); Via Ostiensis (to Ostia and the main harbours of Corsica and Sardinia, Sicilia and Africa). * The names of the roads out of Rome and the men of praetorian rank Augustus had made curatores viarum to see to their upkeep,L. Richardson, 1992 based on Cassius Dio's account of the erection of the monument. =The problem of the marble fragments labeled \\"Milliarium Aureum\\"= The ca. 3-m diameter marble fragments labeled \\"Milliarium Aureum\\" with an anthemion frieze decoration have long been considered part of the base of the monument. However, there is no direct evidence for this, considering as well that the diameter of this base seems to be too large for a standard milliarium. According to Richardson, the ruins labeled \\"Milliarium Aureum\\" can be considered pertinent only if the column of the monument was of a colossal scale, of almost 3 m diameter and not 1.15 m: > Still less credible is that the carved stone members labelled Milliarium > Aureum at the northwest end of the Forum Romanum today actually belonged to > the base of that monument. The frieze decorated with an anthemion belongs > relatively high on a building, and both elements are of a diameter equal to > that of the Umbilicus Romae, too large for a milestone, unless it were of > colossal scale.L.

The film stars Sergei Bodrov Jr. as Danila Bagrov, a young Russian ex-conscript. It appeared in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. After its release on VHS in June 1997, Brother unexpectedly became one of the most commercially successful Russian films of the 1990s and quickly rose to cult film status throughout Russia. Due to the film's popularity and fan demand, a sequel, Brother 2, was released in 2000. Brother 2 is notable for having a significantly higher budget, placing more emphasis on action sequences, and being set in Moscow and Chicago. Plot In the autumn of 1997, Danila Bagrov (Sergei Bodrov Jr.) returns to his small hometown of Priozersk following his demobilization from the Russian Army after the First Chechen War. On his way home, he ends up in a fight with security guards, after he accidentally walks onto the set of a music video for the band Nautilus Pompilius. He is arrested and brought to the local militsiya precinct. The officer in charge releases Danila on the condition that he will find another job within a week. After Danila arrives home his mother, very concerned for Danila, insists that he go to St. Petersburg to meet up with his successful older brother Viktor and ask for his help. Danila travels to St. Petersburg, but his attempts to make contact with Viktor are unsuccessful. Instead, he wanders around the city. He befriends Kat (Mariya Zhukova), an energetic drug addict, and \\"The German\\" Hoffman (Yury Kuznetsov), a homeless street vendor whom Danila helps after a thug attempts to extort him. Unbeknown to their mother, Viktor (Viktor Sukhorukov) is an accomplished hitman who goes by the street name \\"The Tatar\\" but is growing too independent and is starting to irritate his mob boss \\"Roundhead\\" (Sergei Murzin). His latest target is \\"The Chechen,\\" a Chechen mafia boss who was recently released from prison and now runs a market. Roundhead, who is unhappy with the amount of money that Viktor demanded for the hit, orders his thugs to watch him in secret. Danila eventually manages to find Viktor in his apartment. To avoid exposure, Viktor passes his assignment to his brother, gives him money to settle into the city, and then lies to him that the Chechen has been extorting from him, and asks Danila to perform the hit. Danila asks the German to find him a room in a communal flat in the city center. He then makes a makeshift silencer out of a plastic soda bottle and an oil filter, as well as a decoy firecracker out of a matchbox. Finally, he follows the Chechen and, despite the latter's security, takes him out without being spotted. As Danila makes his exit, Roundhead's thugs spot him and chase him. Making his escape, Danila jumps into a freight tram and, despite being wounded in the abdomen, manages to kill one of the pursuing thugs. The tram driver, a woman named Sveta (Svetlana Pismichenko), helps Danila escape. Danila later recovers and meets up with Sveta. Despite Sveta being married, the two begin an affair. With the money given to him by Viktor after the hit, he begins to enjoy St. Petersburg, gives his provincial image a makeover, goes to a concert with Sveta, and manages to scare away her husband. He meets up with Kat to go to a nightclub and then smokes cannabis in an afterparty. The night ends with him sleeping with Kat. Meanwhile, Roundhead is angry about losing one of his men and the fact that Viktor used someone else to carry out the hit. He decides to draw him into a combined raid. Once again Viktor, suspecting a trap, passes the job to Danila. The two thugs raid the apartment, but their main target is away. While they wait, in an apartment on the floor above, a party is taking place with several well-known Russian rock musicians. A young radio director, Stepan (Andrey Fedortsov) mistakes the raided flat for the party flat and is almost killed by the thugs, who take him captive. Vyacheslav Butusov, the lead singer of Nautilus Pompilius, makes the same mistake, but Danila instead follows Butusov to the party above and relaxes in the friendly musical atmosphere. After spending time at the party, he comes back downstairs and finds that the thugs have just killed their primary target, and are about to do the same with Stepan. Instead, Danila kills both thugs. Danila and Stepan drag the corpses to the Smolensky Lutheran Cemetery, where the German helps Danila dispose of the bodies. Roundhead is furious upon finding out what happened. Instead of going after Viktor, he decides to track Danila and intercepts Sveta's tram. They later raid her apartment, where his men beat and rape her, and learn his phone number, as well as his address. A henchman nicknamed \\"Mole\\" ambushes Danila near his apartment building, but Danila manages to kill Mole. Realizing that staying home is unsafe, he travels to Sveta's house and is shocked at her state. He learns that Roundhead was responsible and realizes that the only way they could have tracked Sveta was when he returned a phone call from her home telephone to his brother. At the same time, Roundhead raids Viktor's apartment and forces him to call Danila at gunpoint, so that he comes to pick up his payment. Realizing the depth of the situation, Danila goes back to the communal room that he was renting, buys a shotgun from his landlord, converts it into a sawed-off shotgun, and replaces the duck-hunting pellets with nailheads. At Viktor's apartment, he takes out Roundhead and two of his henchmen and tells the surviving thug to warn the rest of the gang that he will kill anyone who hurts his brother. In reply, the thug tells him that it was Viktor who turned him in (which Danila already suspected.) Danila forgives his brother, gives him some of the money from Roundhead's suitcase, and then tells him to return home and to work for the militsiya. Danila decides to go to Moscow. He visits Sveta, intending to take her with him, but her husband has returned and is beating her, demanding to know where Danila is. Seeing Danila, he challenges him to a fight, but before he can come closer, Danila fires a shot into his leg. Sveta rushes to her husband and begins to treat his wound. Danila urges her to leave with him, but she tells him to get out and never come back. He then meets up with the German, converses with him about the influence of the city on its residents, saying that everyone is weak here, to which the German replies that the city is an evil force that drains the strength from those who enter it. Danila offers him money, but the German declines, saying \\"What's good for the Russian is death for the German.\\" Before he leaves the city, he finds Kat to say goodbye. She is indifferent to his departure, but he gives her money nonetheless. The last scene of the film shows Danila walking out of a snow- covered forest. He hitches a ride to Moscow on a passing truck. As he chats with the driver, the final shot is of the winter road stretching far into the wilderness.

The actors worked for little to no pay, and due to the low budget, they wore their own clothes on set throughout most of the film. Some clothing was bought second-hand at flea markets, such as Danila's sweater that he wears throughout most of the film. Most of the film was shot in St. Petersburg, on Vasilyevsky Island. The first six minutes of the film were set in Danila's hometown, which was filmed in Priozersk, with the scene where Danila walks onto a film set taking place outside the walls of Korela Fortress. Svetlana Pismichenko, for her role as Sveta, learned how to operate a tram. During the filming of the scene where Sveta's husband, Pavel, is shot in the leg by Danila, the actor, Vladimir Yermilov, was wounded in the leg due to an accident with the pyrotechnics. Before the filming of the last scene, where Danila hitchhikes on a truck, the crew realized that none of the actors knew how to operate a truck. Because of this, Sergei Astakhov, the film's camera operator, played a brief role as the truck driver. The film was released on VHS in June 1997 and premiered on television on 12 December 1997.  Sequel  After the success of the film, Alexey Balabanov began writing a script for two sequels. Brother 2 was supposed to take place in Moscow, and Brother 3 in America.

History The area of Lavello was settled in prehistoric times, as attested by findings of an Iron Age village. The town originated as a Daunian and then Roman settlement, known as Forentum. It was already an important stronghold during the Lombard rule in southern Italy, and here was killed Sicard of Benevento (839). Lavello was an important Byzantine center and a bishopric seat from 1025. Starting from 1043 Lavello was one of the twelve baronies of the Norman county of Apulia in southern Italy. The Normans rebuilt the cathedral and added a line of walls. The fortress was strengthened under their successors, the Hohenstaufen. Here King Conrad IV of Germany died in 1254. As a result of its participation in the anti-Angevine revolt in 1268, it was burnt down by Charles I of Anjou in 1298.

Categories of punishment During the Edo period, Japan used various punishments against criminals. These can be categorized as follows: * Death penalty * Incarceration and Exile * Penal labor * Confiscation of property * Corporal punishment = Death penalty = Serious crimes such as murder and arson were punished by death. The shogunate maintained execution grounds for Edo at Kozukappara, Suzugamori, and Itabashi. Kozukappara, also known as Kotsukappara or Kozukahara, is currently located near the southwest exit of Tokyo's Minami-Senju Station. It is estimated that between 100,000 and 200,000 people were executed here. Only part of the site remains, located next to Emmeiji temple, partly buried under the rail tracks and under a more-recent burial ground. Archaeological and morphological research was done by Tokyo University on the skulls found buried here which confirmed the execution methods. Another notable one was located at Suzugamori in Shinagawa. Both sites are still sparsely commemorated in situ with memorial plaques and tombstones. The shogunate executed criminals in various ways: * Boiling * Burning * Crucifixion for killing a parent, husband etc. * Decapitation by sword * Hanging * Sawing * Waist-cutting (cutting the person in half). The Kanazawa han coupled this with decapitation. The death penalty often carried collateral punishments. One was parading the criminal around town prior to execution. A similar one was public display of the criminal prior to execution. A third was public display of the severed head. Samurai were often sentenced to commit seppuku in lieu of these forms of punishment. Seppuku is a term of suicide for the samurai. = Incarceration and exile = Depending on the severity of the crime, magistrates could sentence convicts to incarceration in various forms: * Exile to an island. Criminals in Edo were often confined on Hachij≈çjima or Miyakejima. Criminals so punished received tattoos. * Imprisonment. The government of Edo maintained a jail at Kodenma- ch≈ç. Exclusion from the location of the crime was a penalty for both commoners and samurai. * Tokoro-barai, banishment to a certain distance, was common for non-samurai. * K≈çfu kinban, assignment to the post of K≈çfu in the mountains west of Edo, is an example of rustication of samurai. = Penal labor = For crimes requiring moderate punishment, convicts could be sent to work at labor camps such as the one on Ishikawa-jima in Edo Bay. More serious acts could result in being sent to work in the gold mine on the island of Sado. In 1590, Hideyoshi had banned \\"unfree labor\\" or slavery; but forms of contract and indentured labor persisted alongside the period penal codes' forced labor. For example, the Edo period penal laws prescribed \\"non-free labor\\" for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the Got≈çke reij≈ç (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 Got≈çke reij≈ç was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.Lewis, James Bryant. (2003). Frontier Contact Between Choson Korea and Tokugawa Japan, p. 31‚Äì32. It was also common for female convicts to be sentenced to serve terms working as slaves and prostitutes in walled Red Light Districts, most notably Yoshiwara. = Confiscation = A penalty that targeted merchants especially was kessh≈ç, the confiscation of a business. = Corporal punishment = Handcuffing allowed the government to punish a criminal while he was under house arrest. Depending on the severity of the crime, the sentence might last 30, 50, or 100 days. Flagellation was a common penalty for crimes such as theft and fighting. Amputation of the nose or ears replaced flogging as penalty early in the Edo period. The 8th Sh≈çgun of Edo, Tokugawa Yoshimune introduced judicial Flogging Penalty, or tataki, in 1720. A convicted criminal could be sentenced to a maximum of 100 lashes. Samurai and priests were exempt from flogging, and the penalty was applied only to commoners. The convict was stripped of all outer clothing and struck about the buttocks and back. The flogging penalty was used until 1867, though it fell out of favor from 1747 to 1795 intermittently. Both men and women could be sentenced to a flogging, though during one segment of the mid-Edo period, women were imprisoned rather than flogged.Nawa Yumio \\"Torture and Penalty in Japan\\" Origin of flogging penalty In 757 A.D., the Chinese-influenced Yoro Ritsuryo (È§äËÄÅÂæã‰ª§) legal system was enacted and introduced Five Judicial Penalties (‰∫îÂàë). Two of the Five Judicial Penalties involved Flogging. Light Flogging provided for 10 to 50 lashes, while Heavy Flogging stipulated 60 to 100 strokes. However, a slave could be sentenced to up a maximum of 200 lashes. These flogging penalties only applied to male commoners. Convicts of the nobility, along with female commoners, might be sentenced to the imposition of handcuffs or a fine. When a convicted criminal was flogged, half the number of lashes were typically applied to the back, half to the buttocks. At times, if the convict's request to change the lash target was sanctioned then the lashes would be applied only to the back or to the buttocks. By the Age of Warring States, flogging had been largely replaced by decapitation.Im Myung-Su \\"Torture and Punishment in Edo period\\" See also Kozukappara execution grounds NotesReferences * Lewis, James Bryant.

Following the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, sanjaks became cities and on December 20, 1924, Kƒ±rk Kilise's name was changed to Kƒ±rklareli, meaning The Place of the Forties. The denomination Kƒ±rklareli was already used years before 1924, for example in the contemporary literature concerning the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13. The Bulgarian name of the town is Lozengrad (–õ–æ–∑–µ–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥) which means Vineyard Town. (see also its other names) History Siege of Lozengrad (now Kƒ±rklareli), in the Balkan Wars. Kƒ±rklareli Museum Culture and Tourism Office in Kƒ±rklareli, Turkey Ongoing archeological excavations in the city support the claim that the area was the location of one of the first organized settlements on the European continent, with artifacts from the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. The settlement and its surrounding areas were conquered by the Persians in 513‚Äì512 BC, during the reign of King Darius I. In 914 during the Bulgarian invasion in Adrianople led by Simeon I, the settlement was captured by the Bulgarians and was under Bulgarian rule until 1003 when it was lost to the Byzantines. The Ottoman Turks took the city and its region from the Byzantines in 1363, during the reign of Sultan Murad I. The city was damaged during the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1829). According to the 1878 record \\"Ethnography of the Wilayahs Adrianopol, Monastir and Thessaloniki\\" Kƒ±rk Kilise was inhabited by 6,700 Bulgarians, 2,850 Greeks, and 2,700 belonging to other ethnic groups.‚Äû–ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –û–¥—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ. –°—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ—Ç–æ –æ—Ç 1873 –≥.‚Äú –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –Ω–∞—É—á–µ–Ω –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1995, —Å—Ç—Ä. 33. According to the official Ottoman census of 1906‚Äì1907 (published in \\"The Ottoman Population 1830‚Äì1914: Demographic and Social Characteristics\\" by Kemal H. Karpat), the ethnic-religious breakdown in the Sanjak of Kƒ±rk Kilise was: 22,022 Muslims; 14,154 Greek Orthodox; 1,599 Bulgarian Orthodox; and 789 Jews.Kemal H. Karpat: Osmanlƒ± N√ºfusu (1830‚Äì1914). Istanbul, 2003. During the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913) Kƒ±rk Kilise was occupied by Bulgaria, and then by Greece in the aftermath of World War I (1914‚Äì1918) resulting in mass immigration of Bulgarian population (there were a large number of journalists who reported on the actions at Kƒ±rk Kilise). Following the Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì1923) the city was retaken by the Turks on November 10, 1922. According to the 1923 population exchange agreement between Greece and Turkey, the Greeks of the city were exchanged for the Muslims (Turks, Pomaks, Karadjaovalides and Albanians) living in Greece. Most of the inhabitants of the city are Turks who formerly lived in Thessaloniki until the First Balkan War of 1912. The Treaty of Lausanne (1923) which defines Turkey's western border in Thrace also defined the western boundaries of the Kƒ±rklareli Province. =The Megleno-Romanians of Kƒ±rklareli= Governor's Office in Kƒ±rklareli, Turkey In 1923 most of the 3700 inhabitants of Notia, the only Muslim village of the Megleno-Romanians in northern Greece, settled in the Odrin area (mainly in Kƒ±rklareli) and became known as KaradjovalidesThede Kahl, \\"The Islamisation of the Meglen Vlachs (Megleno-Rumen): The Village of N√¢nti (N√≥tia) and the N√¢ntinets in Present-Day Turkey\\".

He played for both Warwickshire and England. A right- handed batsman, Amiss was a stroke maker particularly through extra cover and midwicket ‚Äì his two favourite areas to score runs. He was an accomplished batsman in all forms of the game. He averaged 42.86 in first-class, 35.06 in List-A, 46.30 in Tests and 47.72 in One Day Internationals. In first-class cricket he scored 102 centuries, and his England record amassed over 50 Tests ranks him with the best England has produced. After retiring as a player in 1987, he served Warwickshire as Chairman of the Cricket Committee, and he followed David Heath as chief executive from 1994 until 2006. In 1992 he was selected as an England selector. In November 2007 he became the deputy chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board; in August 2011, The Daily Telegraph described his role on the board as providing \\"cricketing knowledge and expertise [that] complemented Clarke‚Äôs business skills.\\" Early years Amiss was born at Harborne in Birmingham. He suffered a serious back injury whilst playing football in his teenage years, which entailed him starting each day of his sporting life undergoing stretching routines to loosen up.  England career  Amiss made his Test debut for England in the fifth Test of the 1966 series with West Indies, and he proved an accomplished Test match batsman. He was one of the first batsmen to use a protective helmet. In scoring 3,612 Test runs, Amiss made eleven half-centuries and eleven centuries, including two double centuries against the West Indies. His highest Test match score, also his highest first-class score, was 262 not out against the West Indies in the 1973‚Äì74 Kingston Test, an innings that saved the Test match for England after they conceded a first innings lead of 230. The next highest score in England's innings was 38. After being dropped by England in 1975, he made a successful return against the West Indies at the Oval in the final Test of 1976, although his 203 in the first innings did not prevent England losing the match. Amiss's last Test came in 1977 when he was left out to make way for Geoff Boycott's return from self-imposed exile. His former Warwickshire teammate, Jack Bannister, stated \\"Dennis was always tinkering with his game, he was a bigger perfectionist than Colin Cowdrey\\". Amiss was also a handy One Day International batsman scoring 859 runs, including four centuries and one half-century, with a top score of 137 against India which is still England's fourth highest individual score in the Cricket World Cup, behind the 158 scored by Andrew Strauss against India in 2011, Jason Roy's 153 against Bangladesh in 2019, and Eoin Morgan's 148 against Afghanistan at the same tournament. He has the distinction of scoring the first ever One Day International century (103 in only the second One Day International on 24 August 1972) which is also the first instance of a debutant scoring a century in ODI. Amiss along with Keith Fletcher is also credited to have shared the first ever partnership of hundred runs in the same match. He ended with an ODI batting average of 47.72, which excepting those players to have played fewer than five times, remains the highest of any England batsman who has completed his career. The still-active Kevin Pietersen averaged over 50 throughout the first 60 matches of his ODI career up until September 2007, but that figure had fallen to under 41 by June 2011. Amiss played World Series Cricket in the late 1970s in Australia; during the 1978 World Series Cricket tournament, he became the first player to wear a batting helmet regularly. Amiss was banned from Test cricket for three years for taking part in the first 'rebel' tour of South Africa in 1982. Honours Amiss was selected as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1975. Amiss was awarded an MBE in 1988; in 2007 he received a Doctor of the University from the University of Birmingham. A graph of Dennis Amiss's Test performances. Records Dennis Amiss is the first player in ODI cricket to have scored a century on both his debut and in his last match, the only other being Desmond Haynes. On 7 June 1975 at Lord's in the first match of the Prudential World Cup (which was also the very first Cricket World Cup to have been held) Amiss smashed 137 runs in just 147 balls against India powered by 18 boundaries. His innings provided enough leverage for England to post a very imposing and improbable target of 335 for India to be chased down within a span of 60 overs. It was also the first time that a team would score 300 or more runs in an ODI match. The match also featured the infamous and notorious ODI innings of Sunil Gavaskar who in reply to the nearly unreachable target set by England scored an unbeaten 36 in 174 balls with just one boundary to adorn his innings.

But even before then, there had been a stronghold with a small settlement around it. In the 16th and 17th century there were many ponds but they were later dried during the German colonization and during the reign of Joseph II in 1782 they were turned into arable and given to settlers, mainly to the German ones. In 1806 the Crown Prince passed through Moravany, later known as the emperor Ferdinand V. The settlers solicited designation of a priest and the building of a rectory although the foundation of a new church had been laid down in 1782 after the old one had burned to the ground. The rectory was then built in 1808. There were 2 bells in the steeple until the 1816 when one of them was taken away for military purposes. The church as it stands now was built in the 1920s in the place of the burned church. =School= Local children walked to school in Slepotice until 1808 when a school was established in Moravany along with the new church. In the school year of 1852‚Äì1853 it was attended by 125 pupils. It had two classrooms and a cabinet, it was made from wood and it miraculously survived every fire that was raging nearby. The new school was built after the old one was no longer satisfactory and it was opened in 1879. After many reconstructions and alterations it still serves its purpose. The construction of another school building, serving as a place for the 5th‚Äì9th grades, started in 1994 and was finished in 1995, starting with education immediately.http://www.obec- moravany.cz/index.php/historie-obce/item/15-pohled-do-historie-moravany.html Sights The main sights of Moravany are Duhov√Ω Pond and the Church of SS.

Loosely based upon William Brashler's 1973 novel of the same name, it starred Billy Dee Williams, James Earl Jones and Richard Pryor. Directed by John Badham, the movie was produced by Berry Gordy for Motown Productions and Rob Cohen for Universal Pictures, and released by Universal on July 16, 1976. The film was a box office success, grossing $33 million on a $9 million budget. Plot Tired of being treated like a slave by team owner Sallison Potter, charismatic star pitcher Bingo Long steals a bunch of Negro League players away from their teams, including catcher/slugger Leon Carter and Charlie Snow, a player forever scheming to break into the segregated Major League Baseball of the 1930s by masquerading as first a Cuban (\\"Carlos Nevada\\"), then a Native American (\\"Chief Takahoma\\"). They take to the road, barnstorming through small Midwestern towns, playing the local teams to make ends meet. One of the opposing players, \\"Esquire\\" Joe Calloway, is so good that they recruit him. Bingo's team becomes so outlandishly entertaining and successful, it begins to cut into the attendance of the established Negro League teams. Finally, Bingo's nemesis Potter is forced to propose a winner- take-all game: if Bingo's team can beat a bunch of all-stars, it can join the league, but if it loses, the players will return to their old teams. Potter has two of his goons kidnap Leon prior to the game as insurance, but he escapes and is key to his side's victory. As it turns out, there is a Major League scout in the audience. After the game, he offers Esquire Joe the chance to break the color barrier; with Bingo's blessing, he accepts. Leon glumly foresees the decline of the Negro League as more players follow Esquire Joe's lead, but Bingo, ever the optimist, cheers him up by describing the wild promotional stunts he intends to stage to bring in the paying customers.

Badham grew up in Birmingham, Alabama, and was familiar with the Birmingham Black Barons, who shared Rickwood Field with the white Birmingham Barons.Badham, John (November 19, 2009) \\"John Badham on 'The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings'.\\" Trailers from Hell! ‚Äì accessed July 30, 2010 Bingo Long is based on former Black Baron Leroy \\"Satchel\\" Paige. Early in his career, Paige would call in his outfield while leading in the ninth inning against an amateur or semi-pro team and strike out the side. Bingo did a similar stunt in this movie. Leon Carter is a Josh Gibson-like power hitter, even playing the same position (catcher). \\"Esquire\\" Joe Calloway is an amalgam of another Black Baron, Willie Mays (in personality, talent, and fielding position) and Jackie Robinson (as being signed by a white team at the film's end). The Bingo Long Traveling All- Stars & Motor Kings were loosely based on the Indianapolis Clowns and other barnstorming Negro baseball teams, who likewise engaged in Harlem Globetrotters-like clowning routines. Production Luther Williams Field in Macon, Georgia, was used for filming as the Negro League ballpark. Luther Williams Field was home to the Macon Music, a minor league team in the independent South Coast League. Additional ballpark scenes were shot at Morgan Field in Macon, a Pony and Colt League Youth Baseball field, Grayson Stadium in Savannah, Georgia, home of the Savannah Sand Gnats of the Class A South Atlantic League, and Wallace Field in Crawford County, Georgia. Exterior scenes set in St. Louis residential neighborhoods were also filmed in Savannah. Scenes set in rural communities were filmed in Talbotton, Georgia, and various small towns around Macon, including Monticello, Georgia. Some ballplayers were played by actual former athletes, including former members of the Indianapolis Clowns, who performed various stunts shown in the film. Steven Spielberg originally wanted to have a hand in producing the movie until the success of his film Jaws got his full attention. Reception The film received positive reviews, but several critics thought it could have been better. Roger Ebert wrote that \\"'Bingo Long' is fun, it's pleasant to watch, but it cakewalks too much on its way to the box office.\\" Jay Cocks agreed in his Time magazine review, stating \\"Although it never fulfills the richest possibilities in the raffish misadventures of a barnstorming black baseball team of the 1930s, it does come close from time to time.\\" The movie holds an 87% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 critics. Accolades The film was nominated for the American Film Institute's 2008 AFI's 10 Top 10 in the sports film category.

From the text it could be inferred that the woman had been raped but this is something Beckett was very clear about when asked. \\"How could you think of such a thing! No, no, not at all‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt that at all.\\"Bair, D., Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), p 664 It seems more likely that she has suffered some kind of collapse, possibly even her death,Higgins, A., Samuel Beckett Special Issue of Irish University Review: A Journal of Irish Studies, Vol. 14, No. 1, Spring 1984 while \\"wandering in a field ‚Ä¶ looking aimlessly for cowslips.\\" The woman relates four incidents from her life: lying face down in the grass, standing in a supermarket, sitting on a \\"mound in Croker's Acre\\" (a real place in Ireland near Leopardstown racecourse) and \\"that time at court\\", each being preceded by a repeat on the repressed first ‚Äòscene‚Äô which has been likened to an epiphany; whatever happened to her in that field in April was the trigger for her to start talking. Her initial reaction to the paralyzing event is to assume she is being punished by God but finds she is not suffering; she feels no pain, as in life she felt no pleasure. She cannot think why she might be being punished but accepts that God does not need a \\"particular reason\\" for what He does. She thinks she has something to confess and believes that if she goes over the events of her life for long enough it will be revealed to her. In addition to the continued buzzing in her skull there is now a light of varying intensity tormenting her; the two seem related. The title comes from the character's repeated denial that the events she describes or alludes to happened to her. Mouth Beckett had always intended that Billie Whitelaw, whom he had worked with on Play, give the definitive premiere performance of Not I. \\"But in the end, more out of friendship than because of any delays in London, he allowed Alan Schneider the opportunity to present it first\\"Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 591 in America featuring Jessica Tandy. Tandy did fly to France to discuss the text with Beckett. However, Whitelaw‚Äôs subsequent performances benefited from extensive coaching from Beckett. \\"I knew that woman in Ireland,\\" Beckett said, \\"I knew who she was ‚Äî not 'she' specifically, one single woman, but there were so many of those old crones, stumbling down the lanes, in the ditches, besides the hedgerows.\\"Tarn A., quoted in Bair, D., Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), p 662 That said, Beckett did not demand that the part be spoken with an accent, his one concession to Whitelaw when tutoring her. Schneider put ten questions to Beckett, indicative of his bafflement. Beckett responded: \\"I no more know where she is or why thus than she does. All I know is in the text. 'She' is purely a stage entity, part of a stage image and purveyor of a stage text. The rest is Ibsen.\\"Ackerley, C. J. and Gontarski, S. E., (Eds.) The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett, (London: Faber and Faber, 2006), p 411 Objective meaning does seem to have been of secondary consideration in the writing style. As Beckett indicated to Tandy he hoped that the piece would \\"work on the nerves of the audience, not its intellect.\\"Beckett to Jessica Tandy. Quoted in Brater, E., 'The I in Beckett's Not I', Twentieth Century Literature, 20, No 3, July 1974, p 200 Beckett told Tandy to consider the mouth \\"an organ of emission, without intellect\\"Bair, D., Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), p 665 and \\"during rehearsals [with Whitelaw] he would say, 'Too much colour, too much colour', which she correctly interpreted as 'For God‚Äôs sake, don‚Äôt act'.\\"Cronin, A., Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist (London: Flamingo, 1997), p 551 The visual image of the mouth was, according to Beckett in a letter postmarked 30 April 1974, suggested by The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio) in Valletta Cathedral.Brater E., 'Dada, Surrealism and the Genesis of Not I' in Modern Drama 18 (Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1975), p 50 Auditor The published stage directions also call for a character of indeterminate sex referred to as 'the Auditor' (generally played by a male) who wears a black robe and can be dimly seen stage left. When Beckett came to be involved in staging the play, he found that he was unable to place the Auditor in a stage position that pleased him, and consequently allowed the character to be omitted from those productions. However, he chose not to cut the character from the published script, and whether or not the character is used in production seems to be at the discretion of individual producers. As he wrote to two American directors in 1986: \\"He is very difficult to stage (light-- position) and may well be of more harm than good. For me the play needs him but I can do without him. I have never seen him function effectively.\\"Gontarski, S.E., Revising Himself: Performance as Text in Samuel Beckett's Theatre, Journal of Modern Literature 22.1 In the 1978 Paris production he did reinstate the character but from then on abandoned the image concluding, as he had once said, that it was perhaps \\"an error of the creative imagination.\\"SB to JK, 19 Jan 1975, recounted in Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 617 It has been suggested that the image of the Auditor was inspired by the image of a djellaba-clad \\"intense listener\\" seen from a caf√© in Tunis; Beckett was in Morocco for a month from February to March 1972.Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 589 James Knowlson conjectures that this \\"figure coalesced with [Beckett‚Äôs] sharp memories of the Caravaggio painting\\" mentioned above. In this painting there \\"is an old woman standing to Salome's left. She observes the decapitation with horror, covering her ears rather than her eyes\\"Letter to J. Knowlson. Quoted in Knowlson, J. and Pilling, J., Frescoes of the Skull (London: John Calder, 1979), p 195 a gesture that Beckett added in the 1978 Paris production. When Schneider questioned him as to whether the Auditor was Death or a guardian angel, Beckett shrugged his shoulders, lifted his arms and let them fall to his sides, leaving the ambiguity wholly intact.Brater E., 'Dada, Surrealism and the Genesis of Not I' in Modern Drama 18 (Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1975), p 57 Significant productions 22 November 1972 = Forum Theatre, Lincoln Center, New York, directed by Alan Schneider, with Jessica Tandy (Mouth) and Henderson Forsythe (Auditor): Various dates have been offered for the first performance of the play from September (quoted in the Faber text) to December 1972. The review in the Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 25, No. 1 (March 1973), pp. 102‚Äì104 states the date as 1 November. The date above however is from Damned to Fame (p. 592) by James Knowlson who was Becket‚Äôs friend for over twenty years and is regarded as an international authority on the man. It is also the date given in The Faber Companion to Samuel Beckett. Jessica Tandy found the experience of acting Not I terrifying. At first she had problems remembering the text and had to rely on a TelePrompTer right in front of her. Because the play was being performed in the round she had to be installed in a box, which could be wheeled on and off the stage. Inside this ‚Äòcontraption‚Äô she stood holding onto two iron bars on either side of the box. She was dressed in black and wore a hood, which made her feel like \\"an old English hangman\\".Quote from Tandy in Bair, D., Samuel Beckett: A Biography (London: Vintage, 1990), p 664 At first her head was held still by a strap but she found it unbearable and unnecessary and asked for it to be removed. They also had an operator hidden in the box to reset the focus on the mouth if it did drift slightly out of the light. Additionally, her teeth were coated with a substance that exaggerated their brightness and then polished to attract the glare. = 16 January 1973 = Royal Court Theatre, London: Initially Billie Whitelaw wanted to stand on a dais but she found this didn‚Äôt work for her so she allowed herself to be strapped in a chair called an ‚Äòartist‚Äôs rest‚Äô on which a film actor wearing armour rests because he cannot sit down. Her entire body was draped in black; her face covered with black gauze with a black transparent slip for her eyes and her head was clamped between two pieces of sponge rubber so that her mouth would remain fixed in the spotlight. Finally a bar was fixed which she could cling to and on to which she could direct her tension. She was unable to use a visual aid and so memorised the text. > \\"Whitelaw has described the ordeal of playing Mouth, how she was totally cut > off from others, high above the stage, clamped, swathed in a black hood, > subject to panic attacks; after the dress rehearsal she was for a time > totally disoriented. Yet this stage experience came to seem her most > meaningful one. She heard in Mouth‚Äôs outpourings her own 'inner scream': 'I > found so much of my self in Not I. Somewhere in there were my entrails under > a microscope.'\\"Whitelaw, B., Billie Whitelaw ‚Ä¶ Who He? Quoted in Worth, K., > 'Sources of Attraction to Beckett‚Äôs Theater' in Oppenheim, L., (Ed.) > Palgrave Advances in Samuel Beckett Studies (London: Palgrave, 2004), p > 211,212 = 17 April 1977 = BBC2, The Lively Arts: Shades, Three Plays by Samuel Beckett: Arguably the definitive performance of the piece albeit in a completely different medium from which it was originally intended. Not I on its own was re-broadcast on 7 February 1990. The British Film Institute database says this is a film of the 1973 Royal Court Theatre performance above but it appears this was actually filmed on 13 February 1975 with Billie Whitelaw reprising the role. In this production the Auditor is absent and the camera stays fixed on her mouth, everything else being blacked out with makeup. A criticism of this interpretation is that the focus shifts from the aural to the visual as the image of Whitelaw‚Äôs mouth dominates the screen and has often been likened to a vagina attempting to give birth to the self. This is a point Beckett himself picked up on when first viewing the video though one to which he raised no objection. = 11 April 1978 = Th√©√¢tre d'Orsay, Paris: Whereas in the French premiere (8 April 1975), Beckett allowed the role of the Auditor to be dropped, in the subsequent performance he both reinstated the position and gave it greater prominence lighting it from above but only at times when Mouth renounces the first person singular. In addition to covering his head with his hands at the end, Beckett also added \\"a gesture of blame\\" to the French version. Both this and the 1975 performance featured Madeleine Renaud. = 27 February 1993 = Performed by Tricia Kelly, directed by Cathy Denford, at West Yorkshire Playhouse. = February 2000 = Beckett on Film, Shepperton Studios: This filmed production, directed by Neil Jordan begins differently from the BBC version in that the viewer sees Julianne Moore come into view, sit down and then the light hit her mouth. Because of this the audience is aware that a young woman as opposed to an \\"old hag\\" is portraying the protagonist. = 9 April 2006 = Beckett Evening, BBC Radio 3: To mark the centenary of Beckett‚Äôs birth, the BBC produced a number of radio programmes including a recording of Not I by Juliet Stevenson who had played the role on stage. Despite the lack of visuals her performance garnered favourable reviews. Of note is the fact that she chose to speak with an accent. = 2005 onwards = Performed by Lisa Dwan, firstly in London's Battersea Arts Centre in 2005. Dwan was interviewed with Billie Whitelaw as part of the Beckett celebrations on BBC Radio 3. Dwan performed the piece again in July 2009 in the Southbank Centre in London in a time of nine minutes and fifty seconds; it usually plays for anything between twelve and fifteen minutes. The performance has since toured around the world, garnering five star reviews. = 28 February 2018 = Touretteshero‚Äôs inclusive presentation of Not I opened at Battersea Arts Centre in February 2018. Jess Thom has claimed Mouth as a disabled character; comparing her experience of Tourette‚Äôs to Mouth‚Äôs experience of not having control over her body and speech (BBC Front Row). The production features integrated British Sign Language (BSL), which is performed by Charmaine Wombwell. This Relaxed Performance asks who is allowed to access theatre and questions the cultural curation of accessible theatre. It will be followed by a TV programme, Me, My Mouth and I, airing on BBC2, as part of the Performance Live strand. Related texts \\"Kilcool\\" = In addition to the woman in the djellaba and the Caravaggio painting already mentioned there is a third source that deserves comment, the so-called \\"Kilcool manuscript\\", a monologue which Beckett worked on ‚Äì and abandoned ‚Äì in 1963. On 28 August 1963, shortly after completing work on Film Beckett began working on a new notebook which included several fragments of writing. There are four separate outlines in the 'Kilcool manuscript' which Stan Gontarski describes as 'episodes'. The extensive analysis by Rosemary Pountey and Stan Gontarski on the manuscript suggests that 'Kilcool' is an early forerunner to what later became the visual and textual themes of Not I. In early drafts a female voice describes a move to Kilcool (which is misspelt - Beckett later amends the mistake). Beckett‚Äôs father had once rented a house in Kilcoole, a small marshy village in Co. Wicklow, Ireland. The first outline describes a monologue spoken by a woman (only the face is visible) who has lost both parents and has moved to Kilcool(e) to live with a 'widowed childless aunt'.Gontarski, Stan. 'From \\"Kilcool\\" to Not I' The Intent of Undoing. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press) 1985. 135 Stage outlines specify a \\"woman's face alone in constant light. Nothing but fixed lit face and speech.\\" throughout the four outlines.Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 814 In later drafts Beckett eliminated almost all naturalistic detail in order to focus on more abstract narrative themes such as memory, compulsive speech and death. = The Unnamable = Asked further about sources for Not I, Beckett referred questioners back to his own novel, The Unnamable with its clamouring voice longing for silence, circular narrative and concern about avoiding the first person pronoun: \\"I shall not say I again, ever again\\".Beckett, S., Trilogy (London: Calder Publications, 1994), p 358 Vivian Mercier in his book Beckett/Beckett goes as far as to suggest that, gender aside, Not I is effectively a dramatisation of The Unnamable. = That Time = On 8 June 1973 Beckett began to imagine the play that came to be That Time which he called later \\"a brother to Not I\\". This play also owes something to the Kilcool Manuscript. In it Beckett returns to the image of a human head ‚Äì of an old man this time ‚Äì illuminated in the darkness and assailed on all sides by three voices ‚Äì all his ‚Äì from earlier in his life. At one point the voice designated as C says \\"did you ever say I to yourself in your life\\"Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 230 ReferencesExternal links *Text of the play *Image of Julianne Moore *BFI database entry: The Lively Arts: Shades *Not I (video), starring and introduced by Billie Whitelaw Category:1972 plays Category:Theatre of the Absurd Category:Plays by Samuel Beckett ","title":"Not I"},{"id":"2502451","text":"Revolver is a 2005 British-French crime thriller film co-written and directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and Andr√© Benjamin. The film centres on a revenge-seeking confidence trickster whose weapon is a universal formula that guarantees victory to its user, when applied to any game or confidence trick. This is the fourth feature film by Ritchie and his third to centre on crime and professional criminals. It was released in UK theatres on 22 September 2005. It performed poorly at the box office and received negative reviews but has gained a small cult following among fans of Ritchie's previous crime films. A reworked version\\"Madonna and Richie push Revolver in US, San Francisco Chronicle, 27 November 2007 was released to a limited number of US theatres on 7 December 2007. Plot Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta) is a gang boss involved in illegal gambling all over the city. With the help of three goons, known as \\"the three Eddies\\", he controls several games that take place in the criminal underground. On one occasion, just before a big game, Macha loses his card man. Having no other options, Macha asks for help from Jake Green (Jason Statham), a card man with a good reputation underground. When Jake refuses, they harass Jake's brother Billy (Andrew Howard) and Billy's family to convince Jake to play. He succumbs and plays the game, which he ends up winning. The loser, a high roller named George, insults Jake's mother and Jake responds by shooting him in the foot, igniting a gunfight in which the game's money vanishes. The police investigation is leading nowhere until Jake's name is mentioned and he is brought in for questioning. Taking precautionary measures, Macha sends the three Eddies to Billy's house where they threaten his niece. Billy's wife reacts poorly in the situation and is accidentally shot. Jake does not give Macha's name to the police, in order to protect Billy and his family, and is sentenced to prison. He is given a choice to either spend 14 years in the general prison population or 7 years in solitary confinement. He chooses the latter. During his seven-year stint imprisoned in solitary confinement, Jake learns of a specific strategy (referred to as \\"The Formula\\") that is supposed to let its user win every game. The Formula itself was discovered by two unnamed men who inhabited adjacent cells on either side of Jake's own. They are referred to as a chess expert and a con man. During the first five years of his seven-year sentence, the three men communicate their thoughts on confidence tricks and chess moves via messages hidden inside library books, such as The Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics. The chess expert and the con man plan to leave their cells simultaneously, and promise to take Jake with them. But when they disappear from their cells, they leave Jake behind to serve the remaining two years of his sentence. When Jake is released, he finds that all of his possessions and money have been taken by the two men with whom he had shared everything. Still, he has The Formula, and he goes about making a lot of money at various casinos. Two years later, Jake has garnered a reputation that leads many casinos to fear his freakishly good 'luck', and he is blacklisted by many casinos. The Formula applies to any game, and is often exemplified by Jake's apparent mastery of chess. Approximately two years after his prison release, Jake, Billy and their other brother Joe walk into one of Macha's casinos. He is recognised and \\"all the tables are closed\\" to Jake and his company. But Macha promptly calls them up to a private area of his casino where a high rollers' game is currently taking place. Jake bets Macha a fortune on a chip toss, and wins. This hurts Macha. As Jake says \\"nothing hurts more than humiliation and a little money loss\\". Macha suspects that Jake, who seems unafraid of him, will be out for more revenge. As Jake and his brothers leave the casino, a man hands Jake a card and tells him that he can help him. Jake, who has a fear of enclosed spaces, decides to take the stairs. In the stairwell he looks at the card and then collapses, falling down the stairs. The card is revealed to read \\"Take the Elevator\\". Jake is rushed to the hospital. The doctors report he is very ill but do not disclose why he had the blackout. Macha puts out an order for a hit on Jake. Jake arrives home, without Billy, where Macha's assassin is waiting for him. However, on his doorstep there is another card, which says \\"Pick This Up\\". As Jake bends to retrieve the card bullets fly over his back. As the shooting continues, the same mysterious individual called Zach (Vincent Pastore) arrives and rescues Jake, who is the only person to survive the hit. Zach introduces Jake to his partner, Avi (Andr√© Benjamin). They offer him a deal: they will take all of his money and he will do what they say, no questions asked. In exchange, they will protect Jake from Macha. In the course of their proposal, they show Jake his medical file, which they have mysteriously obtained. It indicates that the blackout occurred due to a rare blood disease which will cause his death within three days. Jake suspects a con. The mysterious men later reveal that his money will be used to fund their loan shark enterprise. Sam Gold is seen to be the 'king' in this chess game of gang warfare. He is the ultimate figure that all men are supposedly aspiring to be. Sam Gold is revealed to be an ultimately powerless cipher, whose power is granted only by those who invest in him. He represents ego and self-investment. He is the personification of greed. Three days after he found out about his disease and working with Avi and Zach, Jake goes to a physician again, and it is revealed that the original diagnosis was wrong and that he has more time to live. Meanwhile, Macha is attacked by 2 assassins from a rival gang, one disguised as a waitress. Macha loses a finger but manages to kill the fake waitress, while Macha's hitman Sorter (Mark Strong) kills the other assassin. Afterward, Sorter kills all the other rival gang members. Jake's brother Billy is betrayed by his bodyguards, who let in all the Macha's men (including Sorter) in Billy's home. Macha's men torture Billy and threaten to kill Billy's daughter in order to find out where Jake is, but these acts cause Sorter to find his conscience, so he kills all his companions. Jake demands answers from Avi and Zach, who only cryptically tell Jake that his worst enemy is himself. While they are in Macha's casino, Avi attempts to get Jake to understand the nature of the ego. He tells Jake \\"the greatest con that [the ego] ever pulled was making you believe that he is you.\\" This is seen to be the 'ultimate con', in that no one wants to sever their connection with their ego, because they refuse to challenge their own lifelong investment in it. Jake goes to Macha's bedroom, where he is sleeping, and asks an almost naked Macha for forgiveness. Jake then enters an elevator that gets stuck at the 13th floor. While waiting in the elevator, Jake has a conversation in his mind in which he rejects his ego. By doing this, Jake steps off the proverbial chess board by making a conscious effort to reverse everything his ego tells him to do. This is seen to be the truest and most fundamental application of the Formula. The characters of Jake, Zach, Avi and Sorter ultimately reject the ego's 'rules'. The character of Dorothy Macha is seen to succumb to them. As Jake is about to leave the building, Macha holds him at gunpoint, but a calm Jake just walks past Macha as he freezes, cries, and feebly tells Jake to fear him, consumed by his ego. It is revealed that Avi and Zach were Jake's \\"neighbours\\" during his years of incarceration. They have forced Jake to \\"induce head pain to engage the enemy\\" by making him give his money away under the principle that \\"nothing hurts more than humiliation and a little money loss\\". They are inflicting this form of 'premature enlightenment' upon Jake because, according to them, he was not ready to hear how hard this process of liberation was going to be while in prison. It was because of this that they left without him. Monologue of Jake Green about the ego: \\"There is something about yourself that you don't know. Something that you will deny even exists until it's too late to do anything about it. It's the only reason you get up in the morning, the only reason you suffer the shitty boss, the blood, the sweat and the tears. This is because you want people to know how good, attractive, generous, funny, wild and clever you really are. \\"Fear or revere me, but please think I'm special.\\" We share an addiction. We're approval junkies. We're all in it for the slap on the back and the gold watch. The \\"hip, hip, hoo-fucking-rah.\\" Look at the clever boy with the badge, polishing his trophy. Shine on, you crazy diamond. Cos we're just monkeys wrapped in suits, begging for the approval of others.\\" Cast * Jason Statham as Jake Green * Ray Liotta as Dorothy Macha * Vincent Pastore as Zach * Andr√© Benjamin as Avi * Mark Strong as Sorter * Tom Wu as Lord John * Terence Maynard as French Paul (credited as Terrence Maynard) * Andrew Howard as Billy * Francesca Annis as Lily Walker * Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen * Elana Binysh as Rachel  Themes  Guy Ritchie was, during the time of conceiving and executing the film, interested in Kabbalah. The film itself is laced with references to Kabbalistic ideas, symbols and numerological references. The trinity of Zach (either from Hebrew ◊ñ÷∞◊õ÷∑◊®÷∞◊ô÷∏◊î Zechariah ‚Ä≤Yah has remembered‚Ä≤ or ◊ô÷¥◊¶÷∞◊ó÷∏◊ß Yitskhak [Isaac] '[he] will laugh'), Jake (from Hebrew ◊ô÷∑◊¢÷≤◊ß÷π◊ë Ya øaqov [Jacob] from the root ◊¢◊ß◊ë  øqb 'to follow', 'to be behind', 'to supplant', 'circumvent', 'assail', 'overreach') and Avi (Hebrew ◊ê÷≤◊ë÷¥◊ô ‚Ä≤my father‚Ä≤) are representative of Kabbalistic right, centre and left pillar energies, respectively. Avi is a black man who is somewhat effeminate in his physical appearance, clothing and mannerisms. The 'left pillar' or 'left column' in Kabbalistic traditions is often associated with 'the feminine' and with the colour black. Jake's surname is \\"Green\\", and the colour green is associated with Netzach, the sphere ruled by Venus (Love) on the Tree of Life. Zach is a hefty, gargantuan, white man who 'dresses down' in a very archetypically 'masculine' way. Both masculinity and the colour white are associated with right column or right pillar energies in Kabbalistic traditions.\\"Blood is red, and blood belongs next to black. So, there's three columns: green is central column, white is right column, black is left column. Everything manifests in processes of three, so you've got: proton, neutron, electron; Sun, Earth, Moon; masculine, feminine, child. Wherever you're going to go, you're going to see a manifestation of '3'. So you've got Zach (or \\"Isaac\\"), Avi and Jake: a process of three. They represent positive, negative and filament, where Jake is the central column. Blood is red, which belongs to the left column, black is extreme left column. So it's the idea that white blood cells are 'mercy', and red blood cells are 'judgement'. Right is positive and left is negative.\\" ‚Äì Guy Ritchie, Revolver DVD commentary. The number 32 comes up repeatedly. \\"The chess game has many mystical meanings. The Temple of Solomon was chequered like a chessboard, which has 64 squares and 32 pieces.\\"Guy Ritchie, Revolver DVD Commentary The lift that Jake enters near the end of the movie has buttons for 32 floors.\\"32 floors: 32 vertebrae in your back, 32 teeth in your mouth, 32 chess pieces on a chessboard. On the same lift, the floor seems to be stuck between the 12 and the 14 floor placing Jake on the 13 floor.\\" ‚Äì Guy Ritchie, Revolver DVD commentary. The dollar bills shown in Jack's money bags have a denomination of 23.  Soundtrack  According to director Guy Ritchie, the music for the film was initially intended to follow in a similar vein to his previous crime movies, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, in that it was to be primarily source- based (i.e. using non-original music). Those source tracks would all have been classical in nature. However, during the production process, Ritchie changed his mind and decided to score a majority of the film with original music, leaving only some small sections to non-original music tracks (such as the restaurant shoot-out during Lord John's attempted assassination of Dorothy Maccha). Ritchie selected Nathaniel Mechaly to compose the score.See Revolver: Making The Music by Jesse Salto. The score was performed by Mechaly on Mini Moog and other keyboards, with drummer Maxime Garoute. All tracks composed by Nathaniel Mechaly and Maxime Garoute except where otherwise noted. # \\"Revolver\\" ‚Äì 03:58 # \\"Later That Night\\" ‚Äì 02:02 # \\"Atom's Tomb\\" (Electrelane) ‚Äì 02:11 # \\"The Heist\\" ‚Äì 02:52 # \\"Fear Me\\" ‚Äì 03:42 # \\"Mucchio Selvaggio\\" (Ennio Morricone, performed by 2raumwohnung) ‚Äì 05:06 # \\"Chess Room\\" ‚Äì 02:03 # \\"Sorter Shoot Out\\" ‚Äì 01:56 # \\"Purple Requiem\\" ‚Äì 04:00 # \\"3 Eddie Story\\" ‚Äì 02:40 # \\"End Casino\\" ‚Äì 02:50 # \\"Opera\\" (from Antonio Vivaldi's Nisi Dominus, third movement, performed by Emmanuel Santarromana) ‚Äì 04:03 # \\"Casino\\" ‚Äì 01:54 # \\"Jack Accident\\" ‚Äì 02:02 # \\"The Mental Traveler\\" ‚Äì 04:08 # \\"To Never Miss\\" ‚Äì 01:18 # \\"Ask Yourself\\" (Plastikman) ‚Äì 08:51 # \\"Gnossienne No. 1\\" (from Erik Satie performed by Alessandra Celletti) ‚Äì 04:18 # \\"Metropolitan\\" (Emmanuel Santarromana) ‚Äì 3:18  Home media  ; Extras featuring director Guy Ritchie. * The Concept: an interview with director Guy Ritchie and editor James Herbert on the subject of the film's conceptual and editorial development. * The Game: The Making Of Revolver * Stills gallery (over 100 stills against film soundtrack). * 7 deleted scenes with director's commentary. * Outtakes * Music Trailer ; Audio * Dolby Digital 5.1 * DTS Digital Surround 5.1 ; Aspect ratio * 2.35 Widescreen / Color ; Regional format * Revolver is currently available in both Regions 1 & 2 on DVD. ** Region 2 is the original 2005 theatrical release, while Region 1 is the 2007 reedited version, created by Ritchie to simplify and/or clarify some plot points after criticism that the film was too hard to follow.  Reception  Critical response = The film was generally panned by critics: for example, it has been criticized on grounds of pretension and having an over-complicated plot by critics such as Mark Kermode. Reviews were so poor in the UK that The Guardian ran a story on how the distributor managed to attribute a quotation to The Sun saying that the director was \\"back to his best\\". The quotation came from a section of the Sun Online website created by a PR agency on behalf of the film's distributors. There are some positive reviews as well. Mark R. Leeper conceded that it was \\"a film for a narrow audience\\", but said that he personally rather \\"liked it\\" and gave it a score of 7/10. According to Brian Orndorf, Revolver \\"is the perfect movie for those who like to crack things open and dig around the innards\\", saying that it \\"reminded [him] quite a bit of Richard Kelly's film, Donnie Darko\\".

Snowmaking is the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a \\"snow gun,\\" also known as a \\"snow cannon.\\" Snowmaking is mainly used at ski resorts to supplement natural snow. This allows ski resorts to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. Indoor ski slopes use snowmaking. They can generally do so year-round as they have climate-controlled environments. The use of snowmaking machines is becoming increasingly common as changing weather patterns and the rising popularity of indoor ski resorts create a demand for snow beyond that which is provided by nature. Snowmaking machines have addressed the shortage in the supply of snow; however, there are significant environmental and cultural costs associated with the artificial production of snow. According to the European Environment Agency, the length of snow seasons in the northern hemisphere has decreased by five days each decade since the 1970s, thus increasing the demand for the production of artificial snow. Some ski resorts use artificial snow to extend their ski seasons and augment natural snowfall; however there are some resorts that rely almost entirely upon artificial snow production. Artificial snow was used extensively at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang to supplement natural snowfall and provide the best possible conditions for competition. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature is used as a metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. The bulb temperature is always below the outside temperature. The damper the air, the less moisture it can absorb. The higher the atmospheric humidity, the colder it must be to turn the small water droplets into snow crystals. Examples Celsius * 0 ¬∞C dry temperature and a humidity of 90 % are equal to a wet bulb temperature of ‚àí0.6 * 0 ¬∞C dry temperature and a humidity of 30 % are equal to a wet bulb temperature of ‚àí4.3 * +2 ¬∞C dry temperature and a humidity of 90 % are equal to a wet bulb temperature of +1.5 * +2 ¬∞C dry temperature and a humidity of 30 % are equal to a wet bulb temperature of ‚àí2.8 Examples Fahrenheit * 32¬∞F dry temperature and a humidity of 90 % are equal to a wet bulb temperature of 31.43 * 32¬∞F dry temperature and a humidity of 30 % are equal to a wet bulb temperature of 24.84 To start a snowmaking system a wet bulb temperature of -2,5¬∞C/27,5¬∞F is required. If the atmospheric humidity is very low, this level can be reached at temperatures slightly above 0¬∞C/32¬∞F but if the air humidity is high, colder temperatures are required. Temperatures around freezing point are referred to as borderline temperatures or limit temperatures. If the wet bulb temperature drops, more snow can be produced faster and more efficient. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy use, thereby limiting its use.  History  In 1934, Warner Bros. technical director Louis Geib conjured a cold and wet blizzard on a sunny back lot in Burbank. His invention‚Äîthe first known snowmaking machine‚Äîconsisted of three rotating blades that shaved ice from a 400-pound block and a high-powered fan that blew the resulting particles into the air. A low-tech precursor to the water-crystallizing snow guns that is used each winter at about 90 percent of the country‚Äôs ski resorts, Geib‚Äôs machine was ideal for close-ups and, as the movie‚Äôs child actors learned, snowballs, though they disappeared quickly under the hot Hollywood lights. Geib‚Äôs innovation was also a hit off-screen, as the burgeoning ski industry‚Äîwhich sometimes trucked in snow for big events‚Äîbegan experimenting with the same technology. In the winter of 1934, the Toronto Ski Club re-purposed an ice planer from a local skating rink when Mother Nature did not provide cover for a scheduled competition. Art Hunt, Dave Richey, and Wayne Pierce invented the snow cannon in 1950, but secured a patent sometime later. In 1952, Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel became the first in the world to use artificial snow.On This Day: March 25, BBC News, accessed December 20, 2006. \\"The first artificial snow was made two years later, in 1952, at Grossinger's resort in New York, USA. \\" Snowmaking began to be used extensively in the early 1970s. Many ski resorts depend heavily upon snowmaking. Snowmaking has achieved greater efficiency with increasing complexity. Traditionally, snowmaking quality depended upon the skill of the equipment operator. Computer control supplements that skill with greater precision, such that a snow gun operates only when snowmaking is optimal. All-weather snowmakers have been developed by IDE.  Operation  A graph of air temperature against relative humidity: if conditions are below the curve, snow can be made. The key considerations in snow production are increasing water and energy efficiency and increasing the environmental window in which snow can be made. Snowmaking plants require water pumps and sometimes air compressors when using lances, that are both very large and expensive. The energy required to make artificial snow is about 0.6 - 0.7 kW h/m¬≥ for lances and 1 - 2 kW h/m¬≥ for fan guns. The density of artificial snow is between 400 and 500 kg/m¬≥ and the water consumption for producing snow is roughly equal to that number. Snowmaking begins with a water supply such as a river or reservoir. Water is pushed up a pipeline on the mountain using very large electric pumps in a pump house. This water is distributed through an intricate series of valves and pipes to any trails that require snowmaking. Many resorts also add a nucleating agent to ensure that as much water as possible freezes and turns into snow. These products are organic or inorganic materials that facilitate the water molecules to form the proper shape to freeze into ice crystals. The products are non-toxic and biodegradable. Pump house & air plant combination The next step in the snowmaking process is to add air using an air plant. This plant is often a building which contains electric or diesel industrial air compressors the size of a van or truck. However, in some instances air compression is provided using diesel-powered, portable trailer-mounted compressors which can be added to the system. Many fan-type snow guns have on-board electric air compressors, which allows for cheaper, and more compact operation. A ski area may have the required high-output water pumps, but not an air pump. Onboard compressors are cheaper and easier than having a dedicated pumping house. The air is generally cooled and excess moisture is removed before it is sent out of the plant. Some systems even cool the water before it enters the system. This improves the snowmaking process as the less heat in the air and water, the less heat must be dissipated to the atmosphere to freeze the water. From this plant the air travels up a separate pipeline following the same path as the water pipeline. =Ice nucleation-active proteins= The water is sometimes mixed with ina (ice nucleation-active) proteins from the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. These proteins serve as effective nuclei to initiate the formation of ice crystals at relatively high temperatures, so that the droplets will turn into ice before falling to the ground. The bacterium itself uses these ina proteins in order to injure plants. = Infrastructure = Piping diagram The pipes following the trails are equipped with shelters containing hydrants, electrical power and, optionally, communication lines mounted. Whereas shelters for fan guns require only water, power and maybe communication, lance-shelters usually need air hydrants as well. Hybrid shelters allow maximum flexibility to connect each snow machine type as they have all supplies available. The typical distance for lance shelters is , for fan guns . From these hydrants \\"‚Äì2\\" pressure resistant hoses are connected similar to fire hoses with camlocks to the snow machine. The infrastructure to support snowmaking may have a negative environmental impact, altering water tables near reservoirs and mineral and nutrient content of the soil under the snow itself.  Snowmaking guns  There are many forms of snowmaking guns; however, they all share the basic principle of combining air and water to form snow. For most guns the type or \\"quality\\" of snow can be changed by regulating the amount of water in the mixture. For others, the water and air are simply on or off and the snow quality is determined by the air temperature and humidity. In general there are three types of snowmaking guns: Internal Mixing, External Mixing and Fan Guns. These come in two main styles of makers: air water guns and fan guns. An air water gun can be mounted on a tower or on a stand on the ground. It uses higher pressure water and air, while a fan gun uses a powerful axial fan to propel the water jet to a great distance. A modern snow fan usually consists of one or more rings of nozzles which inject water into the fan air stream. A separate nozzle or small group of nozzles is fed with a mix of water and compressed air and produces the nucleation points for the snow crystals. The small droplets of water and the tiny ice crystals are then mixed and propelled out by a powerful fan, after which they further cool through evaporation in the surrounding air as they fall to the ground. The crystals of ice act as seeds to make the water droplets freeze at 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F). Without these crystals the water would supercool instead of freezing. This method can produce snow when the wet-bulb temperature of the air is as high as -1 ¬∞C (30.2 ¬∞F). The lower the air temperature is, the more and the better snow a cannon can make. This is one of the main reasons snow cannons are usually operated in the night. The quality of the mixing of the water and air streams and their relative pressures is crucial to the amount of snow made and its quality. Modern snow cannons are fully computerized and can operate autonomously or be remotely controlled from a central location. Operational parameters are: starting and stopping time, quality of snow, maximum wet-bulb temperature in which to operate, maximum windspeed, horizontal and vertical orientation, and sweep angle (to cover a wider or narrower area). Sweep angle and area may follow wind direction. * Internal mixing guns have a chamber where the water and air are mixed together and forced through jets or through holes and fall to the ground as snow. These guns are typically low to the ground on a frame or tripod and require a lot of air to compensate for the short hang time (time the water is airborne). Some newer guns are built in a tower form and use much less air because of the increased hang time. The amount of water flow determines the type of snow that is to be made and is controlled by an adjustable water valve. * External mixing guns have a nozzle spraying water as a stream and air nozzles shooting air through this water stream to break it up into much smaller water particles. These guns are sometimes equipped with a set of internal mixing nozzles that are known as nucleators. These help create a nucleus for the water droplets to bond to as they freeze. External mixing guns are typically tower guns and rely on a longer hang time to freeze the snow. This allows them to use much less air. External mixing guns are usually reliant on high water pressure to operate correctly so the water supply is opened completely, though in some the flow can be regulated by valves on the gun. * Fan guns are very different from all other guns because they require electricity to power a fan as well as an on- board reciprocating piston air compressor; modern fan guns do not require compressed air from an external source. Compressed air and water are shot out of the gun through a variety of nozzles (there are many different designs) and then the wind from the large fan blows this into a mist in the air to achieve a long hang time. Fan guns have anywhere from 12 to 360 water nozzles on a ring on the front of the gun through which the fan blows air. These banks can be controlled by valves. The valves are either manual, manual electric, or automatic electric (controlled by logic controller or computer). Snow lance used at Flottsbro in Stockholm * Snow lances are up to 12 meter long vertically inclined aluminum tubes at the head of which are placed water and/or air nucleators. Air is blown into the atomized water at the outlet from the water nozzle. The previously compressed air expands and cools, creating ice nuclei on which crystallization of the atomized water takes place. Due to the height and the slow rate of descent there will be enough time for this process. This process uses less energy than a fan gun, but has a smaller range and lower snow quality; it also has greater sensitivity to wind. Advantages over fan gun are: lower investment (only cable system with air and water, central compressor station), much quieter, half the energy consumption for the same amount of snow, simpler maintenance due to lower wear and fewer moving parts, and regulation of snow making is possible in principle. The working pressure of snow lances is 20-60 bar. There are also small mobile systems for the home user that are operated by the garden connection (Home Snow). = Home snowmaking = Smaller versions of the snow machines found at ski resorts exist, scaled down to run off household size air and water supplies. Home snowmakers receive their water supply either from a garden hose or from a pressure washer, which makes more snow per hour. Plans also exist for do-it- yourself snowmaking machines made out of plumbing fittings and special nozzles. Volumes of snow output by home snowmakers depend on the air/water mixture, temperature, wind variations, pumping capacity, water supply, air supply, and other factors. Using a household spray bottle will not work unless temperatures are well below the freezing point of water.  Snowmaking at warm temperatures  Snowfactory at Lenzerheide, Switzerland The Snowfactory is a snow generator which can also be used in warm temperatures. The Snowfactory is particularly suited to be used in Nordic skiing regions. Many Nordic centres are located in valleys which makes snowmaking particularly difficult in the beginning of the season. The Snowfactory generates 220m¬≥ of snow every day, at temperatures far above freezing - and without the addition of chemicals. Snow is produced by means of an innovative cooling technique. An efficient heat exchanger cools the water temperature to freezing point. The refrigeration circuit remains closed and makes it possible to produce snow at any outside temperature. The Snowfactory is made by the Italian manufacturer TechnoAlpin.  Extent of use of snowmaking technology  A ski resort that has compensated for low snowfall by producing artificial snow. By the 2009-2010 ski season, it is estimated that around 88% of ski resorts belonging to the National Ski Areas Association were using artificial snow to supplement natural snowfall. Since 1985, average aggregate temperatures in the Contiguous United States for the months of November through February have consistently been above the average temperatures for those months measured between 1901 and 2000. See Figure 1. Such a trend both limits and encourages the use of artificial snow. Rising temperatures will result in greater snowmelt and decreased snowfall, thus forcing ski resorts to depend more heavily upon the use of artificial snow. However, once temperatures approach 43 ¬∞F, snowmaking is not viable given the current technology. The image to the right, Photo 1, demonstrates the use of artificial snow to supplement natural snowfall. The strip of white going down the mountain is a ski slope that has been opened due to extensive use of snowmaking technology. Figure 1. Average winter temperatures for the contiguous United States As the use of artificial snow becomes more common and efficient, developers may seek to build new or expand existing ski resorts, as was the case with the Arizona Snowbowl ski resort. Such an action could cause significant deforestation, the loss of fragile and rare ecosystems, and cultural opposition. The high costs associated with the production of artificial snow serve as a barrier to entry for its use. It was estimated that in 2008 it cost approximately US$131,000 to purchase a snow gun and develop the necessary infrastructure. Overall, approximately US$61 million have been invested in snowmaking technology in the French Alps, US $1,005 in Austria, and US $415 in Switzerland. Furthermore, 50% of the average American ski resort‚Äôs energy costs are generated by the production of artificial snow.  Economics of snowmaking and snow sports  Figure 2. Models trends in ski and snowboard resort revenues Snowmaking machines allow ski resorts to extend their seasons and sustain their businesses in times of low snowfall. With changing climate trends, snowfall is becoming increasingly unpredictable, thus jeopardizing the economic success of ski resorts. Between 2008 and 2013, American ski and snowboard resorts experienced annual revenues of about US$3 billion. Such high levels of revenue increase the demand for predictable and adequate amounts of snow cover, which can be achieved through artificial snowmaking practices. While the economic benefit of ski resorts has been around US$3 billion in recent years (see Figure 2), the additional economic value of winter tourism in the United States is estimated to be around US$12.2 billion per year. These additional benefits come in the form of spending at hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and other local businesses. Additionally, winter tourism supports around 211,900 jobs in the United States, which amounts to a total of approximately US$7 billion paid in benefits and salaries, US$1.4 billion paid in state and local taxes, and US$1.7 billion paid in federal taxes. The economic benefits of snow sports are great, but also fragile. It is estimated that in years of lower snowfall, there is about a US$1 billion decrease in economic activity.  Environmental impact and future conditions  Mountain reservoirs = The implementation and use of artificial snow making technologies requires the undertaking of major infrastructural projects. These projects result in significant disruptions to local ecosystems. A major infrastructural project associated with the use of artificial snow making technology is the mountain reservoir. Many mountain reservoirs are embankment dams that feed underground water pipelines, and pose significant safety risks to nearby populations and ecosystems. In addition to the hazards posed by conventional reservoirs and dams, mountain reservoirs are subject to a variety of mountain-specific hazards. Such hazards include avalanches, rapid flows, and landslides. Approximately 20% of mountain reservoirs are built on avalanche-prone sites, and about 50% are prone to very high hazards. Additionally, mountain reservoirs expel water very quickly, causing massive floods, and significantly jeopardizing public safety. The severity of these hazards is augmented due to their potential impact on lower populations and properties. = Water and energy use = Snowmaking machines generally require between 3,000-4,000 cubic meters of water per hectare of slope covered. Accordingly, it takes approximately 106 gallons of water to produce one cubic meter of snow, and snowmaking machines use about 107 gallons of water per minute. A significant amount of this water is lost due to evaporation, and thus is not returned to the water table. Furthermore, it takes approximately 3.5 to 4.3 kWh of energy to produce one cubic meter of snow, however this number can be as high as 14 kWh, or as low as 1 kWh per cubic meter of snow. Snow making accounts for approximately 50% of the average American ski resort's energy costs, which amounts to about $500,000. = Effects on ground and drinking water = Ski resorts often use mineralized water in the production of artificial snow, which has adverse impacts on surrounding ecosystems and water tables. Mountain reservoirs are often filled with highly mineralized water, and the runoff from these reservoirs affects the mineral and chemical composition of groundwater, which in turn pollutes drinking water. Furthermore, mountain reservoirs do not allow water to seep back into the ground, so water is only returned to the water table through runoff. = Environmental conditions and forecasts = As a result of changing weather patterns, snowmaking has become a major industry due to a shortage in the supply of natural snow. The production of artificial snow aims to maintain a steady level of consumer and producer utility, however it poses significant environmental threats that may serve to perpetuate the issue that resulted in an increased demand for artificial snow in the first place. The EPA forecasts temperatures to increase by between 0.5 ¬∞F and 8.6 ¬∞F globally with a likely increase of 2.7 ¬∞F by the year 2100, and an average increase in temperatures in the US of between 3 ¬∞F and 12 ¬∞F by the year 2100. Furthermore, scientists predict that snow cover in the northern hemisphere will decrease by 15% by the end of the century with snowpack decreasing and snow seasons shortening concurrently. These predicted changes in temperature and snowfall patterns will induce ski resorts to rely more heavily upon artificial snow which uses significant amounts of water and electricity. As a result, ski resorts will further contribute to the production of greenhouse gases and the issue of water scarcity. In addition to long term environmental impacts, artificial snow production poses immediate environmental challenges. Artificial snow takes around two to three weeks longer to melt than does natural snow. As such, the use of artificial snow introduces new threats and challenges to local flora and fauna. Furthermore, the high mineral and nutrient content of the water used to produce artificial snow changes soil composition, which in turn affects which plants are able to grow.  Potential and realized externalities  In addition to the direct effects of the production of artificial snow, snowmaking practices result various secondary effects. = Positive externalities = Positive externalities resulting from the production of artificial snow include: positive impacts on local economies, increased firefighting capabilities, increased opportunities for physical activity, and improved competition conditions. The reservoirs and pipelines that are constructed to transport water to ski resorts increase the amount of water available to firefighters in the event of a wildfire. Furthermore, producing artificial snow allows ski resorts to extend the amount of time that they are operational, thus increasing opportunities for people to participate in outdoor physical activities. Finally, the composition of snow produced using snow guns differs from that of natural snow, and as such provides for improved conditions for winter sports competitions. = Negative externalities = The most visible negative externalities resulting from snowmaking are the adverse environmental impacts. However, in addition to environmental impacts, the production of artificial snow results in significant negative cultural and social externalities. Such externalities include issues regarding land use and land rights. Many ski resorts rent out mountains and slopes from the US Forest Service, which raises questions surrounding how the land can and should be used, and who should be the arbiter of determining appropriate uses. A specific example of a negative cultural externality is the contention surrounding use of artificial snow at Arizona Snowbowl, a ski resort in Northern Arizona. Arizona Snowbowl is situated in the San Francisco peaks, which are one of the holiest sites for various Native American tribes in the Four Corners area, including the Navajo Nation. In 2004, Arizona Snowbowl was renting its slopes from the US Forest Service, and was looking to build new ski slopes and increase the production of artificial snow. The proposed project would involve the clearing of approximately 74 acres of forest, the use of reclaimed water to produce artificial snow, the construction of a three-acre holding pond for reclaimed water, and the installation of an underground pipeline. A group of plaintiffs made up of members from six Native American tribes and various other organizations filed a lawsuit against the US Forest Service and Arizona Snowbowl. Plaintiffs alleged that undertaking such a project would significantly alter and damage the cultural and spiritual nature of the mountain. This legal challenge ultimately failed in 2009. Other uses In Swedish, the phrase \\"snow cannon\\" (Sn√∂kanon) is used to designate the Lake-effect snow weather phenomenon. For example, if the Baltic sea is not yet frozen in January, cold winds from Siberia may lead to significant snowfall.

[London]: Faber and Faber, [1982]. First English edition of A Piece of Monologue, Rockaby and Ohio Impromptu. A Piece of Monologue is a fifteen-minute play by Samuel Beckett. Written between 2 October 1977Reading University Library RUL 2068 and 28 April 1979 it followed a request for a ‚Äúplay about death‚Äù by the actor David Warrilow who starred in the premiere in the Annex at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club,La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club official web site New York on 14 December 1979.  Synopsis  Diffuse light fades up on a room in which a white-haired old man ‚Äì identified simply as Speaker ‚Äì stands motionless facing a blank wall. To his left is a standard lamp the same height as the actor with a globe about the size of a human skull; it is faintly lit. Just visible to his extreme right is the white foot of a pallet bed. ‚Äú[I]t is much like the room in the television play Ghost Trio, although without the mirror.‚Äù Ben-Zvi, L., ‚ÄòThe Schismatic Self in A Piece of Monologue ‚Äô in Journal of Beckett Studies 7 (1982) The man is wearing a white nightgown and white bed-socks. After a ten-second pause the actor begins speaking and continues without a break till the end of the play. All is lit dimly. This invites us, along with a lack of any specified internal staging to focus on listening as the primary way to experience the play. Speaker ‚Äútells a ‚Äòstory‚Äô of a man so much like himself that it is easy to suppose that he is simply speaking of himself in the third person\\" Morrison, K., ‚ÄòThe Rip Word in A Piece of Monologue‚Äô in Modern Drama 25 (1982) p 349 who is first seen staring out of a window at ‚Äúthat black vast.‚Äù Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 265 He has been contemplating the length of his life, which he totals up to ‚Äútwo and a half billion seconds‚Äù or ‚Äúthirty thousand nights.‚Äù (This works out to 79 years of seconds and 82 years of nights ). He focuses at first on only two things, being handed around as an infant and the various funerals that have punctuated his time on earth. The birth/death dyad is announced in the opening line: Birth was the death of him.\\" This pervades the play and appears in various forms throughout much of Beckett's writing. Speaker goes on to describe the man‚Äôs efforts to light an old-fashioned oil lamp in great detail. The linguistic discipline and repetition of precise phrases lends a ritualistic quality to these sequences which end in reduced light as he lastly \\"turns wick low.\\" This sequence of variations ultimately reduces to the singe word: \\"lights\\" closer to ending the play. In the initial, larger variations he uses up three matches in the process each time. Now able to see the man turns eastward to face a blank wall. This appears to be another nightly ritual. The wall that the man stands before used to be ‚Äúcovered with pictures‚Äù of once ‚Äúloved ones‚Äù (an expression he doggedly avoids saying as Beckett employs ellipses each time this phrase is uttered, forcing the character to interrupt himself immediately after each utterance). He looks at specific marks left on the wall and remembers a photo of his father, one of his mother, one of them on their wedding day ‚Äì Perhaps what he refers to right before the end as ‚Äúthe dead and gone‚Äù Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 269 ‚Äì and one of ‚ÄúHe alone‚Äù Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p266 which is likely one of himself ‚Äì yet another, with his parents and possibly others of ‚Äúthe dying and the going.‚Äù These pictures have been ‚Äúripped from the wall and torn to shreds‚Äù Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 266 though not in a single emotional scene, as with the character O in Film, but rather over a period of time and then swept ‚Äúunder the bed with the dust and spiders.‚Äù (Beckett manages to create a sense of their presence haunting the room. This seems increasingly likely as ghosts are mentioned in a sequence of lines leading to the closing section of the play.) Speaker then recalls the \\"Room once full of sounds. Faint sounds. Fewer and fainter as time wore on.\\" He links this to recollections of rain, which is falling at that moment as he states: \\"Rain some nights still slant against the panes. Even now.\\" Rain is further utilized in funeral sequences to come. The Speaker describes going to the window and lighting the lamp again in a truncated variation. For the third lamp-lighting a single lighted spill (a slender piece of wood or of twisted paper, for lighting lamps, etc.) is used rather than matches. An additional element is added with disappearing and reappearing hands and the globe. (Perhaps this is evocative a magic trick? A disappearing act as if one more verging on death?) Later follows the final mention of lighting the lamp with the aforementioned final, single-word variation \\"lights.\\" The action at an open grave is recalled in a series of variations and narrated in cinematic terms: ‚ÄúUmbrellas round a grave. Seen from above ‚Ä¶ Thirty seconds ‚Ä¶ Then fade.‚Äù Beckett, S., Collected Shorter Plays of Samuel Beckett (London: Faber and Faber, 1984), p 268 The funeral is taking place in the pouring rain. The man describes watching someone speak at the graveside ‚Äì (presumably the minister?) ‚Äì but only ‚Äúhalf hearing what he‚Äôs saying.‚Äù Confusion as to whose funeral gives way to indication that the funeral is of a woman, very likely that of his mother(?). The fact that Speaker corrects himself, ‚Äúhis way‚Äù becoming ‚ÄúHer way‚Äù, suggests that the death of this female loved one is perhaps the critical event of this partial and oblique story. Or, more accurately, the attempt to speak of this specific event and renounce it from memory is the most significant behaviour represented in the narrative.‚Äù Lyons, C. R., ‚ÄòMale or Female Voice: The Significance of the Gender of the Speaker in Beckett‚Äôs Late Drama and Fiction‚Äô, in Ben-Zvi, L., (Ed.) Women in Beckett: Performance and Critical Perspectives (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992), p 156 The text fragments from this point on. The narrator jumps back and forth from the funeral to the window to the lamp to the wall to his birth. The action does progress somewhat however: in the first mention of the funeral the grave is empty, in the second the coffin is ‚Äúout of frame‚Äù and in the third the coffin is ‚Äúon its way.‚Äù  Interpretations  ‚Äú[One] of Freud‚Äôs theories that had an impact on Beckett because it reinforced his own experience was that the agony of birth induced a primal anxiety in human beings.‚Äù Brown, V., Yesterday‚Äôs Deformities: A Discussion of the Role of Memory and Discourse in the Plays of Samuel Beckett , (doctoral thesis) p 174 Beckett claimed to have remembered his time in utero along with his own painful birth. The word ‚Äòbirth‚Äô preoccupies Speaker. He returns to it over and over again describing graphically at one point, in as great a detail as he does the lighting of the lamp, how the word is said. This is an important moment and one that caused Beckett major problems when he came to adapt the piece into French since ‚Äúno similar word is vocalised in this way in French.‚Äù Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p 677 This resulted in his omitting whole passages and ‚Äúreduced the piece to a free version, shorter, entitled Solo.‚Äù ‚ÄúParting the lips is both a condition for and a result of pronouncing the plosive consonant ‚Äúb‚Äù; thrusting the tongue forward, more precisely, pushing it out through the parted lips and teeth, describes in turn the action involved in pronouncing the sound ‚Äúth‚Äù‚Ä¶ This connection links the parting of lips and thrusting forward of the tongue, necessary for the articulation of the word ‚Äúbirth,‚Äù with the actual act of birth.

As he destroys the photographs that reduce his once-loved mother and father to grey voids, and him to another, he tries to obliterate the memories that connect him with life and intimacy. Nothing remains but dim recollection and an anticipated funeral to mark the end of his slow death mark from birth to oblivion‚Äù‚Ä¶ Hovering as Old Father Time in his shroud, he is ‚Äòwaiting on the rip word‚Äô ‚Ä¶ to avaunt his ‚Äòso-called loved ones‚Äô and his ‚Äòghastly grinning‚Äô self.

Beckett effectively attempts to achieve on stage what he has previously achieved in fiction: to allow the two parts of the self to exist simultaneously. There is Speaker framed on stage who does not move (effectively a Tableau Vivant) ‚Äì he resembles a photograph ‚Äì and then there is the man in his story. F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs remark, \\"Action is character,\\" Bruccoli, M. J. (Ed.) The Notebooks of F. Scott Fitzgerald, (New York and London: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich/Bruccoli Clark, 1978), p 332 has never been truer than in this short play. ‚ÄúThe play ends on the growing pull of the image of death: ‚ÄòTreating of other matters. Trying to treat of other matters. Till half hears there are no other matters. Never were other matters. Never two matters. Never but the one matter. The dead and the gone. The dying and the going. From the word go. The word begone‚Äô. The two issues, birth and death, ultimately become only death. From birth, the beginning‚Äî‚Äòthe word go‚Äô‚Äîthe presence of death is constant, just as the word ‚Äògo‚Äô is part of the word ‚Äòbegone.‚Äô‚Äù  Background  In August 1977, the actor David Warrilow, who had had such a resounding success with the adaptation of The Lost Ones wrote to Beckett asking him if he would write a solo piece for him to perform. After clarifying what exactly he was after Beckett declined: ‚ÄúMy birth was my death. But I could not manage 40 min. (5000 words) on that old chestnut. Not with it now within reach.‚Äù SB to David Warrilow, 1 Oct 1977, University of Reading The day afterwards he did however sit down and attempt a piece with the opening words: ‚ÄòMy birth was my death.‚Äô Written in the first person singular; it was provisionally entitled ‚ÄòGone‚Äô. ‚ÄúIt broke down ‚Ä¶ after a few thousand groans‚Äù SB to Martin Esslin, 14 Jan 1979, University of Reading but he considered it salvageable and returned to it in January 1979 when Martin Esslin wrote to him to ask if he had an unpublished work that could appear in The Kenyon Review. He added a set of stage directions to what had been up till then simply a monologue and, on his seventy-third birthday, he posted copies to both Esslin and Warrilow. He considered it ‚Äúunsatisfactory ‚Ä¶ I do not expect you to use it,‚Äù he wrote to Warrilow.SB to David Warrilow, 13 April 1979, University of Reading ‚ÄúThe piece drew on childhood memories: ‚Äúhis father teaching him to light a match on his buttocks; the various operations involved in lighting an old-fashioned oil lamp ‚Ä¶ what his mother had told him about how he was born just as the sun was sinking behind the larches ‚Äònew needles turning green‚Äô; a gleam of light catching the large brass bedstead that had stood in his parents‚Äô bedroom.‚Äù Knowlson, J., Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), pp 649,650 He had also recently calculated his own age in days and incorporated a figure of ‚ÄúTwenty five thousand five hundred and fifty dawns‚Äù in his initial draft. A few days after Beckett began work on ‚ÄòGone‚Äô he arranged for his whole house to be painted ‚Äúgrey like the proprietor‚Äù and, on his return from a trip to Germany seeing the walls now bare and uncluttered, he chose to let them remain that way. As James Knowlson puts it in Damned to Fame (p 650): ‚ÄúLife here emulated art, or at least echoed the mood that inspired it.‚Äù  Related texts Breath= The oxymoron \\"Birth was the death of him\\" evokes a fusion of the two events. We find this in Breath, in which a stage littered with rubbish is accompanied by a faint cry, followed by inspiration, silence, expiration, another cry and silence again. End of piece. =Krapp's Last Tape= To access his memories (i.e. to see the wall) the man in Monologue has first to turn on the lamp. In Krapp's Last Tape before Krapp can access his he needs to locate the appropriate tape and switch on the machine. Today, when digital technologies accentuate the process of the externalisation of memory begun with the invention of written language, these plays are more relevant than ever.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1917, and is notable as the first member of the Social Democratic Party to serve in that body. Rigg was born in Todmorden, Lancashire, England, and came to Canada in 1903. He was a bookbinder as well as a Methodist minister, and served as a first permanent business agent of the Winnipeg Trades Council. He was initially a member of the Socialist Party of Canada, but broke away from the SPC in 1911 to help form the Social Democratic Party. Along with Jacob Penner and Herman Saltzman, he co-authored the SDP's first manifesto. Rigg campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1911 federal election, but finished third in the riding of Winnipeg against Conservative Alexander Haggart. In 1913, Rigg was elected to the Winnipeg City Council for Ward Five in the city's north end. He received considerable support from the city's Jewish community, and in his victory speech pledged to support religious, national and political equality for all members of Canada's working class. Rigg's victory began a tradition of social-democratic representation in Winnipeg's council which has continued to the present day. Rigg was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1915, defeating Liberal candidate Solomon Hart Green by 231 votes in the Winnipeg North \\"B\\" constituency. Nominated as an SDP candidate, Rigg also received support from the more centrist Labour Representation Committee. During the 1915 campaign, Rigg and fellow SDP candidate Arthur Beech emphasized both general reforms and the broader working-class struggle. Their meetings were often disrupted by members of the more hardline Socialist Party, who accused Rigg and Beech of being \\"sentimentalists and Christ-lovers\\". The Socialists did not field candidates against them, however, and could not prevent Rigg's victory. Rigg's success was credited, in part, to a strong support base among ethnic communities in Winnipeg's north end. In the legislature, Rigg pressed for improvements to Manitoba's Factories Act, and unsuccessfully attempted to raise the minimum age of factory labour. Rigg was generally supportive of the provincial Liberal government of Tobias Norris, claiming that the Norris administration did more for labour in its first six months than the previous Conservative administration of Rodmond Roblin had done in fifteen years. Rigg resigned from the legislature in 1917 to campaign for the Canadian House of Commons a second time. The SDP had initially nominated John Queen as its candidate in Winnipeg North, but the city's centrist labourites declared that Queen could not win and nominated Rigg in his place. Rigg's nomination was subsequently confirmed by special convention of Winnipeg's working-class organizations. He also received the endorsement of the \\"Laurier Liberals\\", who declined to offer a candidate of their own. Rigg's campaign was based primarily on opposition to Prime Minister Robert Borden's policy of conscripting men for military service in World War I. He made the following statement during the campaign: \\"I regard human life as the supremely sacred thing and believe that if the state had adopted the policy of the conscription of money, industry and natural resources, there would be absolutely no necessity for the passing and enforcing of any scheme to conscript men\\". He called for a referendum on the conscription issue, and also advocated the nationalization of industry. Government supporters responded by accusing Rigg's supporters of disloyalty. He was defeated, losing to government candidate Matthew Robert Blake by a margin of 9,656 votes to 3,472. Many working-class voters in Winnipeg were unwilling to oppose Borden's government in wartime. Rigg himself joined the Canadian Army in 1917 and served overseas. In 1919, he drafted a motion supporting the Winnipeg General Strike that was approved by the Great War Veterans' Association. He served as Superintendent of Employment Offices for Western Canada from 1919 to 1922, and as Director of the Employment Service of the Department of Labour in 1922. He retired in 1940.

They are closely related to adjoints, but are also related to limits and ends. They are named after Daniel M. Kan, who constructed certain (Kan) extensions using limits in 1960. An early use of (what is now known as) a Kan extension from 1956 was in homological algebra to compute derived functors. In Categories for the Working Mathematician Saunders Mac Lane titled a section \\"All Concepts Are Kan Extensions\\", and went on to write that :The notion of Kan extensions subsumes all the other fundamental concepts of category theory. Kan extensions generalize the notion of extending a function defined on a subset to a function defined on the whole set. The definition, not surprisingly, is at a high level of abstraction. When specialised to posets, it becomes a relatively familiar type of question on constrained optimization. Definition A Kan extension proceeds from the data of three categories :\\\\mathbf{A}, \\\\mathbf{B}, \\\\mathbf{C} and two functors :X : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C}, F : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{B}, and comes in two varieties: the \\"left\\" Kan extension and the \\"right\\" Kan extension of X along F. The right Kan extension amounts to finding the dashed arrow and the natural transformation \\\\eta in the following diagram: : 150px (The natural transformation in the diagram above should be interpreted as an arrow to the functor X from the composed functor RF: \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C}.) Formally, the right Kan extension of X along F consists of a functor R: \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C} and a natural transformation \\\\eta: RF \\\\to X that is couniversal with respect to the specification, in the sense that for any functor M: \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C} and natural transformation \\\\mu: MF \\\\to X, a unique natural transformation \\\\delta: M \\\\to R is defined and fits into a commutative diagram: : Image:Right Kan extension universal property diagram.PNG where \\\\delta_F is the natural transformation with \\\\delta_F(a) = \\\\delta(Fa): MF(a) \\\\to RF(a) for any object a of \\\\mathbf{A}. The functor R is often written \\\\operatorname{Ran}_FX. As with the other universal constructs in category theory, the \\"left\\" version of the Kan extension is dual to the \\"right\\" one and is obtained by replacing all categories by their opposites. The effect of this on the description above is merely to reverse the direction of the natural transformations. :(Recall that a natural transformation \\\\tau between the functors F,G: \\\\mathbf{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{D} consists of having an arrow \\\\tau(a): F(a) \\\\to G(a) for every object a of \\\\mathbf{C}, satisfying a \\"naturality\\" property. When we pass to the opposite categories, the source and target of \\\\tau(a) are swapped, causing \\\\tau to act in the opposite direction). This gives rise to the alternate description: the left Kan extension of X along F consists of a functor L: \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C} and a natural transformation \\\\epsilon: X \\\\to L F that are universal with respect to this specification, in the sense that for any other functor M: \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{C} and natural transformation \\\\alpha: X \\\\to M F, a unique natural transformation \\\\sigma: L \\\\to M exists and fits into a commutative diagram: : 150px Image:Kan extension universal property diagram.png where \\\\sigma_F is the natural transformation with \\\\sigma_F(a) = \\\\sigma(Fa): LF(a) \\\\to MF(a) for any object a of \\\\mathbf{A}. The functor L is often written \\\\operatorname{Lan}_FX. The use of the word \\"the\\" (as in \\"the left Kan extension\\") is justified by the fact that, as with all universal constructions, if the object defined exists, then it is unique up to unique isomorphism. In this case, that means that (for left Kan extensions) if L, M are two left Kan extensions of X along F, and \\\\epsilon, \\\\alpha are the corresponding transformations, then there exists a unique isomorphism of functors \\\\sigma: L \\\\to M such that the second diagram above commutes. Likewise for right Kan extensions. PropertiesKan extensions as (co)limits= Suppose X:\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{C} and F:\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{B} are two functors. If A is small and C is cocomplete, then there exists a left Kan extension \\\\operatorname{Lan}_FX of X along F, defined at each object b of B by :(\\\\operatorname{Lan}_F X)(b) = \\\\varinjlim_{f:Fa \\\\to b} X(a) where the colimit is taken over the comma category (F \\\\downarrow \\\\operatorname{const}_b), where \\\\operatorname{const}_b\\\\colon \\\\ast\\\\to B, \\\\ast\\\\mapsto b is the constant functor. Dually, if A is small and C is complete, then right Kan extensions along F exist, and can be computed as the limit :(\\\\operatorname{Ran}_F X)(b) = \\\\varprojlim_{Fa \\\\leftarrow b} X(a) over the comma category (\\\\operatorname{const}_b \\\\downarrow F). =Kan extensions as (co)ends= Suppose K:\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{C} and T:\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\to\\\\mathbf{A} are two functors such that for all objects m and m‚Ä≤ of M and all objects c of C, the copowers \\\\mathbf{C}(Km',c)\\\\cdot Tm exist in A. Then the functor T has a left Kan extension L along K, which is such that, for every object c of C, :Lc=(\\\\operatorname{Lan}_KT)c=\\\\int^m \\\\mathbf{C}(Km,c)\\\\cdot Tm when the above coend exists for every object c of C. Dually, right Kan extensions can be computed by the end formula :(\\\\operatorname{Ran}_KT)c=\\\\int_m Tm^{\\\\mathbf{C}(c,Km)}. =Limits as Kan extensions= The limit of a functor F:C\\\\to D can be expressed as a Kan extension by :\\\\lim F=\\\\operatorname{Ran}_E F where E is the unique functor from C to ùüô (the category with one object and one arrow, a terminal object in Cat). The colimit of F can be expressed similarly by :\\\\operatorname{colim} F=\\\\operatorname{Lan}_E F. =Adjoints as Kan extensions= A functor F : C \\\\to D possesses a left adjoint if and only if the right Kan extension of \\\\operatorname{Id} : C \\\\to C along F exists and is preserved by F. In this case, a left adjoint is given by \\\\operatorname{Ran}_F \\\\operatorname{Id} and this Kan extension is even preserved by any functor C \\\\to E whatsoever, i.e. is an absolute Kan extension. Dually, a right adjoint exists if and only if the left Kan extension of the identity along F exists and is preserved by F. Applications The codensity monad of a functor G: D \\\\to C is a right Kan extension of G along itself.

Plot  While waiting for their new home to be renovated, Nellie and her younger brother George are sent to a farm in the countryside, much to George's delight and Nellie's disgust. However, the farmhouse and the surrounding area are teeming with magical fey creatures, most of which Nellie cannot see initially because she doesn't believe in faeries. The first the two children properly encounter is a somewhat crotchety and unfriendly hobgoblin named Broom (whom Nellie can see) who is (more or less) secretly looking after the farm. While playing outside, George inadvertently stumbles into a faery ring surrounding a massive, ancient oak tree and ends up in the realm of faeries. Nellie is able to bribe Broom with honey cakes in exchange for him showing her how to see the faeries and how to find and enter Faeryland. Broom warns Nellie not to eat or drink anything while she is there, however, she reaches her brother just in time to see George eating a faery cake. The uptight Chudley informs them that the law of the faery realm states that a mortal who consumes even one mouthful of faery food must remain in the realm forever. Nellie and George strongly ‚Äî and noisily ‚Äî protest. The commotion attracts the attention of the Faery Prince Albrecht, the ruler of the realm, who offers them a chance to escape by setting three tasks for them. What they do not know is that the evil brother of the Prince, the Shapeshifter, and his goblin henchmen, are trying to manipulate the children and the faery citizens (Merrivale, Huccaby, Chudley, and Starcross are the only ones met in the film) to usurp the rulership of the faery realm. The Shapeshifter can steal the throne with ease if he obtains the Orb, a powerful magical sceptre in his brother's possession. In addition, the Prince falls in love with a friend of the children, the pretty human farmhand Brigid, which proves pivotal in an old prophecy that foretells the future for the faery realm. Nellie and George succeed in bringing Brigid to Faeryland, where she meets and falls in love with the Prince. Later, the children are instrumental in foiling the Shapeshifter's attempt to cause war between Albrecht and the faery princess to whom he was originally betrothed. Once the Shapeshifter is defeated, the princess gives Brigid and Albrecht her blessing, and Nellie and George watch as Brigid is married to Albrecht, and is transformed into a faery. Two tasks down, the children return to the farm, where the faeries have left a fabricated letter to explain Brigid's disappearance. Later, the children bring Brigid to the home of her friend, whose newborn baby is Brigid's godson (making Brigid a real fairy godmother.) However, the Shapeshifter has followed them, and steals the child, leaving a goblin replacement. Brigid must steal the Orb for the Shapeshifter if she wants to rescue the child. Brigid makes the trade, but is horrified to see the faeries upon her return-now drastically aged, and Albrecht close to death, as the Orb is also the source of the faeries' youth and immortality. Brigid is only unaffected because she has not been a faery long enough to noticeably age. With a little help from Broom, the children and Brigid make a plan. Using a bead, a brooch pin, and a pinch of hobgoblin magic, the group creates a fake Orb. Nellie and George sneak into a goblin party and successfully swap the Orbs. Brigid returns the original to its rightful place in the palace, saving the faeries' lives and restoring their youth. The Shapeshifter, unaware that the Orb in his possession is fake, marches into Faeryland, believing his brother and the other faeries to be dead. He is confronted by the children, who reveal the deception. Albrecht arrives, battles his brother (who transforms into a fire-breathing dragon/mantis-like monster) and ultimately wins. The Shapeshifter and all but one of his henchmen are thrown into prison. The last one evades detection and runs away. Nellie and George have completed their three tasks, and, as a reward for saving Faeryland, are allowed to consume as much faery food as they desire, without having to remain in Faeryland or complete another three tasks. The film ends with the children deciding to extend their stay at the farm, and the faeries flying back to the tree.

In the , there were no residents in the suburb.  Geography  The mountain is 287 metres above sea level, has the highest peak within the urban footprint of Brisbane. It forms the eastern extent of the Taylor Range and is a prominent landmark approximately to the west of the Brisbane central business district. Visible from much of the city, Mount Coot-tha is a popular bushland tourist destination including the Brisbane Botanic Gardens and Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium, as well as a mountain drive, bike trails, parks including a waterfall, and television and radio towers.Visit Mt Coot-tha Brisbane Tourist Guide. Retrieved on 7 November 2013. Mount Coot-tha is the source of Ithaca Creek. History Before the Moreton Bay penal settlement, Mount Coot-tha was the home of the Yugara Aboriginal people.Mount Coot-tha Forest track map ‚Äî (Brisbane City Council) The Aboriginal people came to the area to collect 'ku-ta' (honey) that was produced by the native stingless bee. In 1839, surveyor James Warner and his team cleared the top of the mountain of all trees except one large eucalypt tree. Because this tree could be seen from many other locations, they used as a trigonometric station to take surveying measurements. This led to the mountain's former name One Tree Hill. Coot-tha meaning Honey Mountain is a derivative of the indigenous term which replaced the name One Tree Hill when the area was declared a park in August 1883. It was suggested by Henry Wyatt Radford, the Clerk of the Queensland Legislative Council. During World War II, the mountain was used as a military base by the RAAF and the US Navy. It was converted to a vast explosives depot and at one stage held more than 120,000 tonnes of explosive weapons. When darkness fell the lookout bristled with search lights in an amazing display as soldiers kept an eye out for enemy planes.anti-aircraft guns and searchlights were located on the lookout. Mount Coot-tha was also the site of US Naval Ammunition Depot (Navy 134) supplying submarines at the Capricorn Wharf at New Farm (Teneriffe) in Brisbane. In 1970 the Brisbane City Council established new botanic gardens at the base of the mountain with the intention of replacing the then Brisbane Botanic Gardens at Gardens Point in the Brisbane CBD (now known as the City Botanic Gardens) which was prone to flooding and lacked space for expansion. The new gardens were originally called the Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens and were officially opened in 1976, becoming the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. The new gardens cover . On 24 May 1978 Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium officially opened in the grounds of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. The Mount Coot-tha Library opened in 1975 at the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. Unlike most branches of the Brisbane City Libraries, this library specialises in botany, horticulture, gardening and landscape design. Brisbane community television channel 31 Digital broadcast from the mountain from 1994 to 2017, after which it shifted to internet streaming under the new name of Hitchhike TV. On 20 November 2005, one of the Mount Coot-tha trails, the Currawong trail, was renamed the Kokoda trail in honour of the Australian soldiers who marched the Kokoda Track during World War II. In 2017 It was proposed to build Australia's longest zip-line from the summit of Mount Coot-tha down to the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. Despite initially being approved by the Brisbane City Council, in April 2019 the new Mayor of Brisbane Adrian Schrinner decided to cancel the project due to the public protests.

Walking tracks There are several popular walking tracks around Mount Coot-tha, one of which includes an art display comprising works produced by local Aboriginal artists. The tracks vary in difficulty, with most involving some uphill sections or steps. Tracks around Mount Coot-tha are often used by hikers training to walk the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea as the terrain and climate are considered similar. Mountain bike trails View of the cityscape from the Mount Coot-tha Lookout The Western side of Mount Coot-tha Forest or Gap Creek Reserve as it is known to the locals is a haven for Brisbane mountain bike riders. The establishment of a world class mountain bike trail network by the Brisbane City Council has created a diverse range of recreational experiences for off-road cyclists. The mountain bike trails at Mount Coot-tha have been assigned a grading under the International Mountain Bicycling Association, Trail Difficulty Rating System. The multi-use trails in Mount Coot-tha provide the least degree of technical challenge to mountain bike riders, however many of them are steep and loose. Riders are advised to pay special attention when riding over the erosion control banks (water bars) which have been the downfall of many a novice rider. The trail ratings provide a guide to the relative difficulty of each trail. The multi-use tracks are used by horses, pedestrians and mountain bikers. Each year orienteering events are held in the area. Transport Mount Coot-tha can be reached by Brisbane Transport Bus 471 (Translink).

He is the host of The Red Peters Comedy Music Hour on Sirius XM, and a frequent guest on The Howard Stern Show. Early career Stevens attended Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston from 1968‚Äì1971, majoring in film. He was one of the original students of The Studio For Interrelated Media. Stevens left art school in late 1971 to go on the road with his first music group, Gross National Productions (or \\"GNP\\") as lead vocalist under the stage name \\"Matt Maverick.\\" GNP recorded their debut album, \\"P Flaps and Low Blows\\" on Metromedia Records in 1972; the album was produced by George \\"Shadow\\" Morton and John Linde. Off the album, the band toured nationally, both headlining as well as opening for major acts such as Lee Michaels, Tommy James, Sha Na Na, Badfinger, Spirit, Jeremy Steig, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention. Following GNP's breakup, Stevens (under the name \\"Red Stevens\\") co-wrote and directed the rock comedy musical theater production Rockfights ‚Äì Rich Amusement, which played at the Overland Theater in Boston in 1976. CareerMusic= In 1984, the song \\"Blow Me (You Hardly Even Know Me)\\" was the first single ever released by Stevens as \\"Red Peters,\\" as a 45rpm single. He co-wrote the song with Ed Grenga (a.k.a. \\"Babe Marino\\"), who also gave Stevens the stage name \\"Red Peters.\\" As Peters told Outer Shell Magazine, \\"My music director, Babe Marino, and I were messing around with a big band arrangement one day and the words just flowed out. We brought the scratch recording to a party that night and people went shithouse for it. We went on to formally record it with his orchestra along with the Alan Pinchloaf Singers.\\" In 1990, Peters released \\"How's Your Whole... Family?\\" as a second single. This led to a full-length release, produced by Grenga, in 1995 for Ugly Sisters Records, I Laughed... I Cried... I Fudged My Undies! A nationwide radio tour followed, including the Mancow Muller show, The Bruce Bond Late Afternoon Show, the Dr. Demento radio show, and eventually Howard Stern. On his first appearance on Stern's show in 1996, he sang \\"A Ballad of a Dog Named Stains.\\" In 1999, Peters released his 2nd full-length album, \\"Ol' Blue Balls Is Back!\\" on Ball Bag Records. It was again produced by Grenga. On October 8, 2003, Peters and Ball Bag Records signed an exclusive distribution deal with Oglio Entertainment Group, and his music is distributed by Universal Fontana. This led to two single releases, \\"I Can't Say These Things\\" in 2005, and \\"When I Jerkoff, I Think of You\\" in 2006. \\"The Best of the Red Peters Comedy Music Hour, Vol. #1\\", a compilation album of various artists, was the first full-length release with Oglio in 2007. This album consisted of songs and artists featured on his Sirius Howard 101 radio show. In 2009, Peters released It's A Red Peters Christmas! Vol. 1, a collection of holiday songs from guests that appeared on his Red Peters Comedy Music Hour holiday radio programs on Sirius XM Howard 101, once again performed by various artists. In 2010, another compilation from his radio show, called Red Peters Presents The Summer Song Sizzler, was released. In October 2010, Peters and comic Margaret Cho recorded a cover of the Dick Shreve song, \\"The Christmas Gift (Just A Little Christmas Blow Job)\\" when Cho was in Boston on her \\"Cho Dependent\\" national tour, performing at the Wilbur Theater. The song was released as a single on Oglio Records in November 2010. =Audio production= In 1976, Stevens founded the music production company Handsome Brothers Music Service with fellow GNP band member Tom Dempsey. The company specializes in commercial music production for television, radio, corporate videos, advertising, and motion pictures. Composer Ed Grenga became a business partner in 1984; besides corporate work, Grenga has produced all of Peters' albums and scored numerous feature films as well. For the 2009 baseball season, Grenga and Stevens created pregame, in-game and post-game music for NESN's broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games. The music debuted on Opening Day in 2009. =Radio show= In 2005, Peters started a Sirius Satellite Radio show called The Red Peters Comedy Music Hour on Howard Stern's \\"Howard 101\\" channel, as a weekly broadcast. The first show aired November 18, 2005. The show is described as \\"uncensored songs, oddities, taboo subjects and the forbidden spoken word.\\" In 2010, Peters' show went to a schedule of 8 one-hour specials a year, primarily on holiday weekends. =Television, movies, and theater= In 1997, Peters appeared on Stern's radio show, and shortly thereafter on his CBS late night television show, The Howard Stern Radio Show. He was featured in a live segment from the radio show, and in music video footage of his song, \\"The Ballad of a Dog Named Stains\\".

It used to be placed under the district of Sri Aman. Location Betong division is located between three main rivers, Batang Lupar, Batang Saribas and Batang Kelaka, covering an area of 4,180 km2. Population By October 2011, the population was nearly 94,000, the majority being Ibans (51,290), followed by Malays (37,283), Chinese (5,084), Bidayuh (225), and Melanau (219), while the remaining are other races. Economy Main areas are farming, agriculture and fishing but there are some who work in the public and private sectors as well as business (most businesses are family-owned). Education As a way to ensure the development of human capital to meet the demands of Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE) and other major projects in the State, major investments are made in the development of educational facilities like vocational schools and polytechnics. This is expected to encourage more local and foreign investors to come to Betong and explore opportunities they never knew Betong had. Recognition In recognition of Betong's rich history, rapid growth and contribution to Sarawak's economy, it was accorded Division status in 2002. It was then selected to become the administrative division centre. The areas of administration include the Saratok District and the Betong District. Betong has also been expanded to cover the Small District of Maludam, which had been under the jurisdiction of the Sri Aman District. Betong is acknowledged by many as the place where the earliest educated Ibans can be found. This paved the way for Ibans in other areas to also educate themselves.

L'Inferno took over three years to make, and was the first full-length Italian feature film. Plot Dante is barred from entering the hill of salvation by three beasts that bar his path (Avarice, Pride, and Lust). Beatrice descends from above and asks the poet Virgil to guide Dante through the Nine Circles of Hell. Virgil leads Dante to a cave where they find the river Acheron, over which Charon ferries the souls of the dead into Hell. They also see the three-headed Cerberus, and Geryon, a flying serpent with the face of a man. They see the Devil eating human beings whole, harpies eating the corpses of suicides, an evil man forced to carry his own severed head for eternity, people half buried in flaming lava, etc. There follows a series of encounters in which the two meet up with a number of formerly famous historical figures whose souls were denied by both Heaven and Hell, and they listen to some of their tales told in flashback. These characters include Homer, Horace, Ovid, Lucanus, Cleopatra, Dido, the Queen of Carthage, the traitor Caiphus, Count Ugalino, Peter of Vigna, Francesca Da Rimini and her lover Paulo, Brutus and Cassius, Mohammed and Helen of Troy. The main attraction of the film are the fantastic set designs depicting the horrors of Hell, with excessive violence and gore, designed to frighten the audience into becoming pious or God-fearing. Cast * Salvatore Papa as Dante Alighieri * Arturo Pirovano as Virgilio * Giuseppe de Liguoro as Il conte Ugolino * Augusto Milla as Lucifer * Attilio Motta * Emilise Beretta Production L'Inferno's depictions of Hell closely followed those in the engravings of Gustave Dor√© for an edition of the Divine Comedy, which were familiar to an international audience, and employed several special effects. As Dante's Divine Comedy places Muhammad in hell, the film also has a momentary unflattering depiction of Muhammad in its Hell sequence (his chest explodes, exposing his entrails). Nancy Mitford recorded seeing the film in Italy in 1922, referring to it as Dante. She records that it lasted from 9 until 12:15 including two intermissions. She details many of the deaths and tortures from the film. Her description of the film in her letter home is quoted during the biography Nancy Mitford by Harold Acton. The scenes from Hell from the film were reused in an American 1936 exploitation film Hell-O- Vision and the 1944 race film Go Down, Death!. Some American state film censor boards required removal of the hell sequences from L'Inferno used in Go Down, Death!, such as one where a woman's bare breast is momentarily seen. Release L'Inferno was first screened in Naples in the Teatro Mercadante on March 10, 1911. An international success, it took in more than $2 million in the United States, where its length gave theater owners an excuse for raising ticket prices. Home video For many years, L'Inferno was largely unseen and only available in lower quality, incomplete copies. In 2004, a newly restored version of the film, combining British and American prints from the BFI National Archive and the Library of Congress, was released on UK DVD by the Snapper Music label. It was scored by father and son Edgar and Jerome Froese, of the German electronic band Tangerine Dream. The film has English intertitles and subtitles in German, French, Spanish, and Italian. In 2011, L'Inferno's centenary, a brand new and more complete digital restoration by Italy's Cineteca di Bologna was released on their own DVD label. This version has original Italian intertitles, optional English subtitles, and a choice of an electro-acoustic score by Edison Studio or a composition for piano by Marco Dalpane. It also has many extras, including some restored early Italian shorts and a bilingual paperback book.

These boundaries include Fairview Park, an earlier suburb associated with the same developers, running from the west side of Blunn Creek to South Congress Avenue. Part of Travis Heights was stranded east of Interstate 35; many of the same streets to be found west of the highway continue east of it. It was founded in 1912 by Newning, Swisher and General Stacy, but development did not expand rapidly until the 1920s. The city park located along Blunn Creek in Travis Heights was donated by Stacy and bears his name, Stacy Park, as does the \\"Big Stacy\\" spring-fed pool and the \\"Little Stacy\\" park and swimming pool, built as a WPA project during the Great Depression. Originally conceived as an exclusive district for the wealthy, the adjacent development of Fairview Park was first developed in the late 19th century, but did not really take off. It was not until the 1920s when Travis Heights was developed next to it, that life south of the river was a reasonable venture. Now, with a great mix of mansions, smaller homes, and hip apartments, Travis Heights is among the most desirable residential neighborhoods in Austin. Proximity to South Congress, Downtown Austin, and the major freeways also make Travis Heights one of the best-positioned areas in South Austin. Another attraction of the neighborhood is its closeness to the newly rejuvenated South Congress Avenue, many times called SoCo. South Congress is full of hip cafes and stores, and attracts many tourists and young professionals from downtown. Blunn Creek Nature Preserve is almost 40 acres in Travis Heights, central South Austin, with trails and historical plaques. Details of the history, including the natural history, of the creek and preserve can be found at this Austin Parks & Recreation web site. Travis Heights and Fairview Park are currently seeking designation as a Local Historic District and National Register Historic District.

Sturrock has been awarded many prizes and honors, and has written or co-authored many scientific papers and textbooks. Biography Sturrock began his education studying mathematics at Cambridge University in 1942. During and after World War 2, Sturrock postponed his Cambridge studies in order to help develop radar systems at the Telecommunications Research Establishment, now the Royal Radar Establishment. After the war, Sturrock resumed his education, and was awarded a scholarship at St John's College in 1947, followed by the University Rayleigh Prize for mathematics in 1949. Sturrock was elected to a fellowship at St John's in 1952. He then pursued work on electron physics at the Cavendish Laboratory, followed by stints at Cambridge, the National Bureau of Standards, and the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure at the University of Paris. In 1951, Sturrock earned a Ph.D. in astrophysics. In the 1950s Sturrock researched nuclear physics at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment; plasma physics at St. Johns' College, Cambridge; microwave tubes at Stanford University; accelerator physics at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Also in the 1950s, Sturrock invented a number of implements, including a novel microwave tube later dubbed the \\"Free electron laser.\\" In 1961, Sturrock was appointed a professor of applied physics at Stanford University, where he remained until 1998; he is currently an emeritus professor of physics and applied physics at Stanford. In 1990 Sturrock was awarded the Arctowski Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. From 1992 to 1998, he was director of the Center for Space Science and Astrophysics, and from 1981 to 2001 was president of the Society for Scientific Exploration. Sturrock has also served as chairman of the Plasma Physics Division and the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society. In 2009, Sturrock published his autobiography, A Tale of Two Sciences: Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist, which covered both his research in conventional physics and his less mainstream investigations. In 2013, Sturrock published AKA Shakespeare: A Scientific Approach to the Authorship Question. In this book, he lays out a method for weighing evidence which he developed for studying pulsars. Sturrock then invites the reader to apply the method to tabulate their own \\"degree of belief\\" in three different candidates for authorship of the works usually attributed to Shakespeare. He was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020. =Interest in UFOs= Sturrock has been a prominent contemporary scientist to express a keen interest in the subject of unidentified flying objects or UFOs. Sturrock's interest traces back to the early 1970s when, seeking someone experienced with both computers and astrophysics, he hired Jacques Vallee for a research project. Upon learning that Vallee had written several books about UFOs, Sturrock‚Äîpreviously uninterested in UFOs‚Äîfelt a professional obligation to at least peruse Vallee's books. Though still largely sceptical, Sturrock's interest was piqued by Vallee's books. Sturrock then turned to the Condon Report (1969), the result of a two-year UFO research project that had been touted as the answer to the UFO question. Sturrock commented that, \\"The upshot of this was that, far from supporting Condon's conclusions [that there was nothing extraordinary about UFOs], I thought the evidence presented in the report suggested that something was going on that needed study.\\" At about the same time that the Condon Committee was conducting its investigation, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) in 1967 had set up a subcommittee to bring the UFO phenomenon to the attention of serious scientists. In 1970 this subcommittee published a position paper also highly critical of how the Condon Committee had conducted its investigation and how Condon's written conclusions often didn‚Äôt match the cases detailed in the final report. Overall, the AIAA deemed about a third of the cases still unsolved. Unlike Condon, they felt these unsolved cases represented the essential core of the UFO problem and deserving of further scientific scrutiny. Sturrock was curious what the general attitudes of the members of the AIAA might be and in 1973 surveyed the San Francisco branch of the AIAA, with 423 out of 1175 members responding. Opinions were widespread as to whether UFOs were a scientifically significant problem. Most seemed unsure or neutral on the question. Sturrock was also curious as to whether fellow scientists like the AIAA members ever reported seeing UFOs, i.e., anomalous aerial phenomena that they couldn‚Äôt identify. The survey indicated that about 5% had, which is typical for what is usually reported for the general population as a whole. In 1975, Sturrock did a more comprehensive survey of members of the American Astronomical Society. Of some 2600 questionnaires, over 1300 were returned. Only two members offered to waive anonymity, and Sturrock noted that the UFO subject was obviously a very sensitive one for most colleagues. Nonetheless, Sturrock found a strong majority favored continued scientific studies, and over 80% offered to help if they could. Sturrock commented that the AAS members seemed more open to the question than the AIAA members in his previous survey. As in the AIAA survey, about 5% reported puzzling sightings, but skepticism against the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) ran high. Most thought that UFO reports could ultimately be explained conventionally. Sturrock also found that skepticism and opposition to further study was correlated with lack of knowledge and study: only 29% of those who had spent less than an hour reading about the subject favored further study versus 68% who had spent over 300 hours. In his analysis of the survey results, Sturrock noted that many scientists wished to see UFOs discussed in scientific journals (there was an almost complete absence of such articles in journals). He subsequently helped establish the Society for Scientific Exploration in 1982 to give a scientific forum to subjects that are neglected by the mainstream. Their publication, the Journal of Scientific Exploration, has been published since 1987. The Journal has been criticized for catering to pseudoscience. In 1998, Sturrock organized a scientific panel to review various types of physical evidence associated with UFOs. The panel felt that existing physical evidence that might support the ETH was inconclusive, but also deemed extremely puzzling UFO cases worthy of further scientific study. Sturrock subsequently wrote up the work of the panel in the 2000 book The UFO Enigma: A New Review of the Physical Evidence.

Wilt is most known for his work with the Chicago Fire, where he gained a reputation for being a fan-friendly businessman in the soccer world.  History  Peter Wilt was born in McHenry, Illinois, and gained his start in sports working for the Milwaukee Brewers baseball and Milwaukee Admirals hockey teams before breaking into soccer with the Milwaukee Wave. Wilt was known for answering questions from fans through the BigSoccer Internet message boards, and now maintains his own blog on Chicago soccer issues. In his seven seasons as Chicago's GM, the Fire won one MLS Cup, three U.S. Open Cups and one Supporters' Shield. In 2005, Wilt was fired by Anschutz Entertainment Group, the team's owner, a move which was protested by fans in Chicago. The following year, he became the chief executive officer of Milwaukee Professional Soccer (a group bidding to bring an MLS franchise to Milwaukee), but left the position to become CEO of the Chicago Red Stars Chicago's Women's Professional Soccer team that started play in 2009. After one season, Wilt left the Red Stars for a front office position with the Milwaukee Wave. After one season with the Wave, Wilt founded the now defunct expansion MISL side Chicago Riot. In late 2012, Wilt led an effort with a group of Indianapolis, Indiana investors headed by Ersal Ozdemir to determine the viability of the market to support a North American Soccer League team in the city with eventual hopes to join MLS. On January 16, 2013, the league awarded Indianapolis the league's twelfth franchise, naming Wilt the team President that day. The team, known as Indy Eleven, began play in the 2014 season. In January 2016, Wilt stepped down from his role with the Indy 11 to pursue an NASL team in Chicago. He later announced that works were in progress to secure short-term and long-term stadium options combined with exploring investors and supporter ownership structures. On June 6, 2017, Wilt was announced that the newly formed National Independent Soccer Association would begin play in 2018 targeting an initial 8 to 10 teams, later revised to 8 to 12 teams. The league has also outlined plans to introduce a promotion/relegation system, once they reach their goal of 24 teams, the first in US professional soccer and in doing so act as a feeder league to the North American Soccer League. On May 17, 2018, Wilt left the NISA to help start up a future professional team in Madison, Wisconsin of the USL League One, later named Forward Madison FC. A committee of club owners has been formed to elect new leadership within the organization. Wilt was also named the managing director of Green Bay Voyageurs FC, Forward Madison's affiliate in USL League Two. On October 24, 2019, Forward Madison announced Wilt's departure from the club in order to take a role with the USL.

Organizational background  According to Josh Sugarmann, its founder, the VPC approaches violence, and firearms violence in particular, as a public health issue affecting the whole population, rather than solely a criminal matter. The VPC is known mainly for its in-depth research on the firearms industry, the causes and effects of gun violence, and the advocacy of regulatory policies to reduce gun violence. The VPC advocates for gun control legislation and policy. The VPC has no official membership fee, relying on donations from the public and foundation support. The primary foundation donor to the VPC is the Joyce Foundation.\\"The Joyce Foundation - Gun Violence Prevention Grantees.\\" Retrieved 2013-8-5. The VPC publicizes its research through the news media and through coalitions with other advocacy organizations. Activities Annual reports on impact of gun violence = Using data from federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the VPC publishes annual state-by-state reports on the effects of gun violence. It has examined the effects of gun violence on specific populations: *Females murdered by males in single victim/single offender incidents,Flatow, Nicole. \\"How Guns at Home Can Make Women Less Safe\\".

The methodology of taking the number of black homicide victims and only adjusting it to the black population of a state, which the VPC does, can be misleading when those same numbers are adjusted to the total population of a state. According to the VPC's 2006 study the black murder rate in North Dakota (31.06 per 100,000) was higher than the black murder rate in Louisiana (28.16 per 100,000) but if black murder victims were adjusted to their total populations, the rate in Louisiana (8.79 per 100,000) wouldv'e been 28 times higher than the rate in North Dakota (0.31 per 100,000) that same year. During the last 29 consecutive years in which Louisiana's murder rate has been the highest among US states, it's also been the state where black murder victims have made up the highest percentage of overall murder victims. = Concealed carry = The VPC maintains a \\"Concealed Carry Killers\\" database of fatal non-self defense killings involving private citizens who are legally allowed to carry concealed handguns in public.http://concealedcarrykillers.org/McCarthy, Ciara. \\"Concealed Carry is Now Legal in All 50 States, and the NRA Doesn't Want Us to Know What That Really Means.\\" Slate, July 11, 2013.

According to the article, suicides, which may or may not have involved a firearm, and motor vehicle homicides caused by intoxication, are included in the statistics. = Gun industry donations = The VPC has issued reports that document the gun industry's financial contributions to the NRA. In 2013, the VPC said that the firearms industry has donated between $19.3 million and $60.2 million to the NRA since 2005.Curry, George E. \\"Obama Reignites Push for Gun Legislation.\\" Los Angeles Sentinel, Sept. 26, 2013. = 50-caliber rifles = The VPC has long advocated for a ban on 50-caliber rifles. In 2001, the VPC issued a study that detailed \\"the 50 caliber's threat as an ideal tool for assassination and terrorism, including its ability to attack and cripple key elements of the nation's critical infrastructure‚Äîincluding aircraft and other transportation, electrical power grids, pipeline networks, chemical plants, and other hazardous industrial facilities\\". In January 2005, the VPC was featured on the CBS news and current affairs program 60 Minutes, which ran a segment on 50-caliber rifles and their alleged threat to public safety. It drew from VPC reports on the .50 BMG cartridge. Interviews were featured with both Ronnie Barrett of Barrett Firearms and Tom Diaz of the VPC. The NRA objected, alleging that the story was biased in the VPC's favor; it claimed that no 50-caliber rifle has ever been used in the commission of a crime. In response, the VPC issued a backgrounder detailing criminal use and possession of 50-caliber rifles, including examples of murders by criminals using this weapon. The list does not clarify whether the weapons seized were possessed legally or not, and makes no distinction between use of a .50 caliber rifle in a crime and possession of a .50 caliber rifle by a person committing an unrelated crime. In September 2004, California passed a law to ban 50 caliber rifles, the only states to do so.Marshall, Carolyn. \\"California Bans a Large- Caliber Gun, and the Battle is On.\\" New York Times, January 4, 2005. = Firearms imports = CBS reported that numerous firearms are sold in the United States that were illegally trafficked into Mexico and legally imported into the United States, where they are sold to \\"straw purchasers\\" and other illegal traffickers.Attkisson, Sharyl. \\"Legal U.S. gun sales to Mexico arming cartels.\\" CBSNews.com, December 6, 2011.

In 1989, ATF officials in the administration of President George H. W. Bush used their powers to prohibit the import of firearms that are not \\"generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes.\\" Despite this prohibition, gun manufacturers skirted the ban by making cosmetic changes to their weapons to comply with the law. The Clinton administration reviewed the case, and as a result banned certain weapons from import.U.S. Department of the Treasury. Department of the Treasury Study on the Sporting Suitability of Modified Semiautomatic Assault Rifles, April 1998. The VPC argues that today the import ban has for the most part been abandoned, and foreign-made assault weapons‚Äîwhole and in parts‚Äîare being freely imported into the United States.Schmitt, Rick. Romanian weapons modified in the U.S. become scourge of Mexican drug war. The Center for Public Integrity, December 21, 2012. In response, the VPC has asked the ATF to enforce a ban on the import of foreign-made assault weapons. =Eddie Eagle study= In November, 1997 the Violence Policy Center published a study of the National Rifle Association's Eddie Eagle program, entitled Joe Camel With Feathers. Key findings included: > The primary goal of the National Rifle Association's Eddie Eagle program is > not to safeguard children, but to protect the interests of the NRA and the > firearms industry by making guns more acceptable to children and youth. The > Eddie Eagle program employs strategies similar to those utilized by > America's tobacco industry‚Äîfrom youth \\"educational\\" programs that are in > fact marketing tools to the use of appealing cartoon characters that aim to > put a friendly face on a hazardous product. Other key findings included that \\"the NRA uses the Eddie Eagle as a lobbying tool\\" in its opposition to child access prevention laws and mandatory trigger lock laws; that \\"Rather than recognizing the inherent danger firearms in the home pose to children, and the often irresponsible firearms storage behavior of adults, the Eddie Eagle program places the onus of safety and responsibility on the children themselves\\"; and that \\"Public health researchers have found that 'gun safety' programs like Eddie Eagle are ineffective in preventing unintentional death and injury from firearms.\\" The study's key findings were summarized in major newspapers including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Chicago Tribune as well as regional newspapers including The Philadelphia Inquirer, Newsday, The Times-Picayune, and others, and in the book Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law edited by Gregg Lee Carter, professor of history at Bryant University in an article on Eddie Eagle by Robert J. Spitzer. The NRA called the study \\"ludicrous\\" and threaten to sue the Violence Policy Center. Reception The VPC distributes its published research and analysis to members of Congress and their staffs. Numerous US gun control organizations have used VPC reports and terminology to advance local and national gun control initiatives.

Her work on the birth control injection pill is especially notable as medical research was influential in the creation of the birth control pill. Dr. Rice- Way headed a large scale, clinical trial of the first birth control pill in the late 1950s in Puerto Rico.  Education  Rice-Wray attended Vassar College Degree where she specialized in public health. She also attended Cornell University where she was a member of the Alpha Phi sorority. She received the award of sesquicentennial from \\"knowledge, wisdom and courage of service\\"' at the University of Michigan in 1967.  Medical Experience  Rice-Wray worked as a doctor at Northwestern University, and had a long career working for the advancement of public health. She was a faculty member of the Puerto Rico Medical School and medical director of the Puerto Rico Family Planning Association. It was there that she headed the first large scale clinical trials working for over 17 years until the UN (United Nations) called her to work in Mexico. In 1959 she founded Mexico's first family planning clinic in Mexico City. Rice-Wray in a conference in Mexicali  Clinical trials in Puerto Rico & work on the birth control pill  In the early 1950s, Rice-Wray's work was focused on studying the effectiveness of the pill. In order to prove the safety of the pill, researchers and activists including John Rock, Margaret Sanger and Katherine McCormick felt human trials had to be conducted. During this time Rice-Wray was working for the Puerto Rican Health Service. Puerto Rico was selected as the location for these trials in 1955 in part because there was an existing network of birth control clinics serving low-income women on the island and liberalized laws existed regarding distributing information about family planning. In 1937, a law had been passed in Puerto Rico that made it legal for married couples to receive advice about contraception. Since accessing the pill was legal, trials began there in 1956. In April 1956, Rice-Wray had been working with the Family Planning Association of Puerto Rico and joined this project. Some of the women who participated in the study experienced \\"the pill\\" (Enovid). In 1956, she starting to distribute these pills. Rice-Wray noticed early on that there were potentially problematic side effects from the dosage in the early birth control pill. Her concerns were initially dismissed by Dr. Rock and Gregory Pincus who argued those concerns raised by women were unfounded. Experiments in her studies were closely supervised by Rice-Wray and she never lost interest in finding more effective methods for controlling fertility. Rice-Wray saw a direct link between large family sizes and poverty. In 1955, she was reported as saying, \\"When all Puerto Rican parents can have the number of children they want and can properly care for, much of the misery and desperation of our poorer classes can be eliminated...then employment opportunities, schooling, housing, medical and welfare services will have a chance of meeting the needs of our people.\\" Despite the controversial nature of fertility research, Rice-Wray's research was closely watched and reported on in the United States. In 1963, the New York Times reported on the details of her research as part of their coverage on a Planned Parenthood conference.Prosalud Maternal Clinic Association  Personal life  Rice-Wray was the daughter of Mabel and Theron Canfield Rice-Wray who were married in 1903. Originally from New York City, Rice-Way spent much of her adult life in Mexico and Puerto Rico. Faith was an important aspect of her personal life. She was of the Bah√° º√≠ (Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Mexico) faith and wrote the Bah√° º√≠ book Portales de la Libertad while in M√©xico.  Awards and accolades  She received several awards for her work in publicizing the effectiveness and benefits of the pill in Latin America, she was the recipient of Planned Parenthood Federation of America's and received the Margaret Sanger Award in 1978. She showed a long-standing commitment to public health and wellness. Gregory Pincus, who was often credited with creating the pill, would often cite the work of Rice-Wray as being instrumental to its success. alt= By the 1970s she moved to Puebla, in the municipality of Cholula where she worked as Professor at UDLA (University of the Americas Puebla) in the fields of Ecology, Anthropology and Population Studies, where she continues to have medical consultations helping and contributing knowledge to medicine in San Pedro Cholula and San Andr√©s Cholula, Puebla including contraceptive pill.  Later years  During the last days of her life, she lived in Cholula, Puebla, Mexico, and died at her home in San Andres Cholula, accompanied by her daughters and grandchildren in 1990.

Carp gudgeons are very small perciform fish (similar in size, shape and colour) found in the Australian Murray-Darling River system, mainly in lowland environments, but some have been observed in upland environments. They are often found in small creeks, as well as billabongs and the edges of larger rivers. They prefer water 1 to 2 m deep with aquatic weed and structure provided by rocks or sunken timber (usually the latter). Like many other Murray-Darling native fish species, western carp gudgeon have crossed the Great Dividing Range through natural river capture events and are found in a number of East Coast drainages, from the Hunter River system in northern New South Wales to the Fitzroy River system in central Queensland. Description Western carp gudgeon are small fish, averaging 30‚Äì40 mm long, though very large specimens may approach 60 mm. Usually, their bodies are yellowish to clear with subtle, dark grey blotches, with semitranslucent fins. Males develop spectacular spawning colours in summer, namely a more metallic-bronze body colour with a red stripe through the caudal (tail), anal, and spiny and soft dorsal fins. The red stripe through the anal and spiny and soft dorsal fins are topped with a tiny iridescent blue-white stripe, which are somewhat subtle on most of the fins, but are prominent and eye-catching on the spiny dorsal fin. Western carp gudgeons spawn in summer, attaching eggs to aquatic weed in the shallows. They may have suffered from small variations in river level caused by river regulation, which exposes and destroys eggs laid in shallows. They may be a critical food item for juvenile Murray cod, and likely are an important forage fish for larger fish species in many waterways. Western carp gudgeons have taken to lower-altitude, man-made lakes and impoundments in the Murray-Darling system well, and are very common in some. In aquaria Western carp gudgeon make superb aquarium fish: they are lively, interactive, attractively coloured, and hardy. They eagerly take live or frozen brine shrimp, very small invertebrates, and commercial micropellet fish feeds. Curiously, they are unavailable in aquarium stores and remain the province of keen naturalists who capture their own. Classification The specific name honours the German physician and zoologist Carl Benjamin Klunzinger (1834-1914), who, in 1880, mistook this species for Eleotris cyprinoides. Western carp gudgeon are purportedly the most common of the carp gudgeons. However, recent genetic research suggests that the carp gudgeons are a cryptic species complex composed of at least four species and many hybrids; their taxonomy is extremely complicated, unresolved, and not accurately reflected by current scientific and common names. Many researchers have now resorted to referring to them as simply \\"carp gudgeon (Hypseleotris spp.)\\" until their taxonomy is resolved. Despite their common name, carp gudgeon are in no way related to carp (Cyprinus carpio) or other members of the family Cyprinidae. Introduced Parasite The introduced parasite Asian fish tapeworm Bothriocephalus acheilognathi had caused significant fish kills of the species in Canberra's Lake Burley Griffin and is strongly suspected of affecting other Australian native freshwater fish.

He was abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery, UK, from its consecration in 1984 until his retirement in 2010. Luang Por means Venerable Father (‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏û‡πà‡∏≠), an honorific and term of affection in keeping with Thai custom; ajahn means teacher. A bhikkhu since 1967, Sumedho is considered a seminal figure in the transmission of the Buddha's teachings to the West.  Biography  Ajahn Sumedho was born Robert Karr Jackman in Seattle, Washington, in 1934.Ajahn Sumedho on Amaravati's Sangha PageAjahn Sumedho on Buddhanet During the Korean War he served for four years from the age of 18 as a United States navy medic. He then did a BA in Far Eastern studies and graduated in 1963 with an MA in South Asian studies at the University of California, Berkeley. After a year as a Red Cross social worker, Jackman served with the Peace Corps in Borneo from 1964 to 1966 as an English teacher. On break in Singapore, sitting one morning in a sidewalk caf√©, he watched a Buddhist monk walk by and thought to himself, \\"That looks interesting.\\" In 1966, he became a novice or samanera at Wat Sri Saket in Nong Khai, northeast Thailand. He ordained as a bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) in May the following year. From 1967-77 at Wat Nong Pah Pong, he trained under Ajahn Chah. He has come to be regarded as the latter's most influential Western disciple. In 1975, he helped to establish and became the first abbot of the International Forest Monastery, Wat Pa Nanachat in northeast Thailand founded by Ajahn Chah for training his non-Thai students. In 1977, Ajahn Sumedho accompanied Ajahn Chah on a visit to England. After observing a keen interest in Buddhism among Westerners, Ajahn Chah encouraged Ajahn Sumedho to remain in England for the purpose of establishing a branch monastery in the UK. This became Cittaviveka Forest Monastery in West Sussex. Ajahn Sumedho was granted authority to ordain others as monks shortly after he established Cittaviveka Forest Monastery. He then established a ten precept ordination lineage for women, \\"Siladhara\\". Until his retirement, Ajahn Sumedho was the abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery near Hemel Hempstead in England, which was established in 1984. Amaravati is part of the network of monasteries and Buddhist centres in the lineage of Ajahn Chah, which now extends across the world, from Thailand, New Zealand and Australia, to Europe, Canada and the United States. Ajahn Sumedho played an instrumental role in building this international monastic community. Ajahn Sumedho's imminent retirement was announced in February 2010, and he retired in November of that year. His successor is the English monk Ajahn Amaro, hitherto co-abbot of the Abhayagiri branch monastery in California's Redwood Valley. Ajahn Sumedho now dwells as a \\"free agent\\" in Thailand.  Teachings  Ajahn Sumedho (left) with a visiting Thai monk (Phra Root Chumdermpadetsuk). Ajahn Sumedho (seated beneath the shrine) in conversation with a bhikkhu, just before Amaravati's daily meal Ajahn Sumedho is a prominent figure in the Thai Forest Tradition. His teachings are very direct, practical, simple, and down to earth. In his talks and sermons he stresses the quality of immediate intuitive awareness and the integration of this kind of awareness into daily life. Like most teachers in the Forest Tradition, Ajahn Sumedho tends to avoid intellectual abstractions of the Buddhist teachings and focuses almost exclusively on their practical applications, that is, developing awareness and wisdom in daily life. His most consistent advice can be paraphrased as to see things the way that they actually are rather than the way that we want or don't want them to be (\\"Right now, it's like this...\\"). He is known for his engaging and witty communication style, in which he challenges his listeners to practice and see for themselves. Students have noted that he engages his hearers with an infectious sense of humor, suffused with much loving kindness, often weaving amusing anecdotes from his experiences as a monk into his talks on meditation practice and how to experience life (\\"Everything belongs\\").  Sound of Silence  A meditation technique taught and used by Ajahn Sumedho involves resting in what he calls \\"the sound of silence\\". He talks at length about this technique in one of his books titled The Way It Is. Ajahn Sumedho said that he was directly influenced by Edward Salim Michael's book, The Way of Inner Vigilance (republished in 2010 with the new title, The Law of Attention, Nada Yoga and the Way of Inner Vigilance and for which Ajahn Sumedho wrote a preface). The Sound of Silence is also the title of one of Ajahn Sumedho's books (published by Wisdom Publications in 2007).

He came to the Swan River valley during the early 1900s. Sims served as a councillor in the Rural Municipality of Swan River from 1907 to 1913, and was the community's reeve in 1914. He was also president of the local Agricultural Society for many years. Sims was married twice: first to Catherine Emily Marsh and then, in 1909, to Christina S. M. Mounsey. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, defeating Conservative candidate W.J. Stewart by thirty- three votes in the constituency of Swan River. The Conservatives won this election, and Sims served with his party in opposition. The Conservative administration was forced to resign in 1915 as the result of a corruption scandal, and the Liberals were called to form government. A new election was called, which the Liberals won in a landslide. Sims was re-elected by an increased majority, and served as a backbench supporter of premier Tobias Norris's government for the next five years. He was defeated in the 1920 provincial election, losing to Farmer candidate Robert Emmond by 619 votes. He sought to return to the legislature in the 1927 election, but finished third against Progressive candidate Andrew McCleary.

It is located in Evanston, Illinois. The seminary offers a number of masters and doctoral-level degree programs in theology and is actively engaged in outreach to congregations focusing in the Midwest but with influence around the world. History Founded in 1853 by Mrs. Eliza Garrett, Garrett-Evangelical is the result of the interweaving of three institutions: * Garrett Biblical Institute, the first Methodist seminary in the Midwest, was established in 1853 by largely the same church people who founded Northwestern University. Its founders hoped that the school would shape mind and spirit toward an educated ministry. * The Chicago Training School, established in 1885, was an important force for women in ministry and for developing service agencies throughout Chicago. Chicago Training School merged with Garrett Biblical Institute in 1934. * Evangelical Theological Seminary, located in Naperville and founded as a seminary of the Evangelical Church (later the Evangelical United Brethren) in 1873. Garrett-Evangelical was formed in 1974 when the Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston merged with the Evangelical Theological Seminary in Naperville, Illinois (both UMC schools). The merged school occupied the Garrett campus. Garrett-Evangelical is on the campus of Northwestern University and continues many associations with the university. The school was a pioneer institution in preparing women for ministry.Keller, Rosemary Skinner, \\"Conversions and Their Consequences: Women's Ministry and Leadership in the United Methodist Tradition\\" in Catherine Wessinger, Religious Institutions and Women's Leadership, South Carolina University Press, 1996, pp. 101-123. The Chicago Training School for Home and Foreign Missions for women was merged into Garrett Biblical Institute in 1930. Dr. Georgia Harkness was the first woman to hold the post of professor of theology at any seminary in the United States. The Center for the Church and the Black Experience was one of the earliest centers focusing on ministry and the African American experience. CollaborationsNorthwestern University= Garrett-Evangelical and Northwestern University have a relationship that is almost a century and a half old. Common founders established both institutions to provide an educated ministry for an educated church. Over the decades, the institutions have shared numerous resources, including courses, buildings, faculties, libraries, parking, and technology. Today, the Garrett-Evangelical learning community is deeply enhanced through its relationship with Northwestern: * Library resources and access (both physical and virtual); * E-mail and other forms of information technology; * Ph.D. coursework and dissertation advising; * Recreational facilities and opportunities; * International student assistance; * Many cultural events and special lectures and programs. =The Association of Chicago Theological Schools= The Chicago area boasts the greatest concentration of seminaries per capita of anywhere in the U.S. The Chicago area schools are organized into a cluster called The Association of Chicago Theological Schools. Garrett- Evangelical is one of the 11 member schools. The ACTS website states: :Together, the schools within ACTS offer a rich network of resources for theological education, making the association one of the outstanding centers of theological education in the world. Available to the approximately 3,000 students currently enrolled at its member schools is a faculty of more than 350, more than 1,000 courses offered annually, and library collections of 1.7 million volumes and nearly 5,000 currently received periodical subscriptions. =Ecumenical Theological Seminary Program= Garrett-Evangelical cooperates with the Ecumenical Theological Seminary in Detroit in a program that enables students to take up to half of their work toward a master's degree in Detroit. =Dual Degree in Social Work with Loyola University= Garrett-Evangelical and the School of Social Work of Loyola University of Chicago have a cooperative agreement for a dual degree program leading to the MSW at Loyola and the MDiv at Garrett-Evangelical. Selected courses may be applied to the respective degrees at each school. Students must be admitted to both schools. =Seminary Consortium for Urban Pastoral Education= Garrett-Evangelical has historically collaborated with SCUPE (Seminary Consortium for Urban Pastoral Education), which used to exist as a program to empower seminarians for urban ministry.https://www.scupe.org/mission-vision/ In February 2017, SCUPE underwent restructuring and became OMNIA Institute for Contextual Leadership, which is now focused on global training in all walks of life. As OMNIA moves its mission away from the seminary focus, it has maintained its relationship with Garrett-Evangelical, but classes no longer count for credit. In place of the SCUPE classes, Garrett-Evangelical has worked to offer more contextually appropriate and public theology-focused classes. =Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary= Garrett-Evangelical and Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary (AMBS) have partnered to provide students at AMBS seeking ordination in the United Methodist Church the opportunity to earn a certificate in United Methodist Studies from Garrett-Evangelical. In return, AMBS will provide a set of courses for a concentration and/or certificate in Peace Studies for Garrett-Evangelical students. Some of these courses will be made available online, some by intensive courses in January and the summer, and some during regular semester terms on the campuses in Evanston or Elkhart. Another component of the partnership is that each school will also provide staff to advise students in fulfilling the expectations for these certificates.

Born √ñsel Hita Torres' to Mar√≠a Torres and Francisco Hita, he was designated soon after his birth as the tulku or reincarnation of Thubten Yeshe‚Äîmaking him one of only a handful of Western tulkus‚Äîand renamed Tenzin √ñsel Rinpoche.'‡Ωñ‡Ω¶‡æü‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ω†‡Ωõ‡Ω≤‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ω†‡Ωº‡Ωë‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω¶‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ω¢‡Ω≤‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωî‡Ωº‡ºã‡ΩÜ‡Ω∫‡ºã For many years \\"Lama √ñsel\\" was expected to succeed to leadership of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), the organization co-founded by Yeshe. As a university student, \\"Oz\\" (as he came to be known) gradually distanced himself from the FPMT, and in 2009 made media statements indicating his intention to pursue a life independent of that organization. However, he remained a follower of Tibetan Buddhism and an FPMT supporter, joining that organization's board of trustees in 2010. Despite this, as of 2018 he was no longer listed on FPMT's Board of Directors.  Biography  Hita's parents, Mar√≠a Torres and Francisco Hita, had been students of Lama Yeshe, and the suggestion was raised soon after his birth that Hita might be Yeshe's tulku (reincarnation). Fourteen months later, after certain traditional tests, the Dalai Lama formally recognized him as such. As a child \\"Lama √ñsel\\" was heavily promoted by the FPMT, and made the subject of a book by Vicki Mackenzie, Reincarnation: The Boy Lama (Wisdom Publications, 1996). As a youth Hita studied traditional Tibetan subjects at Sera Monastery in southern India, and simultaneously received private tutoring in Western subjects. The question of his Tibetan education, and involvement with the FPMT, was one of the issues surrounding his parents' divorce. At some point Hita gave up his monastic robes and distanced himself from the FPMT in favor of a more avant-garde lifestyle, for example performing at the 2007 Burning Man festival. He later attended St. Michaels University School, a private high school in Victoria, British Columbia. Once he passed his ASATs in Canada, he moved to Switzerland and studied western philosophy, human rights, French and art. After six months he decided to leave for Italy, ending up in Bologna working with Matteo Passigato, an experienced camera operator. There he spent another 6 months working different jobs related to cinema and TV. Once he came back to Spain he decided to study film. So at the age of 20 he spent two years at the NIC school in Madrid getting his director of cinema diploma. Then another year for director of photography. After that he did a master for documentaries at EIMA which took one more year. In 2011, Osel is said to have joined the board of the FPMT although as of January 2019 he is not listed as a Director on the FPMT website, and there has not been any notification that he was expelled or had resigned from or otherwise left the FPMT Board of Directors. In November 2012 he is said to have written a \\"letter to the FPMT family.\\" although as of December 2018 there is no longer any trace of this letter on this section on the FPMT website. The FPMT has also created a news and information page for him. although as of January 2019 no news or information about him has been posted there since his birthday on 11 February 2018, i.e. for nearly one year. In December 2012 he released his film Being Your True Nature. Osel Hita Torres is the fifth of nine siblings: Yeshe, Harmonia, Lobsang, and Dolma (all older); and (younger brothers) Kunkyen, Sonam, Ramses and Tristan. Osel lived in Spain for some years with his girlfriend Mai Le Turquais. According to his FPMT news and information page however, his new partner Indila Dora gave birth to their son Tenzin Norbu in 2017.  Personal Development  After attaining his majority, formulaic greetings regularly appeared in FPMT publications. In May 2009, Hita gave an interview for Babylon Magazine, a bilingual (Spanish/English) Madrid periodical. In it he expressed belief in reincarnation, and admiration for Lama Zopa and the Dalai Lama, while complaining of discomfort with his exile Tibetan environs: :\\"I returned to Spain because I had arrived at a point where I no longer fitted within that life. I couldn't find myself, because for me it was a lie being there living something that was imposed from outside.\\" Having left Sera monastery at eighteen, without going on for the geshe degree, he felt unqualified to teach, as the FPMT expected of him: \\"The literal translation of lama is teacher, and I'm no teacher.\\" Similar, but more pointed, remarks soon appeared in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo: :\\"Con 14 meses ya me hab√≠an reconocido y llevado a la India. Me vistieron con un gorro amarillo, me sentaron en un trono, la gente me veneraba... Me sacaron de mi familia y me metieron en una situaci√≥n medieval en la que he sufrido much√≠simo. Era como vivir en una mentira.\\" :[\\"At 14 months I was recognized and taken to India. They dressed me in a yellow hat, they sat me on a throne, people worshipped me ... They took me away from my family and put me in a medieval situation in which I suffered a lot. It was like living a lie.\\"] Extracts appeared the following day in The Guardian (UK). Wisdom Publications (the FPMT publisher) then reported on these developments on its blog under the title \\"Tempest in a Teapot,\\" claiming that Hita's original comments had been misrepresented and taken out of context. According to Wisdom, the article from El Mundo had been based on the one for Babylon Magazine. On 3 June 2009, a message from Hita appeared on the FPMT website, saying that despite the difficulties alluded to above, he was \\"privileged\\" to have received an education rooted in both Eastern and Western cultures. However, as of 2018 this message could not be found on the link provided: :\\"That experience was really good and I so appreciate it. However, certain media find ways to sensationalize and exaggerate an unusual story. So I hope that what appears in news print is not read and taken too literally. Don't believe everything that is written! Experience shows that however hard one tries in interviews to sincerely and honestly convey key information, the printed result can tend towards sensationalism to get the most attention. FPMT is doing a great job and Lama Zopa is an immensely special person ‚Äì very inspiring and a great yogi. [...] There is no separation between myself and FPMT...\\" Hita reiterated his plans to pursue a career in cinematography. However, in a video posted on Youtube in December 2018, on 27 December 2018 he gave a two-part, 3-hour long talk to students at the FPMT-affiliated Tibetan Buddhist Centre, Institut Vajra Yogini, at Lavaur, near Toulouse, France. In November 2019, Hita showed his commitment to supporting the UK Daily Mirror's \\"Million Trees\\" Campaign, along with the 14th Dalai Lama and Hollywood legend Richard Gere.\\"Hollywood legend Richard Gere urges Mirror readers to plant trees around the world\\" - UK Daily Mirror article by Michelle Klepper, 21 November 2019  Resumption of his vocation  A documentary about Hita's life, called The Reluctant Lama, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 28 September 2012. The documentary was produced by Beth O'Dea and presented by Jolyon Jenkins. According to videos posted on the internet, we know that he resumed teaching dharma from 2012, in Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, India, Spain, France, United Kingdom, Holland, United States etc. At the Vajra Yoginƒ´ Institute in France, which he founded during his previous life, he lectures on the teaching of the Buddha in English, sometimes with words and short sentences in French.

It is the dominant winter football code in the states of New South Wales and Queensland.http://jss.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/2/221 David Rowe, Rugby League in Australia: the Super League Saga, Journal of Sport & Social Issues, Vol. 21, No. 2, pp. 221-226 (1997) In 2009, it was the most watched sport on Australian television eclipsing the AFL nationally for the first time with an aggregate audience of 128.5 million viewers. The elite club competition is the National Rugby League (NRL), which features ten teams from New South Wales, three teams from Queensland, and one team each from Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand. Australia has a rich history of rugby league, first taking up the sport in 1908 alongside people in Britain and New Zealand. The rule changes over the decades have been partly instigated in Australia as well. The country has been dominant over the other rugby league-playing nations for many years, but enjoys a strong rivalry with New Zealand. Commonly known as \\"league\\" or simply \\"football\\", and sometimes referred to as \\"the greatest game of all\\", it is traditionally seen as a \\"working man's sport\\" with its roots in the working class communities of Northern England, compared to rugby union which has its roots in prestigious English public schools. The Australian Rugby League Commission, the sport's governing body in Australia, is working on ways to expand rugby league's popularity across political and social boundaries. History 1900s = By the time England's new \\"Northern Union game\\" arrived in Australia it was fundamentally different from that of the Southern Rugby Union, with lineouts, rucks and two players from each team having already been removed, and the play-the-ball introduced to improve the game's flow. A similar schism to that which occurred in England, and for similar reasons, opened up in the rugby union establishment of Australia, seeing the term \\"rugby league\\" first used for the new game as in the rest of the world, in 1907 at the instigation of the famous test cricketer Victor Trumper. At a meeting in Bateman's Crystal Hotel in Sydney, New South Wales, the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) was formed as a professional organisation. Players were immediately recruited for the new game, and despite the threat of immediate and lifetime expulsion from the rugby union, the NSWRFL managed to recruit Herbert \\"Dally\\" Messenger, the most famous rugby footballer in Sydney at that time.The visit by James Giltinan, Harry Hoyle, and Victor Trumper on Sunday 11 August 1907 to gain the agreement of Dally Messenger's mother, Annie Messenger, for him to switch to the new code is part of Rugby League folklore.Annie Frances Messenger (nee Atkinson) mother of Rugby League Champion, Dally Messenger Rugby league then went on to displace rugby union as the primary football code in New South Wales. Four matches were played in Sydney on the New South Wales Rugby Football League's \\"Foundation Day\\" on 20 April 1908 (Easter Monday) in two double headers. At Wentworth Park in Sydney's Glebe, Easts beat Newtown before Glebe triumphed over Newcastle while at Birchgrove Oval in Balmain, South Sydney beat North Sydney and Balmain beat Wests. On 8 May 1909 the first match of rugby league was played in Brisbane. Past Grammars played against Souths before a handful of spectators at the Gabba. The Newcastle Rugby League was founded in 1910 with four clubs, Central Newcastle, Northern Suburbs, South Newcastle and Western Suburbs. The Illawarra Rugby League was founded in 1911 with five clubs (Dapto, Helensburgh, Mount Keira, Unanderra and Wollongong). In 1911, a Goldfields' League was formed in West Wyalong, and games were played in Tamworth, Aberdeen, and along the South Coast. The game was introduced to Orange in 1912 and spread quickly through the western districts. In 1913 branch leagues were formed at Bathurst, Dubbo, Nowra, and Tamworth. In 1914 and 1915 an amalgamation of rugby league and Australian rules football was considered and trialled. The 1920 Great Britain Lions tour saw a record attendance for any sport at the Sydney Cricket Ground as Australia won the Ashes for the first time on home soil. In 1921 approximately 30,000 people watched a women's rugby league game in Sydney. This set a long- standing record for the highest attendance at a women's sporting competition outside the Olympic or Commonwealth games. The attendance record for a rugby league match in Australia was broken in 1932 when 70,204 people saw Australia play England at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The 50th anniversary of rugby league in Australia was marked by hosting the second ever Rugby League World Cup tournament in 1957. The attendance record for a rugby league match was re- set by the 1965 NSWRFL season's Grand Final between St. George and South Sydney attracting a crowd of 78,065. The 1967 NSWRFL season's grand final became the first football grand final of any code to be televised live in Australia. The Nine Network had paid $5,000 for the broadcasting rights. Arthur Beetson became the first indigenous Australian to captain the national team of any sport when in 1973 he was selected to lead the Kangaroos. Also that year NSWRFL boss Kevin Humphreys negotiated rugby league's first television deal with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. In 1976 Eastern Suburbs became the first rugby league team, and one of the first in Australian sport, to sport a sponsor's name on their jersey. The NSWRFL Premiership spread outside Sydney in 1982 with the introduction of the Illawarra Steelers and Canberra Raiders. In 1986, Brisbane Rugby League player Bob Lindner was the last to be selected from a non-NSWRL club to debut for the Australian national team. 1987 was the last year that a state of Origin player was selected from a non-NSWRL club. In 1988 the NSWRL's first teams from outside the borders of New South Wales were added: the Brisbane Broncos and Gold Coast Giants. In 1993 the Australian Women's Rugby League was formed. The 1993 Winfield Cup Grand Final drew remarkably strong ratings nationwide. The second game of the 1994 State of Origin series was brought south to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and re-set the nation's rugby league attendance record with 87,161. This success had set the scene for a truly national competition which eventuated in 1995 with the addition of teams from Townsville, Perth and even Auckland in New Zealand. However the growth of the competition was severely hampered by one of the biggest corporate disputes in Australian history over control of it: the Super League war. The Super League war was fought in and out of court during the mid-1990s by the News Ltd-backed Super League and Kerry Packer-backed Australian Rugby League organisations over control of the top-level professional rugby league football competition of Australasia. In 1995, New South Wales State of Origin and Kangaroos Test forward Ian Roberts became the first high-profile Australian sports person and first footballer in the world to come out to the public as gay. 1997 was unique in Australian rugby league's history as it was split into two separate competitions: the 1997 ARL season and the 1997 Super League season. The following season the premiership was re-united under the National Rugby League partnership committee, composed of representatives from Australian Rugby League and News Ltd. = 2000s = Centenary of Rugby League logoIn 2008, the centenary year of rugby league in Australia was celebrated, with 2008 World Cup being held and the Royal Australian Mint launching a series of uncirculated coins in November 2007 to commemorate the occasion. The percentage of indigenous players in top-level rugby league premiership was reported to have fallen from 21% in the 1990s to 11% in 2009. In 2009, rugby league's popularity in Australia was confirmed as it had the highest television ratings of any sport. This occurred again in 2010, with an increased number of people watching Rugby League (120 million) compared to AFL (112 million). This is a season when an unprecedented scandal took place: the Melbourne Storm was found to have conducted four systematic breaches of the competition's salary cap, and had all honours gained over the previous years (including 2 premierships) nullified, were forced to pay large fines and shed enough star players to get back under the cap, all while playing the rest of the season already guaranteed the wooden spoon. 2012 saw a major re-structure of the administration of rugby league in Australia. The newly formed independent Australian Rugby League Commission took over control of the National Rugby League premiership, the State of Origin series and the Australian national team. A 2013 report found that behind cricket, rugby league was Australia's second-most popular sport. The same year a report conducted by Brand Finance valued the Penrith Panthers club at $46.2m, the highest of any Australian sporting brand, while the Brisbane Broncos had the highest brand equity. Polling conducted by Roy Morgan Research indicated that in 2014 the NRL was second only to the AFL in terms of football television viewship.  Governing body  Federal Governing Body = The Australian Rugby League Commission is the governing body for the sport of rugby league in Australia and also conducts all representative rugby league, including the national team and the annual State of Origin series. The Australian Rugby League's major club competition is the National Rugby League. = State Based Governing Bodies = At state level, the game is administered by local governing bodies under the control of the ARLC. The state bodies include the New South Wales Rugby League and Queensland Rugby League, as well as Northern Territory Rugby League, South Australian Rugby League, Tasmanian Rugby League, Victorian Rugby League and Western Australia Rugby League which have Affiliate state status. New South Wales has a second governing body, the New South Wales Country Rugby League (NSWCRL) to govern the sport outside the Sydney metropolitan area. In spite of its name, NSWCRL also governs rugby league in the Australian Capital Territory. However, the NSWRL will be absorbing the CRL in the near future.  Club competitions  Wests Tigers vs Canberra Raiders, 2006 The elite professional rugby league club competition in Australia is the National Rugby League (NRL). The NRL's Telstra Premiership is contested by 3 teams from Queensland, 10 from New South Wales, 1 from Victoria and 1 from the Australian Capital Territory as well as 1 team from New Zealand. These teams also field National Youth Competition teams, an Under 20s competition. Underneath the NRL, semi-professional competitions such as the Queensland Cup, New South Wales Cup and NSWRL Jim Beam Cup are run in both New South Wales and Queensland. These competitions are the major feeder competitions for the NRL competition. Alongside these mainly metropolitan-based competitions country rugby league bodies run competitions throughout rural Queensland and New South Wales. Amateur competitions are run in the Affiliated states. = Attendances = Rugby league attendances saw their previously best year in 1995 (the year before Australia's Super League War, with total attendances reaching 3,061,893. Six clubs averaged over 20,000 in that year, a feat still unmatched. This was a large increase on the previous years and was no doubt due to the formation of several new clubs and the renaming of the competition, from the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) to the Australian Rugby league (ARL). A 2004 match between Brisbane Broncos and Canterbury Bulldogs in Brisbane The year of 1996 was a turbulent one for Australian rugby league and saw what may be the largest decrease in attendance ever (2,450,776, down 611,117 down from 1995) in the ARL. This crowd decrease is attributed to the poor publicity surrounding the ongoing court cases related to Super League. When the SL competition was introduced in 1997 and played alongside the ARL competition it attracted 1,111,189. The ARL for the same year saw slightly higher attendances of 1,308,824. Subsequent years of 1998, in which the merger of the SL and ARL formed the National Rugby League (NRL) and 1999 also saw increases. The year 2000 saw club mergers and \\"relegations\\" from the NRL. The effective slashing of clubs from the first grade rugby league competition was reflected in the slashing of crowd figures as fans became disgruntled by the club they had supported for many years being torn apart. Crowd figures did not improve until 2003, with an increase of 249,317 on the previous year, 2002. Figures increased again in 2004 and 2005. The aggregate crowd for 2005 was 2,964,288 and the average crowd figure for regular season matches was 16,468, the highest ever recorded, and 34,710 for play-offs. In 2006, attendance slightly dipped to 2,808,235. An average of 15,601 for regular season matches and 34,163 for playoffs, which was still an improvement on 2004 figures. In 2007, the number of teams competing in first grade rugby league in Australia increased for the first time since 2002 with the re-introduction of the Gold Coast Titans in Gold Coast, Queensland.(Statistics do not include finals) In 2010 Rugby League recorded its best year ever in Australia, setting a new all- time total season attendance record of 3,490,778 spectators ‚Äî and with four less teams than in 1995.  Representative competitions  The State of Origin series is an annual best-of-three series of interstate matches between the two strongest rugby league states Queensland and New South Wales. The State of Origin series is one of Australia's premier sporting events, attracting a huge television audience and usually selling out the stadiums in which the games are played. Beginning in 2012, an Under 20s State of Origin match will be held annually on the same weekend as the Australia vs New Zealand test. City vs Country Origin is an annual Australian rugby league match that takes place in New South Wales between teams made up of NRL players representing 'City' (Sydney metropolitan area) and 'Country' (all areas in NSW outside the Sydney metropolitan area). The Affiliated States Championship is an annual competition involving four affiliated states (Victoria, South Australia, Northern Territory and Western Australia) plus representative sides from the Australian Police and Australian Defence Force.  Demographics of the game  Total participation = In 2008, a total of 423,584 Australians participated in rugby league. Junior league registrations have grown, climbing from 79,000 in 1999 to 120,667 in 2008. In 2008, 269,377 children played rugby league competitively in schools. This is a 390% increase from 2002, when the first accurate census of school competition participation numbers. ARLD schools programs have directly involved more than 1,000,000 children in rugby league-based physical activities by in 2008. In a sign of the game's growing influence, in 2010 over 50,000 Victorian school children attended rugby league school programs. As at 2014, rugby league in Australia had a total player base of 500,000 people.Clearinghouse for Sport = Women in rugby league = The vast majority of rugby league participants are male. Of the 172,000 participants in 2004, 5% were female. The Australian Women's Rugby League was formed in 1993, which only achieved affiliation with the Australian Rugby League in 1998. This is in contrast to the men's competition which has existed since 1908. The lack of female-participation in Australian rugby league can mostly be attributed to the predominantly masculine culture which discourages women from playing, and provides little financial or cultural incentive to play. Despite this, a women's rugby league match in Sydney in 1921 attracted around 30,000 spectators. Females account for a large percentage of rugby league's viewing public and the attraction of the game for women partly accounts for rugby league's very strong position in the Australian sporting landscape. Many NRL clubs hold initiatives to foster this relationship. For instance, in 2005 the Canterbury Bulldogs staged a luncheon for 300 of Sydney's corporate women to raise funds for the National Breast Cancer Foundation, as well as skills development for school girls within the Canterbury-Bankstown district. This follows the increased number of female members to the boards of the National Rugby League and several of its clubs. Manly Sea Eagles also instituted several female directed initiatives, some of which were aimed towards further increasing female spectator numbers. Not all the perceptions of rugby league being a mostly man game are completely true. At a junior and local level there are many women involved in volunteering positions. Women form a very important part of the local club structures. However, it is not customary for women over the age of 11 to continue playing rugby league against the boys and the exclusively women's rugby league clubs have a relatively small profile in comparison to the local boys' clubs. Rugby league became the first mainstream professional sport in Australia to appoint a female director to a governing body, with Katie Page, the managing director of retail giant Harvey Norman, accepting an invitation to join the National Rugby League's executive board. In 2009 the Australian National Women's rugby league side (Jillaroos) defeated the 2008 Women's Rugby League World Champions New Zealand, in Auckland, ending a ten-year streak of successive defeats at the hands of the New Zealand team. = Age = Junior Participation  Recent research by the University of New South Wales has shown that 2% of parents are likely to discourage their son from playing rugby league. In contrast, the next most discouraged sport was rugby union, with only 7.5% of parents willing to discourage the sport. This is despite recent research by Medibank annually since 2003 that puts other sports in Australia, such as Australian Rules Football and soccer as producing more major injuries. The injury rates and the public perception of rugby league as a dangerous sport are most likely the catalysts for the introduction of several initiatives by the national rugby league and ARL development in recent years to curb the number of youth playing other sports. The specific initiatives over the years includes a Safe play code, Kids to kangaroos programmes and new forms of modified rugby league, such as, Mod league and Mini Footy to help young children prepare for the full rigours of the international code. Also with such introductions are the competitions aimed at school children such as Joey league, League of legends and League Sevens, which use modified rugby league rules such as Tag and Sevens. Because of these recent initiatives, junior league registrations have grown climb from 79,000 in 1999 to 120,667 in 2008 while school participation numbers have grown to 269,377. Rugby league gala days, the ARL's free school clinic program and various club projects \\"have directly involved more than 1,000,000 children in rugby-league based physical activities in 2008\\".  Senior Participation  In 2008, 51,540 people participated in senior rugby league. Participation numbers amongst senior divisions tend to decline in higher age groups. While this can be expected to the nature of a physical sport, overall rugby league senior numbers have declined since the early 1990s. The ARL attributes this to game becoming more physically demanding and the increasing pressure to sustain semi-professional clubs and teams. At the same time, however, it notes that \\"rugby league is, generally, missing a recreational game that keeps people playing the sport when they drop out of the so-called elite stream.\\" To combat this, the ARL is investing programs, modified rules and gala days to increase senior participation such as the ARL Masters Carnival. = Location = The Barassi Line splits Australia in two, with Rugby League considered to be more popular East of the line and Australian rules football considered to be more popular to the West. New South Wales and Queensland account for the majority of rugby league participation numbers. However, per capita figures show that Queensland and the Northern Territory rate ahead of New South Wales participation figures, making Queensland and the Northern Territory the largest participators per capita of rugby league in Australia. Rugby league enjoys only minor participation in other states of Australia due to competition with Australia's other premier football code Australian rules football, and the high junior level participation rates of other sports such as soccer and basketball. Victoria and Western Australia have roughly an equal number of participants with Western Australia higher per capita, though Victoria has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, especially in school based rugby league participation which registered 33,444 participants in 2008. South Australia has the lowest participation levels for mainland Australia and Tasmania has, by far, the least participants for rugby league in the entire nation.  The national team  The Australian national rugby league team represents Australia at rugby league. Since 7 July 1994 the team's nickname has been the Kangaroos. Prior to that the Australian team was only referred to as the Kangaroos when on tours of Great Britain and/or France. They are administered by the Australian Rugby League and have been the most dominant national side over the past few decades.  In popular culture  Rugby league has been described as \\"an iconic Australian sport\\" and has therefore featured prominently in Australian popular culture. Famous Australian writers throughout history such as Banjo Paterson, Thomas Keneally and Kenneth Slessor have produced literature about the game.  Media coverage  Due to the widespread interest in rugby league games played, including the State of Origin series, match results, scorelines and reports of injuries to key players, are comprehensively carried by many Australian newspapers. These include the major national daily newspapers; in general match results and reports are published on the weekend of the game and on Mondays, and commentary continues throughout the week, with rugby league-related stories usually to be found in the sporting section of the major newspapers every week-day. All premiership games are broadcast on television, either free-to- air or cable. Online, the ABC, as well as major newsgroups provide articles on Rugby League, bylined in general by a reporter who is exclusively a sports correspondent. The official publication for the NRL is Big League. Interest in rugby league is highest in New South Wales and Queensland; as well, many of the large number of Australian expatriates living and working overseas are avidly interested in the season's games, and are able to ensure that they are kept up-to-date by accessing on-line versions of stories provided by major media organisations. The 2012 State of Origin series' third and deciding game set a new record for the highest television audience in Australia for a rugby league match since the introduction of the OzTam ratings system in 2001. A list of major newspapers which publish rugby league-related stories includes The Australian, The Courier-Mail, Daily Telegraph, The Sydney Morning Herald, Herald Sun and The Age. Matches are broadcast on both Channel 9, Foxtel and in New Zealand by Sky TV. ABC radio's Grandstand programme broadcasts live rugby league games on the weekends. Sydney radio station, 2GB, also broadcasts live NRL matches Friday to Sunday (with their Continuous Call Team).
