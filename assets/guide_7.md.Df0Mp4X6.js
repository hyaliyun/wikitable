Racing 2 is a racing video game for the iOS platform. The game was developed and released by Maciek Drejak Labs on September 6, 2012. It is the sequel to the original VS. Racing, which was released by the same development team on the same platform in 2011. The game was generally well-received, with critics praising the simple but solid gameplay, but criticizing the lack of content in its initial release prior to updates. Gameplay VS. Racing 2 features simple, arcade-like gameplay mechanics. The game is played from a top-down perspective similar to the Micro Machines video games. The player must direct their car through a themed race course faster than competing cars. Cars are controlled by a steering wheel placed in the bottom corner of the touchscreen of the given iOS device; touching in a given direction moves the car in the same direction, and not holding any direction applies the brakes. Winning races, or certain acts, such as passing or running into other racers, earns the player in-game currency, which can be spent on buying new cars, upgrading cars, or making aesthetic changes to cars. A zero to three star ranking based on the quality of the driver's racing also affects the amount of money won. Additionally, the player may opt to use in-app purchases to use real-life currency to purchase more in-game currency. Development The game was developed by the same development team that had released the original VS. Racing for iOS in 2011, which itself had accumulated over 1 million downloads. VS. Racing 2 was initially released at a $0.99 price point at its release on September 6, 2012, but was later switched to a free-to-play pricing model in June 2013. Reception The game was generally well received. Review aggregator Metacritic gave the game a score of 75/100, based on 6 critics reviews. Pocket Gamer praised the game for evenly balanced artificial intelligence for the computer controlled competitors, and concluding that the game was a \\"polished, incredibly enjoyable high-speed blast\\". Slide to Play gave the game a 3 out of 4 rating, praising the game for being fun despite its simplicity, stating \\"While all of this might sound boring or too simple, it never feels that way. The game plays like a retro arcade racer, with a focus on the actual racing.\\" Touch Arcade was a little more critical of the game, stating \\"'A little light' is probably the best way to describe Vs Racing 2...As far as being an arcade racer, the experience is about as smooth as one can expect for a game that focuses more on fundamentals. However, improvements over the original feel relatively minor, and the missing online multiplayer means Vs Racing 2 lacks that big ticket feature that sequels usually try and include. Still, it's an enjoyable arcade racer\\".

It was acquired by the City Hall of Alzira in 1989, and from 1995, is in recovery and restoration both the convent and its environment of La Murta Valley.  Origins  The Valley of la Murta, in Alzira. In 568, under the reign of Liuvigild, San Donato and his hermits who had fled from Africa founded in the Valley, then called Valley of \\"Miralles', a servetano monastery. The Arab invasion in 711 left him devastated and the hermits were dispersed, the founder dying and being buried in the monastery. However its origins are documented in the manuscript 1773 of the father J.B. Morera, scholar of the archive of the monastery, from the fourteenth, when Arnau de Serra alcireno Knight, Lord of the lands of La Murta, authorization of the King Peter IV of Aragon, donated them to a group of hermits established on the Valley with the condition of founding a religious community. He lived under the rule of the Hieronymites. After professing in X√†bia as monks of the Hieronymites order, Pope Gregory XI granted them the bull to found a monastery in 1376.  Construction and period of splendor  Saint Vincent Ferrer. The new monastery was born under the protection of the important Monastery of Sant Jeroni de Cotalba, whose prior, Fray Domingo Lloret, and a group of monks were sent to Alzira in 1401. That same year, on February 11, began construction work according to the Benedictine, enhancing the church building and placing the other buildings around the cloister. In this first stage, in the year 1410, the monastery was visited by Saint Vincent Ferrer. The construction of the church is estimated in the middle of 15th century, time that began to happen the donations. The authorship of the initial work is attributed to Jaime Gallent, master builder of the city of Valencia, historical archive national includes a visit of the juries of Valencia to the monastery in which his name appears. Master Gallent participated in works such as the Portal of Quart and the Trinity, and also in the construction of the Royal Palace of Valencia. The magnificent architectural development of the monastery was due to major donations from illustrious families and personalities, among which were two of the most important Valencian families: the Vich and Villaragut, to which belonged the Juan Bautista Villaragut prior. Other donations were made by the family of the Viscounts of Gallano, the niece of the Treasurer of the Catholic Monarchs Leonor de Heredia, Cardinal Cisneros, Toledo Archbishop and confessor of Queen Isabella the Catholic or the aristocrat Beatriz Proxita and Cronell, among others.  Vich family  Shield noble family Vich. In the 15th century, the Vich family had made donations for the construction of the monastery and had a chapel in the cloister, which was buried Luis Vich and Corbera, \\"Rational master\\" of the Kingdom of Valencia. But it was cardinal Guillermo Raimundo de Vich y de Vallterra (1460 / 1470-1525), Ambassador of the Council of Valencia in Rome, then Archdeacon of X√†tiva and Canon of Valencia, who sought to give a new church to the monastery. The works were financed by Jeronimo Vich and Valterra (1459-1535), Ambassador in Italy of Fernando the Catholic and Emperor Charles I. They were these made by Juan de Alicante and Agust√≠n Mu√±oz, who had done work in the main buildings of Valencia, such as the Valencia Cathedral or the Consulate of the sea in 1528. Is the pigeon Tower. Deceased Guill√©n Ram√≥n Vich and Valterra and Jeronimo Vich and Valterra, his successors maintained the link and his burial, but mainly dedicated its resources to other works. Philip II of Spain. The Princess Isabella Clara Eugenia. In 1586, the monastery was visited by the King Philip II accompanied by Prince Felipe and Isabella Clara Eugenia Princess. The King opened the new access bridge to the monastic enclosure, on the barranco de la Murta, which was baptized with its name. It was in the last years of the 16th century when he started the splendor of the monastery of La Murta from the hand of Juan Vich Manrique de Lara, Ambassador of Spain in the Holy, Mallorca Bishop and Archbishop of Tarragona, which promoted countless improvements and created the library. The monastery treasured an important heritage fruit of donations of the Vich family and other notable families in Exchange for burial. So did another illustrious member of the Vich, Luis Vich, Viceroy of Mallorca and the Order of Santiago Knight. Don Juan Vich and Lara, brother of the former, raised new church whose Chapel would be the new family grave. The work, done by architect Francisco Figuerola's Valencia was supervised by Diego Vich, and completed in 1623. Diego Vich, last member of the dynasty, was one of the most important protectors of Santa Mar√≠a de La Murta. He instructed Juan Miguel Orliens, author of the altarpiece is the altarpiece in 1631 of the Church of los Santos Juanes and the Monastery of San Miguel de los Reyes in Valencia. Painted and gilded by Pedro de Orrente, it was finished in 1634. The monastery became during this stage in a prominent religious and cultural center.  17th and 18th centuries  Following the death of Diego Vich, and with his legacy, the community could conclude the improvements that had been initiated in life of the guard. Along the 18th century monks undertook new improvement works, but already not elected teacher of the first order. The whole of the monastery was enlarged and renovated, stressing reform of the refectory and its bleaching, as well as the cloister, cell of the prior and church which was painted by the Milanese Carlos Lorenzo Soronetti and Pedro Bazzi in 1772. Thus he had done in the Church of Lliria, in the Carthusian monastery of Porta Coeli, and he had been in charge for the cathedrals of Zaragoza and Orihuela. They also highlighted the clad the walls with tiles and the enlargement and improvement of the Inn built in 1657.  Decadence and confiscation  The life in the 19th century was very turbulent in Santa Mar√≠a de La Murta. The provisions left by Diego Vich ceased to be respected, and the decline of the monastery devoted himself to the monks to sell the biggest church organ and some works of art, paintings mostly. In 1835, in the wake of the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendiz√°bal, the monastery was closed. Eleven monks had at that time. In 1838 it passed into private hands, initiating a process of abandonment and looting of their property until its total ruin, which was aggravated to be engulfed the buildings by the nature surrounding them. Precisely that State of ruin in harmony with nature, has aroused the attention of historical and literary, being the monastery of la Murta which aroused more literary forays among all the Valencian Hieronymites monasteries.  Religious characters  Among the characters religious who inhabited the monastery highlighted San Juan de Ribera, Antioquia and Viceroy Patriarch and Archbishop of Valencia, Gilabert Mart√≠, Bishop of Segorbe, fray Peritoya, prior of the monastery and Bishop of Coria, fray Jer√≥nimo Corella, Honduras Bishop, fray Juan de Esteban, Archbishop of Brindisi, fray Vicente de Montalb√°n, general of the Hieronymites, as well as the aforementioned family church members Vich and Saint Vincent Ferrer.  Art and treasures  Along the centuries the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de La Murta, besides its constant architectural enrichment, made collection by patronages and donations of many treasures and works of art, becoming one of the most important historical and artistic monuments of the Valencian Community. However, currently it is not one of the best known, because of its abandonment and long forgotten during 150 years. The multitude of artistic treasures which contained include: the altarpiece where acquired at the beginning of the 16th century, \\"Ver√≥nica\\" and alabaster altarpiece representing \\"The baptism\\" which did bring Italy Jeronimo Vich and Valterra (preserved today in the Museum of fine arts of Valencia), the altarpiece of the \\"Crucifixion\\", precious liturgical objects donated to Juan Vich Manrique de Lara in 1593. 1597 organ, the altar and the choir stalls of the choir, magnificent altarpiece of Saint Joseph, the altarpiece of the chapel of the Kings, the altarpiece of the Nativity of Christ, el retablo of Saint Jerome, the altarpiece of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, \\"Calvary\\", \\"Christ embracing the cross\\" and \\"Christ in Limbo\\" of Sebastiano del Piombo, which are preserved in the Museo Nacional del Prado, a table of El Greco, a \\"Savior\\" of Juan de Juanes and many works paintings of great masters painters such as Albrecht D√ºrer, Jacopo Bassano, the Flemish landscape Paul Bril and Francisco Ribalta, (of which 31 portraits of Juan Ribalta and his workshop are preserved in the Museum of Fine Arts of Valencia), Pedro de Orrente, Jos√© de Ribera or Lorenzo Castro.

C. polykrikoides has a wide geographic range, including North America, Central America, Western India, Southwestern Europe and Eastern Asia. Single cells of this species are ovoidal in shape, 30-50Œºm in length and 25-30Œºm in width. Cochlodinium polykrikoides is a highly motile organism. They are generally found in aggregations of 4 or 8 cell zooids. Chain length is known to be affected by the presence of grazers and the inclusion of vitamins B1,B7 and B12. This species is also capable of mixotrophy, which makes them extremely persistent during a large algal bloom. C. polykrikoides exhibits diel vertical migration. Cochlodinium is thought to have a cyst-type overwintering stage in their life cycle. This process allows C. polykrikoides to produce a specialized cell that is non-motile. These cells aggregate and rest in certain basins until conditions allow for reproduction and colonies to form.  Optimal growth conditions  C. polykrikoides is a euryhaline species, capable of surviving a wide range of salinities. Growth experiments have shown that C. polykrikoides can have greater than 0.3 divisions day-1 in optimal growth conditions (25¬∞C, 34ppt). The growth range C. polykrikoides is 15¬∞C-30¬∞C, 20-36ppt and >30Œºmol m-2 s-1 irradiance. There has been no observed photo- inhibition for C. polykrikoides under high irradiance.  Toxicity  C. polykrikoides is a species that can produce allelopathic chemicals. These chemicals inhibit the growth of other phytoplankton taxa in the water column. The production of such toxins can play important roles in the formation of Harmful Algal Blooms. C. polykrikoides can also generate reactive oxygen species which are lethal to both pelagic fish and shellfish even in low concentrations. Massive blooms In late 2008 and early 2009 (November‚ÄìFebruary) there was a massive bloom of Cochlodinium polykrikoides in the Sea of Oman, off the coast of Oman in the Persian Sea. It was notable for being based on Cochlodinium polykrikoides rather than the Noctiluca scintillans (Noctiluca miliaris) that had been more usual in the immediately previous years. The bloom resulted in massive dying off of fish, damage to coral reefs, and interference with desalinization plants. = Conditions for a Bloom = # Sea Surface Temperature (SST)- SST has been shown to be a huge factor in the growth of C. polykrikoides and thus determining when blooms form. Lab studies have shown that C. polykrikoides have the most significant growth between 25.0ÀöC and 26.0ÀöC. # Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR)- As for almost all planktonic species, there needs to be enough light for these phytoplankton to photosynthesize. Studies have proven that C. polykrikoides have higher growth rates when solar insolation is increased. # Favorable Transport- Many are unsure of the source of where C. polykrikoides are generally found, however, currents play an important role when transporting these toxic phytoplankton to favorable areas for a bloom to spawn. # Upwelling- The nutrient-rich waters that are brought to the photic layer by upwelling hold nutrients (nitrogen compounds, phosphorus compounds, etc.) that are essential in photosynthesis and cell growth. An appropriate wind is needed to cause this upwelling and while also ensuring temperature and transport are also favorable for C. polykrikoides blooms. As climate change continues to affect the oceans, it is predicted that harmful algal blooms (such as red tides caused by Cochlodinium polykrikoides) will be more frequent in the upcoming years.

Robert Fernholz in 2002. It is descriptive as opposed to normative, and is consistent with the observed behavior of actual markets. Normative assumptions, which serve as a basis for earlier theories like modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), are absent from SPT. SPT uses continuous-time random processes (in particular, continuous semi-martingales) to represent the prices of individual securities. Processes with discontinuities, such as jumps, have also been incorporated into the theory.  Stocks, portfolios and markets  SPT considers stocks and stock markets, but its methods can be applied to other classes of assets as well. A stock is represented by its price process, usually in the logarithmic representation. In the case the market is a collection of stock-price processes X_i, for i=1, \\\\dots, n, each defined by a continuous semimartingale : d \\\\log X_i(t) = \\\\gamma_i(t) \\\\, dt + \\\\sum_{ u=1}^d \\\\xi_{i u}(t) \\\\, dW_{ u}(t) where W := (W_1, \\\\dots, W_d) is an n-dimensional Brownian motion (Wiener) process with d \\\\geq n, and the processes \\\\gamma_i and \\\\xi_{i u} are progressively measurable with respect to the Brownian filtration \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{F}_t\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{F}^W_t\\\\\\\\}. In this representation \\\\gamma_i(t) is called the (compound) growth rate of X_i, and the covariance between \\\\log X_i and \\\\log X_j is \\\\sigma_{ij}(t)=\\\\sum_{ u=1}^d \\\\xi_{i u}(t) \\\\xi_{j u}(t). It is frequently assumed that, for all i, the process \\\\xi_{i,1}^2(t) + \\\\cdots + \\\\xi_{i d}^2(t) is positive, locally square-integrable, and does not grow too rapidly as t \\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. The logarithmic representation is equivalent to the classical arithmetic representation which uses the rate of return \\\\alpha_i(t), however the growth rate can be a meaningful indicator of long-term performance of a financial asset, whereas the rate of return has an upward bias. The relation between the rate of return and the growth rate is :\\\\alpha_{i}(t) = \\\\gamma_i(t) + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{ii}(t)}{2} The usual convention in SPT is to assume that each stock has a single share outstanding, so X_i(t) represents the total capitalization of the i-th stock at time t, and X(t) = X_1(t) + \\\\cdots + X_n(t) is the total capitalization of the market. Dividends can be included in this representation, but are omitted here for simplicity. An investment strategy \\\\pi = (\\\\pi_1 , \\\\cdots, \\\\pi_n) is a vector of bounded, progressively measurable processes; the quantity \\\\pi_i(t) represents the proportion of total wealth invested in the i-th stock at time t, and \\\\pi_0(t) := 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\pi_i(t) is the proportion hoarded (invested in a money market with zero interest rate). Negative weights correspond to short positions. The cash strategy \\\\kappa \\\\equiv 0 (\\\\kappa_0 \\\\equiv 1) keeps all wealth in the money market. A strategy \\\\pi is called portfolio, if it is fully invested in the stock market, that is \\\\pi_1(t) + \\\\cdots + \\\\pi_n (t) = 1 holds, at all times. The value process Z_{\\\\pi} of a strategy \\\\pi is always positive and satisfies : d \\\\log Z_{\\\\pi}(t) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\pi_i(t) \\\\, d\\\\log X_i(t) + \\\\gamma_\\\\pi^*(t) \\\\, dt where the process \\\\gamma_{\\\\pi}^* is called the excess growth rate process and is given by : \\\\gamma_{\\\\pi}^*(t) := \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\pi_i(t) \\\\sigma_{ii}(t) -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i,j=1}^n \\\\pi_i(t) \\\\pi_j(t) \\\\sigma_{ij}(t) This expression is non-negative for a portfolio with non-negative weights \\\\pi_i(t) and has been used in quadratic optimization of stock portfolios, a special case of which is optimization with respect to the logarithmic utility function. The market weight processes, : \\\\mu_i(t) := \\\\frac{X_i(t)}{X_1(t) + \\\\cdots + X_n(t)} where i=1, \\\\dots, n define the market portfolio \\\\mu. With the initial condition Z_\\\\mu(0) = X(0), the associated value process will satisfy Z_{\\\\mu}(t) = X(t) for all t. page=1 A number of conditions can be imposed on a market, sometimes to model actual markets and sometimes to emphasize certain types of hypothetical market behavior. Some commonly invoked conditions are: # A market is nondegenerate if the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (\\\\sigma_{ij} (t))_{1 \\\\leq i,j \\\\leq n} are bounded away from zero. It has bounded variance if the eigenvalues are bounded. # A market is coherent if \\\\operatorname{lim}_{t\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} t^{-1} \\\\log(\\\\mu_i(t)) = 0 for all i = 1, \\\\dots, n. # A market is diverse on [0, T] if there exists \\\\varepsilon > 0 such that \\\\mu_{\\\\max}(t) \\\\leq 1 -\\\\varepsilon for t \\\\in [0, T]. # A market is weakly diverse on [0, T] if there exists \\\\varepsilon > 0 such that \\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\int_0^T \\\\mu_{\\\\max}(t)\\\\, dt \\\\leq 1 - \\\\varepsilon Diversity and weak diversity are rather weak conditions, and markets are generally far more diverse than would be tested by these extremes. A measure of market diversity is market entropy, defined by :S(\\\\mu(t)) = -\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\mu_i(t) \\\\log(\\\\mu_i(t)).  Stochastic stability  Figure 2 plots the (ranked) capital distribution curves at the end of each of the last nine decades. This log-log plot has exhibited remarkable stability over long periods of time. The study of such stability is one of the major goals of SPT. thumb300pxrightalt=Figure 3:‚Äúcumulative turnover‚Äù processes. Figure 3 shows the ‚Äúcumulative turnover‚Äù processes at various ranks over the course of a decade. As expected, the amount of turnover increases as one goes down the capitalization ladder. There is also a pronounced linear growth in time across all displayed ranks. We consider the vector process (\\\\mu_{(1)}(t), \\\\dots, \\\\mu_{(n)}(t)), with 0 \\\\leq t < \\\\infty of ranked market weights : \\\\max_{1\\\\leq i \\\\leq n} \\\\mu_i(t) =: \\\\mu_{(1)}(t) \\\\geq \\\\mu_{(2)}(t) \\\\geq \\\\cdots \\\\mu_{(n)}(t) := \\\\min_{1\\\\leq i \\\\leq n} \\\\mu_i(t) where ties are resolved ‚Äúlexicographically‚Äù, always in favor of the lowest index. The log-gaps : G^{(k,k+1)}(t) := \\\\log(\\\\mu_{(k)}(t)/\\\\mu_{(k+1)}(t)), where 0 \\\\leq t < \\\\infty and k=1, \\\\dots, n-1 are continuous, non-negative semimartingales; we denote by \\\\Lambda^{(k,k+1)}(t) = L^{G^{(k, k+1)}}(t ; 0) their local times at the origin. These quantities measure the amount of turnover between ranks k and k+1 during the time-interval [0, t]. A market is called stochastically stable, if (\\\\mu_{(1)}(t), \\\\cdots, \\\\mu_{(n)}(t)) converges in distribution as t \\\\rightarrow\\\\infty to a random vector (M_{(1)} , \\\\cdots, M_{(n)}) with values in the Weyl chamber \\\\\\\\{(x_1, \\\\dots, x_n ) \\\\mid x_1 > x_2 > \\\\dots > x_n \\\\text{ and }\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 1\\\\\\\\} of the unit simplex, and if the strong law of large numbers : \\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}\\\\frac{\\\\Lambda^{(k,k+1)}(t)}{t} = \\\\lambda^{(k,k+1)} > 0 holds for suitable real constants \\\\lambda^{(1,2)}, \\\\dots, \\\\lambda^{(n-1, n)}.  Arbitrage and the numeraire property  Given any two investment strategies \\\\pi,\\\\rho and a real number T > 0, we say that \\\\pi is arbitrage relative to \\\\rho over the time-horizon [0,T], if \\\\mathbb{P}(Z_\\\\pi(T) \\\\geq Z_\\\\rho (T)) \\\\geq 1 and \\\\mathbb{P}(Z_\\\\pi(T) > Z_\\\\rho (T)) > 0 both hold; this relative arbitrage is called ‚Äústrong‚Äù if \\\\mathbb{P}(Z_\\\\pi (T) > Z_\\\\rho (T)) = 1. When \\\\rho is \\\\kappa \\\\equiv 0, we recover the usual definition of arbitrage relative to cash. We say that a given strategy u has the numeraire property, if for any strategy \\\\pi the ratio Z_\\\\pi/Z_ u is a \\\\mathbb{P}‚àísupermartingale. In such a case, the process 1/Z_ u is called a ‚Äúdeflator‚Äù for the market. No arbitrage is possible, over any given time horizon, relative to a strategy u that has the numeraire property (either with respect to the underlying probability measure \\\\mathbb{P}, or with respect to any other probability measure which is equivalent to \\\\mathbb{P}). A strategy u with the numeraire property maximizes the asymptotic growth rate from investment, in the sense that : \\\\limsup_{T\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z_\\\\pi(T)}{Z_ u(T)}\\\\right) \\\\leq 0 holds for any strategy \\\\pi; it also maximizes the expected log-utility from investment, in the sense that for any strategy \\\\pi and real number T > 0 we have : \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\log(Z_\\\\pi(T)] \\\\leq \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\log(Z_ u(T))]. If the vector \\\\alpha(t) = (\\\\alpha_1(t), \\\\cdots, \\\\alpha_n(t))' of instantaneous rates of return, and the matrix \\\\sigma(t) = (\\\\sigma(t))_{1\\\\leq i,j \\\\leq n} of instantaneous covariances, are known, then the strategy : u(t) = \\\\arg\\\\max_{p \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n} (p' \\\\alpha(t) - \\\\tfrac{1}{2}p' \\\\alpha(t) p) \\\\qquad \\\\text{ for all } 0 \\\\leq t < \\\\infty has the numeraire property whenever the indicated maximum is attained. The study of the numeraire portfolio links SPT to the so- called Benchmark approach to Mathematical Finance, which takes such a numeraire portfolio as given and provides a way to price contingent claims, without any further assumptions. A probability measure \\\\mathbb{Q} is called equivalent martingale measure (EMM) on a given time-horizon [0,T], if it has the same null sets as \\\\mathbb{P} on \\\\mathcal{F}_T, and if the processes X_1(t), \\\\dots, X_n(t) with 0 \\\\leq t \\\\leq T are all \\\\mathbb{Q}‚àímartingales. Assuming that such an EMM exists, arbitrage is not possible on [0,T] relative to either cash \\\\kappa or to the market portfolio \\\\mu (or more generally, relative to any strategy \\\\rho whose wealth process Z_\\\\rho is a martingale under some EMM). Conversely, if \\\\pi, \\\\rho are portfolios and one of them is arbitrage relative to the other on [0,T] then no EMM can exist on this horizon.  Functionally-generated portfolios  Suppose we are given a smooth function G : U \\\\rightarrow (0, \\\\infty) on some neighborhood U of the unit simplex in \\\\mathbb{R}^n . We call : \\\\pi_i^{\\\\mathbb{G}}(t) := \\\\mu_i(t) \\\\left( D_i \\\\log(\\\\mathbb{G}(\\\\mu(t))) + 1 \\\\- \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\mu_j(t) D_j \\\\log(\\\\mathbb{G}(\\\\mu(t))) \\\\right) \\\\qquad \\\\text{ for } 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n the portfolio generated by the function \\\\mathbb{G}. It can be shown that all the weights of this portfolio are non-negative, if its generating function \\\\mathbb{G} is concave. Under mild conditions, the relative performance of this functionally-generated portfolio \\\\pi_\\\\mathbb{G} with respect to the market portfolio \\\\mu, is given by the F-G decomposition : \\\\log\\\\left( \\\\frac{Z_{\\\\pi^\\\\mathbb{G}}(T)}{Z_{\\\\mu}(T)} \\\\right) = \\\\log\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{G}(\\\\mu(T))}{\\\\mathbb{G}(\\\\mu(0))} \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\int_0^T g(t) \\\\, dt which involves no stochastic integrals. Here the expression : g(t) := \\\\frac{-1}{2\\\\mathbb{G}(\\\\mu(t))} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^n D_{ij}^2 \\\\mathbb{G}(\\\\mu(t)) \\\\mu_i(t) \\\\mu_j(t) \\\\tau_{ij}^\\\\mu(t) is called the drift process of the portfolio (and it is a non-negative quantity if the generating function \\\\mathbb{G} is concave); and the quantities : \\\\tau_{ij}^\\\\mu(t) := \\\\sum_{ u=1}^n (\\\\xi_{i u}(t) - \\\\xi_ u^\\\\mu(t))(\\\\xi_{j u}(t) - \\\\xi_ u^\\\\mu(t)),\\\\qquad \\\\xi_{i u}(t) := \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mu_i(t) \\\\xi_{i u}(t) with 1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n are called the relative covariances between \\\\log (X_i) and \\\\log (X_j) with respect to the market. = Examples = # The constant function \\\\mathbb{G} := w > 0 generates the market portfolio \\\\mu, # The geometric mean function \\\\mathbb{H}(x) := (x_1 \\\\cdots x_n)^\\\\frac{1}{n} generates the equal-weighted portfolio \\\\varphi_i(n) = \\\\frac{1}{n} for all 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n , # The modified entropy function \\\\mathbb{S}^c(x) = c - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\\\cdot \\\\log(x_i) for any c > 0 generates the modified entropy- weighted portfolio, # The function \\\\mathbb{D}^{(p)}(x) := (\\\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^p)^\\\\frac{1}{p} with 0 < p < 1 generates the diversity-weighted portfolio \\\\delta_i^{(p)}(t) = \\\\frac{(\\\\mu_i(t))^p}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\\\mu_i(t))^p} with drift process (1-p)\\\\gamma_{\\\\delta^{(p)}}^*(t). = Arbitrage relative to the market = The excess growth rate of the market portfolio admits the representation 2\\\\gamma_\\\\mu^*(t) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mu_i(t) \\\\tau_{ii}^\\\\mu(t) as a capitalization- weighted average relative stock variance. This quantity is nonnegative; if it happens to be bounded away from zero, namely : \\\\gamma_\\\\mu^*(t) = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mu_i(t) \\\\tau_{ii}^\\\\mu(t) \\\\geq h > 0, for all 0 \\\\leq t < \\\\infty for some real constant h, then it can be shown using the F-G decomposition that, for every T > \\\\mathbb{S}(\\\\mu(0))/h, there exists a constant c > 0 for which the modified entropic portfolio \\\\Theta^{(c)} is strict arbitrage relative to the market \\\\mu over [0, T]; see Fernholz and Karatzas (2005) for details. It is an open question, whether such arbitrage exists over arbitrary time horizons (for two special cases, in which the answer to this question turns out to be affirmative, please see the paragraph below and the next section). If the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (\\\\sigma_{ij}(t))_{1\\\\leq i,j \\\\leq n} are bounded away from both zero and infinity, the condition \\\\gamma_\\\\mu^*\\\\geq h > 0 can be shown to be equivalent to diversity, namely \\\\mu_{\\\\max} \\\\leq 1 - \\\\varepsilon for a suitable \\\\varepsilon \\\\in (0, 1). Then the diversity-weighted portfolio \\\\delta^{(p)} leads to strict arbitrage relative to the market portfolio over sufficiently long time horizons; whereas, suitable modifications of this diversity-weighted portfolio realize such strict arbitrage over arbitrary time horizons.  An example: volatility-stabilized markets  We consider the example of a system of stochastic differential equations : d\\\\log(X_i(t)) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2\\\\mu_i(t)}\\\\, dt + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\mu_i(t)}\\\\, dW_i(t) with 1\\\\leq i \\\\leq n given real constants \\\\alpha \\\\geq 0 and an n-dimensional Brownian motion (W_1 , \\\\dots, W_n). It follows from the work of Bass and Perkins (2002) that this system has a weak solution, which is unique in distribution. Fernholz and Karatzas (2005) show how to construct this solution in terms of scaled and time-changed squared Bessel processes, and prove that the resulting system is coherent. The total market capitalization X behaves here as geometric Brownian motion with drift, and has the same constant growth rate as the largest stock; whereas the excess growth rate of the market portfolio is a positive constant. On the other hand, the relative market weights \\\\mu_i with 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n have the dynamics of multi-allele Wright-Fisher processes. This model is an example of a non-diverse market with unbounded variances, in which strong arbitrage opportunities with respect to the market portfolio \\\\mu exist over arbitrary time horizons, as was shown by Banner and Fernholz (2008). Moreover, Pal (2012) derived the joint density of market weights at fixed times and at certain stopping times.  Rank-based portfolios  We fix an integer m \\\\in \\\\\\\\{2, \\\\dots, n - 1\\\\\\\\} and construct two capitalization-weighted portfolios: one consisting of the top m stocks, denoted \\\\zeta, and one consisting of the bottom n - m stocks, denoted \\\\eta. More specifically, : \\\\zeta_i(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^m \\\\mu_{(k)}(t) \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_i(t) = \\\\mu_{(k)}(t)\\\\\\\\}}} {\\\\sum_{l=1}^m \\\\mu_{(l)}(t)} \\\\qquad \\\\text{ and } \\\\eta_i(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=m+1}^n \\\\mu_{(k)}(t) \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_i(t) = \\\\mu_{(k)}(t)\\\\\\\\}}} {\\\\sum_{l=m+1}^n \\\\mu_{(l)}(t)} for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n. Fernholz (1999), (2002) showed that the relative performance of the large-stock portfolio with respect to the market is given as : \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z_\\\\zeta(t)}{Z_\\\\mu(t)}\\\\right) = \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{(1)}(T) + \\\\cdots + \\\\mu_{(m)}(T)} {\\\\mu_{(1)}(0) + \\\\cdots + \\\\mu_{(m)}(0)} \\\\right) \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^T \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{(m)}(t)}{\\\\mu_{(1)}(t) + \\\\cdots + \\\\mu_{(m)}(t)} \\\\,d\\\\Lambda^{(m, m+1)}(t). Indeed, if there is no turnover at the mth rank during the interval [0, T], the fortunes of \\\\zeta relative to the market are determined solely on the basis of how the total capitalization of this sub-universe of the m largest stocks fares, at time T versus time 0; whenever there is turnover at the m-th rank, though, \\\\zeta has to sell at a loss a stock that gets ‚Äúrelegated‚Äù to the lower league, and buy a stock that has risen in value and been promoted. This accounts for the ‚Äúleakage‚Äù that is evident in the last term, an integral with respect to the cumulative turnover process \\\\Lambda^{(m,m+1)} of the relative weight in the large-cap portfolio \\\\zeta of the stock that occupies the mth rank. The reverse situation prevails with the portfolio \\\\eta of small stocks, which gets to sell at a profit stocks that are being promoted to the ‚Äúupper capitalization‚Äù league, and buy relatively cheaply stocks that are being relegated: : \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z_\\\\eta(t)}{Z_\\\\mu(t)}\\\\right) = \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{(m+1)}(T) + \\\\cdots + \\\\mu_{(n)}(T)} {\\\\mu_{(m+1)}(0) + \\\\cdots + \\\\mu_{(n)}(0)} \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int_0^T \\\\frac{\\\\mu_{(m+1)}(t)}{\\\\mu_{(m+1)}(t) \\\\+ \\\\cdots + \\\\mu_{(n)}(t)}. It is clear from these two expressions that, in a coherent and stochastically stable market, the small- stock cap-weighted portfolio \\\\zeta will tend to outperform its large-stock counterpart \\\\eta, at least over large time horizons and; in particular, we have under those conditions : \\\\lim_{T\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{Z_\\\\eta(t)}{Z_\\\\mu(t)}\\\\right) = \\\\lambda^{(m, m+1)} \\\\mathbb{E} \\\\left( \\\\frac{M_{(1)}}{M_{(1)} + \\\\cdots + M_{(m)}} \\\\+ \\\\frac{M_{(m+1)}}{M_{(m+1)} + \\\\cdots + M_{(n)}} \\\\right) > 0. This quantifies the so-called size effect. In Fernholz (1999, 2002), constructions such as these are generalized to include functionally generated portfolios based on ranked market weights.  First- and second-order models  First- and second- order models are hybrid Atlas models that reproduce some of the structure of real stock markets. First-order models have only rank-based parameters, and second-order models have both rank-based and name-based parameters. Suppose that X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n is a coherent market, and that the limits : \\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}_k^2 = \\\\lim_{t\\\\to\\\\infty} t^{-1}\\\\langle\\\\log\\\\mu_{(k)}\\\\rangle (t) and : \\\\mathbf{g}_k = \\\\lim_{T\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{T}\\\\int_0^T\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\\\\\{r_t(i)=k\\\\\\\\}}\\\\,d\\\\log\\\\mu_i(t) exist for k=1,\\\\ldots,n, where r_t(i) is the rank of X_i(t). Then the Atlas model {\\\\widehat X}_1,\\\\ldots,{\\\\widehat X}_n defined by : d\\\\log {\\\\widehat X}_i(t) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\mathbf{g}_k\\\\,\\\\mathbf{1}_{,dt \\\\+ \\\\sum_{k=1}^n\\\\mathbf{\\\\sigma}_k \\\\mathbf{1}_{,dW_i(t), where {\\\\hat r}_t(i) is the rank of \\\\widehat X_i(t) and (W_1,\\\\ldots,W_n) is an n-dimensional Brownian motion process, is the first-order model for the original market, X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n. Under reasonable conditions, the capital distribution curve for a first-order model will be close to that of the original market. However, a first-order model is ergodic in the sense that each stock asymptotically spends (1/n)-th of its time at each rank, a property that is not present in actual markets. In order to vary the proportion of time that a stock spends at each rank, it is necessary to use some form of hybrid Atlas model with parameters that depend on both rank and name. An effort in this direction was made by Fernholz, Ichiba, and Karatzas (2013), who introduced a second-order model for the market with rank- and name-based growth parameters, and variance parameters that depended on rank alone.

History The agency was founded in 2006 by Marc Dfouni and Nemr Nicolas Badine. Prior to Eastline‚Äôs establishment, Dfouni was the general manager of a web interactive agency in Canada. Badine meanwhile designed multimedia systems used in live performances by artists such as U2, Paul McCartney and Madonna. At the time of Eastline‚Äôs inception, the online marketing field was virtually nonexistent in the MENA region. However, little by little, Internet use in the Middle East began growing considerably. As a result of this, the agency started expanding its operations and working with clients based in Dubai, Qatar, Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia. Eastline has developed campaigns for Middle Eastern and global brands such as Toyota, AZADEA Group, DHL, Kimberly-Clark, Bank Audi, Fransabank, Henkel, Avis, AXA Insurance, Marks & Spencer, JoueClub, and Waterfront City. It also organized and implemented a holistic online strategy for the 2009 Beirut Marathon. The agency has produced its own web platform named Sweepz, which allows clients to launch social media promotional campaigns. Sweepz is the only platform that supports the Arabic language. Dfouni and Badine were selected as high impact entrepreneurs by Endeavor (an NGO that supports entrepreneurs of emerging market countries) in 2011.

Dura- Europos was an important trading center in Roman Syria. It may or may not be the same as the \\"Doura\\" recorded in Shapur I's inscriptions. The town was in Sasanian hands for some time after its fall, and was later abandoned. Intact archaeological evidences at Dura provide details of the Roman presence there, and the dramatic course of the siege. The garrison was determined to resist the siege, and the Sasanians employed a variety of siege warfare techniques to defeat them. Archaeological evidences suggest that the garrison at Dura- Europos was mixed, composed of Cohors XX Palmyrenorum (which is known more than the others), vexillations from Legio IV Scythica Valeriana Galliena, III Cyrenaica, XVI Flavia Firma, and other cohorts, including Cohors II Paphlagonum Galliana Volusiana and possibly Cohors II Equestris. The relationship between these forces are uncertain. XX Palmyrenorum was certainly based in Dura-Europos, and may have been an \\"inferior\\" contingent of the garrison relative to the legionaries. The numbers of the legionaries are unknown. The use of chemical weapons The siege was notable for the early use of chemical weapons by the attacking Persian army. During the siege the attackers dug several underground shaft mines under the city walls. The Romans dug tunnels to reach the mines and fight the diggers underground. In one such tunnel, when the Romans broke through into the Sassanian tunnel the tunnelers ignited a mixture of sulfur and pitch, producing a cloud of sulfur dioxide, which killed twenty Roman soldiers, one of which was carrying a coin dated 256, allowing the dating of the siege. Archaeologists excavated the scene in the 1930s. In 2009 tests showed the presence of sulfur dioxide inside the tunnel.‚ÄúDeath Underground: Gas Warfare at Dura-Europos,‚Äù Current Archaeology, November 26, 2009 (online feature) http://www.archaeology.co.uk/cwa/world- news/death-underground-gas-warfare-at-dura-europos.htm (accessed October 3, 2014)Samir S.

Both were built in the early 20th century; the Knickerbocker garage was added to the Arnink garage 12 years after it was built. In 1980, they were listed on the National Register of Historic Places; nine years later they were both demolished and delisted. At the time, many garages were adapted from stables or carriage houses. The first to be built, the smaller, was instead adapted from an existing commercial building by the owner of a successful Ford dealership in the city for his car-rental and repair service. His superintendent later bought the business from him and had the larger one built in the same style by the same architect. They were among the earliest structures in Albany built specifically in response to the increasing use of the automobile at that time. Their neo-Gothic cast stone facades are an unusual choice of style and material for that time. They may have been inspired by the nearby Delaware and Hudson Railroad office building, a contemporary catalyst for the redevelopment of downtown that is today the system administration building for the State University of New York. One was later converted into a warehouse and used for that purpose until its demolition. That came about as part of a plan for two large office towers proposed for the neighborhood as redevelopment. Nothing has been built on the space since; it is used as part of a parking lot that serves another nearby redevelopment project, the Times Union Center. Buildings The two garages were located on the south side of downtown Albany in a lot on the south side of Hudson Avenue, midway between South Pearl Street (New York State Route 32) and Green Street. The terrain is generally flat and the Hudson River lies to the east. Today the land is, along with everything east to Green, a parking lot. The buildings of the Downtown Albany Historic District, including the city's oldest building 48 Hudson Avenue, are two blocks to the north and east. An 18-story office tower is located on the west. Across the street is a large parking garage serving the Times Union Center arena and another old, commercial building to the northwest at the corner of Hudson Avenue and South Pearl Street. The arena is across South Pearl Street. To the south, just beyond Division Street, is the elevated South Mall Arterial, which leads from nearby Interstate 787 at the Dunn Memorial Bridge to the parking areas under Empire State Plaza. Both buildings used a structural system of steel framing and reinforced concrete. The exteriors were brick faced in cast stone. The Knickerbocker, at 72 Hudson Avenue, was four stories tall; the Arnink's was three stories; both buildings were three bays wide and had flat-roofs. Different materials in the composite for the cast stone meant the Knickerbocker had distinct golden hue that resembled the color of sandstone while the Arnink was granite gray. The upper fenestration of both garages was similar. The Knickerbocker's street entrance was a single, wide, pointed arch stretching across all three bays with separate entrances. Its window spandrels had decorative touches that were intended to mimic Gothic tracery. On the Arnink, every bay had a separate garage; the western one was slightly larger and each garage had a pointed-arch entrance with an original folding door and a metal lantern-style light above. Above it was a frieze that bore the inscription \\"Arnink Garage 1915\\" carved into the cast stone. The garages were set with casement windows that continued with the large, pointed- arch windows in the upper stories. Between them the tracery continued. At the top of the Arnink were cast-stone finials shaped like bells. At the time they were listed on the Register, the Knickerbocker was used a Hertz rental-car location and a vertical, illuminated sign with the company name was affixed to the facade. This was the only significant modification to either building during their lifetimes. History In 1914, a downtown redevelopment plan based on City Beautiful movement principles led to the construction of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad's (D&H;) new headquarters, today the State University of New York (SUNY) System Administration Building. The Flemish Gothic edifice by local architect Marcus T. Reynolds, closely copied from the Cloth Hall in Ypres, Belgium, was meant to be a focal point for traffic coming down from Capitol Hill to the west via State Street. To further this goal, the industrial structures along the riverfront behind it were demolished. alt=A parking lot next to a multistory parking deck, with a tall modern concrete, brick and glass high-rise at right The new building drew much praise, and local merchants and businessmen were inspired to emulate it in their own. Henry Arnink, a local dealer of Ford Model T's, had expanded his business to include repair and rental services by that time. He bought the existing three- story structure at 74 Hudson and renovated and expanded it. Local architect J. Walter Montross oversaw the project, designing a cast stone Gothic exterior that may have been intended to echo the nearby D&H; Building. Twelve years after Arnink moved into the new building he sold the business to his superintendent, Harry Knickerbocker. Wanting to expand the business, Knickerbocker again commissioned Montross. The second garage was similar to the first in decoration and overall form, save for an extra story at the top. It differed in its wide single garage at the street level with no text and lacked the roofline finials. In 1947 Knickerbocker sold the Arnink garage to another concern, which converted it into a warehouse. Both buildings were still in use for those businesses at the time they were listed on the Register three decades later. Knickerbocker had by then become a franchisee of the Hertz car-rental chain, which necessitated placing a large series of illuminated signs with that company's name letter by letter down the two stories above the garage, between the eastern bays. That would be the only significant change made to either building following their construction. By the late 1980s the neighborhood had changed. Another Register-listed property nearby, the Abrams Building, had been demolished to clear the way for a new arena, now known as the Times Union Center. In 1988 plans for two large office towers at the corner of South Pearl and Hudson were approved by the city. While the two garages did not overlap the new buildings' footprint, it was necessary to demolish them anyway to provide enough parking. That was accomplished in early 1989; they were delisted a month later.

After the fondation of the Ottoman empire around 1300, the title of Sheikh-ul-Islam, formerly used in the Abbasid Caliphate, was given to a leader authorized to issue legal opinion or fatwa. During the reign of Sultan Murad II, (1421-1444, 1446-1451) the position became an official title, with authority over other muftis in the empire. In the late 16th century, Sheikh-ul-Islam were assigned to appoint and dismiss supreme judges, high ranking college professors, and heads of Sufi orders.

It was translated into English by Peter Theroux. The novel, and the quintet of which it is the first volume, describes the far-reaching effects of the discovery of huge reserves of oil under a once-idyllic oasis somewhere on the Arabian peninsula. ‚ÄúOil is our one and only chance to build a future,\\" Munif once told Theroux, \\"and the regimes are ruining it.‚Äù In the novel and its sequels, great oil-rich cities are soon built, described as cities of salt. \\"Cities of salt,\\" said Munif when asked by Tariq Ali to explain the book's title, \\"means cities that offer no sustainable existence. When the waters come in, the first waves will dissolve the salt and reduce these great glass cities to dust. In antiquity, as you know, many cities simply disappeared. It is possible to foresee the downfall of cities that are inhuman. With no means of livelihood they won't survive.\\"  Author and composition  Abdul Rahman Munif was born in 1933 with a Saudi Arabia origin. He grew up in Jordan under the influence of the British Empire. He was stripped of his Saudi citizenship for political reasons, namely his criticism on the royal family's use of oils. He earned a license in law from Baghdad and Cairo Universities, and his Ph.D. in oil economics from the University of Belgrade. He subsequently served as Director of Planning in the Syrian Oil Company and Director of Crude Oil Marketing as a part of his career in the field of oil. He was editor-in-chief of a monthly periodical, Al-Naft wal Tanmiya (Oil & Development), in Baghdad. These early hands-on experience with oil development in Arab countries provide Munif invaluable insights in his writings. Cities of Salt, which is the first novel of a trilogy (other two being the Trench 1991 and Variations on Night and Day 1993), was written during his stay in France and originally published in Beirut in 1984. For more, please see Abdul Rahman Munif.  Characters (selected)  * Miteb al- Hathal is a patriarchal figure of the poorest and proudest Atoum tribe. He is a protector of the village and opposition to Ibn Rashed. He has been a witness of the old Wadi Al-Uyoun and he is very wary of the motivation of the intruding Americans. When the excavating oil and the total transformation of the Wadi are irreversible, Miteb left Wadi in grief and ever since become a haunting phantom that allegedly will return with vengeance one day. * Ibn Rashed is the owner of the encampment that served the arriving Americans. He eagerly cooperated with Americans to excavate oils, hire local labors, and relocate people. He is unwilling to get himself into troubles when Mizban died. Many hated him because of his greed and coarseness. Towards the end, Ibn Rashed died and his death complicates people's feelings towards him. * Umm Khosh is a mother of a long-traveling son. She has kept her faith in waiting for her son's return to Wadi despite mocking from kids and others. The poor women died when people were forced to leave the town due to excavation of oil and constructions. * The emir is a young authoritative ruler of the region. He supports the Americans' drilling of oil and firmly believes the government knows better about the issue when confronted by Miteb. However, he refused to sing for the Americans as it is a self-abasing gesture. Emir become obsessed with Western technologies, especially the radios and cars. The emir left Harran after riots of workers broke out. * Abdu Muhammad is the baker in Harran. He adorned the bakery with pictures that he torn out of the foreign magazines, mostly pictures of women. Abdu would lock himself up in his bakery without explaining what has happened. Later on, people learnt that he has felt in love with one of the women on the American cruise. He is a figure that represents the influence of Western cultures on Arab people. * Mizban and Hajem are brothers of working class. They are the few local people who are good at swimming. Most people are afraid of water since they rarely have been to seaside in their life. Mizban and Hajem are eager to teach the workers to swim. In the middle of the book, Mizban drowned and died when he was trying to board the boat and stuck his foot in the crevice of a boulder. Hajem and his uncle are forced to leave after Mizban's death. * Akoub and Raji are truck drivers working on the Ujra-Harran road after the emergence of commercial towns. Akoub is an Armenian Christian. They are initially competitors but bond together when their jobs are threatened by the faster American trucks owned by large companies. They refuse to sell their old trucks to the company. Akoub died due to illness at the end of the book. Akoub and Raji represent those people who struggle for living when facing superior Western technologies. * Subhi al-Mahmilji is an upperclass doctor that practices modern medicine. He is initially a foe of Mufaddi but they developed friendship later on. * Mufaddi al-Jeddan is a local doctor that practices traditional, arguably outdated and sometimes misleading, medicine. Mufaddi is contempt of money and refuse to receive payment for treatment. Mufaddi is the first prisoner of the emir because of his protest against capitalism. Mufaddi got killed by Johar in the end. * Hassan Rezaie, businessman working for the American company. He is eager to bring western technologies, such as the radio, to the emir. * Johar, the commander of the newly formed Desert Army.  Style and genre  * Cities of Salt diverges from typical novel forms as it doesn't have one prolonged and consistent storyline. Instead, the book tells several episodes of the reactions and fates of lower-class working people after the emergence of petro-capitalism. Some scholars also argue the fact that the novel does not have a conventional protagonist also makes it atypical. Others identify the community of working class Arabs as an aggregate protagonist. * Boullata claims Cities of Salt is a postcolonial writing because the narrative of cultural encounter between Orient and Occident is an attempt to \\"establish Arab authenticity and disengage itself from Western influences\\". * Munif presents himself as a historian of Arab life that chronicles the every-day concerns and issues of the oppressed Arabs and transcribe them into words. * The term \\"petrofiction\\" is coined by Amitav Ghosh to classify literature about the oil industry. Cities of Salt is a masterpiece of the sub-genre. * Cities of Salt is closer to literary realism as it loyal depicts the everyday life and activities among lower class Arabs with little \\"romantic idealization or dramatization\\".  Themes  = Role of resource = Petroleum and a logic of extraction figure is central in the making and breaking of community. Munif asks what kind of role does petroleum plays in Arab societies. Oil appeared to be a source of wealth from the outside whereas in reality, it \\"impoverished the Arab and hijacked his destiny\\". Numerous societal phenomena, including \\"the oil press\\", \\"modern-day oil life\\", and \\"oil Islam\\", have risen because of oil. Unfortunately, abundant oil has not brought sustainable economic growth nor democratic reforms. In the book, petrodollars perpetuate oppressions. American companies are the ones that profit the most and consequently they can lay off employees and settle the death of Mizban. The emir is able to imprison Mufaddi and form armies. Mapping this onto the larger real world, we have witnessed numerous conflicts fighting for oils: the Gulf War, the Oil Crisis, the Iraq War. Oil economy disincentives Arab nations to diversify their composition of economies. = Encounter of the Occident and the Orient =  Technological  Manpower stands no chance against superior Western technologies. The increase of productivity and wealth often comes with price of collapse of domestic industries and unemployment. In the novel, Akoub and Raji lost their job as truck drivers when faster and more efficient American trucks appear. People also feel amazed and ignorant when personally seeing all the incredible Western inventions. For example, the emir becomes a curious little child when trying to figure out how the radios work.  Cultural  The influx of modern western cultures pose great challenges to the beliefs in the relatively isolated community. In the book, the \\"Satan's ship\\" is a boisterous American cruise that carried many blond American women in nudity. Many Arab people deem this as a corruption of their soul, a psychological shock to the socially conservative and religious society, and something they can not easily forget. Abdu Muhammad is surrounded in controversies by adorning the bakery with pictures of women from foreign magazines and falling in love with a portrait of an American women. = Price of modernization =  Social alienation and polarization  As the modernization process continues, the emergence of different societal groups often leads to clashes of interests. In the book, readers increasingly see the divergence of two groups of people that have contrasting attitudes towards cooperation with Americans. One group, led by Miteb and working class Arabs are wary of the promises made by capitalists and the repercussions of drastic social transformations. Material self-interests push another group, led by Ibn Rashed and Rezaie, to align themselves with the Americans and create a separate and different identity marked with better living standards, familiarity with modern technology, close relationship with the emir and a relentless desire to dominate. Two incidents illustrate how the proletariats become aware of their lack of rights and power. First, the personnel office requires each worker to be interviewed to determine their classification. Such interviews, however, really give the workers a sense of intrusion and suspicion. Second incident is the death of Mizban. The company refused to pay any retribution and detained Hajem and his uncle. The bourgeois, however, receives much hatred after the happening of multiple incidents. For example, he recruits people with alluring promises but only provides barracks in the end. He is perceived to be colluding with the American company to settle the death of Mizban. The emir becomes obsessed with his \\"new toys\\" and stops to really care about the well- being of his people. Social alienation engenders and consolidates societal split based on class. The book captures the nuanced moment of the emergence of class consciousness: > \\"The shift ended, and all the men drifted home to the two sectors like > streams coursing down a slope, one broad and one small, the Americans to > their camp and the Arabs to theirs, the Americans to their swimming pools, > where their racket could be heard in the nearby barracks behind the barbed > wire. When silence fell, the workers guessed that the Americans had gone > into their air-conditioned rooms whose thick curtains shut everything out: > sunlight, dust, flies, and Arabs.\\" Night Scene of Modern Riyadh.  Breakdown of physical space  ‚ÄúThe old Harran you knew is gone. It has been obliterated‚Äù. With the drilling of oil going on, local people often have to be relocated or travel with the company as their homes are torn down. Palm trees are uprooted as if they are butchered. Ships, trucks, and monstrous machines roar on the construction sites. When travelers return to Wadi, they could barely recognize the place they used to live in. For example, to the returning Fawaz, \\"Wadi seems to be a place he had never seen before. There was no trace of the wadi he had left behind; none of the old things remained.\\"  Loss of cultural identity  Wadi's people's culture is an environmental-based one. People and the environmental components are inseparable. Despite that people remain in the same geographical space, the destructions or losses of any environmental surroundings are equivalent to the stripping of their cultural identities. For example, the people are asked to give up the most precious they owned, the camels. Munif, once again, eloquently expresses such theme: \\"What happened was not just the loss of place called Wadi al-Uyoun, nor any loss that a man could describe or grow accustomed to. He realized that it was a breaking off, like death, that nothing and no one could ever heal.\\" = Oppression and resistance = Oppression and resistance has always been a central theme of Munif's novels. The internal oppression comes from the emir. Mufaddi has been protesting against the corrupting effects of money. He then become the first resident in the emir's jail and eventually murdered by Johar when he refuses to work in stone quarry or leave. The external oppressions are exerted by American colonialism and capitalism. The personnel office conducted interviews that made workers very uncomfortable and vigilant. Workers also realized their powerlessness after the irresponsible and sloppy settlement of the death of Mizban. Finally, American company's arbitrary laying off of workers become the last straw. The mounting unrest and class conflicts eventually erupt into a workers' revolt. Al-Sarrani further explores the humanized resistance of environment by showing the protests and simultaneous fading away of humans, birds, and animals.  Contexts  = Historical context =  The Six-Day War  The Six-Day War, also known as the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, was fought between Israel and its neighboring states Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. The war ended with a total defeat of the Arab nations. Israel seized the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Sinai peninsula. Munif, like many others in his generation, possesses the dreams of rising Arab nations and consider the humiliating loss the most dangerous defeat in the 20th century. Therefore, the defeat urges him to contemplate the causes of the defeat and to question the hierarchies behind these causes. In the Cities of Salt, Munif explores the oppressive political structure in Arab societies as well as the oil that impoverishes Arab people. Discovery of Oil in Saudi Arabia  Discovery of oil  Americans first discovered Saudi Arabian oil in commercial quantities in 1938. US-controlled Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company) began full scale development in 1941. The petrodollars not only brought economic prosperity and international political leverages, but also wasteful government spending and domestic suppressions. The large inflow of foreign workers, commodities, and capitals also fundamentally transformed the religious and idyllic society. Superior Western technologies outcompeted old modes of productions. Western ideas and cultures often challenge Arab people's beliefs. = Political context = Authoritarian states like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and UAE in the Arab world has been using petrodollars to uphold its legitimacy of rulings. Criticisms and dissidence are censored or strictly monitored. Externally, the Arab world is still haunted by the relics of colonialism and imperialism. Britain made many important statements, such as the British Mandate for Palestine and the Balfour Declaration, that led to the creation of Israel. There is also an internal split of opinions on the relationship with the U.S. within the Arab world. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel have eagerly been working with the U.S. while others like Iran and Iraq feel antagonistic to the U.S., marked with the 1973 Oil Crisis and U.S. continuous support of Israel. = Social context = The Arab world is also ambivalent about having a fully secular, western-style society. Iran is still a theocratic country and Saudi Arabia has monarchies. Government and general public are wary of Western influences that might corrupt their heart and mind. For example, Saudi Arabia did not lift the ban on cinemas until recently.  Interpretation  = Title = One possible explanation of the book title \\"Cities of Salt\\" is that both salt and oil are very valuable resources in the past and the present. The analogy is alluding to countries that possess abundant oil resources in the Arab World. Another explanation is offered by Munif himself during an interview: \\"Cities of salt means cities that offer no sustainable existence. When the waters come in, the first waves will dissolve the salt and reduce these great glass cities to dust. In antiquity, as you know, many cities simply disappeared.\\" = Book = After recognizing the connection between the oil age and its problematic externalities, economic, political, environmental, sexual, aesthetic, and even religious, Cities of Salt asks us to contemplate the human effects of its eventual passing. Being both an epitome and a reminiscence of the traumas brought by colonial and imperial exploitations that persist until today, the novel pushes us to re-evaluate the gains and losses, especially lives, self, and love.  Criticism and receptions  Cities of Salt was banned in Saudi Arabia and few other countries because it satirizes Arab elitist government, exposes Americans' cruel treatment, and has the potential of evoking rebellious emotions. \\"The only serious work of fiction that tries to show the effect of oil, Americans and the local oligarchy on a Gulf country.\\" --- Edward W. Said \\"An Arab novel-and an excellent one at that. It opens up new vistas to the imagination.\\" --- Graham Greene \\"A powerful, untold story, done with humor, grace, and a resonant depth of feelings\\" --- Kirkus \\"Brings to life many of the political issues that have plagued the Middle East for most of this century ... Munif writes from a unique vantage point: English-languages readers have been given few opportunities before now to look at this situation through native eyes ... Theroux's sensitive translation conveys the subtleties of ambiguity and nuance inherent to the Arab language and culture.\\"--Publishers Weekly  References  Category:1984 novels Category:Lebanese novels Category:Arabic-language novels Category:Saudi Arabian novels ","title":"Cities of Salt"},{"id":"39831264","text":" John F.

Malen was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship and a NYFA Grant in Interdisciplinary Art in 2009. Early life and career Malen was born and lives and works in New York City. Malen's father, Philip J. Levitt, was a music critic and several uncles were artists, including the printmaker Edwin Kaufman and the Works Projects Administration painter Lionel Stern. Malen received a BA degree from Skidmore College in art history, and an MA in art history from the University of Pennsylvania (1972). She began her career as a painter, curator and art critic, exhibiting at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum and writing for Arts Magazine under the editorship of Richard Martin. From 1990 to 1996, Malen served as executive editor of Art Journal, published by the College Art Association. In January 2017 review in The Brooklyn Rail, writer Ann McCoy describes the scope of Malen's work, \\"Lenore Malen is an artist of extraordinary intelligence, compassion, and depth. Her work bridges biology, ecology, philosophy, performance, political science, and a wide range of literature.\\" Artwork =Painting and Sculpture (1979‚Äì1999)= During this period, Malen exhibited her minimalist paintings at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, CT; The Locks Gallery, Philadelphia, PA; Galerie Fabian Carlsson, G√¥teborg, Sweden; Frank Marino Gallery, New York City, NY; M13 Gallery (Howard Scott), New York City, NY;Holland Cotter. \\"Lenore Malen at Granary Books and M13\\".Art in America.June 1992. and Michael Walls Gallery, New York City, NY. =Games (1998‚Äì1999)= Beginning in 1998, Malen‚Äôs interest in games inspired a series of site- specific works and artists' books that engaged the viewer as a direct participant. Her book Opportunity Knocks (1998), produced to coincide with an exhibition at Rutgers University, was described by critic Nancy Princenthal in Art on Paper (1998) as having a \\"distinctive blend of urgency and fatalism played for laughs.\\"Nancy Princenthal. \\"Artists' Book Beat.\\" Art on Paper. September 1998. In 1999, the photographs from Opportunity Knocks were featured in a window exhibition at Printed Matter, New York, NY. Other game-based projects include \\"Magnetic Map\\" (1999), created for Art in General New York; \\"The Lottery\\" (1999), an exhibition she curated for Rotunda in Brooklyn; and illustrated short stories for France-Fiction, Paris. =The New Society for Universal Harmony (1999‚Äìpresent)= photograph from The New Society for Universal Harmony, 2005 photograph from The New Society for Universal Harmony, 2005 In 1999, Malen initiated the ongoing project The New Society for Universal Harmony, a fictive reinvention of La Soci√©t√© de l'harmonie universelle, founded by Franz Mesmer in Paris in 1784. The art critic, Gary Indiana has written on Malen's work describing it as a metaphorical utopian fiction of the life of Mesmer. The New Society for Universal Harmony uses pseudo-documentary photos, video and audio transcriptions, testimonials, case histories and other devices drawn from historical reenactment, to archive the functioning of Malen's reinvention of Mesmer's 18th century utopian society.* In 2005, Granary Books published Malen's book, eponymously titled The New Society for Universal Harmony. The book's black and white photographs illustrate a range of influences ‚Äì from the Kinsey Institute's archives, stills from Peter Weiss's 1967 theatrical production and film Marat/Sade and photographs by 19th-century French anatomist Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne de Boulogne, to the photographs of the l9th-century photographer Carleton Watkins. The New Society also functions as an actual society of artists and actors who perform the reenactments and rituals, whose documented activities survive as artworks. The New Society produces Malen's collaborative projects such as La Soci√©t√© de l'harmonie universelle, Harmony as a Hive, and I am the Animal, all of which explore utopian themes. La Soci√©t√© de l'harmonie universelle (1999‚Äì2008) Originally commissioned in 1999 as a photo and text work for Paris' 9/9 revue d‚Äôart practique, it was presented in New York City as a performance at the College Art Association, Apex Art, Artists Talk on Art, Participant, Inc. (2005), and Location One (2007). Featured on Jochen Gerz‚Äô web-based anthology-of-art, it was exhibited at the Centre Pompidou and other museums. The photographic prints were installed at Castle Gallery, New Rochelle, New York; Klenova Castle, Klatovy, Czech Republic; and Trynarstarka Tower, Lublin, Poland. A 2004 solo exhibition presented at the Slought Foundation, Philadelphia, PA, traveled to the Schick Art Gallery, Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY and CUE Art Foundation, New York City, New York in 2007. In 2008, Wesleyan University's Zilkha Gallery presented the multi- media installation \\"Lenore Malen and the New Society for Universal Harmony.\\" In addition, The New Society has been featured in numerous publications and on television. In Fall 2002, the writer Jonathan Ames wrote a short story for BOMB MagazineJonathan Ames. \\"My New Society Testimony: Able to Love Again.\\" BOMB Magazine. Accessed August 18, 2013. about his visit to The New Society in Athol Springs, New York. In 2005, Malen performed for the BBC as Doctor Mesmer in Miriam Margolyes's television production Dickens in America]. The Anthology of Art included Malen's \\"The Magnetic Reconnection Experiment\\", 2001, in its archive of 156 artists and theorists from all over the world. Harmony as a Hive (2007‚Äì2009) Toward the end of Malen's CUE Art Foundation exhibition, she presented a live performance that explored the social structure of the beehive as a model of utopia. Following this performance, Malen began raising bees in Hudson, NY. I Am the Animal (2009‚Äì2012) I Am The Animal, Part I (2009) is a 22-minute documentary on beekeepers in the Hudson Valley, New York. Subsequently, Malen broadened her focus to an exploration of the philosophical differences and exclusions between animals and humans. A three- channel immersive video installation, I Am The Animal, Part II attempts to reverse anthropomorphism by re-imagining human culture as a hive through the co-mingling of historic, documentary and mass-media footage. It was installed at the Mediations Biennale in Poznan, Poland (2012); Tufts University Art Gallery, Medford, MA (2011); and Wave Hill, NY (2010). thumb Scenes from Paradise (2015 - 2017) Scenes from Paradise is a dark comedy presented in multiple formats: a film, live performances, and three-channel video installations, which are variously titled Reversal, The Reason of the Strongest is Always the Best, So we‚Äôll no more go a rowing by the light of the moon and Scenes From Paradise. In every format Eden, the cautionary tale, is made newly relevant by the ticking clock of climate change, habitat loss and extinction. The entire project was inspired by a 15th century manuscript illumination discovered on the internet. The Brooklyn Rail reviewed Malen's Scenes of Paradise in January 2017. In the review Ann McCoy states \\"In Scenes from Paradise we return to Eden for a course correction, we have forgotten that we share the same web of life for survival.\\" In Artforum (January 2017) the art critic Nicholas Chittenden Morgan wrote: \\"Understanding language as political, Malen presents inter-species relationships without sentimentality. Her affective tools ‚Äî satire, Biblical absurdism, and the compassion it took to found The New Society for Universal Harmony . . . are worth holding onto. . . .\\" Malen's work is also featured in a 2015 review from an artist-run blog, Romanov Grave. Scenes from Paradise has been exhibited at Studio10, Brooklyn, NY in January 2017 and was performed live at Art Omi International Art Center in July 2016. Teaching, residencies, fellowships Malen is an associate teaching professor in the MFA Fine Arts Program at Parsons The New School For Design, where she has taught since 1991. She previously taught at RISD, Cooper Union, Bennington College, University of the Arts and Arcadia University. Between 1990 and 2003 Malen was awarded residences at Yaddo, New York; Blue Mountain Center, New York; and held a Hand Hollow Foundation Fellowship at the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Massachusetts (1998). She was a visiting artist at the Vermont Studio Center in 1997, and a senior fellow at the Terra Foundation, Giverny, France, in 2001.

The first graduates eventually took on advisory and combat roles assisting the Army of the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The program was dissolved after the war due to budget cuts. The Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center was activated on February 11, 2013 with the deactivation of the Air Force Special Operations Training Center (AFSOTC). As a result, the major units that fall under the center include: U.S. Air Force Special Operations School, 371st Special Operations Combat Training Squadron, 19th Special Operations Squadron, 551st Special Operations Squadron from Cannon Air Force Base, N.M., 18th Flight Test Squadron, 6th Special Operations Squadron and the 745th Special Operations Squadron from Eglin AFB, FL, which were formerly assigned to AFSOTC.\\"AFSOC Stands up Air Warfare Center.\\" - By Raquel Sanchez Air Force Special Operations Command Public Affairs. - AFSOC Homepage - News. 12 February 2013. <> The center was inactivated on 17 May 2017 and its functions were assumed by the 492d Special Operations Wing.

A basalt reef extends from the Cape into the Bay of Fundy where it intersects the violent waters of the Dory Rips, a rip tide created by the collision of three strong tidal currents. History Cape d'Or was called L'mu'juiktuk by the Mi'kmaq, the native people of Nova Scotia. The cape was a centre of tool production and trade for the Mi'kmaq because of veins of hard dense rock such as chert which could be shaped to form sharp edges for tools and weapons. The Mi'kmaq also obtained copper from deposits in the basalt.\\"L‚Äômu‚Äôjuiktuk Cape d‚ÄôOr\\", Mi‚Äôkmawey Debert Cultural Centre An archaeological excavation near the lighthouses in 1980 found extensive native artifacts dated to about 2000 years ago.\\"Cape d'Or\\", ' 'Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society' ' The Cape was named by French explorers (Cape of Gold) because bright native copper deposits appeared golden. Samuel de Champlain explored the copper deposits at Cape d'Or in 1607 and bestowed the name Port of Mines on nearby Advocate Harbour to reflect the seams of copper ore at Cape d'Or. The French did not establish a mine at Cape d'Or as the massive cliffs and tides made the copper seams difficult to access but the name \\"Les Mines\\" became associated with the upper Bay of Fundy beyond Cape d'Or which became known as the \\"Baie des Mines\\", later Minas Basin, and the Acadian communities around the southern shore of the Minas Basin which became known as Les Mines.Joan Dawson, The Mapmakers Eye: Nova Scotia Through Early Maps, Halifax: Nimbus Publishing (1988), p. 60 Mineral rights at Cape d'Or were later granted to the Duke of Chandos but he was unable to establish a mine. However, in 1897 the Colonial Copper Company began a mine at Cape d'Or. Based out of New York and headed by J. A. Hanway, the company invested several million dollars in developing the site which went into operation in 1900.G. A.

The shafts were connected to the processor and a shipping terminal at nearby Horseshoe Cove by a short narrow-gauge railway. A small company town was built with worker and manager houses. However, by 1905 the mine stopped excavation when the copper veins proved disappointing yields as they were excavated. The site was abandoned in 1907. The houses were shipped by sea to communities around the Bay of Fundy.Roger David Brown, Historic Cumberland County South Halifax: Nimbus Publishing (2002), p. 110 Horseshoe_Cove_Cape_d'Or.jpgView of Horseshoe Cove circa 1905.

Two new bungalows were built for the lightkeeper and the assistant lightkeeper in 1958 and a new concrete lighthouse was built in 1965. The last keeper was Ernie Morris who served until the light was de-staffed in 1989.

Biography He grew up on a farm, which he worked on, and he attended the common school in the winter. At 19, he left for Boston, where he worked as a farm hand, and in 1826 he established himself there as a provision dealer. In 1828, he was engaged in Ashtabula, Ohio, in supplying Boston and New York City with beef and pork. He settled in Chicago during the winter of 1833/4, and there followed a similar business until 1837, when his accumulations were swept away in the Panic of 1837. He began again in the grain business, and acquired a substantial fortune. Meanwhile, he worked for the advancement of Chicago. He invented many appliances that were incidental to meat packing, especially those having reference to the use of steam. He invented the dried-meal process, and ‚ÄúMarsh's caloric dried meal‚Äù was long an article of commerce. In 1855 he moved to Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, and moved back to Chicago after five years. He resided a year in Brooklyn, New York, where he was an exporter, sending much of his dried meal product to the West Indies. In 1864 he settled in Littleton, New Hampshire, and after 1879 made Concord, New Hampshire, his residence. In 1844, he married Charlotte Bates, who died in 1850. In 1855, he married Cornelia Hoyt. She and four children survived him. Cog Railway While ascending Mount Washington in 1852, he lost his way, and then conceived the idea of building a railroad to its summit, believing that such an enterprise could be made profitable. He obtained a charter for the road on June 25, 1858, but the American Civil War prevented any action until May 1866. The construction of such a road was regarded as impossible, and he became known as ‚ÄúCrazy Marsh‚Äù; indeed, the legislature, in granting him a charter, further expressed their willingness to grant a ‚Äúcharter to the moon‚Äù if he wished. Notwithstanding all opposition, he persisted in building the railroad, relying chiefly on his own resources, and received but little encouragement from capitalists until an engine was actually running over part of the route. The peculiar form of locomotive, cog rail, and brakes used were invented by Marsh.

With that company he performed in almost every major city in North America, typically conducting 8 opera performance a week eight months out of the year. In 1934, upon Peroni's 500th performance with the SCOC, The New York Times declared that he had conducted more grand opera performances in North America than any conductor in history. Life and career Peroni studied music at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. He began working as a musician and music teacher at a young age, and by the age of 13 his wages from teaching piano and harmony was the primary source of income for his family. At the age of 15 he began conducting, leading a 30 piece boys band in Rome. In 1914 he immigrated to the United States where his career was largely centered for the rest of his life. He served in the United States Navy during World War I, after which he worked as a conductor for Antonio Scotti's touring company the Scotti Opera Company from 1919-1921. Wilfrid Pelletier was notably his assistant at the Scotti Opera. Peroni was admired for his photographic memory. He often conducted without a score and was said to have completely memorized the complete scores to more than 70 operas. In 1929 he conducted several arias with Giovanni Martinelli for some of the last recordings made by Edison Records. He also served as director of the Chicago Opera Company from 1941-1942 and continued to collaborate with that company periodically up until his death. The last performance he conducted was an SCOC performance of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia in February 1944. After his death in a month later in New York City at the age of 59, he was succeeded by Nicola Rescigno, who later founded the Lyric Opera of Chicago, as musical director of the SCOC. Peroni married soprano Mary Kaestner in 1917, and she retired from her opera career. She survived him when he died in March 1944.

This manuscript, from about 1240, contains the Chronica sancti Pantaleonis. The Chronica regia Coloniensis (\\"Royal Chronicle of Cologne\\", German: K√∂lner K√∂nigschronik), also called the Annales Colonienses maximi, is an anonymous medieval Latin chronicle that covers the years 576 to 1202. The original chronicle only went up to 1197, but a continuator later added the following few years' events. According to the historian Manfred Groten, the Chronica was probably first compiled about 1177 in Michaelsberg Abbey, Siegburg, and then continued in Cologne. The earliest manuscript only contains an account down to 1175. The chronicle is called \\"royal\\" because it is a history of the Roman emperors, Frankish kings, Byzantine emperors and German kings and emperors. It probably began with Augustus, but the beginning of the chronicle is lost. Up to 1106 the Chronica depends on the works of Frutolf von Michelsberg and Ekkehard of Aura, and then on until 1144 on the now lost Annales Patherbrunnenses. After that it is an independent source. The author of the Chronica sancti Pantaleonis made use of the royal chronicle to cover the years down to 1199, and the historian Georg Waitz treated the former as a mere continuation of the latter and edited them together. The author of the Chronica had access to a letter of Rainald of Dassel, archbishop of Cologne, which gave him important information on the emperor's Italian expedition of 1166. He also knew details of the reconquest of Lisbon and the Second Crusade in 1147 because a contingent from the Rhineland took part. He includes a poem, \\"De expugnatione Salaciae carmen\\" (A Song on the Conquest of Alc√°cer do Sal), by one Gosuinus, describing how the crusaders captured Alc√°cer do Sal, the ancient Salacia.The poem begins at p. 349 in Waitz (1880).

The institute holds and sponsors research, educational events and program and activism on its own and in collaboration with business, educational and governmental agencies. Organization The Instituto Global para la Sostenibilidad (IGS) was founded at the Tec de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus in collaboration with Arizona State University. It is an expansion of the Global Institute for Sustainability, founded in Arizona in 2004 and is the first and only program of its kind in Latin America, promoting business solutions, clean technologies, and government models for action. The institute was founded to promote global environmental thinking in Mexico and the rest of Latin America. Its primary objectives are, to promote sustainable development in Mexico, to generate and diffuse knowledge about green economies and sustainable development and promote coordination of efforts in sustainability at the Tec de Monterrey system . Its main functions are interdisciplinary research into environmental issues, environmental education and creating solutions for businesses and government. The program has alliances with private and public organizations such as : the UNAM Programa de Investigaci√≥n en Cambio Clim√°tico, Yale University, El Colegio de M√©xico, FEMSA, CEMEX, Walmart, Mexican Stock Exchange, Green Momentum, Asociaci√≥n de Bancos en M√©xico, SIGEA, Siemens, Instituto Mexicana para la Competitividad, World Wildlife Fund, Centro Mexicano del Derecho Ambiental, Greenpeace, the Nature Conservancy, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and Korea International Cooperation Agency as well as Mexican agencies such as the Secretariat of Energy, the Secretariat of Economy, the Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources and the Nacional Financiero development bank.

It collaborates with Tec de Monterrey's system of ‚ÄúTechnological Parks‚Äù to promote the development of environmentally friendly technology, which include the development of cementing materials, adhesives, biopolymers/bioplastics, water purification systems, lead-free electronics, battery technologies and microprocesses. This collaboration involves nine of Tec de Monterrey's research centers including the new Parque Tecnol√≥gico de Ciencias para la Vida (Life Sciences Technology Park) at the Mexico City Campus. IGS offers a bachelors in sustainable development engineering and a masters in sustainable development, works with students in other majors at the campus including those in business administration, finance, international business and international relations. It offers internships for students in sustainable energy, communications, small business development, recycling computer technology, hydraulic research and sustainable cities, and supports student projects in hydroponics, with a greenhouse on the Toluca campus, water-recycling with the use of microorganisms, the Gaia group focused on recycling at Campus Santa Fe and TuEnerg√≠a, a program to install solar panels and other types of energy generators in homes and businesses. IGS sponsors conferences, seminars and workshops for business and governmental leaders as well as the public. One of its main efforts along these lines related to the concept of ‚Äúgreen businesses‚Äù called the Iniciativa Negocios Verdes (Green Businesses Initiative). This includes a ‚Äúclinic‚Äù to help create environmentally friendly businesses, which is sponsored by corporations such as Walmart M√©xico, FEMSA and Banorte . It sponsors workshops, seminars and courses in business and environment, creating government programs against climate change and general environmental education for both campus students and the public.

History The IGS evolved from the Centro de Di√°logo y An√°lisis sobre Am√©rica del Norte (Center of Dialogue and Analysis of North America) or CEDAN, both founded by Mar√≠a Isabel Studer Noguez. By 2011, much of CEDAN's activities were related to environmental issues, so Studer reorganized the institute, which opened in 2011 as a partnership between Tec de Monterrey and Arizona State University's Global Institute for Sustainability. IGS's inaugural event included Carlos Gay of UNAM, Martha Delgado of the Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources, Ellis J. Juan, director of the Inter- American Development Bank, Irina Maslesnikova, of Xerox M√©xico, and Gabriel Quadri de la Torre of SIGEA. It has grown to sponsor research, educational and promotional activities both on the Tec de Monterrey, Mexico City Campus and other parts of Mexico, successful enough to be known in the United States and Canada as well. Former professors and students of the institute have gone on to create projects such as the Xooc Foundation, which promotes awareness of marine biodiversity of Mexico, DameUnAveton, an online platform to share rides, and Impulso Urbano, a research and service organization to improve housing and public spaces through the use of recycled materials.

In the fierce quarrel which broke out during the season among the managers, leading to legal proceedings and a fierce polemic, Powell sided with George Colman, whom he had brought into the association, against Harris and Rutherford.In his last season he played Ford in the Merry Wives of Windsor, Alwin in The Countess of Salisbury (Hall Hartson), Young Bevil in Conscious Lovers, and was, 3 December 1768, the original Cyrus in John Hoole's play of the name; and, 18 January 1769, the original Courteney in Charlotte Lennox's The Sister. On the closing night of the season, 26 May 1769, he played Cyrus in John Hoole's play of the name, which was his last appearance in London. Death On 31 May 1769 Powell made, as Jaffier, his last appearance on the stage, in Bristol at the King Street Theatre. The following day he caught cold, playing cricket. His illness became severe, and King Street, in which, near the theatre, he lived, was barred by chains against carriages, by order of the magistrates. On Friday, at the request of his family and physician, the performances were suspended to avoid disturbing him, and on Monday, 3 July, at seven in the morning, he died. ‚ÄòRichard III‚Äô was given that evening, and Holland, then manager, had to apologise for the inability of the actors to play their parts. The audience voluntarily dispensed with the closing farce. Powell was buried on the following Thursday in Bristol Cathedral, Colman, Holland, and Clarke, with all the performers of the theatre, attending the funeral, which was conducted by the dean. An anthem was sung by the choir. On 14 July the Roman Father was performed in Bristol for the benefit of Powell's family, most of the audience appearing in black. An address by Colman was spoken by Holland, who did not long survive. A monument in the north aisle of the cathedral, erected by his widow, has an epitaph, also by Colman. Family Once out of his indentures, Powell married, in 1759, a Miss Branston. Powell's wife made a d√©but as Ophelia in Bristol in July 1766, but did not reach London. Widowed, she married again, in September 1771, John Abraham Fisher. Miss E. Powell appeared in Ireland, where she married H. P. Warren, an actor, and died as Mrs. Martindale in King Street, Covent Garden, in 1821. Another daughter married Mr. White, clerk of the House of Commons, and left daughters who were shareholders in Covent Garden Theatre.

Someone who believes that art should strive to save lives, liberate people, challenge stereotypes and so forth. Reflected in my writing you will, I hope, see someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time interrogating myself, my values and behaviors as well as those of the people around me‚Äìand who continues to learn what it means to be African American and male.

Description The explosion occurred during a propane transfer from a Doxol railroad car to a storage tank on the Getz rail siding near Andy Devine Avenue/Route 66. The incident began when a hairline crack in the side of the tanker was leaking non smelling gas that was ignited by static electricity. This caused a spark that ignited the leaking propane gas, facts identified after a long investigation and trial had been conducted. The initial fire badly burned the two railroad employees present, one of whom later died from his burns. The burning propane gas escaping from the valve connection on the rail car quickly heated the liquid propane inside, increasing the tank pressure. This in turn increased the leak and fire, further heating the tank car. The Kingman Fire Department responded, and began setting up attack lines to cool the propane car. Within minutes of the initial fire, the safety valve on the car opened from the dangerously increased pressure in the tank car. The stream of propane gas blowing out of the safety valve immediately ignited as well. At this point, two burning streams of propane were shooting out of the car, one horizontal from the transfer valve, and one vertical from the safety valve. The heat from the streams of burning propane continued to heat the tank, increasing pressure to dangerous levels. The fire department was in the process of setting up a deluge gun to cool the car, which would have delivered far more water than the booster attack lines they initially were using; however, before the deluge gun could be made ready, the pressure inside the tank car reached the design bursting limit and the tank car exploded. Almost instantaneously, thousands of gallons of boiling liquid propane flashed to gas with the drop in pressure and simultaneously ignited. The resulting explosion produced a shock wave that was heard and felt for over 5 miles, and a fireball over 1,000 feet in diameter. Burning propane rained down on everything in the vicinity, and the remnants of the rail car were propelled over a quarter mile from the explosion site. The three firefighters closest to the explosion were killed instantly; eight more died from their burns shortly thereafter. In addition to the eleven city firefighters and one railroad worker killed in the disaster, one state trooper was also killed in the explosion. Over 90 onlookers gathered on the highway were burned or injured, some badly. The most severely burned, including some of the firefighters, were airlifted to hospitals in Las Vegas and Phoenix. This incident was the worst firefighter tragedy in Arizona until 2013 when 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots firefighters were killed in the Yarnell Hill Fire. The incident was photographed in detail by a photographer on the roof of his home near the explosion site, and reportedly also was captured on 8mm film by a vacationing family. Because of this documentation, this explosion has become a classic incident studied in fire department training programs worldwide. The Arizona State Archives in Phoenix has of original material, including civil case material and photographs, concerning the \\"Kingman Explosion.\\" The incident was chronicled in the July 1993 issue of American Fire Journal in an article titled \\"Kingman Revisited\\". Firefighters Memorial Park in Kingman is dedicated to those 11 firefighters who died in the BLEVE.

China recognized South Sudan's independence on July 9, 2011. China began friendly exchanges with Southern Sudan in 1970s when China sent medical teams and agricultural experts to provide assistance for the people there. In January 2005, China was one of the witnesses to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed between the north and the south of Sudan, which ended the 38-year civil war and announced the establishment of the autonomous government of South Sudan. Since then, China has started formal friendly exchanges with South Sudan and the bilateral cooperation in various fields has increased progressively. In February 2007, Chinese President Hu Jintao made his first visit to Sudan and met in Khartoum with the First Vice President Salva Kiir Mayardit who was also President of the southern autonomous government. Then Kiir visited China twice in March 2005 and July 2007. In September 2008, China opened the Consulate General in Juba. In February 2011, the Chinese government announced its recognition of the referendum results in Southern Sudan and China was one of the world's first counties to recognize the results. On July 9, 2011 when the Republic of South Sudan was established, China Housing and Urban-Rural Development Minister Jiang Weixin was invited as a special envoy of Hu to participate in the independence celebrations. On behalf of the Chinese government, Jiang signed the Joint Communique on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the two countries with South Sudan's Foreign Minister Deng Alor Kol, meaning that on the founding day of South Sudan, China established official diplomatic relations with the new country and became one of the first countries to establish such a relation with it. The government of South Sudan admits in the Joint Communiqu√© that there is only one China in the world, the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. On the same day, Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan opened the embassy. From April 23 to 26 in 2012, South Sudan's President Kiir made a state visit to China at the invitation of Hu. During the visit, Hu held talks with Kiir, Other Chinese leaders, including Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo, and Vice Premier, member of the Standing Committee of the Political bureau of the CPC Central Committee Li Keqiang met with Kiir respectively. Non-interference South Sudanese hip hop star Emmanuel Jal noted that China was seen positively by Sudanese and Africans due to its non interference policy, only doing business, saying- \\"The Chinese don't influence our politics, They don't comment on it, and what they want, they pay for -- sometimes double the amount. This tends to make all Africans happy -- from the dictators to the democrats, There isn't a party in Africa that doesn't like them. Even if you're a rebel movement and you say to them you can secure gold, the Chinese will simply say they want to buy it. The only foreign policy advice I heard from China was when they said to Sudan, 'Don't go back to war.' That's all they said. They didn't push anything else.\\" Human rights In June 2020, South Sudan was one of 53 countries that backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations.

Etymology SpahƒÅn is attested in various Middle Persian seals and inscriptions, including that of Zoroastrian priest Kartir. The present-day name (Isfahan) is the Arabicized form of Ispahan (unlike Middle Persian, New Persian does not allow initial consonant clusters such as spStrazny, P. (2005). Encyclopedia of linguistics (p. 325). New York: Fitzroy Dearborn.). The region appears with the abbreviation GD (Gay, Southern Media) on Sasanian numismatics. In Ptolemy's Geographia it appears as Aspadana, translating to \\"place of gathering for the army\\". It is believed that SpahƒÅn derives from spƒÅdƒÅnƒÅm 'the armies', Old Persian plural of spƒÅda (from which derives spƒÅh 'army' in Middle Persian). The province is called Parthau on Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht.  History  Spahan became a part of the Sasanian Empire in 224, after Ardashir I (r. r. 224‚Äì242) seized its capital and killed its ruler, Shadh-Shapur. During the reign of Ardashir's son and successor Shapur I (r. 240-270), a certain Varzin was appointed as the governor of the province. In 642, the battle of Spahan took place, where it was fought between the Rashidun Arabs and the Sasanians. The Arabs were victorious during the battle, where they reportedly killed the prominent Mihran commander Shahrvaraz Jadhuyih. After the battle, the Arabs made peace with Fadhusfan, the governor of the city. According to an Arab historian, many civilians were killed or enslaved after the battle.ISFAHAN vi.

The medal, also known as the Permanent Overseas Forces Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, was established in 1910 as a single common award to supersede the several local versions of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal which were being awarded by the various territories. (Accessed 26 May 2015)South African Medal Website ‚Äì Union Defence Forces (1913‚Äì1939) (Accessed 9 May 2015) Along with the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal was, in turn, superseded in 1930 by the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military), which once again had various territorial versions. Origin The United Kingdom's Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was instituted by King William IV in 1830. The original medal had the Royal Coat of Arms with the badge of Hanover on the obverse, while on the Queen Victoria version, introduced upon her succession to the throne in 1837, the Hanover emblem was replaced by a Trophy of Arms which incorporated a central shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms. Upon the succession of King Edward VII to the throne in 1901, his effigy was placed on the medal's obverse. The medal's ribbon was plain crimson from 1830 until 1917, when white bands were added to the edges.Stephen Stratford Medals site - British Military & Criminal History - 1900 to 1999 - Army Long Service & Good Conduct Medal (Accessed 26 May 2015) On 31 May 1895, Queen Victoria authorised Colonial governments to adopt, amongst others, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal and to award it to other ranks of their local permanent military forces. Territories which took advantage of the authorisation include Canada, Cape of Good Hope, India, Natal, New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. Their respective versions of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal were identical to the Queen Victoria version of the United Kingdom's medal, but with the names of the respective territories inscribed in a curved line above the inscription \\"FOR LONG SERVICE AND GOOD CONDUCT\\" on the reverse. All these territorial medals had ribbons in the same crimson colour as that of the British medal, but with a 4 millimetres wide band in the centre in a colour to represent each territory.South African Medal Website ‚Äì Colonial Military Forces (Accessed 6 May 2015)Museum Victoria - Medal - Queensland Long Service & Good Conduct Medal, Specimen, Queen Victoria, Queensland, Australia, 1895-1901 (Accessed 29 May 2015)Museum Victoria - Medal - South Australia Long Service & Good Conduct Medal, Specimen, Queen Victoria, South Australia, Australia, 1895-1901 (Accessed 29 May 2015) Second versions of most of these medals, with the effigy of King Edward VII on the obverse, were awarded from 1902. The reverse of these medals remained the same for all but the five Australian territories. Since the Commonwealth of Australia had been formed on 1 January 1901, the five Queen Victoria versions of the medal for New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria were replaced by a single King Edward VII version with the inscription \\"COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA\\" in a curved line on the reverse.Museum Victoria - Medal - Commonwealth of Australia Long Service & Good Conduct Medal, King Edward VII, Australia, 1903-1910 (Accessed 29 May 2015) Institution The Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal was established by King Edward VII in 1910 and superseded the several territorial versions of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal which were being awarded by the various territories of the British Empire. Like the United Kingdom's Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal was instituted as an Army award, since members of the Royal Navy were eligible for the award of the Naval Long Service and Good Conduct Medal instead. From 1 February 1920, when the South African Air Force was established as the first independent Air Force outside the United Kingdom, eligibility for award was extended to members of the Air Forces of the Empire as they were being established as independent Air Forces, separate from the respective Armies.History of the South African Air Force (Accessed 29 May 2015) Award criteria The Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal could be awarded to warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men who had completed eighteen years of irreproachable service in the ranks of a Permanent Force of any of the Dominions and Colonies of the British Empire. The medal was unique to the Empire \\"beyond the seas\\" and could not be awarded for long service in the Permanent Force in the United Kingdom, where the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal continued to be awarded. While the medal was created by Royal Warrant, issued by the British Government, and was struck and named by the Royal Mint in London, the actual administration of each award of the medal was delegated to the respective territorial governments of the Empire. Order of wear In the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal ranks on par with the United Kingdom's Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal and its territorial versions, and the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military). They all take precedence after the Accumulated Campaign Service Medal and before the Naval Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (1830). =South Africa= With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace the British awards used to date, the older British decorations and medals which were applicable to South Africa continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the Victoria Cross, took precedence after all South African orders, decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date. Of the official British medals which were applicable to South Africans, the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal takes precedence as shown.Government Notice no. 1982 of 1 October 1954 - Order of Precedence of Orders, Decorations and Medals, published in the Government Gazette of 1 October 1954.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal) Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (South Africa) * Preceded by the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal (Natal). * Succeeded by the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (South Africa). Description The Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal was struck in silver and is a disk, in diameter and thick. The medal is mounted from a single-toe claw, affixed to the medal by means of a horizontal pin through the upper edge of the medal and with double-scroll claw supports on the rim. The mount attaches to a straight, swiveling suspension bar. King George V version ;Obverse The obverse of the first version of the medal has a raised rim and depicts the effigy of King Edward VII in the uniform of a Field Marshal, facing left. It is inscribed \\"EDWARDVS VII REX IMPERATOR\\" around the perimeter. The second version of the medal was instituted after the coronation of King George V on 22 June 1911 and depicts his effigy in the uniform of a Field Marshal, facing left. It is inscribed \\"GEORGIVS V BRITT: OMN: REX ET IND: IMP:\\" around the perimeter. ;Reverse The reverse is smooth with a raised rim. Around the perimeter, between the circumferences of two concentric circles, it bears the inscription \\"PERMANENT FORCES OF THE EMPIRE BEYOND THE SEAS\\" and, in the centre \\"FOR LONG SERVICE AND GOOD CONDUCT\\" in four lines. ;Ribbon The ribbon is 32 millimetres wide, with an 11¬Ω millimetres wide crimson band and a 2¬Ω millimetres wide white band, repeated in reverse order and separated by a 4 millimetres wide dark blue band. Recipients In Canada, 839 medals were awarded to members of the Canadian Army, and one to a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Discontinuation The Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal and the United Kingdom's Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal were both superseded on 23 September 1930, when a new Royal Warrant was promulgated by King George V to establish a single Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military) for the British Army and all regular and permanent military forces of the British Empire. This medal once again had various territorial versions, but this time in the form of subsidiary titles inscribed on a bar attached to the suspender of the medal, rather than on the medal reverse. One exception was the South African version, which had a bilingual inscription on the medal reverse.

It was demobilized in Germany on 2 July 1919. There is no modern United States Air Force unit that shares its lineage and history.Series \\"P\\", Volumes 1 and 2, History of the 3d Army Air Service. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. History =Organization= The command was established on 14 November 1918 by Brigadier General William Mitchell, who was appointed as Commander, Third Army Air Service. The command was organized as part of the United States Third Army for the occupation of German Territory west of the Rhine River as agreed under the terms of the 11 November Armistice with Germany. The Headquarters staff was originally organized about 15 October when about half dozen officers and some twenty enlisted men were withdrawn from Headquarters Detachment of the First Army Air Service at Souilly Aerodrome, France and used as a nucleus upon to build up a staff for a planned Army Group. The Army Group was planned as a Headquarters for both the First and Second Army Air Services. With the Armistice with Germany ending combat on 11 November, and the formation of Third Army, the staff was re-designated as the Third Army Air Service. Once formed, the staff moved from Souilly to Ligny-en-Barrois, France on 14 November. A few days after the arrival of the staff at Ligny, a carload of necessary office supplies, equipment and other necessities began to arrive which enabled the command to begin operations. Everything was prepared for an extended move into Germany, and on 21 November, orders were received to move to Longuyon, France. The Headquarters began its trip into Germany, arriving at Longuyon on the 22d. Owing to the terms that no Allied troops would cross into Germany until 1 December, on 5 December orders were received to move the Headquarters to Euren, a suburb of Trier, Germany. The truck train route taken took the Headquarters though Luxembourg. Quarters in Euren consisted of several old German Barracks, and the offices were set up in one of the barracks. The facilities were very unkempt and in a filthy condition, and it was necessary to send an advance detail to clean the facilities. Lastly, on 16 December, orders were received for Headquarters to proceed to Coblenz. On the morning of the 18th, a truck train of eight trucks began the move. It was hoped to make the trip in one day, however considerable difficulties were encountered on the road, and the convoy did not arrive in Coblenz until the evening of the 19th. =Initial operations= Upon the command's arrival in Germany, an airfield was constructed on the former parade ground of Fort Kaiser Alexander for aircraft squadrons being assigned to Coblenz. The former Deutsche Luftstreitkr√§fte (German Air Force) aerodromes at Trier and Wei√üenthurm were also taken over by the Command. Lion's Gate Entrance to Fort Kaiser Alexander Initial Observation units assigned to the Headquarters were the 1st Aero Squadron at Wei√üenthurm, the 12th Aero Squadron at Coblenz, and the 88th Aero Squadron at Trier. These units were initially ordered to photograph the entire corps area, including interesting features of the terrain, cities and towns, the road and railroad network and any such points as Headquarters may designated. The 94th Aero Squadron (Pursuit) and 166th Aero Squadron (Bombardment), both at Coblenz were ordered to carry out \\"show of force\\" formations over the Third Army area. Whenever possible, large formations of aircraft were to fly low over cities and towns, but no lower than 500m altitude. Acrobatic and stunt flying was to be avoided. The 9th Aero Squadron (Night Observation) was assigned as a courier squadron for the Commander of Third Army. An extensive training program was organized in Aerial photography, infantry liaison, artillery adjustments, machine guns, infantry drill regulations, map reading and the study of photographs, lectures on the cooperation of aviation with the other branches of the Army. Practice flights included long-distance cross country, photographic missions, formation flying and also, the flying of German aircraft obtained and evaluation of their capabilities and other aspects of their construction. The VII Corps Observation Group established an infantry liaison school at Trier in January 1919. The mission of the school was to train infantry units in displaying panels by the front line troops, the use of pyrotechnics as employed to signal from the ground to aircraft and from the aircraft to the ground. Artillery units were trained in the use of aircraft for adjusting barrages. As many officers and non-commissioned officers as possible were taken up in airplanes to view the exercises. Radio officers were taken up to perform duties in actual exercises. =Realignment and demobilization= Hangars and aircraft on display at the Coblenz Aviation Show, April 1919 Observation Balloon demonstration at the Coblenz Aviation Show 1st Aero Squadron Salmson 2A2 planes on display at the Coblenz Aviation Show On 7 April the construction of a new aerodrome at Sinzing was commenced to take care of additional squadrons moving in from the First and Second Armies in France, and for that same reason, the aerodrome at Wei√üenthurm was expanded. Also plans were made to place a main Supply Depot adjacent to the airfield at Wei√üenthurm. The next day, 8 April 1919, with the pending assignment of replacement units from France, the 12th, 91st, 94th and 166th Aero Squadrons were relieved from duty with the Third AS and on 16 April ordered to proceed to the Services of Supply 1st Air Depot at Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome, France, for immediate demobilization and return to the United States. With the demobilization of the First and Second Army Air Services on 15 April, additional squadrons were transferred to Third Army to supplement units already in Germany. The 5th Pursuit Group, formerly of Second Army in France was moved to Coblenz, and the IV Corps Observation Group was moved to the new Aerodrome at Sinzig. There, IV Corps was to establish a Liaison School, modeled on the one operating by VII Corps at Trier. Other new units assigned to the Third Army AS were the 166th, 24th and 256th Aero Squadrons to the III Corps, and the 278th and 354th AS to IV Corps. Between 23 and 27 April, the Third Army held a Horse-Motor and Aviation Show at Coblenz. The Air Service took a large part, putting on both air and Ground exhibitions. Pursuit, Observation, Day Bombardment, and Aerial Reconnaissance planes were placed on display, all fully equipped for duty over the lines. Also a Radio Section was on display showing the methods of liaison from ground to air and air to ground employed by the Air Service during the War. Other displays presented were from the Armament Section, with a full display of munitions and other pyrotechnics; various aircraft engines, aerial cameras, and a Balloon Exhibit of lighter-than-air observation craft. Pursuit plane races, message dropping contests, the winner being the one dropping a message from an aircraft closest to a panel, and a demonstration of aerobatic stunt flying by members of the Air Service. The show was attended by several thousand Air Service personnel, members of Third Army and also, and most importantly, members of the general public, who saw the capabilities of the Air Service on display.

They are useful for biomedical applications that require optical sensing/imaging/heating, magnetic stimulation/manipulation, or both of these functionalities. An example of these functionalities is that PM-NPs can attach to biological entities and separate them under an external magnetic field while simultaneously detecting their chemical nature via optical sensing. These functionalities are especially useful when studying tissues deep within an organism. Current available bifunctional PM-NPs are limited to quasi-zero-dimensional (0D) nanostructures. There are few reports of quasi- one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, although 1D PM nanotubes provide advantages for biomedical applications that are not available with 0D nanostructures. A specific type of 1D PM nanotube has applications in targeted single-cell sensing. SERS characterization A laser beam focused on two neighboring Ag nanoparticles can generate a high intensity electric field in the narrow junction due to LSP resonance as a result of coherent electron oscillation in the Ag nanoparticles. This junction is referred to as a ‚Äúhotspot‚Äù. If a molecule is in the vicinity of the hotspot, it‚Äôs Raman scattering signals can be significantly amplified. This phenomenon is called surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). SERS EF is determined by the electric field intensity. Nanocapsules that have Ag nanoparticles on the inside and outside (double-layer nanotubes) exhibit 2x SERS intensity than those with a single layer of Ag nanoparticles (see below). Manufacturing SERS nanocapsules and arrays Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin found a method for economically synthesizing SERS nanocapsules and creating arrays of the nanocapsules capable of ultrasensitive and position- predictable SERS detections. In doing so, the researchers also tackled two major problems previously associated with SERS sensing: 1\\\\. Lack of many hotspots with controlled gaps 2\\\\. Difficulty of assembling SERS probes at designated locations The nanocapsules created in this study comprised a 3-layer structure: the Ag/Ni/Ag nano core, a silica capsule, a uniformly distributed Ag nanoparticles on silica. Creating the nanocapsule works as follows: (1) The electrodeposition of a nanoporous anodized aluminum oxide and subsequent deposition of a Cu layer onto this membrane to create a three- electrode electrodeposition system; (2) building the nanowires via electrodeposition, starting at the bottom of the membrane‚Äôs nanopores (the amount of electric charge passing through the circuit controls the length of the Ag/Ni/Ag nanowires; (3) dissolving the template membrane in NaOH and subsequently washing the nanowires via sonication and centrifuging in ethanol and deionized water; (4) coating nanocore in silica via hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate; (5) isolating Ag ions and then incubating with the silica-coated nanocapsule to reduce ionic Ag into metallic Ag nanoparticles on the silica. In terms of functionality, the nanocore of Ag and Ni allows for manipulating the nanocapsule with electric tweezers. Ag/Ni/Ag nanocores prove necessary for steering/orientation via the AC field. The silica capsule serves to separate the nanocore from the Ag nanoparticles on the outside, preventing the plasmonic quenching effect. The Ag nanodots act as a hotspot layer (with an enhanced electric field) and perform the sensing task. The researchers arranged the nanocapsules into arrays using magnets of Cr/Ni/Ag. The Cr anchored the magnet in substrate; the Ni worked in concert with the Ni in the nanocapsule core by providing an attractive magnetic field; the Au layer tuned the magnetic interaction force between nanomagnet and nanocapsule. The researchers used a quadruple electrode chip to create an array of nanocapsules. The AC and DC fields could be oriented parallel or perpendicular to each other in order to create the electric tweezers (the mechanism could transport capsules parallel or perpendicular to their orientations depending on whether or not AC and DC fields were directed parallel or perpendicular to one another). The Ag/Ni/Ag nanocores proved necessary for steering/orientation via the AC field (when removed no net torque resulted). The electric tweezers then moved the nanocapsules to their nanomagnet anchors, utilizing the attraction between Ni in capsule and magnet. These nanocapsule arrays prove consistent, with the variation of Raman intensity between sensors +/-9%. This low error margin comes from the controlled sizing and spacing of Ag nanoparticles and the large number of such hotspots on the nanocapsule. Previously there existed only randomly placed hotspots, which produced more variation between nanocapsule sensitivity and therefore increased the error margin. The nanocapsules can detect Raman spectra at small concentrations (for example, 1,2-bi-(4-pyridyl) ethylene (BPE) at 10-12 M) and as concentration increases, the detection sensitivity increases logarithmically. Plasmonic simulation SERS enhancement can be attributed to two factors: electric field (E-field) enhancement due to the plasmonic resonance of nanoparticles and chemical enhancement due to charge transfer between the molecules and metal particles. E-field enhancement is a major contributor to SERS. A group of metallic particles on the same surface can provide stronger E-field enhancement than that of single particles or dimers. A group of nanoparticles with controlled distributions further enhance the E field. Narrower junctions between nanoparticles exhibit a strong E field. For smaller nanoparticles, the normalized electric field increases as size increases. However, for nanoparticles of diameters >40 nm, E-field enhancement reduces. This is because the plasmonic resonance shifts to a longer wavelength. When a double- layer nanotube is placed on top of a glass substrate and excited by a surface normal beam, the hot-spot is at the bottom of the nanotube. This is because the bottom hot-spot is surrounded by silica, while the top is surrounded by air. In addition, the inter-particle coupling through the nanoparticle chain at the outer surface enhances the electric field at the bottom of the nanotube. Not only does the inner layer add more hot-spots for SERS sensing, but it also increases the intensity of the hot spots in the outer layer nanoparticles. However, when the core is filled with platinum, the opposite is observed. The hot spots at the top of the nanotube are enhanced by 2x, while those at the bottom are reduced. This is because at the top of the nanotube, light is reflected to enhance the hot spot, while no light is able to pass through the platinum, which reduces the hot spots on the bottom. A similar phenomenon occurs when the tube is filled with nickel. Thickness of the silica also affects enhancement of SERS. Near-field enhancement can be observed on nanotubes with a silica coating ranging from 70 to 150 nm. However, if the thickness is increased, near-field enhancement will disappear. Magnetic characterization These 1D PM nanotubes also offer tunable magnetic properties for controlled manipulation. When the Ni segment is relatively large, the anisotropy direction is along the long axis. When the Ni segment is relatively low, magnetic anisotropy is transverse to the length of the nanotubes with zero remanence. This is a way of controlling the magnetic anisotropy, and can be used to affect the way the tubes align with a magnetic field. Single-Cell bioanalysis Because of their various functionalities, 1D PM nanotubes can be used for various applications, including analysis of membrane composition of a single animal cell among many. Because of the bifunctionality of the nanotubes, it is possible to precisely transport the nanotube to a specific living cell, and analyze various features of that cell.Xu, Xiaobin, Huifeng Li, Dihan Hasan, Rodney S.

History In 1992, Bono and U2 lead guitarist The Edge bought and later refurbished the two-star 70-room hotel, and converted it into a \\"contemporary boutique\\" 49-room hotel. After an 18-month renovation costing US$8 million, enabled in part, due to a tax-exemption scheme which aimed to revive the Temple Bar district the hotel re-opened in 1996. As of 2019, while the hotel building was owned by Bono, the Edge and developer Paddy McKillen snr, its leasehold is held by a company called Press Up Entertainment (owned by developers Paddy McKillen jnr and Matt Ryan). This company manages the hotel's operations. The hotel's main restaurant, Cleaver East, replaced The Tea Rooms in July 2013. Expansion proposals The Octagon bar at the Clarence Hotel In 2004, plans were announced for an expansion of the hotel, which would include adjoining properties 9 Essex Street and 9, 10 and 11 Wellington Quay. All of the historic buildings would be gutted, leaving just the fa√ßades. Everything else would be new. The budget was projected at US$237.2 million.

Life Mare was born in New York City, the son of John Mare, of Devonshire, and Mary Bes Mare, presumed to be of Dutch origin. His sister Mary was the wife of the painter William Williams, who may have taught him, although nothing is known of his training as an artist or of his education otherwise. His father is variously described in records as a mariner and laborer, and may have been illiterate. Mare is recorded in Albany, New York after 1759; in that year he moved to the city with his wife, Anne Morris, and his son was baptized there in 1760. Both appear to have died early; there is no mention of them in the will of John Mare, Sr., dated 1761. In that same year Mare is supposed to have returned to New York City, as the will makes no mention of residence in Albany. The first direct mention of Mare's profession comes in 1765; on October 1 of that year he was admitted to the freedom of the city of New York under the name and title of \\"John Mare Jr., Limner\\". Evidence suggests that he was in Boston around 1767 and again in 1768, but by 1772 he was back in Albany seeking work, having mortgaged his property on Mulberry Street in 1771 to pay for the trip. Sometime in the next two years he returned to New York City, executing his last two known portraits while there. Mare is believed to have moved to North Carolina by 1778; he is last recorded in New York the year prior. The reason for the move is unknown; however, while Mare had been nearly the only painter in New York City for much of his early career, competing only with Lawrence Kilburn for custom, the arrival of John Durand and Abraham Delanoy on the scene may have influenced his decision somewhat. In Edenton he became a businessman, apparently abandoning painting once and for all; no record of any artwork by Mare in North Carolina has yet been found. By 1780 he had become a partner in the firm Mare & Cooley, and had taken out one-sixteenth interest in the schooner Ostrich. For some fifteen years he was successful, opening trade with the West Indies and acquiring property in surrounding counties; he is also known to have owned slaves. However, he fell into financial difficulty in his last years, and appears to have suffered from a debilitating illness as well, which may have prevented his putting his affairs in order. Mare was a supporter of the Revolutionary cause from the time he came to North Carolina, providing supplies for the state's troops during the war. When Albemarle Sound was invaded by the British, he contributed ¬£1,000 to the effort to battle their forces. In 1780 a ship of which he was part owner, the Fair American, was captured by the British, causing him significant financial loss; among its passengers, who were transported to London, was future congressman Thomas Wynns. Mare married again while in North Carolina, in 1784; his second wife was Marion Boyd Wells, a widow. Little else is known of her save that she and her sister Lydia had been signatories to the resolutions of the Edenton Tea Party. She died long before him, leaving him two young daughters, Mary and Elizabeth Ann. He was a member of St. Paul's Church, and may have been buried in its churchyard; the exact date of his death is unknown, as no obituaries have been found either in the press or in Masonic records of the era. At his death he left almost nothing to his children, who were taken in by the family of their aunt Lydia. Mare's nephew, son of Mary, was the painter William Joseph Williams. =Public life= Mare served as Edenton's first postmaster beginning in 1786. He also served in numerous other public capacities in Chowan County; he was county coroner from 1786 to 1788, and also in 1786 became Edenton's town treasurer. He was first called to serve on the grand jury in March 1785. In 1789 he became a town commissioner, and served in both capacities from some years. He became a justice of the peace in 1787, and held that role until 1799; he often served as an auditor of legal accounts during this time. In 1787 Governor Samuel Johnston appointed Mare to the North Carolina Council of State. He served three terms on the council, and was renominated yet again in 1789; as Johnston did not take up his reappointment as governor, Mare was not reappointed at this time. In that same year Mare was chosen to represent Edenton at the convention in which North Carolina ratified the United States Constitution; he voted for ratification. Mare was a Mason, and is known to have attended Masonic meetings in Albany in 1772. He later transferred his membership to St. John's Lodge No. 2 (now St. John's Lodge No. 1, A.Y.M.) in New York City before transferring it again, this time to Unanimity Lodge in Edenton, in 1778. He became master of this lodge in 1779, and for twenty years remained its mainspring. Mare is also believed to have assisted in drafting the constitution of the Grand Lodge of North Carolina; he presided over the convention in Tarboro which revived it in 1787, having been elected with Stephen Cabarrus to represent Edenton. He was also a prominent member of the Anglican church in Chowan County. Work Not much is known of Mare's training, although his portraits share some of the characteristics found in the work of colonial New York painter Thomas McIlworth. His earliest surviving portrait, of fewer than a dozen known, is of Henry Livingston, dating to 1760; a painting of Henry's brother Robert, similar in appearance, is unsigned and undated, but presumed to be his work also. Both are believed to be copies of works by John Wollaston, as is Mare's portrait of Henry Lloyd of Boston, dating to around 1767. In 1766 the Common Council of New York commissioned a portrait of George III. A 1767 portrait of John Keteltas (in the New York Historical Society collection) is distinguished by a trompe l'oeil house fly on the sitter's cuff, poised as if on the surface of the painting. In 1768, again in Boston, Mare painted John Torrey; he is presumed to have painted Torrey's brother William as well. A portrait of Gerard Beekman from 1769 is believed to be by the artist, as is an undated portrait of an unknown member of the Werden-Wilcocks family. In 1772, during his return sojourn in Albany, Mare painted John Johnson, a portrait which today hangs in Johnson Hall in Johnstown. A pastel portrait by Mare in the Shelburne Museum is also known; it depicts John C. Couvenhoven, and is dated 1774.Biography at Dictionary of pastellists before 1800 Also dating from that year is a portrait of Dr. Benjamin Youngs Prime, currently in the New York Historical Society collection; these two are the last dated portraits ascribed to Mare, and it appears he stopped painting at this point. Mare's best-known work today is the portrait of merchant Jeremiah Platt currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It is thinly painted; rather than apply glazing, the artist chose to blend still-wet pigments on the surface of the painting to create texture. The portrait is the only one of its kind, three-quarter length, known by the artist's hand; judging by the prominence he gives to the chair on which Platt leans, and the damask drapery background, it appears that he was unfamiliar with the format and compensated accordingly. The portrait suggests knowledge of the work of John Singleton Copley, and is adjudged as Mare's most successful known piece; he is otherwise thought of as an average painter, and his style has been described as \\"stiff and awkward\\".

It covers more than two centuries of Kerala life, encompassing six generations of characters. The historic transformation of man's relationship with land, as also between man and man, men and women and even man and God, forms the staple theme of Kayar.

Tri-Valley Transit's mission is to enhance the economic, social and environmental health of the communities it serves by providing public transportation services that are safe, reliable, accessible and affordable. TVT became a 501(c)(3) incorporation in 2017 as the unification of Addison County Transit Resources (ACTR) of Addison County, Vermont, and Stagecoach Transportation Inc. (Stagecoach) of Orange and Northern Windsor Counties, Vermont. Stagecoach was founded in 1976 and ACTR in 1992 by community leaders who recognized that many residents were impeded by a lack of reliable transportation to work, medical appointments and essential errands. In the early days, services focused on elderly residents and were provided by volunteers. Today TVT offers a robust public Shuttle Bus System for everyone and a complementary Dial-A-Ride System for vulnerable residents who cannot access the Bus System. Beginning in 2002, ACTR expanded its bus routes and Dial-A-Ride capacity, growing ridership from 68,000 to more than 174,000 in 2019 and its growth necessitated building the Addison County Community Transportation Center in order to meet future community transportation needs. Over the past two decades, TVT and ACTR have been recognized more than once nationally as a model rural system and locally for community impact. In 2014, ACTR was named the Chamber of Commerce Non-Profit of the Year, while in 2015, Executive Director Jim Moulton was named the nation‚Äôs Community Transportation Manager of the Year, and in 2016, Regional Director Bill Cunningham was named Addison County‚Äôs Person of the Year. In addition, the Community Transportation Center won awards in 2013 and 2017 for innovative green building design. Based on ACTR‚Äôs record of responsible and highly effective community service, the VT Agency of Transportation (VTrans) asked ACTR leadership to enter into a management agreement with Stagecoach in 2014. Stagecoach was in crisis ‚Äì facing bankruptcy and potential closure. During the three-year management agreement with ACTR, Stagecoach‚Äôs debt was paid off, it regained its status as the regional Medicaid Non-Emergency Medical trip provider, general public services were expanded, and community impact nearly doubled (from 61,400 rides in 2014 to nearly 112,600 in 2019). ACTR also benefitted by gaining shared staff, operational efficiencies and cost savings, and a deeper organizational foundation. In 2017, with the management agreement set to expire, the two Boards of Directors recognized the two agencies were stronger together than apart and Tri-Valley Transit was born. With long histories behind them, however, both divisions continued to operate under their original local branding while slowly building the TVT brand. In 2020, TVT began developing a new, unified logo with plans to implement within 3-6 months. In 2019, TVT provided more than 268,000 rides and was on track to deliver approximately 300,000 in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES PROVIDED AND PERSONS SERVED Dial-A-Ride programs provide more than 119,000 annual rides to elders, persons with disabilities and Medicaid members. They serve people in more remote towns where Shuttle Buses are not cost efficient. 69 volunteer drivers use their own vehicles to provide rides 7 days-a-week. TVT volunteers give more than 55,000 work hours annually, an in-kind value of almost $600,000. While most trips are provided in-county, they also bring passengers to medical specialists across the state and even occasionally as far as Boston or New York City. In FY19 the Dial-A-Ride System provided 65,500 rides to Medicaid recipients and nearly 83,400 rides to the elderly and disabled. 81% of trips are to medical facilities, 16% to grocery stores or meal sites and 3% elsewhere. Surveyed riders gave TVT Dial-a-Ride a 98% approval rating. Shuttle Bus routes operate 7 days-a-week in densely populated corridors, providing 167,000 rides annually. Every bus in the fleet is equipped with a wheelchair lift, two built-in child seats, seat belts and bike-carrying racks. More than half of the respondents to the 2019 bus rider survey reported a household income below poverty level. They also indicated riding the bus to access work, job training or school (71%), shopping (22%) and medical care (31%). 95% of bus riders say TVT routes get them where they need them to go on time. U.S. Department of Commerce indicates 38% of the region‚Äôs population lives below the poverty level, is aged 65 or older or has a disability. These groups are considered ‚Äútransit-dependent‚Äù because of risk indicators for isolation and poor access to the food and medicine. Aging Vermonters need more medical care and may become less fit to drive themselves. The region‚Äôs elderly population is growing (from 15% in 2000 to a projected 30% in 2030). Financial pressures create more transit need (VT people living in poverty rose from 9% in 2000 to 11.7% in 2010; and U.S. News and World Report lists Vermonters‚Äô yearly cost of driving at $12,869/year (that‚Äôs 23% of VT‚Äôs median household income). TVT transportation services allow them to reach all the places needed to live a healthy life. Vermont‚Äôs transit-dependent population is growing quickly (from 15% in 2000 to a projected 30% in 2030) and TVT must grow to keep pace with its needs. Trip planning via TVT is also available on Google Maps. Cities Covered, Google Maps. Retrieved 2015-01-23.

Peters, CanonLaw.info, accessed Jul-1-2013 much later than Roman law but predating the evolution of modern European civil law traditions. The history of Latin canon law can be divided into four periods: the jus antiquum, the jus novum, the jus novissimum and the Code of Canon Law.Manual of Canon Law, pg. 13, #8 In relation to the Code, history can be divided into the jus vetus (all law before the Code) and the jus novum (the law of the Code, or jus codicis). Eastern canon law developed separately. Latin canon law = Jus antiquum = The most ancient collections of canonical legislation are certain very early Apostolic documents, known as the Church Orders: for instance, the Didache ton dodeka apostolon or \\"Teaching of the Twelve Apostles\\", which dates from the end of the first or the beginning of the 2nd century; the Apostolic Church-Ordinance; the Didascalia, or \\"Teaching of the Apostles\\"; the Apostolic Canons and Apostolic Constitutions. These collections have never had any official value, no more than any other collection of this first period. However, the Apostolic Canons and, through it, the Apostolic Constitutions, were influential for a time in that later collections would draw upon these earliest sources of Church law.Paul Fournier and Gabriel Le Bras, Histoire des Collections Canoniques en Occident depuis les Fausses D√©cr√©tales jusqu‚Äôau D√©cret de Gratien, 2 vols. (Paris, 1931), vol I, pp. 16-17 It was in the East, after Constantine I's Edict of Milan of toleration (313), that arose the first systematic collections. We cannot so designate the chronological collections of the canons of the councils of the 4th and 5th centuries (314-451); the oldest systematic collection, made by an unknown author in 535, has not come down. The most important collections of this epoch are the Synagoge kanonon, or the collection of John the Scholastic (Joannes Scholasticus), compiled at Antioch about 550, and the Nomocanons, or compilations of civil laws affecting religious matters (nomos) and ecclesiastical laws (kanon). One such mixed collection is dated in the 6th century and has been erroneously attributed to John the Scholastic; another of the 7th century was rewritten and much enlarged by the schismatical ecumenical patriarch Photius (883). In the Western Church one collection of canons, the Collectio Dionysiana, exercised an influence far beyond the limits of the country in which it was composed. This collection was the work of Dionysius Exiguus, who compiled several collections that now go under the name Dionysiana. Dionysius appears to have done most of his work shortly after the year 600.On the controversial date of the Dionysian collections, see E. Wirbelauer, ed., Zwei P√§pste in Rom: der Konflikt zwischen Laurentius und Symmachus (498‚Äì514), Studien und Texte, Quellen und Forschungen zur antiken Welt 16 (Munich, 1993), p. 121. His collections contain his own Latin translation of the canons of the ancient third-, fourth- and fifth-century councils, excerpts from a (probably) confected collection of African canons (which Dionysius calls the Registrum ecclesiae Carthaginensis, c.f. Church of Carthage), and a collection of (38) papal letters (Epistol√¶ decretales) dating from the reign of Pope Siricius (384-398) to that of Anastasius II (died 498). The influence of this Italian collection grew enormously during the seventh and eighth centuries, especially in England and France. It was continuously enlarged and modified, the most famous modification being a version supposedly send by Pope Adrian I to Charlemagne in 774 and therefore known today as the Collectio Dionysio- Hadriana. Besides the Dionysiana, Italy also produced two 5th-century Latin translations of the Greek synods known as the Corpus canonum Africano-Romanum and Collectio prisca, both of which are now lost though large portions of them survive in two very large Italian collections known as the Collectio canonum Quesnelliana and Collectio canonum Sanblasiana respectively. In Italy was also produced a popular fifth-century collection of forgeries known today as the Symmachean forgeries. Africa possessed a late fourth-century collection known as the Breviarium Hipponense as well as an early fifth-century collection known as the Codex Apiarii causae; also the Breviatio canonum, or digest of the canons of the councils by Fulgentius Ferrandus (died c. 546), and the Concordia canonum of Cresconius Africanus, an adaptation of the Dionysiana (about 690). In Gaul many important collections were produced, like the collection known today as the Concilium Arelatense secundum and, at the beginning of the 6th century, the Statuta Ecclesi√¶ antiqua, erroneously attributed to Africa. Also from Gaul/France are the collections known today as the Collectio canonum quadripartita and the Libri duo de synodalibus causis composed by Regino of Pr√ºm. Gaul/France also produced two immensely important collections known as the Collectio canonum vetus Gallica (compiled in Lyons about 600) and the Collectio canonum Dacheriana (about 800), the latter so called from the name of its editor, Luc d'Ach√©ry. The Collectio canonum Hibernensis or Irish collection of canons, compiled in the 8th century, influenced both England, Gaul and (though much later) Italy.David N. Dumville, \\"Ireland, Brittany and England: Transmission and Use of the Collectio canonum Hibernensis\\", in Catherine Laurent and Helen Davis (eds.), Irlande et Bretagne : vingt si√®cles d'histoire, Actes du colloque de Rennes, 29-31 mars 1993 (Rennes, 1994), pp. 84-85. Unlike almost every other region, England never produced a 'national' collection, though English personnel played an important role in copying and disseminating Irish and Italian collections in Germany and France.M. Elliot, Canon Law Collections in England ca 600‚Äì1066: The Manuscript Evidence, unpubl. PhD dissertation (University of Toronto, 2013). Around the year 700 there developed in either England or Germany a collection of penitential canons attributed to Theodore of Tarsus, Archbishop of Canterbury (died 690). This collection marked a major advance in the development of penitential-canonical collections, which had already been in development for centuries especially within the Irish church. Collections like the one attributed to Theodore were known as penitentials, and were often rather short and simple, most likely because they were meant as handbooks for the use of confessors. There were many such books circulating in Europe from the seventh to the eleventh century, each penitential containing rules indicating exactly how much penance was required for which sins. In various ways these penitentials, mainly Insular in origin, came to affect the larger canon law collections in development on the continent.Fournier and Le Bras, Histoire des Collections Canoniques en Occident, vol I, pp. 51-62. Iberia (i.e. Spain) possessed the Capitula Martini, compiled about 572 by Martin, Bishop of Braga (in Portugal), and the immense and influential Collectio Hispana dating from about 633, attributed in the 9th century to St. Isidore of Seville. In the 9th century arose several apocryphal collections, viz. those of Benedictus Levita, of Pseudo-Isidore (also Isidorus Mercator, Peccator, Mercatus), and the Capitula Angilramni. An examination of the controversies which these three collections give rise to will be found elsewhere (see False Decretals). The Pseudo-Isidorian collection, the authenticity of which was for a long time admitted, has exercised considerable influence on ecclesiastical discipline, without however modifying it in its essential principles. Among the numerous collections of a later date, we may mention the Collectio Anselmo dedicata, compiled in Italy at the end of the 9th century, the Libellus de ecclesiasticis disciplinis of Regino of Prum (died 915); the Collectarium canonum of Burchard of Worms (died 1025); the collection of the younger St. Anselm of Lucca, compiled towards the end of the 11th century; the Collectio trium partium, the Decretum and the Panormia of Yves of Chartres (died 1115 or 1117); the Liber de misericordia et justitia of Algerus of Li√®ge, who died in 1132; the Collection in 74 Titles ‚Äì all collections which Gratian made use of in the compilation of his Decretum =Jus Novum= The period of canonical history known as the Jus Novum (\\"new law\\") or middle period covers the time from Gratian to the Council of Trent (mid-12th century‚Äì16th century). The spurious conciliar canons and papal decrees were gathered together into collections, both unofficial and official. In the year 1000, there was no book that had attempted to summarized the whole body of canon law, to systematize it in whole or in part.Law and Revolution, pg. 116 There were, however, many collections of the decrees of councils and great bishops. These collections usually only had regional force and were usually organized chronologically by type of document (e.g. letters of popes, canons of councils, etc.), or occasionally by general topic. Before the late 11th century, canon law was highly decentralized, depending on many different codifications and sources, whether of local councils, ecumenical councils, local bishops, or of the Bishops of Rome. The first truly systematic collection was assembled by the Camaldolese monk Gratian in the 11th century, commonly known as the Decretum Gratiani (\\"Gratian's Decree\\") but originally called The Concordance of Discordant CanonsLaw and Revolution, pg. 240 (Concordantia Discordantium Canonum). Canon law greatly increased from 1140 to 1234. After that it slowed down, except for the laws of local councils (an area of canon law in need of scholarship), and was supplemented by secular laws.NYTimes.com, Neighbors and Wives book review of Nov-13-1988, accessed 27 June 2013 In 1234 Pope Gregory IX promulgated the first official collection of canons, called the Decretalia Gregorii Noni or Liber Extra. This was followed by the Liber Sextus (1298) of Boniface VIII, the Clementines (1317) of Clement V, the Extravagantes Joannis XXII and the Extravagantes Communes, all of which followed the same structure as the Liber Extra. All these collections, with the Decretum Gratiani, are together referred to as the Corpus Juris Canonici. After the completion of the Corpus Juris Canonici, subsequent papal legislation was published in periodic volumes called Bullaria. Johannes Gratian was a monk who taught theology at a monastery in Bologna. He produced a comprehensive and comprehensible collection of canon law. He resolved contradictions and discrepancies in the existing law.Europe in the High Middle Ages, pp. 127‚Äì128 In the 1140s his work became the dominant legal text.Europe in the High Middle Ages, pg. 116 The papacy appreciated and approved the Decretum of Gratian. The Decretum formed the core of the body of canon law upon which a greater legal structure was built. Before Gratian there was no \\"jurisprudence of canon law\\" (system of legal interpretation and principles). Gratian is the founder of canonical jurisprudence, which merits him the title \\"Father of Canon Law\\".Dr. Kenneth J. Pennington, Ph.D., CL701, CUA School of Canon Law, \\"History of Canon Law, Day 1\\", around 0:25:30, accessed 8-15-2014 In the thirteenth century, the Roman Church began to collect and organize its canon law, which after a millennium of development had become a complex and difficult system of interpretation and cross-referencing. The official collections were the Liber Extra (1234) of Pope Gregory IX, the Liber Sextus (1298) of Boniface VIII and the Clementines (1317), prepared for Clement V but published by John XXII. These were addressed to the universities by papal letters at the beginning of each collection, and these texts became textbooks for aspiring canon lawyers. In 1582 a compilation was made of the Decretum, Extra, the Sext, the Clementines and the Extravagantes (that is, the decretals of the popes from Pope John XXII to Pope Sixtus IV). =Jus Novissimum= After the Council of Trent, an attempt to secure a new official collection of church laws was made about 1580, when Gregory XIII charged three cardinals with the task. The work continued during the pontificate of Sixtus V, was accomplished under Clement VIII and was printed (Rome, 1598) as: Sanctissimi Domini nostri Clementis pap√¶ VIII Decretales, sometimes also Septimus liber Decretalium. This collection, never approved either by Clement VIII or by Paul V, was edited (Freiburg, 1870) by Sentis. In 1557 the Italian canonist Paul Lancelottus attempted unsuccessfully to secure from Paul IV, for the four books of his Institutiones juris canonici (Rome, 1563), an authority equal to that which its model, the Institutiones of Emperor Justinian, once enjoyed in the Roman Empire. A private individual, Pierre Mathieu of Lyons, also wrote a Liber Septimus Decretalium, inserted in the appendix to the Frankfort (1590) edition of the Corpus Juris Canonici. This work was put on the Index. =Jus Codicis= Pio-Benedictine law At the First Vatican Council several bishops asked for a new codification of the canon law, and after that several canonists attempted to compile treatises in the form of a full code of canonical legislation, e.g. de Luise (1873), Pillet (1890), Pezzani (1894), Deshayes (1894), Collomiati (1898‚Äì1901). Pius X determined to undertake this work by his decree \\"Arduum sane munus\\" (19 March 1904), and named a commission of cardinals to compile a new \\"Corpus Juris Canonici\\" on the model of the codes of civil law. The 1917 Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC, Code of Canon Law) was the first instance of a new code completely re-written in a systematic fashion, reduced to a single book or \\"codex\\" for ease of use. It took effect on 29 May 1918. It had 2,414 canons. Johanno-Pauline law In 1959, Pope John XXIII announced, together with his intention to call the Second Vatican Council and a Synod of the Diocese of Rome, that the 1917 Code would be completely revised.John XXIII, allocution Questa festiva (25 Jan. 1959), AAS 51 (1959) pp. 68-69CanonLaw.info, \\"Legislative History of the 1983 Code of Canon Law\\"; accessed June-7-2013 In 1963, the commission appointed to undertake the task decided to delay the project until the Council had been concluded. After Vatican II closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology of Vatican II. After decades of discussion and numerous drafts, the project was nearly complete upon the death of Paul VI in 1978. The work was completed in the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. The revision was promulgated by the apostolic constitution Sacrae Disciplinae Leges on 25 January 1983, taking effect on 27 November 1983. The subjects of the Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC, Code of Canon Law) are the world's 1.2 billion Catholics of what the Code itself calls the Latin Church. It has 7 books and 1,752 canons. Oriental canon law Distinct from the canonical tradition of the Latin Church is the tradition of the Eastern Catholic Churches. The earliest Oriental canon law collections were called nomocanons, which were collections of both canon and civil law. In the early twentieth century, when Eastern Churches began to come back to full communion with the Holy See, Pope Benedict XV created the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church in order to preserve the rights and traditions of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Since the early twentieth century, Oriental canon law had been in the process of codification. Some of these Oriental canon law reforms were promulgated by Pope Pius XII. The codification effort culminated with the Pope John Paul II's 1990 promulgation of the Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium (CCEO, Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches) which incorporates certain differences in the hierarchical, administrative, and judicial fora for the 23 sui juris particular Eastern Catholic Churches, which were each encouraged to issue codes of particular law peculiar to each church, so that all of the Catholic Church's canon law would be codified. Influence of the Catholic Church on civil law Christianity is essentially an ethical religion; and although its moral principles were meant directly for the elevation of the individual, still they could not fail to exercise a powerful influence on such a public institution as law, the crystallized rule of human conduct. The law of Rome escaped this influence to a large extent, because much of it was compiled before Christianity was recognized by the public authorities. But the leges barbarorum were more completely interpenetrated, as it were, by Christian influences; they received their definite form only after the several nations had been Christianized. This influence of the Church is particularly noticeable in the following matters. =(1) Slavery= The condition of the slaves was most pitiable in the ages of antiquity. According to Roman law and usage a slave was considered not as a human being but as a chattel, over which the master had the most absolute control, up to the point of inflicting death. From the time of the Emperor Antoninus Pius (138-61) a master was punished if he killed his slave without reason, or even practiced on him excessive cruelty (Instit. Just., lib. I, tit. 8; Dig., lib. I, tit. 6, leges 1, 2). The emperor Constantine (306-37) made it homicide to kill a slave with malice aforethought, and described certain modes of barbarous punishment by which, if death followed, the guilt of homicide was incurred (Cod. Just., lib. IV, tit. 14). A further relief consisted in facilitating the manumission or liberation of slaves. According to several laws of Constantine the ordinary formalities could be dispensed with if the manumission took place in the church, before the people and the sacred ministers. The clergy were permitted to bestow freedom on their slaves in their last will, or even by simple word of mouth (Cod. Just., lib. I, tit. 13, leges 1, 2). The Emperor Justinian I (527-65) gave to freed persons the full rank and rights of Roman citizens, and abolished the penalty of condemnation to servitude (Cod. Just., lib. VII, tit. 6; Nov., VII, cap. viii; Nov. LVIII, praef. capp. i, iu). Similar provisions were found in the Barbarian codes. According to the Burgundian and Visigothic laws the murder of a slave was punished; emancipation in the church and before the priest was permitted and encouraged. In one point they were ahead of the Roman law; they recognized the legality of the marriage between slaves in the Lombardic law, on the authority of the Scriptural sentence: \\"Whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder.\\" The killing of a slave was severely punished (Counc. of Elvira, D. 300, Can. v; Counc. of Epaon, A.D. 517, Can. xxviv); a fugitive slave who had taken refuge in the church was to be restored to his master only on the latter's promise of remitting the punishment (Counc. of Orleans, A.D. 511, Can. iii, c. vi, X, lib. III, tit. 49); marriage between slaves was recognized as valid (Counc. of Chalons, A.D. 813; Can. xxx; c. i, X, lib. IV, tit. 9); and even the marriage between a free person and a slave was ratified, provided it had been contracted with full knowledge (Counc. of Compiegne, A.D. 757, Can. viii). The institution of slavery was strongly defended in the council of Granges (324) where it was stated \\"If anybody under the pretence of piety, pushes the slave to despise his master, abandon slavery, not serving with good will and respect, may he be excommunicated\\". =(2) Paternal Authority (Potestas Paterna)= According to the Roman law the power of the father over his children was as absolute as that of the master over his slaves: it extended to their freedom and life. The harsher features of this usage were gradually eliminated. Thus, according to the laws of different emperors, the killing of a child either by the father or by the mother was declared to be one of the greatest crimes (Cod. Theod., lib. IX, tit. 14, 15; Cod. Just., lib. IX, tit. 17; Dig., lib. XLVIII, tit. 9, lex 1). Cruel treatment of children was forbidden, such as the jus liberos notice dandi, i.e., the right of handing children over to the power of someone injured by them (Instit. Just., lib. IV, tit. 8); children could not be sold or given away to the power of others (Cod. Just., lib. IV, tit. 43, lex 1); children that were sold by their father on account of poverty were to be set free (Cod. Theod., lib. III, tit. 3, lex 1); finally, all children exposed by their parents and fallen into servitude were to become free without exception (Cod. Just., lib. VIII, tit. 52, lex 3). The son of a family was entitled to dispose in his last will of the possessions acquired either in military service (peculium castrense), or in the exercise of an office (peculium quasi castrense), or in any other way (In stit. Just., Jib. II, tit. 11; c. iv, VI, lib. III, tit. 12). The children could not be disinherited at the simple wish of the father, but only for certain specified reasons based on ingratitude (Nov. CXV. cc. iii sqq.). =(3) Marriage= In the ancient law of Rome the wife was, like the rest of the family, the property of the husband, who could dispose of her at will. Christianity rescued woman from this degrading condition by attributing to her equal rights, and by making her the companion of the husband. This equality was in part recognized by imperial laws, which gave to women the right of controlling their property, and to mothers the right of guardianship (Cod. Theod., lib. II, tit. 17, lex 1; lib. III, tit. 17, lex 4). The boundless liberty of divorce, which had obtained since the time of Augustus, was restricted to a certain number of cases. The legislation of the Emperors Constantine and Justinian on this subject did not come up to the standard of Christianity, but it approached it and imposed a salutary check on the free desire of husband or wife for separation (Cod. Theod., lib. III, tit. 16, lex 1; Cod. Just., lib. V, tit. 17, leg. 8, 10, 11). Woman was highly respected among the barbarian nations; and with some, like the Visigoths, divorce was forbidden except for adultery. =(4) Wills and Testaments= The canon law introduced various modifications in the regulations of the civil law concerning last wills and testaments; among them there is one which enforced a particular fairness in favour of the necessary heirs, such as children. According to the Roman law, one who became heir or legates with the condition of a fideicommissum (i.e., of transmitting his inheritance or legacy to another after his death) had the right of deducting the fourth part from the inheritance or legacy, which was not transmitted; this fourth part being known as the Trebellian quarter. Again, the necessary heirs, such as children, had a claim on a certain part of the inheritance. If it happened that the share of the necessary heir was burdened with a fideicommissum, then the necessary heir was entitled only to deduct the part coming to him as a necessary heir, but not the Trebellian quarter (Cod. Just., lib. VI, tit. 49, lex 6). The canon law modified this provision by enjoining that the necessary heir in such a case was entitled first to the deduction of his natural share and then also to the deduction of the Trebellian quarter from the rest of the inheritance (cc. 16, 18, X, lib. III, tit. 26). =(5) Property Rights= According to a provision in the Roman law, a man who was forcibly ejected from his property could, in order to recover it, apply the process known as the interdictum unde vi against the one who ejected him directly or indirectly, i.e., against him who perpetrated the act of ejection or who counselled it. But he could take action against the heirs of those who ejected him only in so far as they were enriched by the spoliation, and none against a third owner, who meanwhile had obtained possession of his former property (Dig., lib., VLVIII, tit. 16, lex 1. tit. 17, lex 3). The canon law modified this unfair measure by decreeing that he who was despoiled of his property could insist first on being reinstated; if the matter were brought to the courts, he could allege the exceptio spolii, or the fact of spoliation; and, finally, he was permitted to have recourse to the law against a third owner who had acquired the property with the knowledge of its unjust origin (c. 18, X, lib. II, tit. 13; c. 1, VI, lib. II, tit. 5). =(6) Contracts= The Roman law distinguished between pacts (pacta nuda) and contracts. The former could not be enforced by law or a civil action, while the latter, being clothed in special judicial solemnities, were binding before the law and the civil courts. Against this distinction the canon law insists on the obligation incurred by any agreement of whatever form, or in whatever manner it may have been contracted (c. 1, 3, X, lib. I, tit. 35). =(7) Prescriptions= The Roman law admitted the right of prescription in favour of him who had been in good faith only at the beginning of his possession, and it abstracted altogether from the good or bad faith in either party to a civil action, if it were terminated by prescription. The canon law required the good faith in him who prescribed for all the time of his possession; and it refused to acknowledge prescription in the case of a civil action against a possessor of bad faith (cc. 5, 20, X, lib. II, tit. 26: c. 2, VI, lib. V, tit. 12, De Reg. Jur.). (See PRESCRIPTION.) =(8) Legal Procedure= The spirit of Christianity made itself felt in the treatment of criminals and prisoners. Thus prisoners were not to be subjected to inhumane treatment before their trial (Cod. Theod., lib. IX, tit. 3, lex 1); criminals already sentenced were not to be branded on the forehead (Cod. Theod. lib. IX, tit. 40, lex 2); the bishops received the right of interceding for prisoners detained for lighter offenses, and to obtain their freedom on the feast of Easter; they were likewise empowered to visit the prisons on Wednesdays or Fridays in order to see that the magistrates heaped no extra afflictions on the prisoners (Cod. Theod., lib. IX, tit. 38, leges 3,4,6-8; Cod. Just., lib. I, tit. 4, leges 3,9,22,23). To all this may be added the recognition of the right of asylum in the churches, which prevented a hasty and vindictive administration of justice (Cod. Theod., lib. IX, tit. 15, lex 4). A great evil among the Germanic nations was the trial by ordeals, or judgments of God. The Church was unable for some time to suppress them, but at least she tried to control them, placed them under the direction of the priests, and gave to them a Christian appearance by prescribing special blessings and ceremonies for such occasions. The popes, however, were always opposed to the ordeals as implying a tempting of God; decrees to that effect were enacted by Nicholas I (858-67), Stephen V (885-91), Alexander II (1061‚Äì73), Celestine III (1191‚Äì98), Innocent III (1198-1216), and Honorius III (1216‚Äì27) (cc. 22, 20, 7, C. II, q. 5; cc. 1, 3, X, lib. V, tit. 35; c. 9, X, lib. III, tit. 50). Another evil consisted in the feuds or sanguinary conflicts between private persons in revenge for injuries or murders. The Church could not stop them altogether, owing to the conditions of anarchy and barbarism prevailing among the nations in the Middle Ages; but she succeeded at least in restricting them to certain periods of the year and certain days of the week, by what is known as the treuga Dei or \\"Truce of God\\". By this institution private feuds were forbidden from Advent to the Octave of Epiphany, from Septuagesima Sunday until the Octave of Pentecost, and from sunset of Wednesday until sunrise of Monday. Laws to that effect were enacted as early as the middle of the eleventh century in nearly all countries of Western Europe ‚Äì in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, England. The canon law insisted on certain principles of fairness: thus, it acknowledged that a civil action might extend sometimes over three years, against the ordinary rule (c. 20, X, lib. II, tit. 1); connected questions, such as disputes about possessions and the right of property, were to be submitted to the same court (c. 1, X, lib. II, tit. 12; c. 1, X, lib. II, tit. 17); a suspected judge could not be refused, unless the reasons were manifested and proved (c. 61, X, lib. II, tit. 28); of two contradictory sentences rendered by different judges the one favouring the accused was to prevail (c. 26, X, lib. II, tit. 27); the intention of appealing could be manifested outside of the court in the presence of good men, if anyone entertained fear of the judge (c. 73, X, lib. II, tit. 28). =(9) Legislation, Government, and Administration of Justice= The Church was allowed to exercise a wide influence on civil law by the fact that her ministers, chiefly the bishops and abbots, had a large share in framing the leges barbarorum. Practically all the laws of the barbarian nations were written under Christian influences; and the illiterate barbarians willingly accepted the aid of the literate clergy to reduce to writing the institutes of their forefathers. The cooperation of the clergy is not expressly mentioned in all the codes of this kind: in some only the learned in the law, or, again, the proceres, or nobles, are spoken of; but the ecclesiastics were, as a rule, the only learned men, and the higher clergy, bishops and abbots, belonged to the class of the nobles. Ecclesiastics ‚Äì priests or bishops ‚Äì were certainly employed in the composition of the Lex Romana Visigothorum or Breviarium Alarici, the Lex Visigothorum of Spain, the Lex Alamannorum, the Lex Bajuwariorurn, the Anglo-Saxon laws, and the capitularies of the Frankish kings. The bishops and abbots also had a great share in the government of states in the Middle Ages. They took a leading part in the great assemblies common to most of the Germanic nations; they had a voice in the election of the kings; they performed the coronation of the kings; they lived much at the Court, and were the chief advisors of the kings. The office of chancellor in England and in the medieval German Empire was the highest in the State (for the chancellor was the prime minister of the king or emperor, and responsible for all his public acts, it was the chancellor who annulled iniquitous decrees of the king or emperor, and righted all that was wrong); and this office was usually entrusted to an ecclesiastic, in Germany generally to a distinguished bishop. The bishops also had a great share in the administration of justice. As in the East so also in the West, they had a general superintendence over the courts of justice. They always had a seat in the highest tribunal; to them the injured parties could appeal in default of justice; and they had the power to punish subordinate judges for injustice in the absence of the king. In Spain they had a special charge to keep continual watch over the administration of justice, and were summoned on all great occasions to instruct the judges to act with piety and justice. What is more, they often acted directly as judges in temporal matters. By a law of the Emperor Constantine (321) the parties to a litigation could, by mutual consent, appeal to the bishop in any stage of their judicial controversy, and by a further enactment (331) either party could do so even without the consent of the other. This second part, however, was again abrogated by subsequent legislation. In the Middle Ages the bishops acted likewise as judges, both in civil and in criminal matters. In civil matters the Church drew to its jurisdiction all things of a mixed character, the causae spirituali annexae, which were partly temporal and partly ecclesiastical. Criminal matters were brought before the bishap's court, which was held usually in connection with the episcopal visitation throughout the diocese. The methods employed by the ecclesiastical or episcopal courts in a judicial process were such that they served as a model for secular courts. At the beginning the proceedings were very simple; the bishop decided the case presented to him with the advice of the body of presbyters, but without any definite formalities. After the twelfth century the Church elaborated her own method of procedure, with such comparative perfection that it was imitated to a large extent by modern courts. Several principles prevailed in this regard: first, all essential parts of a trial were to be recorded in writing ‚Äì such as the presentation of the complaint, the citation of the defendant, the proofs, the deposition of witnesses, the defence, and the sentence; secondly, both parties were entitled to a full opportunity of presenting all material relating to the accusation or to the defence; thirdly, the parties in a litigation had the right of appealing to a higher court after the lapse of the ordinary term for a trial (which was two years), the party dissatisfied with the decision was permitted to appeal within ten days after the rendering of the sentence. =(10) Sacred Scripture in Legislation= A last instance of the influence of Christianity on legislation is found in the appeal to the books of Sacred Scripture in support of civil laws. In the Roman law there is hardly any reference to Scripture. And that is not surprising, since the spirit of Roman legislation, even under the Christian emperors, was heathen, and the emperor ‚Äì the principle voluntas ‚Äì was conceived of as the supreme and ultimate source of legislation. On the contrary, the codes of the barbarian nations are replete with quotations from Scripture. In the prologue to several of them reference is made to the leftist ration given by Moses to the Jewish people. Mention has been made above of a Lombardic law which recognizes the legality of marriages among slaves on the authority of the Scriptural text: \\"whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder \\" (Matt., xix, 6; Mark, x, 9). Many other examples may be found, e.g., in the Leges Visigothorum and in the Capitularies of the Frankish kings, where almost every book of the Old and New Testament is resorted to for argument or illustration.

Price (born 1938 in Clyde, North Carolina, USA) is an American novelist and historical non-fiction writer whose work covers topics ranging from the Crusades to the American Revolution, to North Carolina in the American Civil War, and to the Texas and Colorado Wild West. Featured writer for the 2009 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library Authors on the Road Program and winner of the 1999 Sir Walter Raleigh Literary Award, a list which includes fellow North Carolinians Reynolds Price (no relation), John Ehle, Ron Rash and Charles Frazier, Price has published five novels, four e-books, one book-length work of historical non-fiction, as well as numerous magazine articles about Western gun fighters. He is also a painter, illustrator, and sculptor in clay.  Biography  Price was born in Clyde, North Carolina, in 1938, to Edgar C. Price, a Methodist minister, and Gertrue [sic] Price. He had one sister, Wanda Price Galloway, who was also a Methodist minister and is now deceased. He graduated Charlotte Central High School in 1957 and High Point College, now High Point University, in 1961 with a BS Degree in Political Science. Price entered the Army Reserves in 1961, serving six months active duty at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina and fulfilled his six year Reserves commitment in clerical positions before mustering out in 1967. From 1966 to 1971 he worked as a reporter and feature writer for the Greensboro Record before becoming a planner for the Guilford County, North Carolina planning department. In 1969 he moved to Birmingham, Alabama, to work as a planning consultant for the Rust Engineering Co., and then moved back to Greensboro, North Carolina, to become the Acting Director of the Guilford Planning Department. In 1974 he took a job as Urban Planner and then Project Manager at Linton, Mields, Reisler & Cottone in Washington, DC., where he stayed 20 years before retiring to take up writing full-time. During this period he earned a Master‚Äôs Degree in Public Administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Writings  = Civil War in the Appalachians = Price turn to full-time writing in 1995. Following the critical success of his first novel, Hiwassee, called by Publishers Weekly ‚Äúforceful and gritty ,‚Äù He moved to Burnsville, North Carolina where his sister Wanda Galloway was pastor of the Pensacola United Methodist Church and the Bald Creek Methodist Church. This put him in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains where he grew up, and where his father, Edgar C. Price, had been a minister in the Western North Carolina Methodist Conference for nearly half a century, providing the settings, story lines, genealogy and voice for his first four novels. His second novel, Freedom‚Äôs Altar (1996), and his third novel, Cockspur (2002) continued the Price family saga begun by the Civil War era Hiwassee, taking place in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War among the soldiers who returned to their families along the Hiwassee River Publishers Weekly called the book ‚Äúabsorbing and moving historical fiction‚Äù. Kirkus Reviews called it ‚Äúwell written, and cutting deeply into the theme of racial prejudice.‚Äù Cockspur, which won the Independent Publisher Book Awards for Storyteller of the Year, follows the Civil War veterans introduced earlier as they struggle against the odds imposed on the South by Reconstruction. Publisher‚Äôs Weekly called the work ‚Äúlyrically written, character-rich, and authentically atmospheric.‚Äù In Where the Water-Dogs Laughed (2003), Price continues the time-line of his family, intertwining a Cherokee myth about a giant bear with the real-life problems the Southern Appalachian farmers faced at the hand of rapacious loggers. Hunter James, reviewer for the Winston-Salem Journal, wrote that this book ‚Äúbrilliantly mines the legends and history of the Southern mountains‚Äù = Revolutionary War = After concluding the Appalachian series, Price turned his attention to the American Revolutionary War, the setting for his fifth novel, Nor the Battle to the Strong (2008). Telling the exploits of Nathanael Greene ascommander of the Southern forces of the Continental Army based out of Charlotte, North Carolina, this book is illustrated with Prices‚Äô own drawings and maps. Winston-Salem Journal reviewer Isabel Zuber called it \\"a masterful story, carefully researched and wonderfully written, blending fact with a brilliant and vivid imagination.\\" Salisbury Post reviewer Deirdre Parker Smith noted that the novel continues his efforts to make history \\"relevant to people in the present.\\" = E-books = Following a dry stretch in which publishers turned down his novels as being part of a genre no longer selling well, Price took three of his favorite Western stories online, venturing into the e-book trade in 2012 with three Kindle books that catered to his own hobby, collecting antique rifles and other memorabilia of the Wild West and Indian Country. A combination of what he calls \\"vanity,\\" as well as \\"the troubling prospects of aging\\" prompted him to make his backlog of unpublished fiction available to Kindle and Nook readers. \\"The sudden prospect of impermanence smote me with a desire to expose the sum of my life's work as a writer to the world.\\" Vengeance on the Sweetgrass: A Literary Western, is a tale set amid the 19th century range wars in Wyoming. Above the Caprock is set in Texas, where a Kiowa raiding party has upended the lives of a widowed rancher and the ex-U.S. Army Scout who protects her from gangs and neighboring cattlemen who want to steal her land. Four Sixes to Beat: John Wesley Hardin in El Paso is a tale of short-lived redemption about the West‚Äôs most feared gunman. A fourth e-book, Call Down Heaven‚Äôs Fire, is a medieval parable closely akin to Price‚Äôs own religious evolution as the son of a Methodist minister. = Western non-fiction = In 2013, Price returned to mainstream publishing, with the publication of his first book-length non-fiction. Published by the University Press of Colorado, Season of Terror: The Espinosas in Central Colorado, March‚ÄìOctober, 1863 uncovers some of the brutal and murderous history of the first days of the new Colorado Territory. Historian Stephen J. Leonard, Professor of History and Chairperson of the History Department at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, praises this work as being ‚Äúmore than a detailed and gripping account of a raft of killings.‚Äù He explains that Price‚Äôs work reveals a much larger picture, spanning centuries of conflict between Anglos and Hispanics and painting such a complex tale of Colorado‚Äôs early history so different from today‚Äôs modern West ‚Äúthat we can imagine it only with the help of an insightful guide.‚Äù Author Marshall Trimble called this book \\"well-written and well documented\\" and added that Price's biography of the Espinosas was \\"an important chapter in the violence and vigilantism that plagued the West during the Civil War.\\" Climbing in the first month of publication to the number three spot on the Denver area bookstores' nonfiction Best Sellers list, one reviewer said his book \\"contains horror and tragedy, but also moments of grace and scene-circling post-mortems.\\" Author photo of South Park, Colorado, showing where much of the Espinosas' rampage took place.  Civic endeavors  As part of his city planning career, Price joined a non-profit effort to improve the livability of communities by promoting quality of life, economic development, social equity and the effectiveness of arts and culture in community building. He is a co-author of a book about this effort, edited by Bob McNulty, President of Partners for Livable Communities. As part of his literary career, Price and his wife Ruth founded the Carolina Mountains Literary Festival, an event held each September in Burnsville, North Carolina, that attracts several dozen writers and poets of regional and national renown, along with 400 to 500 participants from across the country as well as middle-schoolers from surrounding communities. sketch by Charles F. Price of Wild West bar fight  Literary themes and styles  = Family history = Price's first four novels are based on paternal family history gleaned from letters, diaries, and troop rosters and pension records from the National Archives that detailed the actions and movements of many of his Western North Carolina ancestors during and immediately after the Civil War. \\"I began to weave a story around their lives so they were characters as witness to the history happening around them,\\" he explained. In his first novel, Hiawassee, for example, all of the central characters, including his own direct ancestor, Oliver Price, are well documented from the actual muster rolls of the 39th and 65th North Carolina and 39th Georgia regiments. Price also draws heavily on family lore from his mother's side. Nor the Battle to the Strong was based in part on the Revolutionary War experiences of James Johnson, \\"a Scots immigrant and absconded indentured servant who lived through the bloody events depicted in this novel to become one of the author's maternal ancestors.\\" = Research and travel = An avid researcher, Price has also relied on the help of state historians and regional museums. Much of the content of Season of Terror is based on newspaper accounts from the 1860s, which avidly covered the eventual hunting down and beheading of the Espinosa brothers at the hands of US Army Scout Thomas Tate Tobin. Extensive travel through south-central Colorado while researching this book, which is illustrated with his own photographs and maps, added local color and authenticity. = Preacher's son = Price uses his experience as the son of a Methodist minister, also using help from naturalists from the areas he writes about. For example, the Historical Novel Society called his Nor The Battle to the Strong ‚Äúa treasure trove of detail.‚Äù Britt Kaufmann, reviewer for Solander Magazine, described his efforts to bring history to life this way: \\"Even though he binds himself to accuracy as tightly as a traditional historian, it is through the freedom of fiction that Price is able to provide insight into history, thereby sparking a reader's insight into contemporary life. Price's commitment to research and 'determined specificity' create a vividness whereby readers see the events of the past not in the form of entertainment, but as ugly and as graceful as they really were.\\" The Christian Science Monitor put it this way: \\"Price's beautifully evocative prose imparts a sense of immediacy to the landscape of valley, hill, field, stream and forest.\\" Price is also noted for his gritty and realistic characterizations of the rough people who populate his novels. Kirkus Reviews described them this way: ‚ÄúThe salty, exact language, tough-minded views, hard lives, and bloody deeds of these characters ring true throughout.‚Äù Price is a collector of antique guns, but his work does not glorify the revolutionary and Civil War battles featured in his earlier novels, but rather \\"conveys the menace of war's depredations on the daily lives of ordinary people who thought they were involved in a gallant cause, only to be brought face to face with its uglier realities.\\" The many strong female characters that dominate his work show how terrible war is on the families left behind. Rob Neufeld, an historian from Asheville, North Carolina and columnist for the Asheville Citizen-Times, writes that Price‚Äôs characters ‚Äúdictate an unfashionable level of realism.‚Äù Noting that Price‚Äôs father was a Methodist minister, he adds that Price‚Äôs writing seeks to resolve ‚Äúthe disturbing chasm between the gentle religion in which he‚Äôd been raised and the soulless horrors that plague us still.‚Äù Price says of his own writing that it reflects the essential truthfulness of what he calls his own deeply flawed life: ‚ÄúThe vital ingredient is the truth of one‚Äôs life‚Äîthe triumphs, blunders, humiliations, joy, pain, the whole mix of experiences. It all deserves reflection; it is the stuff that truthful writing is made of.‚Äù Montana Cowboy by Charles F. Price  Artwork  Price‚Äôs fiction and non-fiction are often illustrated by his own maps, sketches and paintings ‚Äúthat are skillfully rendered.‚Äù He also sculpts in clay. His work may be seen at his website.  Published works  Price has five published novels, as well as one book-length work of historical non- fiction, numerous magazine articles about the history of the American frontier, four e-books and an essay in an anthology about the Revolutionary War. = Novels = * Hiwassee: A novel of the Civil War.

He was educated at Rugby under Dr. Arnold, where he became the lifelong friend of his school-fellow, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley, and Balliol, where he was elected Fellow in 1838Memorials of William Charles Lake, Dean of Durham, 1869-1894: Lake,K.G/Gurney,H.P/Rawlinson,G London, E.Arnold, 1901 and was President of the Oxford Union.Foster, Joseph, Oxford men & their colleges, p. 67 He was ordained in 1842, but remained at Oxford until 1858. In that year he became Rector of Huntspill; and in 1860 Canon of Wells. Meanwhile, Lake's linguistic abilities had led to his appointment by Lord Panmure as a member of the commission of 1856, to report on military education on the continent. He had won the prize at Oxford in 1840, for his Latin essay on the Roman army as an obstacle to civil liberty. He also served on the Newcastle commission of 1858 to inquire into popular education, and on the royal commission upon military education of 1868. On 9 August 1869, Lake was nominated by Gladstone for the deanery of Durham. In 1881, he was a member of the ecclesiastical court's commission. His theological position was that of a moderate high churchman, and in 1880 he joined Dean Church and others in endeavouring to induce Gladstone and Archbishop Tait to bring forward legislation modifying the Public Worship Regulation Act. During Lake's decanate, Durham Cathedral was restored. He exercised an important influence over Durham University of which he was warden, and education in the north of England generally owed much to his efforts. The foundation of the College of Science at Newcastle in 1871 was very largely his work. He resigned the deanery, owing to failing health, in 1894, and went to live at Torquay. There he died suddenly on 8 December 1897. Family He married, in June 1881, Miss Katherine Gladstone, a niece of the premier, who survived him. Works Lake published nothing separately but a few sermons and a pamphlet, \\"The Inspiration of Scripture and Eternal Punishment, with a preface on the Oxford Declaration and on F. D. Maurice's Letter to the Bishop of London,\\" 1864. But he contributed to the Life of his friend Tait some highly interesting recollections, and especially a valuable picture of the independent position he held at Oxford, and an account from intimate knowledge of his life as head of Rugby, bishop of London, and primate. Lake also supplied to Mr. Wilfrid Ward's W. G. Ward and the Oxford Movement (1889) some reminiscences of Ward, who was for some time his mathematical tutor at Balliol and exercised some influence over his tone of thought.

The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act would revise existing law governing the leasing, operation, and development of oil and natural gas resources available in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The bill is primarily supported by Republicans and is opposed by President Barack Obama. Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to direct the United States Secretary of the Interior to implement a leasing program that includes at least 50% of the available unleased acreage within each Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning area considered to have the largest undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources, with an emphasis on offering the most geologically prospective parts of the planning area. The act instructs the Secretary, in developing a five-year oil and gas leasing program, to determine a specified domestic strategic production goal for the development of oil and natural gas as a result of that program. It would also require the Secretary to: (1) develop and submit a new five-year oil and gas leasing program, (2) conduct offshore oil and gas Lease Sale 220 within one year after enactment of this Act, (3) make replacement lease blocks available in the Virginia lease sale planning area that are acceptable for oil and gas exploration and production if the Secretary of Defense proposes deferral from a lease offering due to defense-related activities irreconcilable with mineral exploration and development. The bill instructs the Secretary to conduct a lease sale within two years after enactment of the Act for areas off the coast of South Carolina that have the most geologically promising hydrocarbon resources and constituting at least 25% of the leasable area within the South Carolina offshore administrative boundaries. It also directs the Secretary to: (1) offer for sale by December 31, 2014, leases of tracts in the Santa Maria and Santa Barbara/Ventura Basins of the Southern California OCS Planning Area; and (2) prepare a multisale environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 for all lease sales required under this Act. The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act, if passed, would also: :*Allocate 37.5% of the amount of new federal leasing revenues to coastal states that are: (1) impacted by the leases under which those revenues are received by the United States, and (2) within 200 miles of the leased tract. :*Establish in the Department of the Interior: (1) an Under Secretary for Energy, Lands, and Minerals, (2) an Assistant Secretary of Ocean Energy and Safety, (3) an Assistant Secretary of Land and Minerals Management, (4) a Bureau of Ocean Energy, (5) an Ocean Energy Safety Service, and (6) an Office of Natural Resources Revenue. :*Instruct the Secretary to establish: (1) a National Offshore Energy Safety Academy, and (2) an Outer Continental Shelf Energy Safety Advisory Board. :*Require the Secretary to: (1) certify annually that all Interior Department personnel having regular, direct official contact with government contractors, or conducting investigations, issuing permits, or overseeing energy programs, comply fully with federal employee ethics laws and regulations; and (3) conduct a random drug testing program of such personnel. :*Abolish the Minerals Management Service. :*Direct the Secretary to collect non-refundable fees from the operators of facilities subject to inspection. :*Establish in the Treasury the Ocean Energy Enforcement Fund as depository for such fees. :*Redefine the outer Continental Shelf to include all submerged lands lying within the U.S. exclusive economic zone and the Continental Shelf adjacent to any U.S. territory. Congressional Budget office report H.R. 2231 would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It would direct the Department of the Interior (DOI) to adopt a new leasing plan for the 2015‚Äì2020 period, require auctions of leases in certain areas in the Atlantic and Pacific OCS, and reduce the department's discretion regarding which regions would be included in future lease sales. Under this bill, some of the offsetting receipts from leases issued in newly available areas would be spent, without further appropriation, to make payments to states. Finally, H.R. 2231 would direct DOI to collect fees from certain firms that operate in the OCS and to implement various administrative reforms. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 2231 would reduce net direct spending by $1.5 billion over the 2014‚Äì2023 period. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the legislation would reduce direct spending. In addition, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost $40 million over the 2013‚Äì2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. Enacting this bill would not affect revenues. Procedural history =House= The Offshore Energy and Jobs Act was introduced into the House on June 4, 2013 by Rep. Doc Hastings (R-WA). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources on June 4, 2013. The subcommittee held hearings on June 6 and 11, before discharging the bill back to the full committee on June 12, 2013. On June 12, the House Committee on Natural Resources marked-up the bill and ordered it reported in amended form by a vote of 23‚Äì18. On June 24, 2013, the bill was reported alongside House Report 113-125. On June 28, 2013, the House voted 235‚Äì186 in Roll Call Vote 304 to pass the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act. Sixteen Democrats voted in favor of the bill. =Presidential reaction= In a statement released on June 25, 2013, President of the United States Barack Obama issued a statement threatening to veto the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act if changes weren't made. In his statement, the President criticized the bill for setting \\"unworkable deadlines,\\" for reducing the net return to taxpayers of money from the leasing of public land, and for the details of the reorganization of the former Minerals Management Service. Three days later, the House passed the bill over the President's objections. Debate and discussion The House Republicans have three main talking points about their reasons for supporting the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act. Those three talking points are: :*\\"The President has implemented a virtual moratorium on oil and natural gas exploration and production in the OCS. His current 5-year leasing program blocks 85% of offshore areas from potential energy production.\\" :*\\"By blocking OCS exploration and production, the President is also blocking the vast economic benefits it would provide.\\" :*\\"In the long-run, offshore drilling has the potential to create 1.2 million jobs, $70 billion in wages, $2.2 trillion in tax receipts, and $8 trillion in additional economic output (GDP).\\" Democrats responded to these arguments by insisting that there were enough open areas for energy companies to lease from and denied that the President's plan had increased gas prices.

Just when he emigrated is unknown; he is known to have been in New York City by 1757, and advertising his work (as \\"Andrew McElworth\\") in local papers by 1758. Five years after moving to New York, he left in search of more commissions, settling in Schenectady and painting a number of prominent locals, as well as residents of Albany. He married Anna Statia (or Anastasia) Willet of New Jersey in October, 1760; the pair are believed to have lived in Westchester County for some while, and had a number of children before her death in 1766. McIlworth is said to have been appointed the first Schenectady town clerk in 1765, and is thought to have left the city two years later. He is last recorded in Montreal in 1767, and is believed to have died around 1769, still in Canada. McIlworth's influence has been discerned in the work of another colonial New York painter, John Mare, but the nature of their relationship is unknown.

From 1962 until his death he was Chief of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Ernst Freese's scientific career started in theoretical particle physics and later moved to molecular biology where he contributed to early genetics research.  Education and academic career  Ernst Freese began his career as a student of physics with Werner Heisenberg at the University of G√∂ttingen, G√∂ttingen, Germany, where Freese received his PhD in 1953 in work in theoretical particle physics. He came to the United States in 1954 to work as a postdoctoral fellow with Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago. He started his career in biology at Max Delbr√ºck's laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in 1955. He held research positions at the University of Cologne (1956-1957) and Harvard University (1957-1959), where he worked with James Watson. Freese joined the University of Wisconsin as an Associate Professor of genetics in 1959 and established the university's first molecular biology program. In 1962 he moved to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as Chief of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Laboratory of Molecular Biology. He held this position until his death. The other laboratory chiefs included Marshall Warren Nirenberg and Daniel Carleton Gajdusek. Freese was also the Director of the Basic Neurosciences Program at NINDS from 1987.  Contributions to molecular biology  Freese was interested in the molecular mechanism of mutations and determined the difference between spontaneous and chemical mutations by using T4 phage. In 1959 he coined the terms \\"transitions\\" and \\"transversions\\" to categorize different types of point mutations. Point mutations, often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A ‚Üî G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C ‚Üî T). Freese's research also included microbial differentiation and molecular neurobiology. He studied the effect of lipophilic acids on the growth and differentiation of bacteria. Freese's laboratory worked on the metabolic control of sporulation and germination of Bacillus subtilis bacteria. He identified the key metabolite for ignition of sporulation: a decrease of GTP. Freese was cofounder of the Environmental Mutagen Society and served as its president for two years. In 1971, he organized the first comprehensive conference focused on the prospects of gene therapy through the John E. Fogarty International Center. His laboratory identified certain compounds as mutagenic and he was instrumental in banning the use of certain pesticides and food additives. Later in his career, as a NIH administrator, he provided the initial support to J. Craig Venter to initiate his program to sequence the human genome. His laboratory first sequenced GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and helped to elucidate its role in neural structure and development. Throughout his career, he trained dozens of postdoctoral research fellows. He received the Alexander von Humboldt Prize in 1983.  Personal life  After meeting her at Caltech, Freese married his fellow postdoctoral fellow, Dr. Elisabeth Bautz, in 1956, and together they had two children, Katherine FreeseCurriculum Vitae of Katherine Freese and Andrew Freese.

It is located about 1,100 light-years (338 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. It was discovered in 2013 using the transit method, in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured, by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. Characteristics =Mass, radius and temperature= Kepler-61b is a super-Earth, an exoplanet with a radius and mass bigger than Earth, but smaller than that of the ice giants Neptune and Uranus. It has an equilibrium temperature of . It has a radius of 2.15 . The mass of Kepler-61b is 6.65 . At 2.15 radius and with a 6.65 mass its density would come to around 3.6 g/cm¬≥ or slightly below the 3.9 cm¬≥ of Mars. This planet may also have some \\"volatile\\" make up or be an ocean planet to explain the lower density. =Host star= The planet orbits a (K-type) star named Kepler-61. The star has a mass of 0.63 and a radius of 0.62 . It has a temperature of 4017 K and is about 1 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The star's apparent magnitude, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is 15. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Orbit= Kepler-61b orbits its host star with about 8% of the Sun's luminosity with an orbital period of 59.877 days and an orbital radius of about 0.28 times that of Earth's (compared to Mercury from the Sun, which is about 0.38 AU). It has an eccentricity of near 0.25, meaning its orbit is mildly elliptical. It receives 27% more sunlight that Earth does. Habitability Artist's representation of an exoplanet that only passes through the habitable zone on part of its orbit. Kepler-61b is located in the inner part of the empirical habitable zone, a zone where liquid water could exist with high albedo, relatively low humidity and higher atmospheric pressure. However, the planet is likely tidally locked because of its close distance to its host star. It has an estimated average equilibrium temperature of , very close to that of Earth. If Kepler-61b is Earth-like it is a good candidate for life, because the system is about one billion years old, however because of its radius (2.24 ), it is likely gaseous, with no solid surface. However, this does not totally destroy the chances of habitability in the Kepler-61 system. Kepler-61b may well have a substantially large enough Earth- like moon (with the proper atmospheric properties and pressure), capable of supporting surface liquid water, and potentially life. However, such moons do not form naturally, it would have to be captured. For a stable orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary and that of the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Kepler-47c, this would be practically the same to have a stable orbit. Tidal effects could also allow the moon to sustain plate tectonics, which would cause volcanic activity to regulate the moon's temperature and create a geodynamo effect which would give the satellite a strong magnetic field. However, the orbit (and close distance to its star) of Kepler-61b may play a key in preventing it and the hypothetical moon from being habitable. The eccentricity of the planet is 0.25, which means it has an elliptical orbit. Kepler-61b's orbit takes it slightly beyond the inner edge of the habitable zone and then out to the middle of it, which would result in the planet experiencing temperatures of up to at is closest point in its orbit, and as low as at its farthest point.http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/hec_plots/hec_orbit/hec_orbit_Kepler-61_b.png These temperatures may vary if Kepler-61b has an intense greenhouse effect, resulting in the planet being too hot to support liquid water altogether. Discovery In 2009, NASA's Kepler spacecraft was completing observing stars on its photometer, the instrument it uses to detect transit events, in which a planet crosses in front of and dims its host star for a brief and roughly regular period of time. In this last test, Kepler observed stars in the Kepler Input Catalog, including Kepler-61; the preliminary light curves were sent to the Kepler science team for analysis, who chose obvious planetary companions from the bunch for follow-up at observatories. The radial velocity observations confirmed that a planetary body was responsible for the dips observed in Kepler-61's light curve, thus confirming it as a planet.

Robert Laurie after Robert Dighton Early life Born in London about 1740, he is said to have been the son of a hairdresser. He was educated at the grammar school in Holborn. A success in a school performance of the Andria of Terence decided him to become an actor. Aged 16, Dodd is said to have appeared at Sheffield as Roderigo in Othello. He was met by Tate Wilkinson in Norwich in 1763. He then played in comedy and tragedy, and was popular, according to Wilkinson. An engagement in Bath, Somerset followed, and proved a stepping-stone to London. At Drury Lane John Hoadly saw Dodd in The Jealous Wife and recommended him to David Garrick, who decided with James Lacy to engage him for Drury Lane Theatre. Dodd's first appearance at Drury Lane took place 3 October 1765 as Faddle in Edward Moore's comedy, The Foundling. For 31 years, Dodd remained there. During this long period he played mainly beaux and coxcombs, regarded as a successor in that to Colley Cibber. He played also in low comedy, sang occasionally, and for benefits took on some serious characters, appearing on one occasion as Richard III.During his first year's engagement he was seen as Jack Meggott in the The Suspicious Husband, Osric in Hamlet, Lord Trinket in The Jealous Wife, Lord Plausible in The Plain Dealer, Slender in the Merry Wives of Windsor, Sir Harry Wildair in The Constant Couple (George Farquhar), Roderigo in Othello, Alexas in All for Love, Sparkish in The Country Wife, Sir Novelty Fashion in Love's Last Shift, and Marplot in The Busybody (Susanna Centlivre), with other characters. He was especially noted as Sir Andrew Aguecheek and Abel Drugger. Among characters of which Dodd was the first exponent were Sir Benjamin Backbite in The School for Scandal, Dangle in The Critic, Lord Foppington in A Trip to Scarborough, and Adam Winterton in The Iron Chest. The Iron Chest was a failure; George Colman the Younger, the author, laid the blame on John Philip Kemble, who played Sir Edward Mortimer. The public, however, hissed Dodd, whose part was tedious. Last years Dodd after the close of the season 1795‚Äì6 acted no more. His last appearance was as Kecksey in the ‚ÄòIrish Widow‚Äô of Garrick, 13 June 1796. He died in the following September. Dodd left at his death a collection of books, largely dramatic, which formed a nine days' sale at Sotheby's, and realised large prices. He also collected the weapons of the North American Indians. Personal life Mrs. Martha Dodd, who was acting with Dodd in the Beggar's Opera as Polly to his Macheath was also engaged at Drury Lane. On 29 January 1766 she played Lady Lurewell in the Constant Couple. She died in October 1769. Dodd had a son James (d. 1820), who was a clergyman, and was usher at Westminster School. Dodd's relationship with Mary Bulkley extended over many years, and ended in a separation and a scandal. James Boaden's Life of Elizabeth Inchbald suggests Dodd behaved badly to her. She was the unmarried Elizabeth Simpson when he tried to seduce her: she threw hot water over him.

Good rose to supervise that audit, and in 1992 she became one of Andersen's few women partners. She was also a partner for a time at Deloitte. Cinergy Following the collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2002, Good joined Cinergy Corp. as senior vice president of accounting and finance. In 2005, Good was named executive vice president and chief financial officer of Cinergy. In 2006, following the merger of Cinergy into Duke Energy, Good was named senior vice president and treasurer of Duke in the company's Charlotte, North Carolina, headquarters. She went on to head the unregulated commercial business. Good was named Duke's executive vice president and chief financial officer as of July 2009. She began to make large investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar facilities that sell their power to utilities and towns. Duke Energy In 2011 Duke of Charlotte and Progress Energy of Raleigh agreed to merge. The deal stipulated that Progress CEO Bill Johnson was to replace Duke CEO Jim Rogers. But in June 2012, on the day that the deal closed, the board fired Johnson and re-hired Rogers instead. North Carolina regulators, following an investigation, reached an agreement with Duke in which the company was required to choose a new CEO by the middle of 2013. Good was selected by a board composed of both Duke and Progress members. Lynn Good became CEO of Duke Energy on July 1, 2013. Good was also elected to the Duke board. In 2016, she was elected chairman of the board. In 2018, Duke Energy awarded Good just under $14 million in total compensation.

Energy policy positions  = Carbon capture and storage = The Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) held a wide-ranging interview of Good on June 21, 2018; among the topics were carbon capture and sequestration. Carbon capture and storage technology can capture up to 90 percent of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions made from a fossil fuels electricity generation plant, thus releasing much less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Good told CSIS that the carbon capture and sequestration process was not quite ready for general use, even though it has potential for keeping fossil fuels in the power-generation mix. According to Daily Energy Insider, \\"On paper, a gas or coal plant that does not release carbon dioxide into the air would be a logical asset to fill in any lags in purely green power production, but Good indicated that while Duke was still collaborating on various research projects involving carbon capture, the big breakthroughs necessary to launch a commercially viable carbon-capture plant were not yet in sight.\\" Other affiliations Good was a member of the board of the Cincinnati Ballet for about eight years, from the 1990s, and has been a member of the board of directors at Boeing since 2015.

They can be distinguished from other theraphosids by a number of characters. Their legs have no or few spines on the underside (ventral surface) of the tibial and metatarsal joints of the legs. The last two leg joints (the metatarsi and tarsi) have brushes of hairs (scopulae) that extend sideways, particularly on the front legs, giving them a spoon-like (spatulate) appearance. Females have two completely separated spermathecae. Taxonomy The earliest classification of the mygalomorph spiders to include sufficient genera to be reasonably comprehensive was that of Eug√®ne Simon in 1892. He recognized only two mygalomorph families; his Avicularidae taxon includes at least 12 modern families. The earliest equivalent to the modern subfamily Aviculariinae is considered to be Simon's 1889 tribe Aviculariae, which included three genera: Avicularia, Tapinauchenius and Scodra (now Stromatopelma). The circumscription of the subfamily has varied considerably. Both the limits of the subfamily and the limits of its genera have been controversial. In his 1985 monograph on the Mygalomorphae, Robert Raven included only four genera, Avicularia, Iridopelma, Pachistopelma, and Tapinauchenius. G√ºnter Schmidt in 2003 included Iridopelma in Avicularia, but added Ephebopus and Psalmopoeus to the subfamily. Authors from 2008 onwards have included a wider range of genera, sometimes newly recognized ones. A 2017 morphological phylogenetic study provided evidence that the subfamily is monophyletic. The authors' preferred hypothesis for the relationships within the Aviculariinae is shown below, based on the species from each genus included in the study.

The Bad Taste of the Town (also known as Masquerades and Operas) is an early print by William Hogarth, published in February 1723/24. The small print ‚Äì by ‚Äì mocks the contemporary fashion for foreign culture, including Palladian architecture, pantomimes based on the Italian commedia dell'arte, masquerades (masked balls), and Italian opera. The work combines two printmaking techniques ‚Äì etching and engraving ‚Äì with etched lines made in the plate using acid and engraved lines marked using a burin. Description Outside the building to the left ‚Äì probably King's Theatre, Haymarket ‚Äì a queue of masked people is being led to a masquerade ball by a devil or satyr bearing aloft a bag containing ¬£1,000 accompanied by a figure wearing a jester's cap and bells with a garter round his right leg (possibly intended to be the Prince of Wales, later George II, who was said to enjoy masquerades). King's Theatre, Haymarket before a fire in 1789 Cuzzoni, Berenstadt and Senesino. A banner hanging above the entrance shows Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough and two other noblemen kneeling before the Italian soprano opera singer Francesca Cuzzoni, asking her \\"pray accept ¬£8,000\\" to perform in London. The Earl is pouring money on the floor, and she draws it towards her with a rake, while two male singers stand behind. The banner is based on a 1723 caricature by another engraver of a performance of Handel's opera Flavio which featured Cuzzoni as Emilia, with Berenstadt as Flavio, and Senesino as Guido. Another sign advertises the conjuring act of Isaac Fawkes in the building's \\"Long room\\". John James Heidegger, Swiss impresario, manager of the King's Theatre, Haymarket, and introducer of the masquerades to London, leans out of a window, identifiable by the letter \\"H...\\" on the window ledge under him. To the right, another crowd waits outside Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre to see John Rich's commedia dell'arte pantomime Harlequin Doctor Faustus. The mitred soldiers guarding the buildings also hint at the patronage of George I, a monarch born in Germany who did not speak English. A countryman with his staff looks on incredulously, as one of the city dwellers tries to interest him in the play. In the background, Hogarth depicts the gate to Burlington House ‚Äì the London house of Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington in Piccadilly ‚Äì labelled \\" of Art\\", topped by a sculpture of Burlington's favoured architect William Kent (KNT), lifted above Michelangelo and Raphael. Hogarth preferred the old English Baroque style over the new Palladian style preferred by Burlington and Kent, as exemplified by Burlington's residence at Chiswick House. In the street outside, a trio of connoisseurs admire the prospect ‚Äì one may be intended to be Burlington. Hogarth contrasts the fashion for foreign entertainments with the neglect of their British equivalents. A woman in the centre foreground is pushing a wheelbarrow filled with the works of great English dramatists ‚Äì William Congreve, John Dryden, Thomas Otway, William Shakespeare, and Joseph Addison ‚Äì being sold as \\"waste paper for shops\\". The first state of the print includes a reference to Anthony Pasquin, replaced in later versions by Ben Jonson. A verse underneath the first version of the print comments: {  Could new dumb Fau≈øtus, to reform the Age, Conjure up Shake≈øpear's, or Ben John≈øon's Ghost, They'd blu≈øh for shame, to see the Engli≈øh Stage Debauch'd by fool'ries, at so great a cost.  What would their Manes say? should they behold Mon≈øters and Ma≈øquerades, where Plays Adorn'd the Theatre of old, And Rival Wits contended for the Bays. } Reception Hogarth attempted to publish the print himself, to avoid the monopoly of the Stationers' Company, and sold the print for cost one shilling. The print was popular, but not a commercial success for Hogarth as half-price unauthorized copies appeared soon after its publication. Hogarth's problems with copyright infringement of his prints made him an advocate for copyright reform, which ultimately led to the Engraving Copyright Act 1734. Later in 1724, Hogarth published A Just View of the British Stage, in which Ben Jonson's ghost rises through a trapdoor and literally pisses on the idiocies of the theatre managers. He followed up with his Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme ‚Äì a similar composition with crowds between buildings to either side ‚Äì and another 1724 engraving entitled The Lottery, sold through the printsellers Mrs Chilcott in Westminster Hall and R Caldwell in Newgate Street.

History The base was active during the First World War, firstly with a flight of No. 38 Squadron RFC initially with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12 between 1 October 1916 and November 1916 before returning on 25 May 1918 with the FE 2B & 2D versions of the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2. The squadron had detachments at Leadenham and Stamford Aerodromes until the squadron moved to Cappelle on 31 May 1918 however the squadron depot stayed here at Buckminster until 14 August 1918 when it became No. 90 Squadron RAF. The new 90 Squadron was similar to 38 Squadron since it had detachments at Leadenham and Stamford Aerodromes with the same FE 2B fighters however during September 1918 this changed when the squadron regrouped at Buckminster and was re-equipped with the Avro 504K(NF). The squadron then disbanded on 13 June 1919 here at Buckminster. The airfield then became home to an Aircraft Acceptance Park which closed in 1919 when the aerodrome was closed. Present day There is no sign of the base today, with the site being given back over to agriculture.

In peacetime she ran scheduled services between Liverpool and West Africa. In the Second World War she was a troop ship, running between the United Kingdom, West Africa, and South Africa. Abosso was built in 1935 and sunk by in 1942, killing 362 of the 393 people aboard. She carried the same name as an earlier Elder Dempster ship, , which had been built in 1912 and sunk by the submarine in 1917. Building and service Cammell Laird of Birkenhead, England, built Abosso for Elder Dempster Lines in 1935. She was launched on 19 June, completed on 8 September and began her maiden voyage on 16 October. Abosso was a motor ship, with two eight-cylinder two-stroke single-acting marine diesel engines driving twin screws and a combined rating of 1,660 NHP. Her navigation equipment included wireless direction finding and an echo sounding device. Abossos accommodation had capacity for 250 1st class, 74 2nd class, and 332 3rd class passengers arranged over three decks. She had refrigeration equipment for carrying perishable cargo in her holds. Abossos regular peacetime route was between Liverpool and Apapa, Nigeria. By the standards of her era Abosso was a small ocean liner, but she was the largest ship in Elder Dempster's fleet. On 27 June 1939 in dense fog off Ushant in France, Abosso was involved in a collision with the British coaster . Both ships survived the incident. In the Second World War Abosso was converted into a Defensively Equipped Merchant Ship, and 20 DEMS gunners were added to her regular crew. She served primarily as a troop ship but also continued to carry civilian passengers between Africa and the UK. On 24 May 1941 a Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor aircraft attacked Abosso, but the ship survived with only slight damage. Final voyage and sinking On 8 October 1942 Abosso left Cape Town, South Africa for Liverpool carrying 210 passengers: 149 military and 61 civilians, including 44 internees, 10 women with children and two or three British distressed seamen (the official term for abandoned seamen away from home without a ship for various reasons). Her DEMS gunners were 13 from the Royal Artillery Maritime Regiment and seven from the Royal Navy. She was also carrying 400 bags of mail in her mail room and 3,000 tons of wool in her holds. Her military passengers included 50 or 51 Dutch conscripts, 44 newly trained pilots fresh from No 23 Service Flying Training School, X Flight, Advanced Training Squadron, at Heany, Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (40 for the RAF and four for the Fleet Air Arm), and 33 or 34 Dutch submariners being transferred to a new submarine. The submariners were from three Royal Netherlands Navy submarines: HNLMS K IX and , both of which had been transferred to the Royal Australian Navy; and , which had been scuttled in the Dutch East Indies to prevent her capture by invading Japanese forces. They were travelling to take over a U-class submarine that Vickers-Armstrongs was building at Barrow-in-Furness and was intended to be launched as HNLMS Haai. Abosso sailed alone and unescorted, despite having a top speed of only . A commander of the Dutch submariners, Luitenant ter zee der 1e klasse Henry Coumou, objected beforehand that this was an unreasonable risk to take, but British authorities overruled him. At 22:13 on Thursday 29 October 1942 Abosso was in the Atlantic about north of the Azores when , commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant G√ºnther Heydemann, fired a spread of four torpedoes at her. One hit Abossos port side abaft her bridge. The ship's engines stopped, all her lights failed, and she started to list heavily to port. Heydemann survived the war and became a successful businessman in Germany. Abosso had 12 lifeboats. The even-numbered boats were on her port side and it is not clear whether any of them was launched. The odd-numbered boats were on her starboard side. As No. 3 boat was being lowered, one of its falls was let go and all of the boat's occupants were thrown into the water. No. 3 boat seems to have been carrying most of the Dutch submariners. No. 5 boat was launched successfully and managed to rescue four of the Dutch from the water. No. 9 boat was also launched successfully. It was a motor boat and moved around picking up survivors from the water. As Abosso settled in the water, she temporarily righted herself, her crew got her emergency generator working, and her floodlights were switched on to help the evacuation. Almost immediately after this, U-575 fired a torpedo from one of her stern torpedo tubes, which hit Abosso at 22:28 (Berlin time) forward of her bridge. At 2305 hrs (Berlin time) Abosso sank bow first. The submarine then surfaced, approached the d√©bris area, and scanned the boats with her searchlights. Kptlt. Heydemann reported about 10 lifeboats and 15 to 20 liferafts afloat and occupied. Heydemann did not try to question survivors to identify the ship, and claimed in his report that this was because the weather was poor. Rescue of survivors rescued the only survivors from Abosso No. 5 boat was leaking badly and her crew were busy using their seaboots and empty cans to bale water out of her. At about 01:30 (local time) on 30 October they lost contact with the other lifeboats. Overnight the boat's crew rowed to keep the boat headed into the sea; at daybreak they raised her mast and hoisted a sail. At about 16:00 (local time) they deployed the boat's sea anchor overnight. At daybreak on 31 October they resumed sailing, and a few hours later sailed into sight of an Allied convoy. This was Convoy KMS-2, which was sailing from the UK to the Mediterranean for Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of Vichy French North Africa. One of the convoy's escorts, the , sighted No. 5 boat and at 11:00 rescued its 31 occupants. HMS Bideford, part of Operation Torch, stopped to pick up the survivors only after permission was given by the admiralty in London by radio communication. Normally stopping for survivors was forbidden. They were 17 military and civilian passengers, 12 crew, and two DEMS gunners. Among the survivors were one of the 10 women passengers, an RAMC Captain, and an RAF pilot officer, William Thomson. Bideford landed them at Gibraltar three days later. No. 5 boat's occupants were the only survivors: the other lifeboats and rafts were never found. A total of 362 people had died, including Abossos Master, Reginald Tate and another Merchant Navy captain, Edward Davies. Among the few survivors were Lieutenant Coumou and three of his fellow-submariners. The Dutch Navy was unable to replace its 30 lost men, so the U-class submarine at Barrow was launched not for the Dutch Navy but as the Royal Norwegian Navy submarine . Monuments The 362 people killed in Abossos sinking have no grave but the sea. The Second World War part of the Tower Hill Memorial in the City of London lists those who were members of her Merchant Navy crew. The Brookwood Memorial in Surrey lists those who were UK or Commonwealth military personnel, such as the newly qualified RAF and Fleet Air Arm pilots. 21 of the victims are commemorated at Singapore's War Memorial, 19 on the War Memorial at El Alamein in Egypt, and one on the Australian War Memorial at Canberra.

The modern Chechen parliament was established in 2003 after the Constitution of Chechnya was approved in a referendum. History After the 1917 establishment of the USSR, the local parliament, the Supreme Soviet of the Chechen Autonomous Oblast merged with Ingushetia, forming the Supreme Soviet of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The parliament met twice a year for short sessions. In autumn 1995, the pro-Russian Chechen administration led by Doku Zavgaev convened the body with most of the deputies of the old. In June 1996 they held elections to the bicameral National Assembly, which stopped functioning in August 1996, when the control of the republic was in the hands of the separatists and the majority of the elected deputies left Chechnya. During January and February 1997, another election was conducted to the parliament of Ichkeria. It consists of about 50 members and is headed by Ruslan Alikhadjiyev. He disappeared almost immediately after the start of the second Chechen war. In the fall of 1999 the old Supreme Council of the Chechen-Ingush, ASSR, tried to gather for the third time. The chairmen of two of its chambers gathered in Moscow with the remaining deputies and created the so-called Chechen State Council, headed by businessman Malik Saidullayev. This initiative, however, was not supported by the Russian leadership, which chose to re-create the local administration. It was headed by the former Mufti of Ichkeria, Akhmad Kadyrov. Following the Constitution that was adopted in 2003, a bicameral parliament amendment was introduced. In December 2007, a constitutional referendum abolished the upper house. Structure The parliament consists of 41 deputies and 10 standing committees. Since the last elections to the parliament, the body has been divided into three factions: United Russia (37 seats), a Just Russia with two seats, and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation with two seats.

The sources prior to 1914 relate in large part to the Hamidian massacres and the Adana massacre. The Armenian Genocide was widely covered in the international community and in many publications such as magazines, newspapers, books, and memoirs. Some organizations, such as the Near East Foundation, used media and newspapers to raise the plight of the Armenians. However, after World War I ended, the Armenian Genocide received little press coverage for the first half of the 20th century. Coverage and public discussion resumed in the last quarter of the 20th century and continued into the 21st century. Press discussion and photographs have been particularly important in educating the public about the Genocide. Press coverage is also considered valuable and important because it constitutes primary sources of direct evidence. During the time period, much of the global press had condemned the nature of the massacres and calls for aid of the Armenians. Coverage of the Armenian Genocide was done by many throughout the world and were often similar when depicting the massacres. Many well-known newspapers in the English language such as The Times, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, The Montreal Gazette, and others also reported extensively about the events. It is believed that The New York Times published thousands of articles pertaining to the Armenian massacres between 1894-1922 and 124 articles in 1915 alone. Some countries, like Australia, relied largely on news agencies in Europe for their information. It is noted that newspapers such as The Washington Post and The New York Times reported on the Armenian massacres almost daily for over a year. The coverage mainly included reports by correspondents, travelers, and consuls or ambassadors of different countries based in the different regions of the Ottoman Empire. Additionally, detailed reports came from missionaries who witnessed the massacres and attempted to aid orphans and other survivors. Local press coverage in the Ottoman Empire came mainly from the Takvim-i Vekayi, the official gazette of the Ottoman government. During the Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919‚Äì1920, the newspaper became especially important because it reported the cross-examinations of Turkish officials and the verdict of court which sentenced Talat, Enver, and Cemal Pashas to death for their roles in massacres against Armenians. Noteworthy studies of the press coverage of Muslim communities in the Middle East and particularly that of Syria have also been instrumental in depicting first hand accounts of the Armenian deportees exiled to the area. The Syrian press also made note of the demographic impact of the Armenian deportees into the region and condemned the Ottoman government for what it largely believed was a campaign of \\"annihilation\\", \\"extermination\\", and the \\"uprooting of a race\\". Terms such as \\"massacre\\", \\"killed\\", \\"murdered\\", \\"slaughtered\\", \\"systematic massacre\\", \\"extermination\\", \\"atrocities\\", and \\"war crimes\\" were used instead of \\"genocide\\" during the period, as Raphael Lemkin coined the term \\"genocide\\" much later in 1943. It was during this time, however, that stereotypes often arose which favored the plight of the Armenians over the Turks. Claims such as the \\"Terrible Turk\\" were invented to depict Turks as such during which Armenians were oftentimes depicted as innocent. Such stereotypes have often been considered Anti-Turkish by scholars today. Exhibitions set up by the Armenian Genocide Museum in Yerevan have been held in Denmark, Lebanon, Sweden, and the United States displaying numerous periodicals from the international press dating from 1860 to 1922. There have also been numerous studies and books published about the press coverage of the Genocide including: \\"El Genocidio armenio en la prensa del Uruguay, a√±o 1915\\" (The Uruguayan Press of 1915 on the Genocide of Armenians) by Daniel Karamanoukian, \\"Le Genocide Armenien dans la presse Canadian\\" (The Armenian Genocide in the Canadian Press) by the Armenian Youth Federation of Canada, \\"The Armenian Genocide: News Accounts From the American Press 1915-1922\\" by Richard G. Kloian, \\"The Armenian Genocide as Reported in the Australian Press\\" by Vahe Kateb, \\"Heralding of the Armenian Genocide: Reports in The Halifax Herald, 1894-1922\\" by Katia Minas Peltekian, \\"\\"The Globe\\"'s representation of the Armenian genocide and Canada's acknowledgement\\" by Karen Ashford, \\"Through the Eyes of the \\"Post\\": American Media Coverage of the Armenian Genocide by Jessica L. Taylor\\" and others. List Included in this list are examples of newspaper articles as republished by various secondary sources. The list also includes press coverage of the massacres prior to the Armenian Genocide such as the Hamidian massacre and the Adana massacre. These massacres are viewed by scholars as beginning a process of exterminating the Armenian people which, in large part, culminated in the final process of genocide in 1915.Vahakn N. Dadrian, The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus (Providence, RI, and Oxford: Berghahn Books, 1995)Raymond H. K√©vorkian, Le g√©nocide des Arm√©niens (Paris: Jacob, 2006). Much of this is apparent in the press articles themselves since they repeatedly place the massacres of 1915 in the context of the previous massacres. Other scholars, such as the Soviet historians Mkrtich G. Nersisyan, Ruben Sahakyan, John Kirakosyan, and Yehuda Bauer subscribe to the view that the mass killings of 1894‚Äì96 during the Hamidian massacre were the first phase of the Armenian Genocide. Even though the Hamidian massacres ended in 1896, Armenians continued to be massacred during what many believed to be \\"peaceful times\\". The massacres conducted during these times involved dislocation, disarmament, dispersion, and ultimately murder. =Hamidian Massacres and Pre- Young Turk Revolution= 1890 *July 25, 1890, Los Angeles Times, \\"Turkish Atrocities: Details of the Massacre at Erzeroum\\" *July 26, 1890, New York Times, \\"The Erzeroum Massacre: Armenians slaughtered and the British Consulate stoned.\\" *November 6, 1890, New York Times, \\"Cruelty of the Turks.

The five vehicles, which are a snow plow, locomotive, tender, bunk car, and caboose, form a snow train, a type of train used to clear snow from rail lines. The snow plow was built as a tender and converted to a wedge-shaped plow in 1953. The locomotive was built in 1903 and served in Wyoming from 1947 to 1957; it served as part of snow trains in 1949 during a blizzard. The bunk car was originally built as an automobile car in 1929 and became a bunk car in 1955; after its retirement, it served as a ticket office for the Wyoming Colorado Railroad. The tender was built between 1907 and 1920, and the caboose was built in 1955. Wyoming snow trains did not function as pre-assembled units and were generally put together when they were needed to clear snow. While these five pieces of rolling stock probably never operated together as a snow train, they are nonetheless representative of Wyoming snow trains. The pieces were moved to the park in 2011 from various locations around Laramie. The Snow Train Rolling Stock was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 2013.

The mission involves a stationary lander that would be a near copy of the successful 2008 Phoenix and InSight spacecraft, but would carry an astrobiology scientific payload, including a drill to sample ice-cemented ground in the northern plains to conduct a search for biosignatures of current or past life on Mars. The science goals for Icebreaker Life focus on sampling ice-cemented ground for its potential to preserve and protect biomolecules or biosignatures. Icebreaker Life was not selected during the 2015 or 2019 Discovery Program competitions. Mission profile The Icebreaker Life mission has been designed based on the successful 2008 Phoenix lander in terms of platform and northern landing site. The Icebreaker Life will also be solar- powered and will be able to accommodate the drill and the rest of the payload with only minor modifications to the original lander. Had it been selected for the Discovery program mission 13, the lander would have been launched no later than December 2021. The lander would arrive over the northern plains of Mars in 2022. Operations on the surface would last for 90 sols. Command, control, and data relay are all patterned after the Phoenix mission with relay to Mars orbiters and direct to Earth as a backup. Christopher McKay is the Principal Investigator. In 2010, the Icebreaker science payload was proposed as the baseline science payload for developing a joint NASA-SpaceX now-canceled mission that was called Red Dragon. Objectives The Mars Icebreaker Life mission focuses on the following science goals: # Search for specific biomolecules that would be conclusive evidence of life. # Perform a general search for organic molecules in the ground ice. # Determine the processes of ground ice formation and the role of liquid water. # Understand the mechanical properties of the Martian polar ice-cemented soil. # Assess the recent habitability (5 million years ago) of the environment with respect to required elements to support life, energy sources, and possible toxic elements. # Compare the elemental composition of the northern plains with mid-latitude sites. To further the current understanding of the habitability of the ice in the northern plains and to conduct a direct search for organics, the Mars Icebreaker Life mission focuses on the following science goals: # Search for specific biomolecules that would be conclusive evidence of past life. Biomolecules may be present because the Phoenix landing site is likely to have been habitable in recent Martian history. Ground ice may protect organic molecules on Mars from destruction by oxidants and radiation, and as a result organics from biological or meteorite sources may be detectable in polar ice- rich ground at significant concentrations. # Perform a general search for organic molecules in the ground ice. If habitable conditions were present, then any organics may be of recent (<10 million years) biological origin. # Determine the nature of the ground ice formation and the role of liquid water. There may have been liquid water generated in the surface soils in the north polar regions within the past <10 million years due to orbital changes in insolation. # Understand the mechanical properties of the martian polar ice- cemented soil. Polar ice may be a resource for human exploration, and the mechanical properties will reflect the stratigraphy of ice and soil, which may inform models of climate history. # Assess the recent habitability of the environment with respect to required elements to support life, energy sources, and possible toxic elements. The perchlorate present at the Phoenix site could provide a usable energy source if ferrous iron is present. A source of fixed nitrogen, such as nitrate, is required for habitability. # Compare the elemental composition of the northern plains with mid-latitude sites. Duplicate samples could be cached as a target for possible return by a Mars sample return mission. If the samples were shown to contain organic biosignatures, interest in returning them to Earth would be high. Science The results from previous missions, and the Phoenix mission in particular, indicate that the ice-cemented ground in the north polar plains is likely to be the most recently habitable place that is currently known on Mars. The near-surface ice likely provided adequate water activity (aw) during periods of high obliquity 5 million years ago, when Mars had an orbital tilt of 45¬∞, compared to the present value of 25¬∞ and ground ice may have melted enough to preserve organic molecules, including organic biosignatures. The two Viking landers conducted in 1976 the first, and so far only, search for current life on Mars. The biology experiments sought to detect living organisms based on the hypothesis that microbial life would be widely present in the soils, as it is on Earth, and that it would respond to nutrients added with liquid water. The Viking biology experiments operated successfully on both landers, with an instrument showing signs of active bacterial metabolism, but it did not occur with a duplicate heat-treated sample. Other instruments yielded negative results with respect to the presence of organic compounds. The results of the Viking mission concerning life are considered by the general expert community, at best, as inconclusive. Scientists deducted that the ambiguous results may have been caused by an oxidant in the soil. The organic analysis instrument on Phoenix (TEGA) was also defeated by the presence an oxidant in the soil, but this lander was able to identify it: perchlorate. The SAM instrument (Sample Analysis at Mars) currently in use on board the Mars Science Laboratory's Curiosity rover, has three capabilities that should allow it to detect organics despite interference from perchlorate. A null result would establish that Earth-like life is likely not present in the ground ice, arguably the most habitable environment currently known on Mars, implying that Earth-like life is absent on Mars generally. This would lower the risk for biohazards during human exploration or sample return. However, this would not rule out life that does not have Earth-like biomarkers. =Preservation of biomolecules= One of the key goals of the Icebreaker Life mission is to test the hypothesis that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from oxidants and radiation. Non-biological organics from infalling meteorites could be detectable in polar ice-rich ground at significant concentrations, so they could be used as indicators that ice actually protect and preserve organic molecules, whether biological or not. If non-biological organics are found, then the north polar regions would be compelling targets for future astrobiology missions, especially because of the potential recent habitability (5 million years ago) of this ice. Target biomolecules will be aminoacids, proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids (e.g., DNA, RNA) and some of their derivatives, NAD+ involved in redox reactions, cAMP for intracellular signals, and polymeric compounds such as humic acids and polyglutamic acid ‚Äîformed by bacterial fermentation. ;Ionizing radiation Ionizing radiation and photochemical oxidants are more damaging in dry regolith, therefore, it may be necessary to reach ~ deep where organic molecules may be shielded by the ice from the surface conditions. The optimal deposition rate for the landing site would be such that of drill will sample through 6 million years of sediment. ;Perchlorate Perchlorate is the most oxidized form of the element chlorine, but it is not reactive at ambient conditions on Mars. However, if heated to above 350 ¬∞C perchlorate decomposes and releases reactive chlorine and oxygen. Thus, the Viking and Phoenix thermal processing of the soils would have destroyed the very organics they were attempting to detect; thus the lack of detection of organics by Viking, and the detection of chlorinated organic species, may reflect the presence of perchlorates rather than the absence of organics. Of particular relevance, some microorganisms on Earth grow by the anaerobic reductive dissimilation of perchlorate and one of the specific enzymes used, perchlorate reductase, is present in all known examples of these microorganisms. Also, perchlorates are toxic to humans, so understanding the chemistry and distribution of perchlorate on Mars might become an important prerequisite before the first human mission to Mars. =Habitability= While sunlight is a powerful energy source for life, it is unlikely to be biologically useful on present Mars because it requires life to be at the surface exposed to the extremely lethal radiation and to dry conditions. The team estimates that if ice-cemented ground at the landing site was in fact raised 5 million years ago to temperatures warmer than ‚àí20 ¬∞C, then the resultant water activity (aw=0.82) may have allowed for microbial activity in the thin films of unfrozen water that form on the protected boundary beneath the soil and ice for temperatures above ‚àí20 ¬∞C. Icebreaker Life would study the concentration and distribution of ferrous iron, nitrate, and perchlorate as a biologically useful redox couple -or energy source- in the ground ice. McKay argues that subsurface chemoautotrophy is a valid energy alternative for Martian life. He suggests that perchlorate and nitrate could form the oxidizing partner in a redox couple if suitable reduced material were available. ;Nitrogen fixation After carbon, nitrogen is arguably the most important element needed for life. Thus, measurements of nitrate over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required to address the question of its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N2) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support nitrogen fixation for biological incorporation. Nitrogen in the form of nitrate, if present, could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes. On Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed in shock and electrical processes. Currently there is no data on its availability.

Icebreaker Life would carry a rotary-percussive drill and the proposed scientific instruments have already been tested in relevant analogue environments and on Mars. *Signs Of LIfe Detector (SOLID) instrument can detect whole cells, specific complex organic molecules, and polymers via fluorescence immunoassays. Using a single Life- Detection Chip (LDCHIP) measuring a few square centimeters, SOLID's antibody library can detect up to 300 different organic molecules. The instrument would carry 16 Life-Detection Chips. *The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) is a powerful analytical instrument that would measure the pH, Eh, conductivity, and dissolved ions present in the ice-cemented ground. The WCL was used successfully on the 2007 Phoenix lander mission. *A laser desorption mass spectrometer (LDMS) would detect and characterize a wide range of nonvolatile organic compounds. The LDMS uses a pulsed laser desorption/ionization (LDI) process, in which molecular ions are sampled directly from particulate samples at Mars ambient pressure, with no vacuum loading required. The LDMS method is not impacted by the presence of perchlorate. *Rotary-percussive drill and a selected set of instruments. The drill penetrates in ice-cemented ground and the cuttings from this drill are sampled by a robotic sample handling system, *The lander uses the Phoenix Surface Stereo Imager (SSI) for monitoring drill and sample delivery operations. It would provide important context information to estimate ice depth and also to understand any surface conditions that may affect mission operations and drill placement. Planetary protection The mission must comply with the planetary protection requirements established by NASA and the international Committee on Space Research (COSPAR).

Career  In August 2010, she released her debut recording New York Love Songs, which features interpretations of works by John Cage and Charles Ives, among others. In April 2012 she made her Carnegie Hall debut, prompting The New York Times's Anthony Tommasini review in which he noted her 'resourceful technique and sensitivity.' She has also performed at (Le) Poisson Rouge, which according to Vivien Schweitzer, was 'an eclectic program that used unconventional tools' . In September 2013, she performed a lecture and recital at the Shanghai Symphony Hall. Exactly one year later, Chai performed to a full audience at Spectrum NYC, debuting selections from her next recording, Life Sketches: Piano Music of Nils Vigeland.http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=9.70216 The performance also included the American debut of Marco Stroppa's \\"Birichino\\", and an experimental rendition of Jaros≈Çaw Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's piece \\"Juicy\\" using Antescofo, featuring animations of fruits.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSHww7K9dM8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJKJ8RcN-7Y In October 2014, Chai was a featured performer at the Leo Brouwer Festival in Havana, Cuba, alongside Yo-Yo Ma, Jordi Savall and Bobby McFerrin.http://oncubamagazine.com/culture/bobby-mcferrin-to-take-part-in-the- sixth-leo-brouwer-festival-on-chamber-music/ In January 2015, Chai's doctoral dissertation on Marco Stroppa's Miniature Estrose (978-3-659-64847-2) was published.

Education  Chai began her music education at the Shanghai Music Conservatory. Chai recently received her Doctor of Musical Arts degree at Manhattan School of Music, where she wrote her thesis (advisor, Marilyn Nonken) on composer Marco Stroppa. Chai has also studied at the Curtis Institute of Music with Seymour Lipkin, and has received two degrees from the Manhattan School of Music where she studied with Solomon Mikowsky, Anthony de Mare, and future collaborator and mentor, Nils Vigeland. One of the pieces she selected for her final recital at Curtis, Henry Cowell's \\"The Banshee\\", required her to play the piano solely on its strings, prompting at least one member of the audience to think she was the piano tuner. In Germany, she studied with Pierre-Laurent Aimard, and performed in Ensemble 20/21, directed by David Smeyers, as well as the group Musikfabrik.

It is a no- frills grocery store where 80% of the offerings are Kroger Brand, the customers bag their own groceries at the checkout, and rent shopping carts for 25 cents. Kroger operates Ruler Foods stores in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee. It was part of JayC Food Stores, which was purchased by Kroger in 1999; however, as of 2018, JayC is now included in the Kroger Louisville division, with Ruler Foods now having its own division. Ruler Foods has its own corporate headquarters adjacent to Freeman Municipal Airport in Seymour, Indiana, which is 90 miles due west of its parent company's Cincinnati headquarters. History The concept was started by JayC Foods as a discount banner. By the end of 1998, the company operated three Ruler Foods store locations. After the purchase of JayC Foods by Kroger in 1999, the JayC division grew its Ruler Foods brand to 13 stores at the end of 2012, including the first store outside of Indiana. Some of the added Ruler Foods were conversions from JayC stores, which has 38 stores at the end of 2012. The company hasn‚Äôt been specific with the number of Ruler Foods locations it would like to open. The stores are about 20,000 square feet, about one-fifth the size of Kroger Marketplace stores. Ruler Foods locations are strictly grocery stores, with no pharmacy and no fuel center. Customers bag their own groceries and 'rent' shopping carts for 25 cents, which is then returned when the cart is replaced. This cuts down on the number of carts on the parking lot which lessens car damage and saves the customer money. Locations Ruler Foods Location in Marion, Indiana. The majority of Ruler Foods locations are in Indiana, with some in Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, and Missouri. Kroger opened its first Ruler Foods in Kentucky in Henderson. The first Ruler Foods in Ohio opened in Lima. A location in Brownsville, Tennessee opened in October 2015 and Milan, Tennessee in March 2016. Typically, Ruler Foods stores open in markets where Kroger does not have existing stores. New Ruler Foods stores have opened in Charleston, IL, St. Ann, MO, Cape Girardeau, MO, St. Louis, MO, Bellefontaine Neighbors, MO, St. Charles, MO, Belleville, IL, Fairview Heights, IL, Granite City, IL, Collinsville, IL, Highland, IL, Olney, IL, Robinson, IL, Springfield, IL, Godfrey, IL, Martin, TN, Milan, TN, Cynthiana, KY and Princeton, KY.http://findnsave.stltoday.com/Local- Ads/a-673744/Ruler-Foods/55868338 Ruler's expansion to St. Louis is a return to the city for Kroger, who previously operated about 50 stores in the area before pulling out in the 1980s amidst intense competition between several local chains. The store has even advertised that it carries Kroger-brand goods, interviewing customers who remembered them or their families shopping at Kroger and remembering its quality. As of April 2016, Ruler Foods operated 43 stores in six Midwest states ‚Äî Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee. As of July 2019, the number had increased to about 50 stores, but also over that time a new logo and branding were introduced and most stores were extensively remodeled.

Reagan first appeared on a few album covers during his time as a Hollywood actor, well before his political career. During the 1960s, folk, rock, and satirical musicians critiqued Reagan in his early years as Governor of California for his red-baiting and attacks on Berkeley's Free Speech Movement. In the 1980s songs critiquing Reagan became more widespread and numerous once he ascended to national office and involved himself in the renewal of the Cold War, the nuclear arms race, social conservatism, right- wing evangelicalism, and his economic policies in relation to low-income people. While references to Reagan during his presidency appear in pop music, his presence in song lyrics and on album covers is often associated with the hardcore punk counter-culture of the 1980s. The 1980s' surge in political songs about a current president marked a shift in the culture and helped define the soundscape of the decade, partly fueled by Reagan's attack on aspects of culture associated with rock and roll, namely sex, drugs, and left- leaning politics. While presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon had been the subject of protest songs and politically satirical music during both the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal, presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter were mentioned only occasionally by songwriters in the 1970s. That changed with Reagan's presidency, which brought on echoes of his prior campaign against counter-cultural activists a generation earlier during his terms as governor of California. The arrival of music television added a visual component to many of these songs, as did numerous album covers that used the president's likeness in their artwork. Artists' access to digital technology and the rise of hip hop also made Reagan the first political figure whose voice was widely sampled in music. With regards to musical taste, Reagan himself was a proponent of standards from Hollywood musicals and the Great American Songbook, running three campaigns to the tune of \\"California Here I Come\\". As a social conservative he and his administration were sometimes at odds with the lifestyles and politics of popular musicians, and Reagan's time as president was marked by various miscommunications involving The Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, and others. Reagan's longevity as a public figure, and the legacy of music written about him, has driven musicians to continue making comment on Reagan well after his political career. Pre-presidency While Ronald Reagan began involving himself in politics in the late 1950s and early 1960s, other cultural and political shifts in the United States coalesced to create a surge in protest music. Waves of African-Americans moving from the Southern United States to urban centers in the North, Midwest, and West during and after World War II helped to electrify the blues and hastened the evolution of rock and roll. A post-war baby boom meant that a large segment of the population was entering their teens at the start of 1960s and became the de facto audience for this new music. Simultaneously the Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam War fueled folk singers like Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs to write and record numerous topical songs that reached a large fanbase of primarily young people. While President Lyndon Johnson's escalation of US involvement in Vietnam was met with increased protests, Reagan began his campaign for Governor of California. Phil Ochs mentioned both Johnson and Reagan on his 1966 album, Phil Ochs in Concert. In his introduction to \\"Ringing of Revolution\\", Ochs sets up the song by speculating on a future where the last of the bourgeoisie are besieged in a mansion atop a hill. Ochs imagines a film based on his own lyrics: > It stars Senator Carl Hayden as Ho Chi Minh, Frank Sinatra plays Fidel > Castro, Ronald Reagan plays George Murphy and John Wayne plays Lyndon > Johnson. And Lyndon Johnson plays God.Ochs, Phil. 1966. \\"Ringing of > Revolution\\" (sound recording). In Phil Ochs in Concert. Elektra Records. Ochs interchanges actors and politicians and pokes fun at Reagan for following in George Murphy's footsteps: Murphy, like Reagan, had been a film actor and became president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), then went on to be a Republican US Senator for the state of California. Reagan had succeeded Murphy as SAG president where he worked as an informant for the FBI during the Hollywood blacklist period. Two decades later, Reagan also ran for office and became California's governor. Tom Lehrer made a similar comparison in his song \\"George Murphy\\", which opens: > Hollywood's often tried to mix Show-business with politics, From Helen > Gahagan To Ronald Reagan. Helen Gahagan was also an entertainer turned politician, progressing from Broadway to US Congress until Richard Nixon unseated her after claims that Gahagan was \\"pink down to her underwear\\". In Lehrer's song on his 1965 live album, he punctuates Reagan's name with a question mark, evoking a laugh from an audience who did not yet know that Reagan would sweep the gubernatorial election the following year. In a similar vein to Lehrar was Borscht Belt entertainer Allan Sherman, who satirized Reagan's governorship on his 1967 song, \\"There‚Äôs No Governor Like Our New Governor,\\" set to the tune of \\"There's No Business Like Show Business.\\" In 1969 Creedence Clearwater Revival mentioned Reagan in their science fiction-inspired song \\"It Came Out of the Sky\\" in which a flying saucer landing in the US Midwest spirals into a commercial and political fiasco. In his lyrics CCR frontman John Fogerty imagines how different sectors of the establishment would respond, with Hollywood turning the event into an epic film, The Vatican declaring it as Christ's return, then-vice president Spiro Agnew proposing a tariff on all things Martian, and Governor Reagan suspecting a communist conspiracy. Fogerty wrote about his inspiration for the song's spectacle and its Reagan reference in his 2015 memoir, saying, \\"Walter Cronkite and Eric Sevareid are in there, big newscasters at the time. And Ronald Reagan‚ÄîI call him Ronnie the Popular.\\" In 1970 Jefferson Starship referred to Reagan's policies and attitudes as governor in the song \\"Mau Mau (Amerikon)\\" on their debut album Blows Against the Empire. In the song vocalist Paul Kantner recants, \\"the dogs of a grade-B movie star governor's war\\" in reference to the previous year's actions taken against students at the University of California, Berkeley to create a People's Park as part of the political counterculture of the 1960s. Governor Reagan's Chief of Staff, Edwin Meese, has ordered the Alameda County Sheriff to fire upon the crowds with buckshot, resulting in the death of one student and the hospitalization of 128 others. These directives had come from Reagan himself, who had been publicly critical of UC Berkeley administrators for tolerating student demonstrations. In his 1966 gubernatorial campaign he had promised to crack down on what he called \\"a haven for communist sympathizers, protesters, and sex deviants\\" on the Berkeley campus. In their song, Jefferson Starship countered Reagan's social conservatism with the line, \\"We'll ball in your parks\\". During Reagan's presidency =Novelty records= While Presidents Johnson and Nixon had come under lyrical fire from songwriters for the role they played in waging war both in Vietnam and against protesters in the US, songs about presidents Ford and Carter were scant in comparison. Exceptions include James Brown's single \\"Funky President\\" (1974);Brown, James, with Bruce Tucker. James Brown: The Godfather of Soul (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, 1986), 242. \\"Please, Mr. President\\" (1975), recorded by 10-year-old Paula Webb; Devo's hit \\"Whip It\\" (1980); and a handful of novelty records, first spoofing the Ford/Carter presidential debates and later the 1970s energy and Iran hostage crises during Carter's presidency. In 1980, producer Dickie Goodman spoofed the Carter/Reagan debates on his \\"Election 80\\" single, which used Goodman's then-popular \\"break-in\\" or \\"flying saucer\\" technique that interspersed bits of dialogue, written and recorded by Goodman, with snippets of popular songs. Goodman would go on to satirize Reagan on his follow-ups, \\"Mr, President,\\" \\"America 81,\\" \\"Washington In-Side-Out,\\" \\"Election '84\\" and \\"Safe Sex Report\\" throughout Reagan's presidency. While Goodman's novelty records dug more at current events and the political process than at the president himself, Reagan's return to major political office ushered in his renewed campaign against things often associated with the rock-and-roll lifestyle: promiscuous sex, illicit drugs, and left-wing politics. As had happened in the 1960s, these attitudes, along with Reagan's domestic and foreign policies, designated Reagan as a prime target for a new generation of protest music. = Pop music = 1981 Michael Jackson with Ronald and Nancy Reagan After Reagan's election as U.S. president in 1980, many pop music artists responded in their song lyrics. In 1981, \\"(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang\\" by British synth-poppers Heaven 17 slammed U.K. prime minister Margaret Thatcher along with Reagan, denouncing the leaders' policies as tending toward racism and fascism. The song was banned by the BBC over concerns of libel, but became a minor UK hit despite its absence from the airwaves. Scottish group the Fire Engines defied the ban by performing a live version of \\"Fascist Groove Thang\\" on The John Peel Show. Critic Stewart Mason later wrote of the song as an example of Heaven 17's \\"skewed perspective: on one level, the song is a straightforward condemnation of the right wing. On another...well, what exactly was a fascist groove thang? The lyrics put images of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan getting down P-Funk style into the listener's head.\\" The song has since become a staple for other bands to play, sometimes keeping the original anti-Reagan lyrics, sometimes inserting other right-wing leaders in relevance to current political situations. After Reagan's inauguration, Prince released \\"Ronnie, Talk to Russia\\" for the album Controversy, a song that Rolling Stone called a \\"hastily blurted plea to Reagan to seek disarmament.\\" On the same record, the song \\"Annie Christian\\" envisions an angel of death responsible for the recent violent events, including John Hinckley's attempt on Reagan's life, the slaying of John Lennon, and a wave of infanticide in Atlanta, Georgia.  1982  In 1982 Australian rock band Midnight Oil critiqued American military intervention in other nations' affairs on their single \\"US Forces.\\" Singer Peter Garrett later said that \\"it‚Äôs construed as an anti-American song but it was an anti-Reagan, anti-Republican song about what they were doing and the impact it was having on our country at the time.\\" Two years after the song's release, Garrett ran for an Australian Senate seat representing the newly formed Nuclear Disarmament Party. After winning more votes than his opponent, other parties joined forces to refuse Garrett and his party a seat in the Senate. That same year artist Joseph Beuys released his single \\"Sonne Statt Reagan,\\" a play on a German phrase meaning \\"sun instead of rain\\" with the word for \\"rain\\" (Regen) spelled like the American president's surname. Beauys' sun-not-Reagan protest song was backed by members of Neue Deutsche Welle groups BAP and Ina Deter and was added to the collection of New York's Museum of Modern Art.  1983  Blues musicians also sang about Reagan. Vietnam and Korean War veteran Louisiana Red recorded \\"Reagan Is For The Rich Man\\" backed by harmonica player Carey Bell in 1983. Red wrote the track after having been refused government benefits, and expresses preference for Reagan's western films over his politics. That same year blues pianist Champion Jack Dupree recorded the song \\"President Reagan\\" in which the former boxing champ accuses Reagan of helping the rich, ignoring poor people and veterans, and undoing the policies put in place by John F. Kennedy two decades earlier. Dupree also sings about being \\"so glad he only got two more years, and the world will be happy...and we won't shed no more tears,\\" without the knowledge that Reagan would be voted in for a second term.  1984  In 1984 former Creedence Clearwater Revival guitarist John Fogerty alluded to Reagan once again for his single \\"The Old Man Down the Road\\". That same year Eagles drummer Don Henley released the single \\"All She Wants to Do Is Dance\\" in protest against the US involvement with the Contras in Nicaragua. In the song he chastised people for wanting to dance while sales of guns and drugs were going on at the behest of the CIA. Henley would later sing about Reagan as \\"this tired old man that we elected king\\" in a parting shot at the president as he was leaving office in 1989's \\"The End of the Innocence\\". Among 1984's other songs protesting the Reagan administration's role in the Iran-Contra affair were \\"Nicaragua\\" by Bruce Cockburn, \\"Lives in the Balance\\" by Jackson Browne. \\"Please Forgive Us\\" by 10,000 Maniacs, and \\"Untitled Song for Latin America\\" by Minutemen. When Britain's ITV network launched the satirical puppet show Spitting Image in 1984, the first record released in relation to the show was a rework of the Crystals' \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\". The Spitting Image version, \\"Da Do Run Ron,\\" was a spoof election campaign song for Ronald Reagan, featuring Nancy Reagan listing reasons why he should be re-elected. The cover featured the puppet versions of the Reagans that appeared on the show and later starred in the 1986 video for \\"Land of Confusion\\" by British band Genesis. Chris Barrie, who voiced Reagan on Spitting Image, also did so on Frankie Goes to Hollywood's \\"Two Tribes\\". The song follows Reagan's career to an imagined future in which Jesus Christ can only return after a nuclear apocalypse, and Barrie, as Reagan, quotes Don McLean's \\"American Pie\\" and parts of an Adolf Hitler speech. On the heels of 1984's presidential campaign, the rock group Supertramp featured spoken voice- overs from both Reagan and Bush on the right audio channel and their Democratic opponents Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro on the left audio channel during the fade-out for their song \\"Better Days\\". The song's video reviews the 20th century through a retrospective montage of its hardships and the leaders who promised a solution. Beginning with the Great Depression and the rise of the Third Reich, the video sequences clips of military parades and battles moving forward to atomic test and other advancements in weapons technology, to footage of President Nixon, and then Reagan as his voice can be heard saying, \\"Our nation is poised...for greatness.\\" In a similar vein, the last minute of Def Leppard's \\"Gods of War\\" is layered with soundbites of Reagan, Thatcher and the noises of missile launches and bombs exploding. In a departure from Cold War rhetoric, the two leaders' quotes are lifted from their justifications for the 1986 United States bombing of Libya and Britain's participation in the affair. Reagan can be heard on the track saying, \\"A message to terrorists everywhere. You can run...but you can't hide\\", and, \\"We are not going to tolerate these attacks from outlaw states,\\" ending with, \\"They counted on America to be passive...They counted wrong,\\" in contrast to Def Leppard's anti-war lyrics.  1985  In 1985 former Police frontman Sting released \\"Russians\\", with lyrics leveled at Reagan, the Soviets, and both countries' pro-nuclear rhetoric, all set to Sergei Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kije Suite. Milwaukee folk-rockers The Violent Femmes imagined the president as \\"Old Mother Reagan\\", a dangerously senile grandmother who tries in vain to enter heaven in one of the group's most fiercely political songs. The same year jam band Phish made their own overt case against the president, sung as a letter to the first lady. Originally titled \\"Memo to Ronnie Reagan\\", the song \\"Dear Mrs. Reagan\\" mimics Bob Dylan's protest music of the 1960s but rails against Mrs. Reagan's Just Say No anti-drug campaign. The band continued to perform it until Reagan left office in January 1989. 1985 also saw the release of Dog Eat Dog, Joni Mitchell's synth-driven album co-produced by Thomas Dolby. The album's songs capture the headlines of the 1980s, including South Africa's apartheid and Ethiopia's famine, while critiquing the rise of mass consumerism and televangelists. Mitchell saw the rise of the religious right as a dangerous and manipulative force on US politics and likened Reagan to a puppet being manipulated by powerful religious leaders. Mitchell told The Guardian: > Reagan feels that Armageddon is inevitable and it's dangerous when you have > a President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the > pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, > increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of > these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for > instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying > \\"Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty things about you, they must be > communists. Therefore they threaten both you and me. Don't you think we > should silence these communists from speaking?\\"  1987‚Äì1989  In 1987, INXS highlighted Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative in their similarly named song \\"Guns in the Sky\\", and R.E.M. likened Reagan to former senator Joe McCarthy. U2's \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" from The Joshua Tree was inspired after lead vocalist Bono visited El Salvador during the Salvadoran Civil War and witnessed how the conflict between rebels and the US-backed government affected local civilians. During a spoken word passage of the song, he speaks of being approached by a man, \\"his face red like a rose on a thorn bush, like all the colors of a royal flush, and he's peeling off those dollar bills, slapping them down, 100, 200\\". Bono said the person he had in mind while writing these lyrics was Reagan, whose administration backed the military regimes in Central and South America that Bono encountered on his trip. Frank Zappa was an outspoken critic of the Reagan presidency and what he saw as a pandering to the religious right wing. During a televised debate on CNN's Crossfire, Zappa said, \\"The biggest threat to America today is not communism, it's moving America toward a fascist theocracy. And everything that's happened during the Reagan administration is steering us right down that pipe.\\" Several songs on Zappa's 1988 album Broadway the Hard Way ridicule Reagan, notably \\"Promiscuous,\\" which jabs at the Reagans' attempts to reduce sex education in public schools and replace it with abstinence-only propaganda as well as his slow response to the AIDS pandemic. On his 1989 album, Big Daddy, John Mellencamp's song \\"Country Gentleman\\" is \\"a scathing indictment on Ronald Reagan\\". Written and recorded during Reagan's final year in office, the song's last line thanks God that \\"he went back to California.\\" = Punk rock = In the 1970s, punk rock emerged as an antithesis to establishment, authority, and the status quo, and by 1980, president-elect Reagan became a prime pariah for punks to rally against in both the United States and abroad. The widespread appearance of Reagan as a vilified icon in punk music particularly can be linked to the do-it-yourself model of bands releasing their own records and not being subject to the censorship of major labels, commercial radio or television. Reagan's rise to power also coincided with the arrival of a new subgenre: hardcore punk. Many hardcore bands put Reagan's face on flyers, T-shirts, and album covers, plus peppered lyrics, song names, and album titles with the president's various monikers, including \\"Reagan,\\" \\"Ronnie,\\" \\"Bonzo,\\" and \\"The Gipper.\\" Other bands would take Reagan's image into the sphere of stage theatrics, like San Antonio's Marching Plague, who donned Ronnie masks while performing their Black Sabbath-inspired tribute, \\"Reagan Man.\\"  Bands named for events linked to Reagan  The band Reagan Youth from New York City, 1980s A few punk bands went so far as to name themselves after the president or events related to him, the first being a self-proclaimed anarcho-punk group from Queens who, in 1980, named themselves Reagan Youth to liken Young Republican fervor for the president to that of the Hitler Youth during the Third Reich. The band's tongue-in-cheek theme song was penned from the perspective of a neo-fascist youth gang shouting, \\"Reagan Youth‚ÄîSieg Heil!\\" On the other side of the country, a skate punk band in Phoenix rebranded themselves as Jodie Foster's Army, or JFA, two weeks after the 1981 Reagan assassination attempt.\\"JFA,\\" Flip Side Fanzine, whole no. 31 (April 1982), pg. 28. Actress Jodie Foster had been the target of an obsession that Reagan assailant John Hinckley Jr. had developed since seeing her portray a preteen sex worker in the film Taxi Driver. Hinckley eventually attempted to kill Reagan as a means to impress the actress.Linder, Douglas O. 2002. \\"The Trial of John Hinckley: Taxi Driver.\\" US: University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law. Originally performing under the name The Breakers, one of JFA's first songs was about the assassination attempt, describing Hinckley's actions with the line, \\"Shoot the prez, shoot a cop, secretary too.\\" When Breakers fans adopted that song's title‚ÄîJodie Foster's Army‚Äîas their own nickname and began showing up at Breakers gigs with \\"JFA\\" written on their clothes, the band decided to adopt it as their new name.  Dead Kennedys  San Francisco's Dead Kennedys made a career out of mentioning Reagan in songs like \\"Moral Majority\\", \\"We've Got a Bigger Problem Now,\\" \\"Bleed for Me\\", and the track \\"Kinky Sex Makes the World Go Round\\", a spoken-word piece about World War III formatted as an erotic phone call between Margaret Thatcher and Reagan's fictitious Secretary of War. The band's 1986 studio album, Bedtime for Democracy, is a play on Reagan's film Bedtime for Bonzo and features a multitude of songs about Reagan. \\"Potshot Heard Round the World\\" is about US military actions in the Middle East, \\"with Reagans and Gaddafis cast as cartoon villains and heroes.\\" Reagan plays the title role in the song, \\"Rambozo the Clown\\", a portmanteau of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo franchise and Bozo the Clown from children's daytime TV. The Dead Kennedys were done in by a lawsuit against their inclusion of H. R. Giger's Penis Landscape painting as an insert for the album Frankenchrist. Singer Jello Biafra was attracted to Giger's work as soon as he saw it, saying, \\"This picture is like Reagan America on parade.\\"  Sun City Girls  JFA's label-mates, the Sun City Girls, released an entire Reagan-themed album in 1987 whose title, Horse Cock Phepner, was an alleged nickname for Ronald Reagan. The album was the band's most lyrical; an obscenity-laden \\"documentation of the American nightmare in all its incestuous beauty.\\" The album's refraining spoken word track \\"Voice of America\\" makes mention of the president, and the album's song \\"Nancy\\" depicts then-First Lady Nancy Reagan as a sexual fetishist. Other songs deride members of the Reagan administration, including Attorney General Edwin Meese, and the band recorded an updated cover version of The Fugs song \\"CIA Man\\" to be about atrocities committed by the CIA during Reagan's presidential terms. In a 1999 interview, the Sun City Girls' guitarist Rick Bishop said: > Other bands during that part of the '80's, both major and not-so-major acts, > were really getting on the political bandwagon for one stupid reason or > another. They were all so fucking serious, trying to be a voice for a > generation or some shit like that, but worst of all they remained within the > parameters of social acceptability. There was also a big censorship flap > going on at the time. We looked at it as a chance to catch up with our > obscenity quota.  Other punk acts  Other notable punk acts that sang about Reagan included The Ramones, The Clash, The Damned, The Exploited, NOFX, Suicidal Tendencies, Wasted Youth, T.S.O.L., Government Issue, Dayglo Abortions, D.O.A., The Fartz, The Minutemen, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles, MDC, Spermbirds, and The Crucifucks. Many of these groups, along with the Dead Kennedys, organized a series of \\"Rock Against Reagan\\" concerts and tours to infuse awareness of then-current politics into the punk subculture. Some hardcore punk songwriters made a conscious decision to avoid putting Reagan in their lyrics. In wanting his music to outlast the administration, Washington, DC musician Ian MacKaye, who was in the bands Minor Threat, Embrace, Pailhead, and Fugazi during the Reagan years, has said, \\"I remember clearly resisting the urge to put the word 'Reagan' in any of the songs\\". Meanwhile, other members of the US hardcore scene took a different political stance altogether: In the late 1980s US skinheads spearheaded a patriotic right-wing faction of New York hardcore, and although bands like Agnostic Front and Cro Mags did not reference the president directly in their lyrics, their support of Reagan fell within their interpretation of patriotic backlash that reimagined hardcore without the anti-establishment ethos of punk rock. Some groups' stances on the president were a bit more ambiguous. When drunk-punk group Murphy's Law praised Reagan and his films in their 1986 song \\"California Pipeline,\\" fans could take it as either actual pro-Republican patriotism or a tongue-in-cheek take on anti- Reagan irony. =Hip-hop and sampling= As hip-hop came of age during the 1980s, Ronald Reagan became the first president to make mention of its music and culture, and Reagan in turn became the first major political figure to recur as a subject in the genre. Proto-rapper Gil Scott-Heron made Reagan the subject of his 1981 song \\"B-movie\\" as well as his 1984 single \\"Re-Ron\\" focusing on Reagan's re-election campaign. The 1980s also saw the widespread use of sampling sounds for use in music, and as sampling equipment became more affordable, both experimental and hip hop artists utilized with greater frequency. Sound collage group Negativland first sampled Reagan on their 1981 album Points on the instrumental track \\"The Answer Is\\", where the music interrupted by the president stuttering, \\"The problem isn't being poor, the problem is, um, the answer is ...\\" The art rock band 3 Teens Kill 4 sampled Reagan and anecdotes about him in their 1984 song \\"Tell Me Something Good\\". In 1985 P-Funk bassist Bootsy Collins and Jerry Harrison from Talking Heads teamed up as the supergroup Bonzo Goes to Washington (named for Reagan's early 1960s films Bedtime for Bonzo and Bonzo Goes to College) to release a single that heavily sampled the president saying, \\"My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes,\\" during a microphone test.Deseret News: Ronald Reagan's 10 Best Quotes German Techno act Moskwa TV sampled the same phrase in the \\"bombing mix\\" of their 1985 dance track, \\"Tekno Talk\\". A snippet of Reagan saying \\"out of control\\" was looped by DJ Jazzy Jeff, Was (Not Was) and EPMD. The president had originally used the expression in reference to the national debt and was appropriated by dance artists to entice their audiences. Industrial dance group Skinny Puppy also used Reagan's voice in their music. Their song \\"Far Too Frail\\" puts a spin on the president's prudishness as he is heard saying, \\"For years some people have argued that this type of pornography is a matter of artistic creativity.\\" and in \\"State Aid\\" Reagan's voice is clipped to create a stammering effect that reflected his reluctance to address the AIDS crisis. Afrika Bambaataa and John Lydon used the same sample in their 1984 video for \\"World Destruction\\" performing under the name Time Zone. The single's B-side also sampled Walter Mondale talking about Reagan. Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau co-wrote an entire musical revue with Elizabeth Swados, featuring the song \\"Rap Master Ronnie.\\" Hollywood actor Reathel Bean was the revue's star performer and in 1984 released a three versions of the song on a 12\\" single attributed to Reathel Bean & The Doonesbury Break Crew. There was also an accompanying video where Reagan and his posse of Secret Service agents go to a black DC neighborhood to rap for minority votes. Other '80s rap songs mentioning or referencing Reagan include Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's \\"The Message\\" (1982), Project Future's one-off \\"Ray-Gun-Omics\\" (1983), Ice-T's \\"Squeeze the Trigger\\" (1987), Biz Markie's \\"Nobody Beats the Biz\\" (1988), Boogie Down Productions' \\"Stop the Violence\\" (1988), Public Enemy's \\"Rebel Without a Pause\\" (1988), and rapper Too Short's 1988 track \\"Cusswords.\\" =Reggae and African music= The Kansas City's Grammy-nominated Blue Riddim Band, recorded the satirical track \\"Nancy Reagan\\" in 1982 about what the band considered to be misguided priorities on the part of the President and his wife. The song was later versioned by Ranking Roger in 1985 and by Big Youth in 2011. Fela Kuti featured demonic caricatures of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and other world leaders on the cover of his 1989 album Beasts of No Nation and mentioned them in the lyrics. =Music videos= The rise of the importance of music videos coincided with Reagan's presidency with the launch of MTV midway into his first year in office. Within a few years, references to the president in song lyrics were mirrored by his likeness appearing in songs' videos. One of the first to feature Reagan, and one of the first by an indie band to appear on MTV, was Randall Jahnson's video for the Minutemen song \\"This Ain't No Picnic.\\" Shot for $450, the video intersperses shots of the Minutemen playing the song on a barren landscape with World War II propaganda footage of Reagan in a US Air Force Spitfire fighter plane, edited to appear as though Reagan was strafing the band with the aircraft's machine guns. The music video was in the running on the network's first Video Music Awards in 1985. That same year Frank Zappa created a music video for his racially charged song \\"You Are What You Is.\\" Though a somewhat conventionally produced video by Zappa standards, MTV blacklisted it because in it an actor made up to look like Reagan was depicted sitting in an electric chair. Also in 1984, Frankie Goes to Hollywood released a video for their anti-war song \\"Two Tribes\\" featuring actors playing Ronald Reagan and Russian leader Konstantin Chernenko who were fighting as though they were professional wrestlers. The video was televised several times during the 1984 Democratic National Convention. In 1986 Genesis collaborated with the producers of British sketch comedy show Spitting Image on the music video for their song \\"Land of Confusion.\\" The video opens with a puppet caricatures of Ronald and Nancy Reagan in bed with a chimpanzee parodying Reagan's film Bedtime for Bonzo, and spirals into the president's fever dream featuring Benito Mussolini, Ayatollah Khomeini, Mikhail Gorbachev, Muammar Gaddafi, Richard Nixon, television celebrities, and the members of Genesis themselves. Reagan awakens drowning in his own sweat, fumbles for a bedside button labelled \\"Nurse\\", but instead presses the one titled \\"Nuke\\", setting off a nuclear explosion. The video won Best Concept Music Video at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards. About.com. and was nominated for by MTV for video of the year. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau ranked the video number one on his year-end \\"Dean's List,\\" and it made number three on the equivalent list in the paper's annual Pazz & Jop survey of music critics. Record sleeves Reagan appeared as an actor and spokesperson on spoken word recordings as early as 1958 and was first pictured on album covers in the early 1960s. One notable recording was Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine, a 1961 Cold War propaganda piece sponsored by the American Medical Association. In his speech, Reagan purports that Social Security is a socialist attempt to supplant private savings, and eventually concludes that, \\"Pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or what he will do for a living. He will wait for the government to tell him.\\" The first musical album which featured Reagan on the cover was Ronald Reagan Recommends Award Winning Music from Hollywood, a promotional item produced by General Electric during Reagan's tenure as their spokesperson from 1953 to 1962. The LP features the General Electric Transcription Orchestra rendering such hits as \\"Zip-A-Dee- Doo-Dah,\\" \\"White Christmas,\\" and \\"Que Sera, Sera.\\" During the 1980s, Reagan's likeness appeared on jackets of records by musicians making political statements almost exclusively against the president. These include: * Let Them Eat Jellybeans!: 17 Extracts From America's Darker Side, the compilation album released on the Dead Kennedys' Alternative Tentacles label in 1981, featured Winston Smith's artwork of the president in front of an inverted United States flag. Let Them Eat Jellybeans' title was a portmanteau referring to Reagan's favorite candy and Marie Antoinette's monarchic \\"Let them eat cake\\" quip allengedly lobbed at France's starving peasantry two centuries hence. The phrase had gained popularity in the media after Reagan had cut food programs that supported children from low-income families, with military veterans during a hunger strike, and artist Jimmy Ernst incorporated the phrase into his collage work in the early 1980s. The album cover and title also inspired an ironic Reagan-era button worn by critics of the president and traded by pin collectors. For the album's 35th anniversary, artist Shepard Fairey made an original print combining the Reagan motif with other emblems of Winston Smith's work with the Dead Kennedys. * Reagan's In, the 1981 debut album Wasted Youth from Los Angeles, featured a version of Reagan's face drawn by then-unknown hardcore punk artist Pushead. * \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\", the 1982 hit single by The Clash, featured Reagan on some versions of the picture sleeve, while others depicted a photo of the band. * Earth Crisis, the 1984 album by reggae group Steel Pulse, featured drawings of Reagan, Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, Pope John Paul II, and a Klansman, among others. * \\"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg,\\" the Ramones 1985 single, pictured Reagan's controversial visit to a German military cemetery in Bitburg earlier that year. Critics in the US, Europe, and Israel decried the presidential visit because among the 2,000 German soldiers buried there were 49 members of the Waffen-SS who had committed genocidal atrocities. The phrase \\"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\\" was coined by protesters in the weeks leading up to Reagan's trip. Before the trip, Reagan ignited more controversy when he expressed his belief that the soldiers buried at Bitburg \\"were victims, just as surely as the victims in the concentration camps.\\" * \\"Five Minutes,\\" the 1985 single by Bonzo Goes to Washington, the collaboration between Bootsy Collins of P-Funk and Jerry Harrison from Talking Heads, depicts Reagan on the sleeve, looking at his wristwatch. * Feed Us A Fetus, the 1986 LP by Canadian thrash band Dayglo Abortions, adapted a photograph of Mr. and Mrs. Reagan with the US presidential seal in the background, adding to it is a fetus being served to the president on a plate. Earlier in his political career, Ronald Reagan had signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act six weeks into his first gubernatorial term, bringing California's statewide total of legal abortion procedures from 518 in 1967 to an average of around 100,000 annually throughout his two terms as governor‚Äîmore than any other state prior to Roe vs. Wade. In 1972 Nancy Reagan make a public statement regarding her husband's decision, saying, \\"If we accept the right to take life before birth are we so far from making the decision after birth?\\" She went on to say, \\"I agree with the California abortion law passed under my husband, however, I believe it has been terribly abused\\". By the end of the Reagans' first term in the White House, they had changed their position on abortion, and in 1986 the president addressed a joint session of Congress, saying, \\"Today there is a wound in our national conscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn\\". By the 1990s, Nancy Reagan reasserted her public opinion of being \\"somewhere in the middle\\" in not supporting abortion while believing in women's right to choose. The Dayglo Abortions's name caused the band problems in both the United States and Canada, and the cover of Feed Us A Fetus resulted in an obscenity charge that was ultimately brought before and overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada. * Beasts of No Nation, the 1989 album by Fela Kuti, critiques state-sanctioned violence in depicting demonic caricatures of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and South African prime minister P. W. Botha, among other world leaders on its cover. Artist Ghariokwu Lemi said of his illustration, \\"I chose to focus on these three personalities because on the global scene they were responsible for the state of affairs of the world. At that point in time, they represented the axis of repression as they supported and helped to prop up the apartheid regime in South Africa and its beastly human policies\\". Ronald Reagan's campaign music = Gubernatorial and first presidential race = Country singer Lee Greenwood with the Reagans at the 1988 Republican National Convention Both in his two terms as governor and during his 1980 run for the presidency, Reagan was introduced with the pop americana standard, \\"California Here I Come\\". The song was reworked into a jingle for the candidate opening with, \\"California, here we come, back where Reagan started from. In 1998 folksinger Oscar Brand recorded this version, along with other presidential campaign songs, for a collection released by Smithsonian Folkways. = Second presidential race and Bruce Springsteen = During his second run for president, Reagan held a public speech in Hammonton, NJ The campaign advisor, George Will, tried to co-opt Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" for the campaign. Will wrote that if \\"labor and management, who make steel or cars or shoes or textiles, made their products with as much energy and confidence as Springsteen and his merry band make music, there would be no need for Congress to be thinking about protectionism\\". A week after Will's writing appeared in a column, Reagan praised Springsteen in a stump speech given in Hammonton, New Jersey on September 19, 1984, saying: \\"America‚Äôs future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in songs of a man so many young Americans admire ‚Äì New Jersey‚Äôs own, Bruce Springsteen. And helping you make those dreams come true is what this job of mine is all about.\\" Soon after Reagan's speech, Springsteen expressed discontent with the president and his policies, and \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was dropped from the campaign. Reagan's team then reached out to John Cougar Mellencamp to use his song \\"Pink Houses\\" and were turned down. The campaign then adopted \\"God Bless the U.S.A.\\" by country singer Lee Greenwood. Greenwood played the song for the Second inauguration of Ronald Reagan and at the inaugurations of the next three Republican presidents. Bob Dole and then Pat Buchanan also used \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" in their respective 1996 and 2000 campaigns, until Springsteen objected. Other events =The Beach Boys= The Beach Boys with Ronald and Nancy Reagan, 1983. In 1983 Reagan's Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt cancelled The Beach Boys annual Independence Day performance in Washington, DC, opting instead for crooner Wayne Newton and a U.S. Army band. The Beach Boys had played a free concert on the National Mall every July 4 since 1980 until Watt declared that rock music attracted \\"the wrong element\\" and that the administration was \\"not going to encourage drug abuse and alcoholism as was done in past years.\\" Watt's social conservatism made him the target of public outcry and denouncements from both the President and the First Lady who declared themselves Beach Boys fans. Days after Watt's announcement, Reagan presented the Secretary with a plaster boot with a hole in it to indicate that Watt had \\"shot himself in the foot.\\" Watt soon reversed his order and invited the Beach Boys back, but the band had quickly booked another Fourth of July concert in Atlantic City. The Beach Boys returned to a crowd of 750,000 on the National Mall in 1984 and performed at Reagan's second inaugural ball the following year. = Michael Jackson = In 1984, Reagan awarded Michael Jackson with the Presidential Public Safety Communication Award after the pop star licensed \\"Beat It\\" for TV spots against drinking and driving. Reagan's speech made several references to Jackson's songs. From the opening remark, \\"Well, isn't this a thriller,\\" Reagan went on to drop allusions to the songs \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\" and \\"I Want You Back,\\" as well as the album Off the Wall. Jackson himself said a total of 13 words at the ceremony. Post- presidency The crossover metal band, Iron Reagan, performing in Germany, 2016. Many artists from different genres have continued to make note of Reagan's legacy in their lyrics, such as Neil Young, Glenn Frey, Van Dyke Parks, GWAR, Camper Van Beethoven, Jay-Z, Kendrick Lamar, Killer Mike, Kanye West, and the Dead Milkmen. Billy Joel was one of the first songwriters to mention Reagan post-presidentially amidst his litany of American cultural and political events in his high-profile 1989 single, \\"We Didn't Start the Fire.\\" ex-Beatle George Harrison threw both Reagan and Bush into a 1991 performance of \\"Taxman\\" released on his Live in Japan concert album. And New York City hardcore band Sick Of It All revived that music sub-genre's prime pariah in their 1992 song \\"We Want the Truth\\". Rage Against the Machine's 1996 album Evil Empire takes its title from name Reagan repeatedly used to describe the USSR. In an interview with MTV, Rage's frontman Zack de la Rocha explained, \\"The title Evil Empire is taken from what Rage Against The Machine see as Ronald Reagan's slander of the Soviet Union in the eighties, which the band feels could just as easily apply to the United States.\\" That same year California punk band NOFX launched a parodic lament for the demise of songs that railed Reagan in their song \\"Reagan Sucks,\\" which name checked 1980s hardcore bands Dead Kennedys, D.I., D.R.I., and M.D.C. In 2006 folk-satire duo The Prince Myshkins released a song about Reagan named \\"I Don't Remember\\" for testimonials the president had given during the Iran-Contra Hearings. Reagan was also mentioned in the 2009 Aqua song \\"Back to the 80s\\". In 2010 television actor Fred Armisen and ex-Scream/Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl paid tribute to their own punk rock roots in the Saturday Night Live sketch, \\"Crisis of Conformity\\", a send-up of an '80s hardcore band reuniting to play a wedding 25 years past their heyday. Chicago indie label Drag City later released a Crisis of Conformity single featuring the song \\"Fist Fight in the Parking Lot\\" whose opening lines \\"When Ronald Reagan comes around / He brings the fascists to your town\\" and subsequent mention of Alexander Haig are a sendup of similar lyrics by the Dead Kennedys and other 80s hardcore acts. In 2012, thrash metal band Municipal Waste formed the spinoff group, Iron Reagan. The band's name pays double tribute to the 1980s with a nod to the group Iron Maiden who enjoyed heavy airplay on MTV during Reagan's presidency. Musical references to Reagan continued to persist in the late 2010s. Bright Eyes founder Conor Oberst's 2016 song \\"A Little Uncanny\\" comments on Reaganomics and explores the irony that Reagan's charisma distracted from the darker side of his policies. After numerous artists refused to perform during inaugural events for Donald Trump in January 2017, a 1980s cover band called The Reagan Years agreed to play at the All American Inaugural Ball at the Hyatt Regency Capitol Hill hotel amidst criticism for supporting a \\"bigot, womanizer, horrible man.\\" See also * Ronald Reagan in fiction * Donald Trump in music References Category:1980s in music Category:Popular music ","title":"Ronald Reagan in music"},{"id":"39834039","text":"Jason Vanacour is a retired American soccer player who is the general counsel for the United States Youth Soccer Association.

It was aired on June 17, 2013. The episode was written by Bryan Gracia and it was directed by Allan Kroeker. Plot A plague is spreading in Defiance, infecting and killing Humans. The plague is identified as a Votan sickness, to which all Votans appear to be immune. The Irathians are pegged as the cause, being carriers while at the same time immune. Amanda (Julie Benz), Nolan (Grant Bowler) and Christie (Nicole Mu√±oz) are infected during the episode. Datak (Tony Curran) suggests to the town council that until they find a solution, they should lock up all the Irathients so no more people get sick. The rest of the members seem to agree with him, except Amanda (Julie Benz). After voting, Rafe (Graham Greene), along with others, starts gathering the Irathients to take them in a tunnel at the McCawley mines. Most of the Irathients are kept there when some others managed to avoid the quarantine. Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) is one of those who are kept in the mines. After a scuffle with the miners, one of the Irathients gets shot and killed. Yewll (Trenna Keating) contacts San Francisco where they have a vaccine for the infection and arranges for it to be sent. However the town has been surrounded by Earth Republic forces preventing entrance or exit to keep the infection from spreading. The vaccines are dropped outside Defiance and Nolan goes to get them along with Conor Lang (Gale Harold). Conor is able to talk Earth Republic into letting Nolan and him retrieve the cure. They manage to get the vaccines but on their return, they are intercepted and captured by the Irathients who avoided the quarantine. They take over the Lawkeeper's office and threaten to destroy the cure if the rest of the Irathients are not released. With Amanda sick, Datak has temporarily taken her place as Mayor and he meets the Irathient hijackers. He pretends to be in their side by saying that he will destroy the cure but he kills them all instead and takes the cure to bring it to Defiance. He then kills Conor who witnessed the whole scene, framing his death to the Irathients. Datak prepares to kill Nolan too but finds that he was unconscious the whole time due to the infection, and does not kill. As the city recovers from the infection, Amanda and Datak address the town via the radio station. Amanda thanks Datak for taking over while she was ill only for Datak to announce his intent to run against her for the position of mayor. In the meantime, Quentin (Justin Rain), after hearing what Nicky (Fionnula Flanagan) said about his mother, he meets her to ask some questions about it. Quentin gives Nicky the artifact and she tells him that his mother, Pilar, is alive and in Mendecino, but suffering from a bipolar disorder. After finding out that his mother is alive and his father lied to him, Quentin leaves his father and Defiance to find his mother. The episode ends with a meeting between Yewll and Nicky where it is revealed that Yewll worked with Nicky and Birch in the past. Now that Birch is dead, Nicky asks Yewll to come back and work with her again.  Feature music  In the \\"If I Ever Leave This World Alive\\" we can hear the songs: * \\"Gone Again\\" by Patti Smith * \\"Gone Again\\" by Brendan McCreary & Bear McCreary * \\"Gone Again\\" by Chad Farran * \\"We Were Sick\\" by The Thermals Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"If I Ever Leave This World Alive\\" was watched by 1.60 million; up 0.31 from the previous episode. =Reviews= \\"If I Ever Leave This World Alive\\" received positive reviews. Rowan Kaiser from The A.V. Club gave a B grade to the episode saying that he felt slightly disappointed at how overstuffed the episode felt but interested in how it was going to get to an ending that managed to deal with the difficult premise. Lisa Macklem from Spoiler TV stated that this wasn‚Äôt her favorite episode so far but it did raise a number of interesting issues. Jim Garner from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.6/5 saying that we had explored few dark paths on the show so far, but they were nothing compared to the one this episode had taken us. \\"The irony of the story heading so far down the dark path that we will need a lantern, a rope and a map to find out way back was that it was also one of the best offerings of the season.\\" References External links * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Defiance (season 1) episodes ","title":"If I Ever Leave This World Alive"},{"id":"39834101","text":"Javanmiri-ye Olya (, also Romanized as JavƒÅnmƒ´rƒ´-ye ‚ÄòOlyƒÅ) is a village in Posht Tang Rural District, in the Central District of Sarpol-e Zahab County, Kermanshah Province, Iran.

This MediaWiki extension was developed by the Wikimedia Foundation in partnership with Wikia. In July 2013, it was enabled by default on several of the largest Wikipedia projects. The Wikimedia Foundation considered it the most challenging technical project to date, while The Economist has called it Wikipedia's most significant change. According to The Daily Dot, Wikimedia Foundation's pursuit of wider participation may risk alienating existing editors. In September 2013, English Wikipedia's VisualEditor was changed from opt-out to opt-in, following user complaints, but it was returned to being available by default in October 2015 after further development. A 2015 study by the Wikimedia Foundation found that VisualEditor failed to provide the anticipated benefits for new editors.

A WYSIWYG editor for Wikipedia had been planned for years in order to remove the need to learn the wiki markup language. It was hoped this would reduce the technical hurdle for would-be Wikipedians, enabling wider participation in editing, and was an attempt to reverse the decline in editor numbers of 50,000 in 2006 to 35,000 in 2011, having peaked in 2007. It was part of a $1m project aimed at developing new features and making improvements. A goal of the project is to allow both the former wiki markup editing and editing with the WYSIWYG VisualEditor. According to Wikimedia Foundation's Jay Walsh, the hope is to redress under-represented contributions from Arabic, Portuguese, and Indic-language versions of the site.Respective Wikipedia websites: Arabic, Portuguese and Indic languages' Urdu, Hindi, Bihari, Gujarati According to Wikimedia Foundation \\"There are various reasons that lead existing and prospective contributors not to edit; among them, the complexity of wiki markup is a major issue.

We also hope that, with time, experienced editors will find VisualEditor useful for some of their editing tasks.\\" In 2012, Sue Gardner, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, said \\"we don't think that the visual editor, in and of itself, is going to solve the challenge\\", and Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales remarked \\"This is epically important\\". =Rollout= MediaWiki is used by a large number of wikis, with smaller sites originally conceived as being rolled out first.

It was default editor for users logged-into the English-language Wikipedia in July 2013. It was subsequently made opt-in on the English-language Wikipedia in September 2013 due to community complaints over its stability and implementation was buggy and had limitations (though it remained active for most non-English Wikipedias).

The implementation encountered challenges with the wiki markup language (the basis for Wikipedia articles), due to it being continuously extended over 12 years to include seldom-used rich and complex features making reproduction of the final article appearance dependent on many factors that were not easy to reproduce. The technical implementation required improvements to MediaWiki in parsing, wiki markup language, the DOM and final HTML conversion. A necessary component is a parser server called Parsoid which is written in Node.js and was created to convert in both directions between wikitext and a format suitable for VisualEditor. The Wikimedia Foundation considered VisualEditor its most challenging technical project to date. supported web browsers include modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Midori, Opera, Safari and Internet Explorer (10+). The VisualEditor MediaWiki extension is available for download by server operators and typically requires the latest version of MediaWiki. Online rich-text editor According to the VisualEditor team, the aim is \\"to create a reliable rich-text editor for MediaWiki\\", a \\"visual editor\\" which is \\"WYSIWYG-like\\". The implementation is split into a \\"core\\" online rich-text editor which can run independently of MediaWiki, and a MediaWiki extension. The MediaWiki extension is in the category \\"WYSIWYG extensions\\". Response Responses to the introduction of the VisualEditor have greatly varied, with The Economists L.M. calling it \\"the most significant change in Wikipedia's short history.\\" = Opposition = Some editors have expressed concerns about the rollout and bugs, with the German Wikipedia community deciding to use an opt-in model instead of an opt-out one. Some opponents have said that users may feel belittled by the implication that \\"certain people\\" are confused by wiki markup and therefore need the VisualEditor. Three months after the rollout of the VisualEditor to the English Wikipedia, The Daily Dot reported that the Wikimedia Foundation had experienced backlash from long-time editors who deemed the editor \\"buggy and untested\\". Following discourse between the community and the foundation, Wikipedia administrator Kww overrode the foundation's rollout, making it opt-in, instead of opt-out. The Foundation did not revert the change, instead committing to further improving VisualEditor. = Support = Softpedia ran an article titled \\"Wikipedia's New VisualEditor Is the Best Update in Years and You Can Make It Better\\". The Register said that the update brings the foundation \\"a little closer to its goal of making it easier for anyone to create and edit Wikipedia articles.\\" =Research results= Aaron Halfaker, a research scientist at the Wikimedia Foundation, ran a controlled study on the effects of VisualEditor in May 2015. The study found that VisualEditor did not increase editor productivity, however reducing the burden upon existing editors. Editing took 18 seconds longer with VisualEditor before hitting save, and new editors were less likely to save their work. Halfaker however did ascribe these negative results as from editors testing the new system, not any real struggle. A previous June 2013 controlled test ‚Äî when VisualEditor was less mature ‚Äî showed similar neutral and negative results.

The novel, based on the author's experiences serving in the light cruiser USS Richmond during the same campaign, is written in a terse Hemingwayesque style and was a contemporary of Nicholas Monsarrat's novel The Cruel Sea and The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk. The novel reached the New York Times Bestseller List for the week of September 6, 1953, ranked 16th in sales, and appeared six times on the list until October 18, fluctuating between 14th and 16th. A third person narrative, the novel is written primarily from the point of view of Alec Austen, an artist obsessed with his painting who joins the navy to escape personal conflicts at the advertising agency at which he works. He is assigned duty as an assistant gunnery officer aboard the USS Atlantis, a light cruiser identical to Richmond. The novel explores several themes, among them abuse of authority by officers; racial discrimination; the clinging of the regular navy early in the war to archaic customs and traditions which are detrimental to morale and the safety of a ship in combat; homosexual rape aboard ship; and the assignment of incompetent or marginally qualified regular officers to positions of trust and authority in an expanded wartime navy. The second half of novel covers a 36-hour period aboard Atlantis in which all the themes come to a head, culminating in a surface battle closely resembling the Battle of the Komandorski Islands. Motion picture rights to The Deep Six were purchased by Jaguar Productions in 1955 and became a feature film starring Alan Ladd as Austen. The film version transformed the cruiser into a destroyer and created a plot line that did not exist in the book, using Austen's Quaker background as a starting point for a theme of pacifism versus duty during war. The title is a reference to burial at sea, i.e. \\"given the deep six.\\"Dibner, p. 105 Plot summary During a gunnery drill aboard the light cruiser USS Atlantis, on patrol west of the Aleutian Islands, a gun barrel of a dual 40mm mount explodes, killing one member of the gun crew and seriously injuring two others. The ship's gunnery officer, Lieutenant Commander Dooley, is terrified by gunfire and accidentally breaks his leg trying to flee the vicinity after the explosion. The gun captain, Frenchy Shapiro, acts promptly to prevent further disaster by unloading the other gun. The officer in charge of the gun mount, Lieutenant (junior grade) Alec Austen, praises Shapiro in his report but avoids any hint of Dooley's cowardly behavior. The Atlantis returns to Adak to send the injured ashore and obtain a new gun barrel. An artist in civilian life, Austen is resentful of being manipulated by Captain Meredith, the skipper of the Atlantis, into painting his portrait, since the favoritism inherent in the situation makes him perceived to be the captain's pet. At Adak the captain sends Austen ashore to pick up a new gun barrel for the 40mm but actually wants him to obtain molding for fashioning a frame for his portrait. This draws the resentment of both the ship's executive officer, jealous of Austen's access to the captain, and the officer of the deck, Ensign Mike Edge, a former enlisted man contemptuous of \\"trade school\\" reserve officers such as Austen. Austen succeeds in acquiring the picture frame but not the gun barrel because the Army general in command on Adak countermands the order for the barrel to make room on the cargo plane for a cow to provide himself with fresh milk. The ship's surgeon, Commander Blanchard, a secret and prolific drinker, admires Austen for the humane manner in which he supervises his enlisted men. Returning together to the ship, the doctor shares a drink of whiskey with him and the freezing boat crew. Austen discovers that one of his men, Slobodjian, has jumped ship to sneak ashore with them and tries to smuggle him back aboard. Edge, however, observes them and to spite Austen, charges Slobodjian with desertion. Austen's 40mm crew is now short four men. Captain Meredith goes ashore for a social visit that night and becomes drunk, vomiting all over himself in the captain's gig. Embarrassed, he blames its crew and orders the coxswain arrested. Later a contrite Meredith is relieved that Austen was the OD and disobeyed the order. Admiral Marcy, the task force commander, comes aboard with his staff and Atlantis sails without a replacement gun barrel. Marcy questions the capability of the old cruiser to carry out its assignment of blockading Japanese-held islands, warning Meredith that a major surface battle is likely to ensue on this patrol. The captain, who has cultivated the loyalty of his men, defends ship and crew, pointing out that recent replacements were entirely \\"the Navy's scum\\", sent to the ship in lieu of imprisonment, and that the remainder of the crew has had its morale undermined by the endless patrolling in Alaskan waters, without hope of change of mission, transfer, or a refit in the United States. In his stateroom, Austen learns from his roommate that the executive officer inspected their room as it they were still midshipmen and threatened disciplinary action. The Negro room steward changing their linen, Homer Fowler, reveals he is trained in gunnery on the 40mm and despite the racial segregation aboard ship, Austen offers him a spot on his undermanned gun crew. Austen also receives a letter mailed months before by Stella Greyne which has just caught up to the ship. The narrative flashes back to how they met, when she was the protege of Godfrey Clemson, the owner of New York's most prestigious ad agency. They have an immediate attraction for each other and Stella, miserable over being unwilling to break free from the repugnant Clemson, falls in love with him. Austen goes to work for Clemson and has a brief affair with Stella but when he deduces that she is actually the mistress of the married Clemson, he quits to enlist in the Navy. During his officer training in Chicago, Stella steals Clemson's car and drives to see him. Austen now knows he loves Stella and asks her to end her relationship with Clemson. Stella recklessly promises to do so and Austen tells her to go to his old studio, where he has left a portrait of her he painted. In her letter, however, Stella apologizes for not have the moral fiber to leave Clemson, and Austen resolves to forget her and make painting his future life. The executive officer intensifies his official harassment of Austen while Dooley, embarrassed by his department's poor performance during a gunnery drill for the admiral, orders Austen to exclude Fowler from the gun crew, despite the excellent marksmanship the steward demonstrated during the same drill. Outraged, Austen takes the issue to the captain, who fears that backing Austen will further harm morale and result in violence among the crew. Vacillating, he suspends the order until he can discuss it with Dooley. Just before Admiral Marcy departs, he gives the ship a combat mission and asks Meredith to find a place in his wardroom for his aide, Commander Griswold, suggesting that the executive officer \\"shouldn't be at sea\\" and hinting that the combat veteran Griswold would make an excellent replacement. Atlantis daringly conducts shore bombardment of both Japanese-occupied Attu and the Japanese base at Paramushiro in the Home Islands, restoring the crew's morale. When they reach enemy waters, the captain tells Austen he can use Fowler as an ammunition passer, and as a gunner during actual combat, but he cannot assign him to the crew. Commander Blanchard offers Austen a drink in his quarters as commiseration, but while he is there a boyish radioman named Gray bypasses channels and asks Blanchard to be admit him to sick bay for an imagined injury. Blanchard tells him to stand his radio watch and report to sick bay afterwards. Edge confronts Gray in the passageway outside and from his position of power over him, marks him as sexual prey. Austen intervenes but sees that Gray is emotionally unstable, and is disturbed by Edge's obscene interest. He consults a veteran warrant officer who knows Edge and is warned that Edge once committed rape on another sailor that went uninvestigated after the sailor got drunk and drowned. In the wardroom, when Austen informs Fowler of the captain's decision, a scene ensues with Dooley in which Austen loses his temper and responds insolently. The executive officer overhears the exchange and places Austen in hack. Edge tries to goad Fowler with racial slurs and Austen warns the steward to stay clear of him, recognizing that both he and Fowler are nearing the limits of their tolerance. After Austen goes to his room, Edge provokes Fowler into attacking him and stabs his hand with a screwdriver. Fowler severely beats Edge and flees when the incident is witnessed by the executive officer, who sends the master-at-arms to arrest Fowler. A search of the ship fails to find Fowler, hiding in an ammunition ready room near his gun station. Atlantis's spotting plane is lost in the fog and unable to find the ship. Radioman Gray has a nervous breakdown and before he can be stopped, violates radio silence trying to talk to the pilot, giving away the ship's position. The gunnery department is ordered to battle stations and when the float plane is sighted, Fowler emerges from hiding and shoots it down, thinking it to be Japanese. The master-at-arms arrives and beats Fowler with his pistol, nearly killing him. Austen helps carry him to sick bay and is accused by the executive officer of deserting his battle station. Austen tells the executive officer he is tired of the abuse and is threatened with court martial. The executive officer, peevishly commanded by the captain to stand the onerous morning watch on the bridge, orders Austen to stand it with him. The executive officer asks Blanchard to support his allegation against Austen with a damning medical report. Blanchard refuses and warns the executive officer that he is hated by the entire crew and exhibiting irrational behavior. Before his watch, Austen is asked by Frenchy to draw his portrait to send to his daughter. Frenchy decides to leave the Navy when his enlistment is over and insists on paying for the portrait with gambling winnings, which Austen accepts on the condition it be sent to Frenchy's family. The injured Edge sneaks out of his quarters, steals a pistol from a sailor on security duty, and plans to rape and kill both Fowler and Gray in the brig. On watch, the executive officer breaks down completely and insists that every crew member aboard the ship be polled to see if they hate him. The captain, listening from his sea cabin, relieves the executive officer, and orders Austen to find Edge, who has been seen prowling the ship. Edge intimidates the brig guard into opening the cell but he is thwarted when the prisoner with Fowler is not Gray but Slobodjian, who knows what Edge plans to do. He cuts Edge with a hidden knife to prevent him from using the gun. Edge hides his wound from the guard and leaves, realizing he would be unable to explain his behavior, taking refuge in a stowage compartment. Austen finds him however, and by refusing to fight Edge when challenged, breaks him down psychologically, recovering the pistol and leaving Edge to his own demons. Austen returns to the bridge, but before he can make his report, a Japanese task force is sighted trying to run supplies past the blockade. The captain, encouraged by the support of Commander Griswold, decides to fight instead of retiring even though his force is outnumbered two-to-one. Austen goes to his battle station, where Fowler has been released from the brig to help defend the ship. Atlantis survives a desperate battle, and aided as much by luck as audacity, repels the enemy force, thanks in large part to Meredith's determination to fight. The executive officer fails to report to his battle station and is later found to have committed suicide in his room. Slobodjian, also released from the brig, is blown overboard by a near miss. Edge's small damage control party is locked down in a flooding compartment which he cowardly tries to abandon but is prevented by Gray, in the sick bay on the other wide of the locked hatch. Ironically a hit kills everyone in the compartment except Edge, who tricks the weak-minded Gray into opening the hatch. He overpowers Gray but collapses from his previous injury. Returning with casualties, the medical party finds them, assumes that Edge rescued Gray, and Edge is mistakenly commended for bravery. A Japanese spotter plane, abandoned by the retreating task force, is shot down by Austen and Fowler but crashes into the 40mm mount, killing Fowler and Frenchy. The Atlantis is sent to Mare Island Naval Shipyard to repair damage and Austen is detached from the ship for a month's leave before reporting to an aircraft carrier under construction. He delivers Frenchy's portrait and donations from the crew to his widow but she denies him permission to see the daughter. Resigned to the situation, he goes to the train station to travel to Maine, where he plans to paint, and finds Stella there, with her portrait in hand, waiting for him. Characters =Leading characters= *Alec Austen - Austen is a headstrong man in his mid-twenties whose parents are Quakers. While he is not, he retains the decency towards his fellow man and antipathy to violence that both, but particularly his father, instilled in him. Austen resists the efforts of superiors to make him a martinet, sometimes to the point of insubordination, and befriends the men of the Fourth Division, who are also his gun crew. In particular he becomes close to his leading petty officer. Austen handles his crew of rough, undereducated men with intelligence, resourcefulness, and tact, earning their respect, and builds a disciplined combat team. While he loves Stella Greyne, his devotion to his art provides him an alternative to her unfaithful ways. *Stella Greyne - Stella, coming from a poor family in a small town, is beautiful (by inference; she is never described), intelligent and ambitious. Godfrey Clemson lifted her out of her poverty, changed her ethic surname to \\"Greyne,\\" culturally educated her, and provides her with a plush apartment and limitless material pleasures in return for being his mistress. She finds Clemson repulsive. Stella perceives herself as a whore because she denies neither Godfrey's unwanted or Alec's welcomed sexual advances. Stella often drinks too much in a futile attempt to overcome self-loathing and a penchant for soft living and sexual temptation. *Frenchy Shapiro - Frenchy is a Brooklyn Jew who joined the Navy eight years before to escape from and at the same time provide for a shrewish wife and a daughter with cerebral palsy. Shapiro and Austen become close friends despite their disparate backgrounds and his subordinate position as Austen's leading petty officer. Frenchy does not hesitate to fight to exert his authority, winning by outlasting his opponents. He is fiercely loyal to Austen and engenders the same from the sailors under him. *Warrington E. Meredith - \\"Snooky\\" Meredith is a third- generation Annapolis man whose father and grandfather were both killed in combat. Meredith hates sea duty and after he accidentally ran his first command aground, was banished to shore billets that suited his need for social acceptance. He married well and enjoyed the Navy lifestyle until an unfavorable reputation among his peers compelled him to return to a sea command, which he receives just as the Atlantis arrives in the Aleutians. He is overweight, often must consult other officers before making decisions and is perceived by most as weak until he is tested in battle. *Mike Edge - Edge is a mustang officer recently promoted from the ranks but ill-suited to the duties and responsibilities of being commissioned. Edge is a thickly built man in his early thirties, with \\"close set, cunning eyes.\\" Bigoted, a martinet physically abusive of enlisted men, cowardly, and a sexual predator of young sailors, Edge is universally loathed but bluffs and bullies his way through the war until, like the captain, he is forced by events to confront his profound fears. Austen at first dismisses him as just another sailor with a coarse background, but comes to think of him as unholy and unclean. =Supporting characters= *The executive officer - The unnamed second-in- command of the Atlantis and a Regular Navy commander showing signs of severe strain, the executive officer is a \\"thin man with the face of a shingle,\\" entirely humorless, with a near pathological obsession for neatness. He notes every perceived infraction by subordinate officers in a small black notebook he always carries, and uses dry sarcasm to humiliate them and enforce discipline. He tolerates Edge's crude demeanor and abusive behavior because he finds common ground in an obscene enjoyment of violence and the degrading of others. The executive officer is in denial about the hatred for him felt by the entire crew, and when informed by the surgeon of it, has a marked change in behavior for the worse. *Commander Blanchard - Blanchard is a career Navy doctor but has little use for traditional naval discipline. Until Austen befriends him, Blanchard keeps to himself, locking the door to his stateroom and using a pharmaceutical to cleanse his breath in order to drink without being caught. Blanchard takes a not-always-welcomed protective attitude towards Austen in his struggles with the executive officer, having no fear whatsoever of his superiors. Blanchard's attempt, \\"man to man\\", to help the executive officer reduce the strain on himself is coldly rejected, and angered, Blanchard inadvertently precipitates the executive officer's breakdown. Rather than taking any other action, however, the doctor locks himself in his room again to comfort himself with a bottle. *Godfrey Clemson - A glib art critic, Clemson parlayed his name and influence into a fortune as owner of the top advertising agency in New York. Portly and unattractive (he is described as pink-faced and not having eyelids), he wields his money and power to obtain whatever he wants, including Stella Greyne. Clemson is supercilious towards artists in general and Austen in particular. Austen characterizes him as a fast-talking salesman who happens to peddle art instead of ladies' dresses or used cars. *Homer Fowler - Fowler, a big steward's mate, has just reported aboard Atlantis as a replacement. From the rural Deep South, he has endured years of racial discrimination and worse, learning to survive by suppressing violent urges to resist. Garrulous, he convinces Austen he is a born gunner and sees in him a protector. Working with the guns becomes the high point of his life. *John Dooley - A \\"slight, troubled man,\\" Dooley had been severely traumatized as a child by someone setting off a firecracker behind him. Rejected by the Naval Academy, Dooley became commissioned through Navy ROTC and made himself indistinguishable from an Annapolis-trained officer. In addition to his fear, he is insecure in his authority and inflexible when embarrassed. His broken leg gives him an honorable means of leaving the ship but he stubbornly remains aboard, and when battle comes, forces himself to do his job despite his fear of guns. *Sam Griswold - Son of an admiral killed at Pearl Harbor and a hero in his own right, Griswold is a model officer, even-tempered, calm within, personally brave, and loyal to his superiors. Commanding a coastal minesweeper under air attack in the Solomon Islands, Griswold severely burned his hands when he and a black steward's mate were the only members of their crew to remain aboard and continue fighting the attacking planes. Admiral Marcy places him aboard Atlantis in tribute to his father's sacrifice, but also to provide Meredith with \\"backbone\\" in a crisis. *Slobodjian - Slobodjian is a small, dark Armenian sailor, simple-minded but with a high degree of cunning. For the most part harmless, he is ruled by his whims with no concept of military discipline, but is well-liked by his shipmates for his congenial view of the world.

He is known best for The Road from Home (Greenwillow Books, 1979), based on his mother's childhood‚Äîcataloged as biography by some libraries, as fiction by others. David Kherdian's Signature Biography David Kherdian David Kherdian (ker.de.en) born December 17, 1931 in Racine, Wisconsin to Veron Duhmejian (1908 - 1981), and Melkon Kherdian (1891 ‚Äì 1958). His sister, Virginia (1943 - ). Both parents were survivors of the Armenian Genocide. An Armenian-American poet, novelist, and biographer, founder of three small presses and editor of three journals: Ararat: A Quarterly, Forkroads: A Journal of Ethnic-American Literature, and Stopinder: A Gurdjieff Journal for Our Time. His wife, Nonny Hogrogian, a painter and award-winning children's book illustrator, was the art director for each of the presses and journals. She also illustrated many of his books, and provided nearly all of his book titles. He liked to refer to her as his Senior Editor, while evoking the Armenian word, Garavel, that doesn't exist in the English language: the one who civilizes, which provision too often falls on mothers and wives‚Äîwives in particular. For two years they lived in Lyme Center, New Hampshire, where he was the state \\"poet-in-the- schools\\". The state university library is one repository for their works (in a joint collection). Hogrogian has illustrated some of his books, both poetry anthologies edited by Kherdian and his own writings. Kherdian's reputation is spread over all the genres he has worked in, from his many books, to the three journals he edited, as well as his three small presses he founded. He was the first to place ethnic-American writers within the canon of American literature, which he accomplished through anthologies and journals, and just as importantly with his own writings. As an editor, writer, and publisher, Kherdian has always been ahead of his time; he comes down the long intermittent line of mystic American poets, namely, Walt Whitman, Henry Thoreau, and Emily Dickinson‚Äîpoets who are rarely valued in their lifetimes. Permanent collections of Kherdian's work can be found in five places, University of Connecticut Special Collections,https://lib.uconn.edu/libraries/asc/ Heritage Museum, Racine, Wisconsin,http://www.racineheritagemuseum.org/ University of New Hampshire Library, University of Wisconsin - Parkside, James L. Henry Collection - Bancroft Library, Berkeley California. Early years Kherdian's Midwestern childhood typically revolved around athletics, at which he excelled: basketball, football, and baseball, but his real athletic passion came later, when he took up golf, and quickly became a low handicapper. His troubled school years were marked by racist teachers who held him back. He would transform their effects on him through his poems, memoirs and prose fiction. In 2017 he published Starting From San Francisco: A Life In Writing, where he wrote about his school years without rancor, although he had earlier termed his grade school years an incarcerated hell. He dropped out of high school during the first semester of his junior year. After his Army service he graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a B.S. Degree in philosophy. Kherdian was driven to know himself, feeling an urgency to get the first twelve years of his life understood and reconciled, in order to become an adult. \\"All of these notions, I knew, had kept me from writing, but little by little, principally through a gradual understanding of Saroyan's work, I saw that for the purposes of art one life is as good as another, and that no life is unworthy of the attention of art.\\"Starting from San Francisco From his earliest years he was a library habitue. One classmate recalled that he had set a record for book reports in the 7th grade. It was then he discovered the writings of James Willard Schultz, the squaw man who was the first white man to penetrate the Blackfeet Nation, later to become a famous children's book author with tales from his years with the Blackfeet tribe. Earlier, Kherdian's mother, who taught Armenian language classes in the church basement, brought home a drawing by one of her students of a Native American, that her son adored, inspiring his own artistic skills. Drawing and reading were the two activities that dominated his adolescence, precluding his life as a writer, which he would prize additionally for the solitude it provided, being a loner both by temperament and defense against discrimination. Kherdian was nineteen when he read Theodore Dreiser's The Stoic, and realized that there existed another way of being in life, which prompted him to pursue writing as a means toward an ideal goal. At that time he was on the road as a door to door magazine salesman where he experienced a camaraderie on a scale higher than school sports; the memory of this would carry him through his embittered army experiences, having narrowly escaped court martial when he went AWOL for the thirteen day journey aboard a troop ship to Korea. He would continue his resistance to authority, a pattern begun in elementary school, and continued as an artist contemptuous of academia, and eschewing all factions, fashions, and movements in literature. His instinctive aim throughout his life was to fight for his own individuality, which led him eventually to the spiritual teaching of G. I. Gurdjieff. His childhood was typically Midwestern. He grew up beside Root River, on the shores of Lake Michigan, enshrining both in his writings. These two bodies of water, along with the natural world around him became the reconciling forces that effectively contravened the unhappy circumstances of his childhood. In Racine, only those primarily of European ancestry were acknowledged Americans, while Jews, African-Americans, Mexicans, Armenians and Italians were known by their ancestral race only. Racine was a backward, backwater factory town of 65,000 during Kherdian's childhood. What preserved him from its stultifying influences were the nearby fields and streams, the library, athletics, and also his fierce rebellious nature. The trauma of living in a society that was antithetical to his very nature and temperament left him with resentments that impelled him in his early sixties to write Asking the River, achieving through forgiveness liberation from his painful past. But it was only in his much later book, Factory Town: A 20th Century Memoir, where the good and the bad in his hometown were conjoined, for him to acknowledge the ample goodness that had been there all along. Through the transformative achievements he gained from his inner struggles, he would secure his destiny and create his own world, boldly stating in his memoir, Starting From San Francisco, \\"I had unwittingly transformed the material that surrounded me as a child into something meaningful, instructive, and enlightening for myself.\\" Further, on speaking of places and in particular the people of his childhood, he wrote, \\"There was a meaning to their lives for me. It was so because I required it, and because I did they would become what they needed to become for me.\\" The river had been his great solace, comforter and teacher. When asked to describe its meaning for him (in the film, The Dividing River / The Meeting Shore), he replied that it stood for time, movement, truth, change and eternity‚Äîhe saw moving water as the power that carries man into this life as well as the force that impels a continuing journey toward our ultimate destiny, as evolving immortal beings. Kherdian credited the three large Kaiserlian families (comprising ten children in all) as his first literary influences during his childhood years. His best friend, Mikey Kaiserlian was the subject of The Dividing River / The Meeting Shore, elegiac poems in his honor following his friend's untimely death. Mikey, and his cousin Ardie were Kherdian's closest friends in childhood, appearing frequently in his poems, memoirs, and stories. Maggie, the oldest of all the Kaiserlian children, became Kherdian's confidant, and appeared in that role as Lily in his autobiographical novella Asking the River. Their homes for him were islands of culture and sophistication in a backward malodorous, factory town, and together they were his sole guides in opening him to the influences that formed his outlook on life, introducing him to jazz, live theatre, good books and foreign movies. As the youngest among them their hold on his imagination was unique and everlasting. Career Kherdian's spiritual nature, previously revealed in his closeness to nature, and his talent for drawing, did not come to fruition until he began writing poetry at age 35, when in his early book, Looking Over Hills, he broke through to another dimension of reality that would be a guide for his future work. The great majority of these poems were written in a period of one month on his first visit to the Berkshires of Massachusetts in the summer of 1970, when he \\"realized that the higher states in which poets often find themselves when writing do not belong to them, cannot be beckoned at will, and in fact, the poet at such times is nothing more than a radio transmitting messages between levels of reality.\\"Starting from San Francisco: A Life in Writing Kherdian moved from the Berkshires to New York City to take the editorship of Ararat: A Quarterly, Armenian-American literary journal to which he had long contributed poems, reviews, and articles. He soon met his soul mate, Nonny Hogrogian, who became his art director, collaborator and lifelong mate. It was not long after that he became acquainted with the writings of the mystic G. I. Gurdjieff, whose teaching he would follow for the rest of his days. Following nine years in a Gurdjieff school in Oregon, where he wrote several books of poetry‚Äîhe later summed up his journey in his memoir, On a Spaceship with Beelzebub: By A Grandson of Gurdjieff (Beelzebub was the fallen angel in Gurdjieff's opus, All and Everything). If Theodore Dreiser's novel had opened Kherdian's eyes to another world, Carlos Castaneda had shown him what that world might look like, when continuing search led him to the Greek-Armenian mystic, G. I. Gurdjieff. Soon after the Kherdians moved to Oregon to enter a spiritual school called The Fourth Way, which was the name Gurdjieff gave to his teaching, that would in time spread across the globe, in particular his sacred dances called Movements, choreographed with music by Gurdjieff. Kherdian at first feared that the spiritual influence he had put himself under would in some way threaten his creativity, but instead it slowly, dramatically enhanced its evolution, as would become evident with his retelling of Monkey: A Journey to the West, a Buddhist allegory, that he followed with his narrative biography titled, The Buddha, The Story of an Awakened Life. The first book he wrote after leaving his school in Oregon was The Dividing River / The Meeting Shore, now considered his finest work in poetry, but it was his later book, Letters to My Father, that Kherdian favored among his many books of poetry. Upon graduating from the University of Wisconsin in January, 1960, he moved to San Francisco, a life changing experience, where he could write openly with other already established, and aspiring writers like himself. He began friendships with Philip Whalen, David Meltzer, William Everson (Brother Antoninus), Richard Brautigan, Allen Ginsberg, and others, but most importantly, William Saroyan, who would soon become his mentor and good friend. Following publication of his first book, A Bibliography of William Saroyan:1934-1964 he was approached by a New York editor to do bibliographies of some Beat poets. This would result in his second book, Six Poets of the San Francisco Renaissance: Portraits and Checklists. The mesmerizing influence of William Saroyan was so powerful and overwhelming, that it was only after the completion of his Saroyan bibliography that he was finally liberated to write from himself. Kherdian's long apprenticeship was detailed in his memoir, Starting From San Francisco: A Life in Writing. Although his writing came to fruition in San Francisco, it had begun, many years earlier, when he read the short stories of William Saroyan. Although they were both first generation Armenian-Americans, Saroyan was a generation older, and grew up in Fresno, a city where Armenians were a dominant presence, unlike Racine, where there were but 200 Armenian families during Kherdian's childhood. What he and Saroyan had in common, however, was their near obsession with their own biographies, that served as their primary literary material for each of them. Shortly after leaving San Francisco for Fresno, Kherdian founded The Giligia Press, where he published his second book and also his first book of poems, On the Death of My Father and Other Poems, that Saroyan would title and write an Introduction for, calling the title poem one of the best lyric poems in American poetry. A short-lived marriage followed, that coincided with and inspired an outpouring of poetry, of which he wrote he stated in his memoir: \\"There is a reason why poetry, love, and youth are connected in our minds. Perhaps one has to be mad to write poetry, and being in love makes this madness seem desirable.\\" He then published Down at the San Fe Depot: 20 Fresno Poets, dedicating the book to Philip Levine, with whom Kherdian had made a friendship, while working in special collections at Fresno State College, where Levine taught most of the poets in the anthology. Down at the Santa Fe Depot had an electrifying effect on poetry, resulting in numerous regional anthologies, and a burgeoning of small presses around the country. Also, during this same period, Kherdian taught a class on Beat poetry, for the first time in an American college or university. During the Kherdians nine years in the Gurdjieff school in Oregon, called The Farm, they established Two Rivers Press, where they learned to set type and print by letterpress, binding their books by hand on fine papers, which included their own hand marbled endpapers. Kherdian also began what he called Writing Classes, combining the gains made from his own writings with the principles of the Gurdjieff teaching, in a method that would liberate those who had formed patterns in their childhood that constricted their growth. During this period Kherdian's best known book, The Road from Home was published, which won numerous awards before being translated, published and pirated around the globe. He was now working in a variety of genres: fiction, biographies, memoirs, children's books, and also translations and retellings, including the Armenian bardic epic, David of Sassoun, told in a series of genealogical tales covering five generations. Anthologies In the early 1970s the Poets in the Schools project was established, with Kherdian named for New Hampshire, where the Kherdian's were living in their first home. During this period he published with Macmillan a series of three anthologies on contemporary American poetry: Visions of America: By the Poets of Our Time, and Traveling America: With Today's Poets, as well as Settling America: The Ethnic Expression of 14 Contemporary American Poets, which was the first such anthology to be published in America. During his class visits he realized that contemporary American poetry was being neglected in schools, so he followed his earlier anthologies, that were aimed at YA markets, to concentrate on the earlier grades, resulting in Poems Here and Now, The Dog Writes on the Window with His Nose, If Dragon Flies Made Honey, and his own Country Cat; City, Cat. He would eventually follow with two projects close to his heart: Forkroads: A Journal of Ethnic-American Literature, and then later Forgotten Bread: First- Generation Armenian American Writers‚Äîan idea he had carried on in his head for forty years, that would knit together the first generation of Armenian- American writers‚Äîthe first being three writers from Armenia, who came to America and wrote in English‚Äî with the next generation, being the first born in America. Prominent writers from the next generation were selected to write profiles for the writers that came before them. The undisclosed purpose of the journal Forkroads, was to create one world through stories from many different cultures‚Äîto build respect and understanding, with an abiding love and openness he believed would inevitably grow out of this. His aim for Forgotten Bread was to reveal how each particular ethnic group had brought to American literature its own sensibility, strength and wisdom, with its results embodied in American literature, not as a hybrid but as a new and unique literature able to speak for itself. Kherdian has been credited through his anthologies, his journal Forkroads, and also through his small press with establishing ethnic American literature into the American canon. Armenia Kherdian was drawn to his heritage, not only to be informed of his own ancestry, but to seek influences that he needed to examine for himself, in order to evolve both as a man and as an artist. Not having grandparents he needed to find his own way back, and not only through his own bloodline, but from racial memory. The Kherdians were invited to Armenia to do a special issue on the arts and life in Armenia for Ararat, the journal they were editor and art director for at the time. They met with the famous Armenian artist, Martiros Saryan, and spent an evening in the home of Yervant Kotchar, celebrated sculptor of David of Sassoun, which stands in a notable square in Yerevan, Armenia. Kotchar at the close of their visit asked to read Kherdian's palm, and quickly exclaimed, ‚ÄúYou must go home at once, you have important work to do.‚Äú At that point Kherdian had produced but two books of poems, but Kotchar could apparently see the future body of Kherdian's work‚Äîperhaps even that his retelling of David of Sassoun would make Armenia's great epic known in the West. Upon his return to America Kherdian co-translated a small book of poems by Charentz, Armenia's greatest poet of the 20th century. Later he transfigured traditional songs into poetry for a collection, titled, The Song of the Stork: Early and Ancient Armenian Songs. In time Kherdian would absorb, transform and transcend many of the inhibiting conditions of his own culture, together with the racial predispositions passed down to him, to achieve liberation from all the elements and factions that would impede his spiritual awakening and growth, while he also enshrined with his art some of the many achievements of his ancestral race. Awards Kherdian won the 1979 Boston Globe‚ÄìHorn Book Award for children's nonfiction, and he was the only runner-up for the 1980 Newbery Medal, recognizing The Road from Home (1979), about the childhood of his mother Veron Dumehjian before and during the Armenian Genocide. The book has been published in most European countries and in many other places, including Japan. It has been reissued several times in the United States and is increasingly read in middle schools throughout the country. In the sequel Finding Home (1981) she settles in America as a mail-order bride. It too is sometime cataloged as fiction.

In 1968 the company announced its System 21 small computer system together with its intention to lease the systems starting at a revolutionary price of $40 per month. The basic system included a microprocessor with 512 characters of read/write RAM memory, a keyboard, a CRT display and two cartridge tape drives. The system specifications, advanced for 1968 - five years before the advent of the first commercial personal computers - caused a lot of excitement in the computer industry. The System 21 was aimed, among others, at applications such as mathematical and statistical analysis, business data processing, data entry and media conversion, and educational/classroom use. The expectation was that the use of new large scale integrated circuit technology (LSI) and volume would enable Viatron to be successful at lower margins, however the prototype did not incorporate LSI technology. In 1968 Bennett claimed that by 1972 Viatron would have delivered more \\"digital machines\\" than had \\"previously been installed by all computer makers.\\" He declared \\"We want to turn out computers like GM turns out Chevvies,\\" The semiconductor industry was unable to produce circuits in the volumes required, forcing Viatron to sell fewer than the planned 5,000-6,000 systems per month. This raised the production costs per unit and prevented the company from ever achieving profitability. Bennet and Spiegel were fired in 1970, and the company declared Chapter XI bankruptcy in 1971. System 21 components As announced the System 21 line consisted of the following: * System 21 Terminal. What would later be called an intelligent terminal, the System 21 terminal included either the 2101 or 2111 microprocessors, a CRT display formatted as four lines of 20 characters with optional color, a keyboard, a control panel, and attachability of up to two peripherals:  The terminal was equipped with one of two microprocessors. * 2101 - 512 16-bit words of read-only memory (ROM), 400 8-bit character read/write magnetic-core memory. * 2111 - 1024 16-bit words of read-only memory (ROM), 400 8-bit character read/write magnetic-core memory.  Printing robot - fit over the keyboard of a standard IBM Selectric typewriter and generated typed output at 12 characters per second.  Card Reader-punch - despite its name this was actually an attachment for an IBM 129 keypunch to provide punched card input and output.  Communications adapter - provided serial ASCII communications at 1200 bits per second.  Tape channel attachments - provided for attachment of up to two \\"Viatape\\" cartridge recorders, capable of reading and writing 80 character records at 1200 bits per second. So-called Computer Compatible tape recorders, Magnetic tape units, could also be attached to the tape channel attachments to read and write mini-reels at either 9 track, 800 bpi or 7 track, 556/800 bpi.  Foreign device attachment - provided parallel input/output in ASCII or Hollerith punch-card code. * System 21 computers. Two computers were announced with the System 21: the 2140 and the 2150. Both employed a MOS LSI CPU and magnetic core memory. The systems included 2 ¬µs core memory with 16-bit words and a high speed data channel. Computers weighed about .  The 2140 included 4 KW of memory and could support up to 8 local or remote System 21 terminals.  The 2150 included 8 KW of memory and could support up to 24 local or remote System 21 terminals.  Software. The Viatron Programming System (VPS) came standard with: * DDL-I (Distributed Data Language I) * Assembler * Subroutine library containing input/output, mathematical, arithmetic and conversion routines * Utility program library containing load, dump, and a library manager * A FORTRAN IV compiler standard with the 2150. CPU The Viatron CPUs differed in memory size and interrupt levels - 2 on the 2140 and 4 on the 2150. They had the ability to operate on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 48-bit data. Three index registers were provided. The CPUs included two independent arithmetic units with different capabilities. * Arithmetic unit I had three 16-bit registers called A, B, and C, and a 16-bit D register which functioned as a buffer. * Arithmetic unit II performed both arithmetic and addressing operations. It had four registers. P was the program counter, R and E were special-purpose, and Q, which was used for 32-bit operations (with A as the high-order word), or 48-bit operations (with A and B). Q also served as the multiplier-quotient register for multiplication and division. The system had two instruction formats: Standard, 16-bit instructions, and Extended, 32-bit instructions. Standard instructions had a 6-bit operation code, a two-bit index register identifier, and an 8-bit PC-relative address. Extended instructions had a 6-bit operation code, a two- bit index register identifier, an 8-bit operation code modifier, and a 16-bit memory address. Indirect addressing was allowed. There were 85 instructions, some of which had both standard and extended forms: * Arithmetic - add, subtract, multiply and divide * Logical - and, or, exclusive or * Load and Store * Shift and Rotate * Modify memory word and skip on test * Execute input/output * Branching - skip or branch on condition, branch unconditional, branch and store program counter (conditional and unconditional), add to index register and skip on test * Operate - increment/decrement register, ones complement register, negate (twos-complement) register, move register to register, move console switches to register, increment register and skip on test. All the above operate instructions used one or more of registers A, B, or C. There were also wait and a no-operation operate instructions.

Background K√† is a Cirque du Soleil show that plays at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to the Los Angeles Times the show \\"may well be the most lavish production in the history of Western theater [and] is surely the most technologically advanced.\\" It features a 360 degree rotating stage and 86 cast members. The stage does not have a permanent floor; it has several moving platforms that appear to float. Guyard-Guillot's fall was the second accident to halt a performance in less than a week. On June 26, 2013, a cast member suffered a minor concussion after slipping from a slack rope during a preview performance of Michael Jackson: One. Previously, two cast members were seriously injured during a 2007 performance of Zumanity. In 2009, an acrobat died during a trampoline training accident. Life  Sarah Guyard-Guillot was born in Paris, France, and began her circus career in childhood. She graduated from the Annie Fratellini Art & Circus Academy. She worked as an acrobat and aerialist for 22 years. In 2006, Guyard-Guillot joined the cast of K√† as it opened at the MGM Grand. She ran a circus school class for children in Las Vegas called Cirquefit. She was formerly married to Mathieu Guyard, another K√† performer. At the time of her death, Guyard-Guillot's son and daughter were 5 and 8, respectively. Death During the final battle scene of K√†, the stage is oriented vertically and performers use harnesses attached to cables to move about. During this scene at the 9:30 pm show on June 29, 2013, Guyard-Guillot was hoisted up the side of the stage to a height of at least (some eyewitnesses said it may have been over ). According to an eyewitness, she \\"then just plummeted down.\\" Her harness apparently slipped free from its safety wire, causing her to fall into a pit, out of the audience's view. A spokesperson confirmed that the harness itself remained on Guyard-Guillot during her fall. \\"Initially, a lot of people in the audience thought it was part of the choreographed fight,\\" said an eyewitness. \\"But you could hear screaming, then groaning, and we could hear a female artist crying from the stage.\\" After her fall, the show was quickly stopped and a recording asked the audience to leave and said refunds would be offered. The other performers watched helplessly as they dangled in the air, before being lowered to safety, one by one. Guyard-Guillot died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. She was pronounced dead at 11:43 pm. Guyard-Guillot's death was the first on- stage accident resulting in death in Cirque du Soleil's 30-year history. She is survived by her two children. She was 31 at the time of her death. On July 2, 2013, the Clark County Coroner's Office said Guyard-Guillot fell around , which is almost twice the distance reported initially. She died of blunt force trauma. Reaction An official statement by Cirque du Soleil read, \\"The entire Cirque du Soleil family is deeply saddened by the accidental death of Sarah (Sasoun) Guyard ... Our thoughts are with her family and the entire Cirque du Soleil family.\\" Company founder Guy Lalibert√© said he was \\"heartbroken\\", and remarked, \\"We are all completely devastated with this news ... [Guyard-Guillot] has been an integral part of our Cirque du Soleil tight family. We are reminded, with great humility and respect, how extraordinary our artists are each and every night.\\" A memorial website was quickly flooded with condolences. Performances of K√† were put on hold indefinitely. On July 14, 2013, it was announced that performances of the show (in a modified form) would resume on July 16, 2013, and that a full schedule would be resumed on July 23, 2013. The first performance was dedicated to Guillot-Guyard, who was described as \\"an exceptional artist\\". A formal investigation into Guyard- Guillot's death was launched by Nevada OSHA. John Fudenberg of the Clark County Coroner‚Äôs office, who worked with OSHA on the investigation, said, \\"There is certainly safety apparatus that is used during any Cirque du Soleil show, and I know that company is very safety-conscious. We have to make sure we inspect the safety harnesses ... Our priority is to find out how this happened.\\" The investigation was expected to take up to six months. On October 29, 2013, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration (NVOSHA) issued six citations totaling $25,000 in fines and penalties for Cirque du Soleil Nevada, and three citations totaling $7,000 for the MGM Grand.{{cite webtitle=More than $30,000 in citations proposed in Cirque du Soleil acrobat's Vegas deathurl=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/10/29/21239285-more- than-30000-in-citations-proposed-in-cirque-du-shooble in November 2013 all but one of the violations issued against Cirque du Soleil in the incident were withdrawn by agency investigators.

In 1606 (or 1705, depending on the historical source), the old stave church burned down and it was rebuilt on the same site as a timber-framed, cruciform building. Years later, a new church was built just to the south of the old one and the new building was consecrated in the spring of 1883. In the fall of the same year, the old church was torn down. On 2 February 1983, the 100-year-old church burned down. Many years passed before a new church was constructed. In 1990, the new church was finally completed.

History Carvana Tempe vending machine Carvana was founded by Ernest Garcia III, Ryan Keeton and Ben Huston in 2012. The company's initial funding round came from the used car retailer and finance company, DriveTime. In November 2013, Carvana opened its first iteration of a car vending machine. In 2015, a fully automated, coin-operated version of the signature car vending machine opened in Nashville, Tennessee. In April 2017, the company went public and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CVNA. As of May 2020, Carvana's as-soon-as-next day delivery was available in 261 markets across the country. In Q2 of 2020, the company reported a 25% increase in vehicle sale, as a result of physical dealership sellers being closed as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Carvana's had a gross revenue of $1.12 billion, up 13% for the months April-June 2020. Business  Carvana operates as an online- only used car dealer that allows customers to shop, finance, and sell or trade-in cars through their website. The company gives customers the option of having their purchased vehicles delivered to them or they can choose to pick them up at one of the company's 24 car vending machines. Vehicles come with a seven day return policy. In response to COVID-19, Carvana introduced touchless delivery and pick-up in March 2020. The Houston Chronicle dubbed the company the ‚ÄúAmazon of Auto‚Äù. In 2019, it sold 177,549 vehicles and posted annual revenue of $3.94 billion, making it the third largest used-car retailer in the U.S.  Acquisitions  In 2017 Carvana acquired rival automotive startup Carlypso to enhance vehicle data and analytical tools. In April 2018, Carvana spent $22 million to acquire Mark Cuban-backed Car360 for its smartphone technology for taking vehicle photos with 3D computer vision, machine learning, and augmented reality.

His collection of 300 scrapbooks documenting African-American history have been part of the collection of Columbia University since 1950 as the Alexander Gumby Collection of Negroiana. Gumby was also the proprietor of a popular bookstore during the Harlem Renaissance, where he was host of a salon. Gumby's passion for collecting earned him the nicknames \\"The Count\\" and \\"Mr. Scrapbook\\". Life Born in Maryland, Gumby was the son of an evangelist, Levi Thomas Gumby, and his wife, Louisa Morris. He and his sister were sent to live with their grandparents in 1901. Gumby studied law at Dover State College in Delaware at the behest of his grandmother, but feeling his inadequacy in law he moved to New York City, which would be his home until his death. Gumby embraced life in New York, saying in his 1952 essay The Adventures of My Scrapbook that \\"At once I became a New Yorker in spirit and principle for I found here more freedom of action than I had ever known before\\". Six of his scrapbooks are autobiographical, labelled \\"Gumby's Autobiography\\". In his early days in New York, Gumby took a number of minor jobs to support his collecting, working as a butler to a banker, a bellhop, and a postal worker during World War I. Gumby also founded the Southern Utopia Fraternity, an organization to support young men who came from the Southern States to New York in search of work and opportunities. Gumby was forced to abandon his bookshop as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and was admitted to hospital as a result of the loss of his studio and fatigue, and spent four years in hospitals on North Brother Island and Randall's Island on New York City's East River. Working as a waiter at Columbia University, Gumby began fraternizing with academia and students. He would eventually leave his collection to Columbia, and was hired by the university to organize the collection for eight months. He added to it until his death from tuberculosis. =Gumby's Book Studio= In the 1920s Gumby received financial assistance to help compile his collection from Charles W. Newman, a wealthy stockbroker. With Newman's help Gumby moved his collection to a large studio at 2144 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan's Harlem district, that became known as \\"Gumby's Bookstore\\". His book studio became an important gathering place for the figures of the Harlem Renaissance. The book studio served as a workspace to compile the collection as well as an exhibition space, and an artistic and intellectual salon. Due to the imperious nature with which he conducted his salon he was nicknamed \\"The Great God Gumby\\". Gumby also produced the Gumby Book Studio Quarterly, a literary journal that was only published for a single issue, and was never distributed. Through his studio, Gumby became acquainted with such notable Harlem Renaissance figures as Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, Rose McClendon, Evelyn Ellis, Paul Robeson, Alain LeRoy Locke, Robert Schlick, Heywood Broun, H. L. Mencken, O. Richard Reid, Aaron Douglas, Dorothy West, Helene Johnson, Augusta Savage, Richard Bruce Nugent and Arthur Fauset. In many cases, Gumby was the only person to keep these documents years after the events occurred. One example is a short series of letters on \\"Our National Capital,\\" a speech given by Frederick Douglass. The letters were written between Grace Greenwood and Douglass himself. Charles W. Newman, Gumby's financial backer, was badly affected by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and Gumby's studio lost the support of its regular patrons. The Wall Street Crash forced Gumby to abandon his studio and sell many of his precious editions, and store his scrapbooks in the cellar of a friend's house. Gumby was openly gay, and his book studio became a gathering place for the LGBT community in Harlem. He was described as a \\"dandy\\" and a \\"Social Butterfly\\", his style being described by Nugent as \\"Fancy clothes, a perennial walking stick, pale yellow kid gloves, and a diamond stick-pin made him the Beau Brummell of his particular little group\\". Collection In September 1901, aged 16, Gumby made his first scrapbook with clippings concerning the assassination of President McKinley. Gumby had organized his clippings by 1910, and took his archival work seriously, visiting similar collections in libraries across the United States and Canada. Gumby also became acquainted with fellow African-American archivist, Arturo Alfonso Schomburg. Working as a waiter at Columbia University Gumby began fraternizing with academia and students, adding clippings to his collection about popular professors and Columbia's president, Nicholas Murray Butler. In 1925 Gumby's collection so crowded his 2¬Ω rooms that he was forced to lease the entire second-floor unpartitioned apartment of the house in which he lived. Gumby initially found it easy to acquire his collection as \\"Negro\\" items were considered of little interest to book dealers. The scrapbooks contain autographed photos, stories and letters from such notable performers as Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker, Langston Hughes, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie and Ethel Waters, and letters and autographs from Black historical figures such as Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Father Divine, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Marcus Garvey. Gumby kept collecting while hospitalized, including articles about his hospitalization, get-well cards and photographs of friends who visited him. Upon his release from hospital Gumby retrieved and began restoring his collection, and continued to add to them. In 1950 Gumby donated his collection to Columbia University and in 1951, Columbia hired him for eight months to help organize the collections. Gumby continued to add to his scrapbooks until his death from complications from tuberculosis in 1961. The 300 scrapbooks are part of Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscript Library in Butler Library as the Alexander Gumby Collection of Negroiana. In the early 1920s he exhibited his collections in cities along the East Coast of America, and was subsequently included in the 1922 edition of the Private Book Collectors' Who's Who. Gumby said of his collection that it \\"... could well be called 'The Unwritten History ... There are so many surprising and startling historical events pertaining to, or relating to the American Negro that are not recorded in the Standard Histories, dictionaries and school text-books, or if so, they are shaded so that they sound like a Ripley's 'Believe It or Not.'\\" A variety of different formats make up the scrapbooks including newspaper stories and magazine articles, and autographs, letters, photos, theatre programmes and documents concerning slavery. The scrapbooks have subsequently been converted to microfilm.

October 1898). As a child, O'Donnell attended the Fuller School on 41st Street in Chicago. However, at age twelve he began his career in show business as an usher at both the Old Chicago Opera House and the Iroquois Theatre.‚ÄúBiography of R.J.

As a result of the immediate financial strain, his family began taking on boarders from Pennsylvania to help with expenses.Thirteenth Census of the United States, 1910 (NARA microfilm publication T624, 1,178 rolls). Records of the Bureau of the Census, Record Group 29. National Archives, Washington, D.C. It was his Chicago theater contacts that would secure him a position on Broadway in New York City.  Career  = New York City = Through a trusted Chicago contact, Lew Wiswell, O'Donnell secured a position as assistant treasurer of the Orpheum Theater on Broadway, in New York in 1911. He later stated that it was during this period that he perfected both his money management skills and showmanship. At this position, O'Donnell was earning enough to be able to put money away into savings as well as send cash home to his family's household in Chicago. After two years, O'Donnell decided that he wanted to open his own theater. He took his savings and pooled it with that of a local friend, Al Malone, and started an open-air theater in Newberg, New York. It failed. In a later interview in 1941, he recalls \\"the citizens of Newberg were not at all stupefied at such a venture and in fact, were so unimpressed that they managed to stay away in large numbers\\". = Interstate Theaters = O'Donnell went back to Broadway to work as a booking agent for several more years, establishing contacts and learning the business side of show business. In 1924, O'Donnell was introduced to Karl Hoblitzelle of Dallas, Texas, the owner of Interstate Amusements, a Missouri company that Hoblitzelle started with $1500 in 1905. Hoblitzelle offered O'Donnell a job as the manager of the fledgling Majestic Theater in Fort Worth, Texas. Majestic Theater, Dallas Texas, c.1950In 1925, Hoblitzelle appointed O'Donnell as general operating manager for all of the Majestic Theaters in Dallas, San Antonio, Houston and Fort Worth. By 1933, O'Donnell had set up his permanent offices in the Majestic Theater in Downtown, Dallas Texas.MA77-1 Interstate Theatre Collection, Texas/Dallas History & Archives Division, Dallas Public Library. Box 4a, Folders 1-6. http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/dalpub/07701/dpub-07701p1.html O'Donnell faced many challenges during this time period such as finding suitable tenants for commercial space connected with theater buildings, especially during the depression years; contracting for Mexican made Spanish language films for theaters in the ‚ÄúValley‚Äù of Texas which catered to the Mexican population; developing a reliable popcorn supply and managing to get it shipped to theaters, a particular problem in wartime (Interstate even subsidized popcorn research by Texas A&M; to solve this particular problem); creating exciting promotional gimmicks to entice customers into the theaters while staying one step ahead of the state lottery laws; dealing with the advent of the television, at first seen as a mortal enemy; adjusting to population movement to the suburbs and the building of theaters outside of the downtown area; building and promoting drive-ins in the late 1940s; coping with the declining amounts of film production available for exhibitors and the economic difficulties created for theater management by the beginnings of unionism and the minimum wage law; and combating local censorship laws as films became more \\"violent\\". At his peak output, O'Donnell presided over more than 200 separate movie theaters scattered across the Midwest. Quoting directly from the source, in 1941 he was called by the Hollywood producers that were making movies ‚Äúthe # 1 exhibitor in the United States‚Äù. The producers on Broadway spoke of him as an \\"outside sizzler\\" and remember him as one of the Bright Belt's best dressed theater men. Organized charities across the United States called him a \\"port in any storm\\". And every employee of the Interstate Circuit called him simply \\"The Boss with a heart of Irish gold\\". = Bob Hope = Bob Hope, c.1940 In 1929, a young Bob Hope appeared at the Interstate-Time club in Fort Worth, Texas to perform his witty, rapid-fire brand of comedy that came to define his style.Marx, Arthur (1993). The Secret Life of Bob Hope: An Unauthorized Biography. Fort Lee, New Jersey: Barricade Books. . Hope wasn't receiving the intended audience response to his material.

They wanted to put him into the Orpheus Theater, what Hope later referred to as ‚Äúthe big time‚Äù.Hansen, Bob. ‚ÄúPunchlines Easier to Take Than Punches‚Äù. Wichita Falls Times. March 30, 1986. Section B-6. = Audie Murphy = Audie Murphy's first taste of show business came in Dallas. He had just returned from the war in 1945 and had been written about in Life magazine with his picture on its cover, when R.J. O'Donnell still at Interstate Theaters, suggested that he be interviewed on a regular Sunday Interstate broadcast called \\"Show Time\\". O'Donnell called friend James Cagney in Hollywood, and the actor was instrumental in getting Murphy two-bit parts as his first tryout in movies. Paul Short of Dallas then signed him to a contract, coming out with Murphy's first starring role in \\"Bad Boy\\". The contract was later sold to Universal- International Studios where he made most of his movies. = The Alamo = In June 1951, amid considerable publicity that John Wayne and Republic Pictures would film \\"The Alamo\\" in Mexico City due to economic considerations, O'Donnell, Jesse Jones (Texas politician, publisher of the Houston Chronicle, entrepreneur and Secretary of Commerce under Franklin Roosevelt) and others went so far as to contact Herbert Yates, President of Republic to try and dissuade them from doing so. \\"To make the story of the Alamo in Mexico would be disastrous, in my opinion, and would be like making the story of Bunker Hill or the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia or any other of our patriotic stories in a foreign country,\\" O'Donnell implored. By October of that year, the outrage of this direction was so great that Wayne had a change of heart and \\"The Alamo\\" was in fact filmed in Texas.Rosenfield, John. ‚ÄúAudie Murphy and 13 Days‚Äù, Dallas Morning News.

Its goal was that children who were affected by poverty, abuse, neglect as well as those with illnesses and disabilities should be given the same opportunities other children had within their communities. R.J. O'Donnell, Dallas, Texas, c.1950Within the Aldolphus Hotel, J.B. Dugger, Buddy Harris, C.E. Hilger, Mike Rice, Harold Robb, Paul Scott, J.B. ‚ÄúJack‚Äù and W.G. ‚ÄúBill‚Äù Underwood, Wallace Walthall, Ed Wilson and R.J. O'Donnell became the eleven charter members for the Club.

Armorican Saints Before the Bretons came, the land now known as Brittany was known as Armorica within the Roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis. The earliest saint associated with this region is Saint Anne, mother of Mary (mother of Jesus), said by tradition to have been Armorican, and she is the patroness of Brittany. She also appeared to Yves Nicolazic, to whom she spoke in Breton. After her, the earliest saints in what is now Brittany have dates which are sometimes unclear, but tradition holds they go back to the earliest days of the Church. One Saint Maxime, said to have been the disciple of Saint Philip the Apostle, was sent to preach among the Gauls and was made the first Bishop of Rennes. He may have been accompanied by saints by the names of Clarus and Justus. Pope Saint Linus, the second Bishop of Rome, sent Saints Clair and Adeodatus; this is said to be the Saint Clair who became the first Bishop of Nantes around AD 280 and died early in the third century, though the dates make this suspect, and Saint Adeodatus preached especially in the area of Vannes. Other Armorican saints include Saint Similien, the third Bishop of Nantes in the early fourth century, and the brother-martyrs saints Donatian and Rogatian. Saint Palladius may also have had an Armorican connection. The Seven Founders The Bretons, coming from the British Isles, brought Christianity with them. With the coming of the Bretons, the seven ancient dioceses were established by the seven founding saints. * Tudwal founded Tr√©guier * Pol Aurelian founded Saint-Pol- de-Leon * Brioc founded Saint-Brieuc * Malo founded Saint-Malo * Patern founded Vannes * Corentin founded Cornouailles * Samson founded Dol The other two dioceses of Brittany were founded by Saint Clair de Nantes and Saint Maxime de Rennes.

Political career In the legislature, Holt emerged as a frequent critic of the Long administration. He opposed Long's attempt in a special session to remove Theo Cangelosi of Baton Rouge from the chairmanship of the Louisiana State University board of trustees. Long quarreled with his former friend Cangelosi regarding Long's divorce from his wife, Blanche R. Long, and Long's brief confinement in 1959 to a mental institution. Holt claimed that Cangelosi's removal for personal reasons would hurt the national image of LSU and weaken the institution.\\"Fight Looms on Cangelois Firing Issue\\", Ruston Daily Leader, July 28, 1959, p. 1 In 1960, after he had left the legislature, Holt was a member of the Louisiana State Democratic Central Committee and allied with the forces opposed to the Kennedy-Johnson ticket. Along with the controversial segregationist political boss, Judge Leander Perez of Plaquemines Parish in south Louisiana, Holt supported free or unpledged electors, rather than the national-oriented slate organized by Judge Edmund Reggie of Crowley, later the father-in-law of U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. That movement coalesced in the since defunct Louisiana States Rights' Party, which carried for that election the support of such public figures as the 1959 gubernatorial candidate William M. Rainach, former U.S. Representative Jared Y. Sanders, Jr., later Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives John Sidney Garrett, and future Republican Governor David C.

Holt was eliminated from the runoff election between former Governor Earl Long and the short-term incumbent Representative Harold B. McSween of Alexandria. Long died a few days after his final election victory; the seat still went to McSween, who was chosen as the party nominee by the Democratic State Central Committee, of which Holt was a member.

The scenic mountain route is a two-lane road with wide shoulders to allow joggers and bicyclists to safely travel the road. The city of Huntsville is in the process of widening 3.4 miles of Cecil Ashburn Drive, beginning at Donegal Drive to Taylor Road. That portion of the roadway will close completely for 10‚Äì12 months beginning in January 2019. The project will ultimately convert Cecil Ashburn Drive into a four-lane divided highway, including paved shoulders and bike lanes in both directions. Road description Cecil Ashburn Drive is a part of a line of roads that connect Whitesburg Drive in Southeast Huntsville to U.S. Highway 72 in Gurley. From the west, the road starts as Four Mile Post Road running through a dense residential neighborhood and runs pass Jones Family Park, Atwood Linear Park Greenway, and Valley Bend At Jones Farm. Upon intersecting Carl T. Jones Drive and Bailey Cove Road, the road takes on the name Cecil Ashburn Drive where it widens to five lanes (one of those being the center turn lane) and travels through a strip building retail area until almost at the base of the mountain. As it starts up the mountain, the road narrows to two lanes. The road twists along the mountain with limited access; only two intersections occur while traveling across the mountain: Avalon Drive and one parking lot for hikers. The road travels through the Blevins Gap Nature Preserve and provides trail heads for numerous hiking trails. Once on the east side of the mountain, the road intersects Old Big Cove Road and becomes Sutton Road. After a short stretch, the road widens back to four lanes and intersects Taylor Road followed by U.S. Highway 431 where the road takes on the name Old Highway 431. This portion is a part of the future Bypass Network for the city of Huntsville and is also known as the Eastern Bypass as it travels through Hampton Cove and the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail. The road eventually narrows down to two lanes and a turn lane, becomes Little Cove Road and connects to U.S. Highway 72. History The road was built in the late 1990s and opened to traffic in January 2000 as a quick way for the fast-growing Hampton Cove subdivision to access Huntsville. The City of Huntsville named the road after James Cecil Ashburn in January 2002. Safety The safety of the road has been called into question following multiple deadly wrecks. Most wrecks generally occur along the same stretch of road and are similar in details: a car traveling west into the city loses control while traveling around a curve near Avalon Drive. The wrecks sometimes occur after rain, but just as often in dry, clear conditions, and the vehicle generally hits another vehicle head on. Each wreck has been found to be due to driver error, and not the road's design. As of June 2018, a total of eleven people have been killed on the road since it opened. In June 2012, one person died and four others were injured in a wreck near Avalon Drive, the same location where two young women were killed in December 2011. More recently, on September 28, 2014, another person died in a wreck which also injured four others. This most recent wreck happened on the straightest part of the road, during a dry, sunny day. One driver simply crossed the yellow line and hit another vehicle head on with no warning. The cause was driver error. Once the roadwork improvements to Cecil Ashburn Drive are completed and it is converted into a divided highway, fatalities should be greatly reduced.

It relates the memoirs of a young boy Jacob McKay who travels with his family on a wagon on their way to California and become stranded in the Rockies. There they learn to survive, adapt to their surroundings and make the most of what they have with the help of a mountain man, an elderly Sioux medicine man and a legendary bear known by the Native Americans as Walking Thunder. The film won a Silver Award at the Worldfest Film Festival. It was released in 1995,http://www.dove.org/review/970-walking-thunder/ but was not widely distributed until 1997. Plot A young boy, Danny McKay, stays with his grandmother while his parents are away. The grandmother gives him a journal written by his grandfather when the latter was a teenage boy. It relates how he, Jacob McKay, travelled with his parents and younger brother Toby in a covered wagon on the way to California to seek a better life. Somehow they become separated from the wagon train that they originally joined up with and become stranded in the Rocky Mountains. While they are sleeping, an enormous bear appears and rummages through the wagon, scaring off their mules and livestock and scatters their possessions. The axle of the wagon is broken in the process and the father, John McKay, decides to build a shelter where they presently are as it would take too long to fix the axle and winter is about to arrive. Also, the mother Emma is heavily pregnant with their third child. Jacob and Toby are sent to look for food and come across a lodge owned by an old Sioux medicine man Dark Wind. Having read about the Indians in books, Jacob and Toby fear for their lives when the old man appears but are quickly re-assured by the fortuitous arrival of mountain man Abner Murdock, who understands the Sioux language and acts as interpreter. Both Murdock and Dark Wind share a meal with the McKays, and Dark Wind regales them with the story of the great bear known by the Sioux nation as Walking Thunder, with whom he shares a kindred spirit, and who had dominion over the land in which they live. The family is still in need of supplies to get through the winter, so Jacob is sent with Murdock to procure the necessary items from a rendezvous of mountain men which takes place several days away. Jacob is also instructed to purchase a cow with the remaining money that the family has, to obtain milk for the coming baby. On the way, Murdock teaches Jacob the ways of surviving in the wilderness, how to track and read sign and obtain food, and other survival skills, as well as stories of famous mountain men like Jim Bridger whom he personally knows, and whose exploits Jacob has read about in books. Jacob becomes fascinated and admiring of Murdock each day, and wishes that his father were more like him. He records everything he has learned in a journal. In the meantime, the remaining family, with the help of Dark Wind, work to build a cabin to shelter them from the elements. Suddenly, two Indian warriors appear with a view to slaying them, but then Walking Thunder who is nearby, gives a fearsome roar and the warriors run away. The family fears he will turn on them next, but Dark Wind utters a chant which seems to appease the bear, and he leaves. Thus the McKays know that the relationship between the medicine man and the bear is true. At the rendezvous, Jacob purchases tools and other necessities, and is about to obtain a cow but Murdock convinces him to buy a rifle instead, saying that it would be more useful for survival as he can use it for hunting game and defense. During a gathering of mountain men, Murdock gets into a fight with Ansel Richter, a scoundrel hunter and his companions, Weasel and Blood Coat, a half-breed. They have seen Jacob spend his money purchasing goods, and think that he may have plenty of gold and decide to trail him and Murdock and take it for themselves. Murdock reads the signs and is aware that the three men are following him and Jacob on the way back to the cabin. But the men have gone ahead of him and reach the cabin first, where they impose on the McKay's hospitality, at the same time casing the place to see where the family has hidden the (non-existent) gold. When they start drinking and becoming unruly, John McKay abruptly asks them to leave. Murdock and Jacob arrive and learn of what happened, also Jacob admits that he bought the rifle instead of the cow. The next day, John goes out to hunt for game, but then gets almost shot at by unseen hunters (presumably Richter and his cohorts). Murdock rides up and saves him. He tells the McKays that he is planning to go to Fort Bridger for the winter, but promises to stay and help them finish building the cabin. When it has been completed, Dark Wind performs a simple ceremony of blessing the family and gives them tokens of grace. His job finished, Murdock prepares to leave for the fort. Walking Thunder appears and Richter attempts to shoot him for the price that his skin will fetch, but Dark Wind. who is wandering nearby, utters a warning call, and the bear disappears. In frustration, Richter turns his gun on Dark Wind and shoots him in the shoulder. Dark Wind manages to make his way to the cabin, where Emma tends to his wound. Fearing that whoever shot Dark Wind would come after them, the McKays prepare their firearms and Toby rigs up a crude but effective alarm system with tin cans strung up on a rope. Richter and his companions creep up in the dark but trip over the cans, triggering a warning to the family. Nevertheless, the three hunters manage to enter the cabin and proceed to threaten to kill the McKays unless they reveal where they have hidden their gold. Murdock arrives in the nick of time and tells the three that there is no gold to be found, and manages to drive them away. When asked why he came back when he was supposed to be going to the fort, he merely explains that he had a hunch that he was needed. Murdock takes John McKay on a hunting trip to obtain meat for the winter. Jacob is left in charge of the cabin. Emma suddenly goes into labor, but the two boys are helpless and unsure of what to do. Dark Wind, who has recovered from his injury, assists in the birth and helps deliver a baby girl. Murdock and John return from hunting and learn of the new arrival. Thwarted by their unsuccessful raid on the cabin, Richter, Weasel and Blood Coat turn to hunting down Walking Thunder to obtain his pelt. Weasel manages to wound him but the bear limps away. Murdock and Jacob hear the shot and ride up to avert further killing. The three hunters see Murdock and Weasel and Blood Coat try to take him down. Richter attempts to shoot Dark Wind, who is praying in the woods, for good but Jacob materializes behind him and tells him to put down his gun. Richter looks at him scornfully, takes Jacob's rifle away and pulls out a knife. As he does, Walking Thunder looms up behind him, roars and takes a couple of swipes at Richter, wounding and scaring him off (off- screen). John arrives and helps Murdock fight off Weasel and Blood Coat, who run away at the sudden turn of events. This causes Jacob to see his father in a new light, and realizes that John is every bit a man that Murdock is, albeit in a different way. The film ends with Danny McKay finishing reading the journal of his grandfather Jacob, and the grandmother giving him a brand-new journal to write his life events in. In voice-over, the film narrator tells that the fate of Walking Thunder has become a mystery and legend. White men's version said that he died the day he was shot, but according to the Indians, he was healed by Dark Wind and together they roamed the mountains till the day they we recalled by the spirits to their eternal after-life.

It was one of the deadliest firefighter disasters in United States history. Background During the dry summer and fall of 1933, thousands of workers financed by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation were hired to clear dry brush and to build trails and roads in Griffith Park. On October 3, 1933, an estimated 3,780 men were working in the park, for a pay of 40 cents an hour. More than 100 squads of 50 to 80 men were at work in the park, each supervised by a foreman or \\"straw boss\\". Fire A little after 2 p.m. local time, a small fire started in a pile of debris in Mineral Wells Canyon. Many of the workers volunteered or were ordered to fight the fire, but it spread up the canyon. Because there was no piped water in the area, the men tried to beat out the fire with shovels. Foremen with no knowledge of firefighting initially directed the effort, setting inappropriate back fires and sending hundreds of workers into a steep canyon. The fire department arrived at 2:26 p.m. but found it hard to fight the fire because of the presence of thousands of untrained people. When the wind changed direction at about 3 p.m., the fire rushed up Dam Canyon, jumped a hastily constructed firebreak, and advanced on the workers, killing dozens and injuring more than 100. By nightfall the fire was under control, after burning about of the park's 4,200 acres. Aftermath Because of the disorganized nature of the deployment and the often inaccurate recordkeeping of the work project, it took weeks to establish the exact death toll and identify the bodies. A month after the fire, the District Attorney's office put the official death toll at 29, with 27 dead at the scene and two dead in hospitals afterwards. The Griffith Park fire remained the single-deadliest wildfire in California history for 85 years until being surpassed by the Camp Fire in 2018, which killed at least 83 people. The cause of the fire was determined to be a faulty power line near Pulga Rd. https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/5512/top20_deadliest.pdf . To commemorate the fallen workers, a deodar tree was planted at the entrance to the park along with a memorial plaque. The plaque can no longer be found. The courts ruled that victims were not eligible for civil compensation due to their unofficial employment by a 'straw boss' (Ca. Public Resources Code) See also * List of California wildfires References Category:1933 in California Category:1933 natural disasters in the United States Category:1933 wildfires Category:Griffith Park Category:History of Los Angeles Category:Santa Monica Mountains Category:Wildfires in Los Angeles County, California Category:October 1933 events ","title":"1933 Griffith Park fire"},{"id":"39835669","text":"Dead Rider, formerly known as D.

Jon Spoelstra is an American author, sports marketer, and a former National Basketball Association executive for the Buffalo Braves, Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets and New Jersey Nets. He is the co- founder of SRO Partners, and he currently serves as president of Mandalay Sports Entertainment. Spoelstra graduated from Notre Dame in 1966. He was a judge at the Miss America 2004 contest. He and his wife Elisa Celino have two children: Monica and Erik, the head coach of the Miami Heat. Spoelstra's father was sportswriter Watson Spoelstra. NBA and business career After graduating from Notre Dame in 1966, Spoelstra founded his first marketing company in 1970, The New School of Youth Marketing and Other Phenomena Inc. In the mid-1970s his company obtained the rights to syndicate Notre Dame basketball games for $2,000 per game. In 1977, Spoelstra's career in the NBA began when the Buffalo Braves hired him as vice president of marketing. One of his biggest tasks he was assigned was to prevent a relocation of the Braves, although the team moved to San Diego ten months later. In 1979, then Portland Trail Blazers owner Larry Weinberg hired Spoelstra as senior vice president and general manager where he would serve for ten years before resigning. The Denver Nuggets hired Spoelstra in 1989 as president and general manager, but he was fired after 90 days due to a dispute with management. Spoelstra returned to Portland, where he co-founded SRO Partners, and began teaching sports marketing at the University of Portland. He began consulting for the New Jersey Nets in March 1991, and became the team's president 1993. During his time with the Nets, Spoelstra implemented marketing tactics that increased the team's home game attendance from last in the league when he initially arrived to first in the NBA. His most famous marketing gimmick came in 1994, when he sent rubber chickens through direct mail with the tagline \\"Don't Fowl Out!\\" to Nets season ticket holders who had not yet renewed their season tickets.

Besides, he does not dare to ask his uncle about his job, since his father had persuaded him to stay away from Frankie, since he would not fit into the family. Nicholas finds connection to the New York teenagers Donna and Tommy, who help him to get along in the metropolis. Over time, the clues are growing that Frankie is working for the Mafia. When Nicholas takes a phone call on Frankie's private phone, he takes a job for a certain Paulie, which actually leads him into a mafia environment. Inspired by one of his favorite movies, he gives himself the name 'Nicky Deuce'. By chance, he gains some recognition within the gangster ring, which brings him further orders. Nicky is also sure his uncle is a mafioso, as the orders were intended for him. Nicky, Donna and Tommy are discovering that the Gangster gang is cheating on horseback in a big way by conditioning their own racehorses through hypnosis and launching them as outsiders. Through a keyword, the horse is \\"switched\\" in the race, wins the race, and the gang around Paulie cashes large amounts of money. Tommy is accidentally hypnotized too. The teenagers kidnap the racehorse, whereupon the gangsters kidnap Tutti. However, Nicky and the gang's attempt to exchange Tutti for the racehorse fails. Nicky, Donna, Tommy, Tutti and Frankie, as well as Nicky's parents are overwhelmed and tied up by the gangsters. They manage to free themselves, but can no longer prevent the manipulated horse breeding. When Paulie wants to pick up his winnings, Frankie reveals his true profession: as a covert investigator of the NYPD, he was thrown into the Gangster gang to reveal their criminal machinations; the gang is caught in flagranti and arrested. Nicky's dad now sees Frankie in a new light and they reconcile. Tutti tells Nicky's parents to allow him to have more excitement in his life. The group attends a dance together, and Nicky and Donna kiss.

The community was named after the Fenwick family, who were early settlers on the left bank of the Mississippi River in the Spanish Illinois Country. History The colonial history of eastern Perry County begins in the late 1700s with the migration of American Catholics into the Spanish territory of Upper Louisiana. In 1797, the Spanish district commandant at New Bourbon had noticed a group of Catholics living in Kentucky. The Spanish colony saw these Americans as prospective immigrants. The head of one of the families, Joseph Fenwick, received an invitation in 1797 from district commandant Luzi√®res to bring himself and his son, a doctor, as well as other American Catholics to settle Spanish territory. On April 18, 1797, Joseph Fenwick arrived with 25 or more Catholic families from the White Sulphur area of Kentucky, along with seventy slaves. These American Catholics from Kentucky - descended from Irish Roman Catholic families who settled in Maryland - were referred to as ‚ÄúMaryland Catholics‚Äù or ‚ÄúEnglish Catholics‚Äù to distinguish them from the resident French-speaking Catholics. The reference to Maryland was due to their having left Maryland in 1785 following the American Revolution, and seeking land elsewhere for a better life. After 1803, Joseph Fenwick left New Bourbon village, possibly over issues of land-ownership or to relocate himself beyond easy reach of the colonial officials. He initially planned to settle on Apple Creek at the mouth of Indian Creek, in proximity to the villages that the Shawnee were erecting at that time. The presence of so many Indians probably caused Fenwick to give up his plans and instead establish a settlement at the mouth of Brazeau Creek in the Brazeau Bottoms on the Mississippi River. This small settlement was named Fenwick Settlement, after its founder. The settlement grew to about 20 families with the arrival of more Catholic families from Kentucky. However, the location of the settlement was not particularly amenable to farming and the settlement did not prosper. By 1807-1808, the Fenwick group began to drift away. GNIS reference The Geographic Names Information System has an entry for the Fenwick Settlement with a location of unknown.

Strelka has been listed among the top-100 best architecture schools in 2014, according to Domus magazine. The Institute has been directed since 2013 by Varvara Melnikova. Education programme The Institute aims to educate the next generation of architects, designers and media professionals, enabling them to shape the 21st century world. Each year, Strelka welcomes young professionals and gives them the opportunity to work together with experts in the fields of urbanism, architecture and communications from all over the world. During this nine-month post-graduate programme, the researchers explore the issues related to Russia's urban development through a multidisciplinary method conducted in English. Experimental methods, a holistic approach to architecture, media and design, and an emphasis on research are the main characteristics of the programme. The prominent architect and architecture theorist, Rem Koolhaas (AMO/OMA), contributed to the designing of the Institute's education programme. Since 2010, Yuri Grigoryan, architect and head of the Meganom architectural bureau], has served as director of the education programme. Since 2012, the curriculum has been designed by two programming directors: Anastassia Smirnova ‚Äì partner in the Rotterdam-based architecture and research bureau SVESMI, and David Erixon ‚Äì founder of the Hyper Island school, and member of the Megafon board of directors.

Its corporate headquarters were in Falls Church, Virginia, in Greater Washington, D.C. Training took place in Boyers, Pennsylvania. USIS was a part of Altegrity Inc., a company headquartered in the Falls Church area that was owned by Providence Equity Partners. History USIS was founded in 1996 after the investigative branch, Federal Investigative Service, of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was privatized. Its creation was due to an effort of Vice President of the United States Al Gore to reduce the size of the civil service. Originally known as US Investigations Services Inc., it was at first an employee-owned company. The Carlyle Group invested in USIS and in 2003, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe also committed capital to them. In 2007, Carlyle announced that it would sell USIS to Providence Equity Partners, a private equity firm, for US$1.5 billion. In the fiscal year 2012, USIS received $253 million for the contract work of the OPM, 67% of the OPM's contract spending for the fiscal year. Background checks =Aaron Alexis background check= In 2007, an OPM contract investigator employed by USIS conducted the field work for the OPM-FIS background investigation on Aaron Alexis, who has been accused of killing twelve people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday, September 16, 2013. =Edward Snowden investigation= In 2011, OPM contract investigators employed by USIS conducted the field work for the OPM security clearance re-investigation on Edward Snowden, who leaked classified documents beginning on June 5, 2013. On June 18, 2013, the Subcommittee on Efficiency and Effectiveness of Federal Programs and the Federal Workforce and the Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight, both of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, held a joint hearing. Michelle B. Schmitz, the OPM assistant inspector general for investigations, testified that USIS had been under investigation since late 2011, stating that it involves a \\"complicated contract fraud case.\\" Patrick McFarland, the OPM inspector general, did not reveal the reason for the investigation of USIS, and said when asked about Snowden's security clearance re-investigation, \\"We do believe there may be some problems.\\" =USIS response to accusations regarding Alexis and Snowden= In a September 8, 2014, media release, the company insisted that, despite being \\"the target of inaccurate and misleading public allegations,\\" USIS is a responsible government contractor. It labeled as myth reports that USIS botched its field work for OPM background investigations on Aaron Alexis and Edward Snowden, calling the claim \\"absolutely false.\\" The company asserted that \\"OPM confirmed in sworn testimony before Congress on February 11, 2014 that the investigative file compiled by USIS on Aaron Alexis 'was complete and in compliance with all investigative standards.'\\" USIS also said it followed all OPM-mandated procedures and protocols in its background investigation of Edward Snowden. The company further clarified that it \\"does not grant security clearances and plays no role in making those determinations.\\" The decision to grant or renew a clearance, said USIS, \\"is the sole responsibility of the federal government agency that requested the background investigation.\\" However, the OPM hired USIS to perform not only background checks but also secondary reviews of those checks to ensure that no one who shouldn't have access to state secrets was overlooked by mistake. While USIS did have staff to review these background investigations and to ensure they met government investigative standards, the federal government and the OPM was still responsible for the adjudication in granting of security clearances. Fraud investigation and charges In June 2013, the office of Senator Claire McCaskill stated that USIS was \\"under active criminal investigation\\". A statement from USIS stated that it was unaware that it was under criminal investigation. It added that \\"USIS complied with that subpoena and has cooperated fully with the government's civil investigative efforts\\". USIS, as the government's No. 1 provider of background checks for the United States, earned $253 million in awards this year alone. On January 23, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice filed fraud charges against USIS. The suit was originally filed by a long time USIS employee, whistleblower Blake Percival. The suit, United States of America, ex rel Blake Percival vs USIS alleges that beginning in at least March 2008 and continuing through at least September 2012, USIS management devised and executed a scheme to deliberately circumvent contractually required quality reviews of reports of investigation of completed background investigations in order to increase the company's revenues and profits. USIS responded that the faulty checks \\"relate to a small group of individuals over a specific time period.\\" In August 2015, Altegrity agreed to forgo $30 million in payments the U.S. government owed to USIS in order to settle the case with the Department of Justice. =Cyber attack= On July 7, 2014, the company said it was hit by a cyber attack prompting the US government to suspend its work with the firm. Multiple experts including USIS Lead Information Security Engineer John Nolan who have examined the hack \\"believe it has all the markings of a state- sponsored attack,\\" but did not detail possible suspects. The investigation revealed that the hackers broke into USIS by pivoting from an SAP system managed by a third party. =OPM drops USIS= On September 9, 2014, the OPM confirmed it would not renew any of its contracts with USIS upon their expiration at month's end. USIS said it was \\"deeply disappointed with OPM's decision,\\" which affects 3,000 employees handling a caseload that averaged about 21,000 background investigations a month for total fees of $320 million during the last fiscal year. Bankruptcy In early 2015, USIS's parent company, Altegrity (also known as Corporate Risk Holdings) filed for bankruptcy.

Alice Taylor died in 1942 and the property was deeded to the Colorado Congregational Church by the Bemis Taylor Foundation. The center is now open to United Church of Christ members, other denominations and organizations. La Foret now has a number of cabins, a dining hall, sports fields and courts, and outdoor theater seating.

The city-state, which later became part of Xinjiang), may have been known to its inhabitants by the Tocharian name Agni, which was rendered Yanqi in Chinese sources. The first campaign in 644 was led by the Tang commander Guo Xiaoke, protector-general of the Anxi Protectorate in western China, who defeated the oasis state and a Western Turkic army and installed a Tang loyalist as ruler. The second campaign in 648, which was part of the campaign against Karasahr's neighboring state of Kucha, was led by a Turkic general of the Tang Dynasty, Ashina She'er, who defeated and conquered Karasahr. Background Karasahr, a kingdom in the Tarim Basin, became a tributary state of Tang China in 632. In 632, the nearby oasis states Kashgar and Khotan surrendered to Chinese suzerainty, as did the kingdom of Yarkand in 635. Karasahr was influenced by Persian culture, Buddhism, and the Greco-Buddhist culture of Afghanistan. The rulers of Karasahr grew uneasy as the Chinese expanded into Central Asia. After the conquest of the city of Turfan, center of the kingdom of Gaochang, the Chinese army stationed nearby was seen as a direct threat. This is a little ironic, because Gaochang's military aggression against Karasahr (a response to Karasahr's developing a trade route to China that bypassed Gaochang) had earlier served as one of the pretexts for the Tang campaign against Gaochang. 644 Campaign Karasahr ended its tributary relationship with the Tang dynasty and formed a marriage alliance with the Western Turkic Khaganate, its previous suzerain. The state of Kucha, although technically a Tang vassal, aided Karasahr's rebellion in 644. Fearing Tang military ambitions, Kucha also ended its status as a Chinese tributary state. The Tang emperor responded by sending an army led by commander Guo Xiaoke, protectorate-general of the Anxi Protectorate, against the kingdom. Long Lipozhun, a brother of the former king, defected to the Tang and served as Guo's guide. Guo planned a surprise attack, marching towards the city from the Yulduz, and attacked the kingdom at dawn. The city fell and the king Long Tuqizhi was captured when the Tang troops swam across the moat that surrounded the city. Guo Xiaoke installed Long Lipozhun as ruler and led his army back toward Gaochang with Long Tuqizhi as a captive. The Western Turks sent 5,000 cavalry to assist Karasahr. They arrived three days after Guo's departure and captured Long Lipozhun. They then pursued Guo Xiaoke's army, but were defeated by the Tang troops. One of the Western Turk leaders later sent a tudun to rule Karasahr, but the tudun pulled out after receiving threats from Tang Taizong. The people of Karasahr then installed Long Lipozhun's cousin Xue Apo'anazhi as their king and remained vassals of the Western Turks. 648 campaign The Tang general Ashina She'er, a member of the Turkic Ashina royal family, was sent to attack Kucha with 100,000 Tiele auxiliary cavalry in 648. Although the Tang expedition did not attack Karasahr directly, the pro-Turk king fled his capital city and attempted to hold off the Tang forces on the eastern borders of Kucha. The Tang expedition pursued, captured, and executed him. Another pro-Tang Karasahr aristocrat, Lipozhun's cousin Xiannazhun, was then installed as ruler of Karasahr. Aftermath Karasahr became one of the Tang empire's Four Garrisons of the Pacified West (the others being Kucha, Khotan, and Kashgar) when the headquarters of the Protectorate of the Pacified West was moved from Gaochang to Kucha in 658 or 659, but it is not clear whether any Tang troops were stationed in Karasahr between 648 and 658. The Tang pulled out of Karasahr in 670 as a result of a Tibetan invasion of the Tarim Basin. Tang forces regained the Tarim Basin in 692 but lost it to the Tibetans for the second and last time in the 790s, by which time the Tarim Basin had been cut off from the Tang empire by the Tibetan conquest of the Gansu Corridor in the 760s.

The series was first unveiled under the name \\"1/144 Gundam Mobile\\" project by Sunrise, before its official announcement. In contrast to other Gundam series, Gundam Build Fighters focuses on the Gundam model (Gunpla) aspect of the franchise. The series was officially unveiled by Bandai on July 2, 2013, during the series's live press conference as part of Gundam's 35th Anniversary in 2014. It premiered on TXN stations in Japan and on YouTube in limited international markets on October 7, 2013. One Manga adaptation and two photonovels were also announced by Sunrise, and currently running on Gundam Ace (Gundam Build Fighters Amazing), Hobby Japan (Gundam Build Fighters Honno), and Dengeki Hobby Magazine (Gundam Build Fighter Document) magazines. Gundam Build Fighters is followed by the 2014 sequel Gundam Build Fighters Try. A sequel ONA titled , which takes place between Build Fighters and Build Fighters Try, was released on August 25, 2017. Story Back in the 1980s, the success of the series Mobile Suit Gundam resulted in an economic boom due to sales of the Gundam model kits, or , dubbed the Gunpla Boom. Years later, with the success of the second Gunpla Boom, special tournaments called Gunpla Battles are established throughout the world to see which customized Gunpla and its builder are the best. These incredibly popular Gunpla Battles culminate in an annual global tournament. The story of the first series revolves around Sei Iori, a young Gunpla Builder and student who has a dream of becoming the best Gunpla Fighter in the tournament and someday become as good as his father. As the only child, his family owns a small Gunpla shop and his talent is well- honed, however his weak piloting abilities have led him to a series of first- round losses. But one day, he meets a strange boy named Reiji, who helps him out. Reiji gives him a jewel, promising that he will come to Sei's aid if wished enough. Together, both of them will tackle the world of Gunpla Battle and compete in the tournament using Sei's customized Gunpla, the GAT-X105B Build Strike Gundam. =Gunpla Battle= The central theme of this series is the , a virtual game that involves the use of Gunpla. Each Gunpla Fighter has a , a device that stores their Gunpla information. Once the GP Bases are set, the disperses , which react only to the plastic material of Gunpla and animate them into the game. The Battle System creates a holographic landscape that simulates a battlefield from different Gundam series, and the battle begins once the Gunpla Fighters set their Gunpla to be scanned by the Plavsky particles. A Gunpla's combat statistics are determined by its build quality; modifications such as adding scratch-built parts and paint weathering will increase its stats. Battle effects such as explosions and beam attacks are faithfully simulated in the Battle System. Consequently, damage sustained during battle is reflected directly on the Gunpla itself, requiring Gunpla Fighters to have spare parts ready for necessary repairs. Scale also plays a major factor in a Gunpla Battle; just like in the real world, a scale Mega Size Model Gunpla will dwarf a scale opponent in the battlefield. The Gunpla Battle World Championships tournament begins with eight battles, including a four-person knockout battle, a three-on-three team battle, and the closing one-on-one battle. Five of the battles are revealed only on their scheduled dates. Each contestant receives four points for every battle won. The 16 Gunpla Fighters with the most points will advance to the final tournament, a knockout stage that decides the World Champion. It is later on revealed that Plavsky particles are processed from , a crystal originating from Reiji's home country of . Production =Development= The first announcement of the series was made in June 2013 under the name \\"1/144 Gundam Mobile\\" project by Sunrise, which revealed a story-line more akin to the OVA Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G. Along with the announcement, several mobile suits would receive their own High Grade Gundam model kits that would tie in to the long running Gunpla plastic model line, the new version of the Gundam Try Age arcade game, and the PlayStation 3/PlayStation Vita game Gundam Breaker. On August 31, 2013, Sunrise aired the second trailer of the series, which provided additional details about the story, the characters, and the Gundam model kits.

Though the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade recognized a legal right for a woman in the United States to get an abortion, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey invalidated certain restrictions that create an undue burden on women seeking abortions, these cases permit states to make certain restrictions in the guise of regulation of the practice, but which they argue do not create an ‚Äúundue burden‚Äù. Some state laws that impact the availability of abortions have been upheld. Regulations imposed by individual states that have impacted the availability of abortions, particularly in the 2010s, include requiring a woman seeking an abortion to view an ultrasound, requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, and long waiting periods after the first consultation with the abortion provider. Nevertheless, abortion remains legal in all U.S. states, and every state has at least one abortion clinic. Laws targeting abortion clinics This map shows 60-mile access to abortion providers in Texas Some states impose regulations that apply only to abortion clinics, sometimes called TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws, which according to Mother Jones and The New Republic impose standards that may be arbitrary or difficult to implement, do not improve safety, but rather are aimed at closing abortion clinics. For example, some laws require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers, which entail renovations that are prohibitively expensive for some clinics. Other regulations require doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Some hospitals refuse admitting privileges to doctors who perform abortions. Critics of admitting privileges laws and other TRAP laws include the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Public Health Association, and the American Medical Association, which have argued that such laws are medically unnecessary and that abortion is already very safe in the United States. From 2011, the crimes of Kermit Gosnell, a physician who ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia, spurred federal and state bills to more strictly regulate abortion facilities. Opponents of the restrictions questioned whether stricter regulations would have deterred Gosnell, who was alleged to be knowingly in violation of existing regulations. Supporters of Texas House Bill 2 (H.B. 2), which included requirements for abortion clinics to meet ambulatory surgical center regulations and for abortion clinic doctors to have hospital admitting privileges, said the bill improved health care for women and babies. Opponents of the bill said it created unnecessary regulations for the purpose of reducing access to abortions. At the time of the bill's signing into law in 2013, five of the state's forty-two abortion clinics met the law's requirements. Courts had blocked enforcement of similar laws in some other states, pending lawsuits challenging their constitutionality. A federal district judge determined this law to be unconstitutional, finding that the admitting privileges requirement placed an undue burden on a person seeking to have an abortion; however, this decision was reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, resulting in the immediate closure of all but seven abortion clinics in the state, all of these in urban areas. In March 2016, this case, now known as Whole Women's Health v Hellerstedt, was heard by the Supreme Court. Over eighty amicus curiae briefs were filed with the Court. The case was decided on June 27, 2016 and was reversed and remanded, 5-3, in an opinion by Justice Breyer. In summary, the Supreme Court ruled that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. In March 2020, the Supreme Court heard June Medical Services LLC v Russo which examined if Louisiana‚Äôs law requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital conflicts with the Supreme Court‚Äôs binding precedent in Whole Woman‚Äôs Health v. Hellerstedt. A decision on this case is expected in summer 2020. In 2015, Arkansas passed a law that ruled that required that any physician that sought to provide the abortion pill must have a contract with another physician who has admitting privileges at a hospital nearby. Consequently, there are now zero providers that offer medication abortion in Arkansas and two Planned Parenthoods within the state cancelled their abortion services. No evidence has been found that hospital admitting privileges improve the safety of abortion. Following the passage of a 2013 Wisconsin law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, three Catholic hospital systems in the state intended to deny admitting privileges to abortion providers. Wisconsin's attorney general said this intent violated the Church Amendment of 1973, which prohibits hospitals receiving federal funds from discriminating against a doctor on the basis of whether the doctor provides abortions. In Maryland, according to The New York Times, something \\"rare in this era of polarized abortion politics\\" occurred when laws that significantly tightened the licensing and inspection of abortion clinics were supported by those on both sides of the abortion issue. Laws targeting methods of practice On November 4, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by the state of Oklahoma to the overturning, on constitutional grounds, of a bill intended to ban the practice of terminations of early pregnancies via medications.Court lets stand an Oklahoma ruling that a state abortion law is unconstitutional', Washington Post, Juliet Eilperin, 12 November 2013. Retrieved 13 November 2013. Mandatory ultrasounds As of May 2019, 12 states require women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound before being allowed to have the procedure, while 14 states require women to be issued with ultrasound information. Mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds have been particularly controversial. In Texas, for instance, even if previous ultrasounds had indicated severe congenital defects, a woman seeking an abortion was required under a 2012 law to have another ultrasound done, \\"administered by her abortion doctor, and [she had to] listen to a state-mandated description of the fetus she was about to abort\\", though state-issued guidelines later eliminated the ultrasound requirement if the fetus had an \\"irreversible medical condition\\". On November 12, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by the state of Oklahoma to the overturning of a bill that mandated compulsory ultrasound examinations.Court lets stand an Oklahoma ruling that a state abortion law is unconstitutional', Washington Post, Juliet Eilperin, 12 November 2013. Retrieved 12 November 2013. Waiting periods 27 states require that a person seeking an abortion wait for a period of one to six days, most often 1 day, after receiving counseling and before having the abortion. 14 states require that the patient takes two trips to the clinic before receiving an abortion as they must receive counseling in person at the clinic, wait the designated waiting period, and return to the clinic to have the procedure done. The state of South Dakota requires that the patient obtain mandatory counseling from an anti-abortion crisis pregnancy center during this time frame. Fetal heartbeat bills This type of legislation requires either that a woman be required to listen to her fetus's heartbeat should she attempt to obtain an abortion,See, for example, The Next Abortion Battleground: Fetal Heartbeats or, more rigidly, that abortion become illegal as soon as a heartbeat can be detected, which is sometimes as early as six weeks. Physician scripts In some states, a doctor who is asked to perform an abortion is required to read a prepared script to the patient in order to secure informed consent. These scripts may include medically inaccurate information intended to persuade the patient not to have an abortion, such as the claim that the abortion will increase the risk of breast cancer or of psychological problems, which are not supported by mainstream medical organizations or scientific consensus. As of July 2013, 12 states require that women be given information on the ability of a fetus to feel pain. In Planned Parenthood v. Rounds, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a South Dakota law requiring doctors to give patients false or misleading information about the suicide risk in women who have abortions was not unconstitutional.Can the Government Require Doctors to Provide Misleading Information to Patients Seeking Abortions?Alaska, Kansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas mandate that before an abortion can be performed, the patient must be counseled on the link between abortion and breast cancer.There is currently no evidence from scientific research that abortion has the ability to cause breast cancer. Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, and West Virginia mandate that patients receive counseling on the potential psychological impacts of abortion on the women who receive them before an abortion can be given. 5 states require that an abortion patient is counseled that personhood begins at conception. Liability A 1997 Louisiana law creates a civil cause of action for abortion-related damages, including damage to the unborn, for up to ten years after the abortion. The same law also bars the state's Patient's Compensation Fund, which limits malpractice liability for participating physicians, from insuring against abortion-related claims. An attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which opposes the law, said the law is an attempt to drive abortion providers out of practice, and that every completed abortion imposes strict liability under the law because abortion necessarily involves damage to the unborn. Reporting As of 2010, 46 of 50 states and the District of Columbia had either mandatory or voluntary reporting of abortion statistics. According to an associate of the Guttmacher Institute, reporting requirements were generally \\"benign\\" and treated confidentially, but the requirements in some states have become more intrusive. A 2009 Oklahoma law, overturned by a federal court in 2010, would have required doctors to report information from a 37-question form about every woman receiving an abortion to the state health department for publication in an online registry. A lawyer for the Center for Reproductive Rights, a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit challenging the law, said the law would have made public potentially identifying details about women, and was intended to dissuade women from seeking abortions. Todd Lamb, who sponsored the law as a state senator, called it \\"essential in protecting the sanctity of life\\" and \\"pro-life\\".

He signed his name as Lowery, Lowry, Lowrie, Lawrey, Lawrie, or Laurie. Early years Born about 1755, his background was the Lauries of Maxwelton, Dumfriesshire. He received from the Society of Arts in 1770 a silver palette for a drawing from a picture, and in 1773, 1775, and 1776 premiums for designs of patterns for calico-printing. Work His earliest portraits in mezzotint are dated 1771. He was a relatively early British user of the √† la poup√©e method of printing in colours, extending the number of colours considerably, and for this received from the Society of Arts in 1776 a bounty of thirty guineas. Early in 1794, in partnership with James Whittle, he succeeded to the business carried on by Robert Sayer at the Golden Buck in Fleet Street, London as a publisher of engravings, maps, charts, and nautical works. Major charts published by this firm were James Cook's Survey of the South Coast of Newfoundland (1776) and the Surveys of St. George's Channel, (1777). Laurie then gave up the practice of engraving. He retired from business in 1812, and the firm continued as Whittle & Laurie, but the business was run by his son, Richard Holmes Laurie, who, on the death of Whittle in 1818, became the sole proprietor.

Founded in December 2012 in Qamishli, it was aimed at forming a new party to rival the dominant role of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in governing the de facto independent Syrian Kurdish region of Rojava. After one of the parties had broken apart in 2013, the alliance dissolved in April 2014 with the remaining parties merging into the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDP-S). History = Establishment = The Kurdish Democratic Political Union was established on 15 December 2012, when approx. 1500 people joined a founding ceremony in the Syrian Kurdish town of Qamishli. It consisted of four parties: * the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDP-S), * the two branches of the Kurdish Freedom Party in Syria (', or Azad√Æ, led by Mustafa Khidr Oso and Mustafa Juma), * and the Kurdish Union Party of Syria (', or PYKS). The alliance was formed by four parties discontent with the perceived weakness of the Kurdish National Council as a \\"subgroup\\" within the council to foster unity. = Clashes with the PYD = The militia it formed clashed with the Popular Protection Units (YPG), a militia controlled by the Democratic Union Party (PYD), in April 2013. The alliance currently claims to have 1,500 fighters in Syria, with the Kurdistan Regional Government training troops in Iraq that will eventually controlled by the alliance. The two Freedom parties and the Kurdistani United Party (headed by Abdulbasit Hemo) would merge into the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria. On 1 March 2014, the PYD-linked Asayish did not allow members of the alliance to cross into Iraq to conduct a meeting in Erbil. = Dissolution = From its very beginning, the alliance was weakened by internal power struggles. While ostensibly formed with the intent of an equitable merger between the parties, the stronger KDP-S was accused of using its political clout and support from the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government trying to subsume all other parties. Only KDP-S members were allowed to become part of the small militia, raising allegations that the KDP-S is behaving in a similar way to how the PYD monopolizes control on the YPG. As a result, the Yek√Æt√Æ party abandoned the alliance in 2013. In early April 2014, the Azadi Party, along with three other parties, merged into the KDP-S.

He was often cast alongside Roekiah as her romantic interest. Biography Djoemala was born in Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia), the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Sources disagree on his year of birth; the catalogue Apa Siapa Film Indonesia gives 19 September 1915, while Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran gives 1918. Although later billed as \\"Raden\\" Djoemala, the actor was not of noble descent. He had some schooling, completing his junior high school in 1934. A tailor by trade, Djoemala had owned the Broadway Store located on Kramat Raya Street. In 1940 he was approached by Tan's Film and cast for their new production, Sorga Ka Toedjoe (Seventh Heaven). He was cast opposite Tan's mainstay Roekiah, whose regular on-screen partner, Rd Mochtar, had recently left the company owing to wage concerns. Djoemala was chosen for his good looks and tall body. In the film, Djoemala played Hoesin, who reunites the long-separated Hadidjah (Annie Landouw) and Kasimin (Kartolo; Roekiah's husband) to win the hand of Roekiah's character Rasmina. The film was a success, and one reviewer opined that Djoemala was as good as, if not better, than Mochtar. The pair's next film together, Roekihati, cast Djoemala as a city-dweller named Mansoer who falls for a village girl named Roekihati (Roekiah) but is nearly forced to marry another woman. In 1941 Djoemala and Roekiah acted in another two films together, Poesaka Terpendam (Buried Treasure) and Koeda Sembrani (The Enchanted Horse). Although all of these films were moderate critical successes, ultimately the pairing of Djoemala and Roekiah was unable to draw as many viewers as Mochtar and Roekiah had done. Biran writes that Roekiah's singing and the comedic antics of Kartolo were all that Tan's could depend on during this period. Following the Japanese occupation of the Indies in February 1942, Tan's was closed. Djoemala is not recorded as having acted in any further films. During the occupation he joined a theatre troupe, Pantjawarna, in West Java, while in the Indonesian National Revolution (1945‚Äì49) he fought as a guerrilla. After the revolution he returned to working as an entrepreneur and tailor, dying in Jakarta on 10 June 1992.

She is regarded as the first female African presidential candidate. Political career Ruth-Rolland began her career as the supervisor for the education system of the French territory of Ubangi-Shari in 1956 and the supervised the Central African Republic national education system following independence from France in 1960, continuing to teach until 1964. Following this she was employed as a social worker, helping street children, and as the head of army social services in the Central African Armed Forces, leaving the forces with the rank of battalion chief. Ruth-Rolland became an advisor to the government in 1979 and later was appointed as the Minister for the Promotion of Women's Status. During this time she worked heavily with street children and was nicknamed \\"Aunt Ruth\\", a name which continued to be used throughout her life. Ruth- Rolland was the president of the Central African Red Cross. During this time she founded and lead the Central African Republican Party (Parti Republicain Centrafricain (PRC)). In 1981 Andr√© Kolingba became president of the Central African Republic, and in October, 1983, Kolingba ordered the arrest of Ruth- Rolland for her denouncement of the embezzlement of government funds by Minister for Social Affairs Gaston Gambor and Minister for Water and Forests S√©bastien Guipi. Ruth-Rolland's subsequent detainment at a police station was opposed by Amnesty International. In August, 1987 Ruth-Rolland was jailed for three years by a Special Jury for Political Matters for her criticism of Kolingba's corrupt government (officially \\"incitement\\"). Although released two-months early in September 1989, she was arrested again in December that year for refusing to make way for the presidential entourage. She was then detained at the National Security Company paramilitary camp until April 1991. The following year, Ruth-Rolland was a candidate in the first multiparty elections and was elected deputy for the seat of Bakouma. As her own political party had not been legalised by the time of the election, she ran as the leader of the Civic Forum party. The election, however, was cancelled by Supreme Court of the Central African Republic and re-held the following year in 1993, when Ruth-Rolland was able to run under her own Central African Republican Party. She was elected despite attempts by President Kolingba to annul the ballot. Later that year she was appointed as the Minister for Social Affairs, the Status of Women and National Solidarity. Ruth-Rolland left her ministerial position on August 22, 1993, to run as a candidate in the Central African Republic general election, being the first woman in Africa to run for president. Despite popularity as a candidate, she was not elected, acquiring 1% of votes. Following the election she resumed her position as deputy of Bakouma and ran a gold prospector's consortium in the eastern regions of the country. Personal life and death Jeanne-Marie Ruth-Rolland's father was French and her mother was African. She married a French arms dealer from Bangui with whom she had five children. She was an avid diamond-collector and pursued this hobby in her later years. In her final years, Ruth-Rolland became ill and was evacuated to Paris, France, where she died, aged 58, in hospital on June 4, 1995. The cause of her death was not given. A memorial has been erected in Bakouma in her honor.

Two civil guards were killed and three injured, while two ETA members were killed after the civil guards starting the new shift came to the assistance of their colleagues. The attack On the day of the attack, ETA hijacked a car in Lasarte, threatening the owner, Claudio Rivera, with death if he informed the police before 16:00.ABC Madrid, 15 July 1980, p19 The attack occurred at 14:05 on a Sunday afternoon. ETA had carried out a similar attack earlier in the year, killing six civil guards in an ambush at Ispaster. The civil guards, having just finished their shift at the munitions factory, were driving to their barracks in three official vehicles. The ETA unit, waiting near the bridge at the main road, launched grenades at the vehicles and subjected them to crossfire, killing two of the guards and wounding three. Another group of civil guards, who had arrived at the munitions factory to begin their shift, heard the shooting and rushed to assist their colleagues. Opening fire on the ETA unit, with the terrain advantage caused by the elevation of the factory, they managed to kill two ETA members after an exchange of gunfire. The remaining ETA members fled down the mountain.

Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 17. Clearly, English is well established in Brunei, though it does not seem to be challenging the position of Malay. Rather more threatened are the minority languages such as Dusun, Tutong and Murut (Lun Bawang), which seem to be getting squeezed out by the two dominant languages,Noor Azam (2012). It's not always English: \\"Duelling Aunties\\" in Brunei Darussalam. In V. Rapatahana & P. Bunce (eds.), English Language as Hydra (pp. 175-190).

Endangered languages in Borneo: a survey among the Iban and Murut (Lun Bawang) in Temburong, Brunei. Oceanic Linguistics, 49(1), 119‚Äì143.  Variation  There is, of course, substantial variation in the English spoken in Brunei. Two sources of variation are mentioned here: education and ethnicity. There is rather a wide educational divide. Those who attend private schools and the best government schools usually achieve an excellent standard in English; but those who go to less fashionable schools often end up with only rudimentary skills in English.Wood, A., Henry, A., Malai Ayla Hj Abd., & Clynes, A. (2011). English in Brunei: ‚ÄúShe speaks excellent English‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúNo he doesn‚Äôt‚Äù. In L. J. Zhang, R. Rubdy & L. Alsagoff (Eds.), Asian Englishes: Changing Perspectives in a Globalized World (pp. 52‚Äì66). Singapore: Pearson. There is also some variation in Brunei English arising from the ethnicity of speakers. Recent research has shown that undergraduates at the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) can identify whether a fellow undergraduate is Malay or Chinese on the basis of 10 seconds of spoken English with an accuracy of about 74%, which suggests that the English pronunciation of the two ethnic groups differs to some extent.Ishamina Athirah (2011). Identification of Bruneian ethnic groups from their English pronunciation. Southeast Asia: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 11, 37‚Äì45. On-line Version  Pronunciation  Some of the salient features of the pronunciation of English in Brunei are: * The consonant at the start of words like thin and thank tends to be pronounced as rather than .Mossop, J. (1996). Some phonological features of Brunei English. In P. W. Martin, A. C. K. Ozog & G. Poedjoesoedarmo (eds.), Language Use and Language Change in Brunei Darussalam (pp. 189‚Äì208).

The vowels of Brunei English: An acoustic investigation. English World-Wide, 27, 247‚Äì264. with the result that beat and bit may be homophones, and similarly fool and full often sound the same. In an investigation of the speech of 53 undergraduates, 14 were found to have the same vowel quality in feast and fist,Deterding, D., & Salbrina S. (2013). Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 38. but the proportion of speakers who merge these two vowels is almost certainly higher for less well- educated speakers. * Spelling pronunciation affects some words, so salmon tends to have an in it, and the first syllable of company has rather than for about half of undergraduates at the University of Brunei Darussalam.Deterding, D., & Salbrina S. (2013). Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 41. One current change that seems to be taking place is that Brunei English is becoming more rhotic, partly influenced by American English and also by the rhoticity of the Malay spoken in Brunei,Salbrina, S., & Deterding, D. (2010). Rhoticity in Brunei English. English World-Wide, 31, 121‚Äì137.Nur Raihan Mohamad (2017). Rhoticity in Brunei English : A diachronic approach. Southeast Asia: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 17, 1-7. PDF Version although English in neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore remains mostly non-rhotic.  Grammar  A few of the salient features of Brunei English grammar are: * Logically plural nouns are found with an ‚àís suffix, even if they are uncount nouns in other varieties of English.

Conclusion  It is hard to know whether English in Brunei is following an established pattern and emerging as a distinct variety of English or not.Schnieder, E. W. (2007). Postcolonial English: Varieties around the World. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Many of the trends found, including the use of plural nouns such as equipments and the variable use of the 3rd person singular ‚àís suffix on verbs, seem to be similar to the ways English is used as a lingua franca around the world.Seidlhofer, B. (2011). Understanding English as a Lingua Franca. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Furthermore, the avoidance of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables is consistent with the way English is spoken elsewhere in South-East Asia.Deterding, D. (2010).

It has particularly focused on research and publication of works which provide information about suicide methods, including How to Die With Dignity, the first book published on the subject.  History  Exit was formed in 1980 in Scotland to research and publish information on suicide for people suffering from serious illness. Originally part of a UK Society formed in 1935, it broke away when the parent group vacillated over producing such guidance. In 1980, as Scottish Exit, it published the first suicide guide in the world, How to Die With Dignity by Dr George Mair. Other suicide books by authors around the world soon followed. The Society was originally called Scottish Exit, a branch of a parent London society. When the parent group's plans to publish such a book were delayed, the Scottish group formed an independent society dedicated to such publications. During its history, it has also been known as The Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland, or the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society, reverting to the name of Exit in 2000. How to Die With Dignity was followed by various supplements as new information became available. In 1993, authors CK Smith and CG Docker collaborated on a new book, Departing Drugs, distinguished by extensive literature searches into various drugs, and peer review. They convened the International Drugs Consensus Working Party, an unpaid research collective, to help sift the evidence and finalize their results. The book was published in several languages as a non-profit venture and distributed privately by Dutch, Spanish, German, Canadian and American organisations. Initial legal uncertainties and concerns about adverse publicity however persuaded Exit to release it in Scotland only under the title of a new 'Supplement' to How to Die With Dignity. Docker & Smith's technical data in support of Departing Drugs was published in a separate volume called Beyond Final Exit, with another contributing author, Bruce Dunn, whose chapter on inert gases laid the foundations for the 'helium method' of suicide. In 2007 a major revision was needed and Exit published Five Last Acts, a larger book (187 pages) that detailed the use of helium and four other main methods of rational suicide, most of which were not covered in Departing Drugs. A similar methodology was used, examining the science behind its assertions. The Five Last Acts series is distinguished by footnotes and citations to evidence. Although the first edition was made available only to members of Exit and other right-to-die societies under strict conditions, such distribution methods were augmented in subsequent editions by placing these more substantial books on general release. Five Last Acts II followed in 2010, and Five Last Acts - The Exit Path in 2013. A major update to the latter was released in May 2015 after concerns had been raised over helium balloon gas being diluted with air by some manufacturers. Exit then published the world's first guide to using welding gas nitrogen as an alternative.Docker C, Five Last Acts ‚Äì The Exit Path (2015), pages 179-206ISBN 9781512176445. Exit worked for the acceptance of the living will (Advance health care directive), initially advocating a living will using a Scottish legal instrument known as the Tutor Dative, and then revising its templates in accordance with developing legislation and the use of Values Histories. Exit highlights both the benefits and shortcomings of advance health care directives and has sought to establish proper understanding by means of contributing chapters in both the academic and legal press. Exit's Director, Chris Docker, has worked for the organisation since 1980. He holds a post-graduate degree from Glasgow University and has lectured at undergraduate and post-graduate level, also writing on end-of-life issues for academic students (Dartmouth), and the legal profession, and winning an award for his research into death by refusing food and liquids.  Structure  Exit uses the Carver Model of Policy Governance in the running of its affairs to ensure strict adherence to its aims. Exit accepts members worldwide. It publishes a substantial magazine, Exit Newsletter, with updates on self-deliverance and living wills, and a mixture of academic and light- reading articles on these subjects. Contributors have included well-known names including Peter Singer, Helga Kuhse, Colin Brewer, Faye Girsh, Sheila McLean, Michael Irwin, Derek Humphry, Arthur Caplan, Kenyon Mason, Ludovic Kennedy, Rev. A Bennett, Alexander McCall Smith, John Beloff, (Bishop) Michael Hare Duke, Oswald Hanfling, Wendy Savage, (Bishop) Alastair Haggart, Philip Nitschke, Janet Radcliffe Richards and Robin Downie. It conducts full-day hands-on workshops for members. Exit works within existing law so does not engage in civil disobedience or one-one-one direct assistance in suicide. Exit is independent and not connected with other organisations of the same or similar name, such as the Australian group, Exit International; the Finnish group, Exitus; the Italian group called Exit, or the two German Groups, Exit ADMD and EXIT-Deutsche Schweiz) but networks with scientific groups and its members worldwide.  Campaigning  Exit advocates a 'permissive' model for legal reform to allow 'exceptions to the rule' against euthanasia or assisted suicide. It was involved in a major initiative of Glasgow University's Institute of Law & Ethics in Medicine to look at the feasibility of a law on physician-assisted suicide for the UK.

Prior to the law's passage, it was not possible to lose U.S. citizenship while in U.S. territory except by conviction for treason; the Renunciation Act allowed people physically present in the U.S. to renounce citizenship when the country was in a state of war by making an application to the Attorney General. The intention of the 1944 Act was to encourage Japanese American internees to renounce citizenship so that they could be deported to Japan. After the end of World War II, those who wanted their U.S. citizenship restored were generally successful at arguing before federal courts that their renunciations pursuant to the 1944 Act had been made under duress and were therefore invalid. The law remained in effect but received little further attention until the 2000s, when a prisoner interested in renouncing U.S. citizenship won a ruling from a federal court that the U.S. was indeed in a \\"state of war\\" at the time for purposes of the 1944 Act. Other prisoners sought to renounce citizenship under the 1944 Act but could not fulfill an administrative requirement that they appear in person at a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office for an interview ‚Äî a requirement whose legality was upheld twice by federal courts ‚Äî or that they depart from the United States immediately after having their renunciation application approved. A 2013 immigration reform bill contained provisions to repeal the 1944 Act. Overview The Renunciation Act of 1944 has no official short title; its long title was \\"A bill to provide for the loss of United States nationality under certain circumstances\\". Another unofficial name for it is the Denationalization Act of 1944. It is also officially referred to as the Act of July 1, 1944, a name it shares with the Public Health Service Act. It added the following item to the list of actions in Nationality Act of 1940 ¬ß 401 () which would result in loss of nationality by a United States citizen or non-citizen national: :making in the United States a formal written renunciation of nationality in such form as may be prescribed by, and before such officer as may be designated by, the Attorney General, whenever the United States shall be in a state of war and the Attorney General shall approve such renunciation as not contrary to the interests of national defense. Due to immigration law reforms and the removal of other items from the list of actions causing loss of nationality, the exact subsection number of this provision has changed over the years. It appeared in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 at ¬ß 349(a)(7).. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 did not alter ¬ß 349 at all. et seq. It currently stands at INA ¬ß 349(a)(6) (). Legislative history Under the Nationality Act of 1940 as it stood originally, renunciation of citizenship could only be performed before a United States diplomatic officer overseas. In December 1943, Martin Dies, Jr. (D-TX) asked Attorney General Francis Biddle to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee to testify on the handling of internees seeking to depart from the United States for Japan; Biddle recommended amending the 1940 Act to permit loss of nationality by persons on U.S. soil. Biddle and the Department of Justice drafted a bill to that effect and were significantly involved in efforts to lobby Congress for support. Edward Ennis of the Department of Justice estimated that between one and three thousand Japanese Americans would renounce citizenship under the law's provisions. Ennis saw the bill as crucial to the DOJ's efforts to retain custody of Japanese Americans suspected of disloyalty; he feared that the courts would find continued internment of U.S. citizens to be unconstitutional, and hoped that \\"militants\\" among Japanese American internees would voluntarily renounce citizenship under the bill's provisions, in which case the DOJ could continue to detain them until they could be deported to Japan. A. Leonard Allen (D-LA) introduced the bill on February 1, 1944. It was referred to the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, which unanimously reported the bill two days later. Allen first spoke about the bill on the House floor on February 8; he described it as \\"a bill to expatriate certain Japanese nationals ... who have openly avowed their disloyalty to the United States and have disclaimed loyalty to the United States, although they were born in this country\\". There was further debate on the bill on February 16. A number of West Coast representatives criticized it as insufficiently far-reaching for its failure to consider alleged renunciations of citizenship prior to the bill's enactment. J. Leroy Johnson (R-CA) thus moved an amendment to the bill to allow the Attorney General to consider all statements of renunciation of citizenship as far back as October 1940. In support, Clair Engle (D-CA) pointed to the refusal of 5,376 internees to \\"swear unqualified allegiance to the United States and renounce Japan\\" as an example of the type of alleged renunciations of citizenship which the original bill failed to consider, while Bertrand W. Gearhart (R-CA) noted that many internees who had earlier expressed enthusiasm for Japan were less vocal due to the defeats the country had suffered in battle and urged that their statements not go unpunished. The previous week, Gearhart had also introduced a bill which would strip Japanese Americans of citizenship unless they swore an oath of allegiance to the United States in a court of naturalization within 60 days after the date of his bill's passage rejecting the divinity of the Emperor of Japan and the \\"divine mission\\" of the \\"Yamato race\\". He stated that \\"I am convinced that the method I propose, constitutional in all of its aspects, will reveal a large number of Japanese who are earnestly hoping for our defeat, secretly doing everything they can to insure a victory for our despicable foes.\\" However, Samuel Dickstein (D-NY), chairman of the House immigration committee, opposed Johnson's amendment, stating that Congress had no authority to revoke the citizenship of birthright citizens. Earl C. Michener (R-MI) warned of the potential for abuse, saying that \\"if the amendment were adopted, it would mean that anybody who at any time said anything which might be construed as unpatriotic could be brought in.\\" Bill sponsor A. Leonard Allen (D-LA) and Richard F. Harless (D-AZ) also spoke out against the amendment, sympathizing with the motivations of the amendment's proponents while stating that it was probably unconstitutional. In the end, Johnson's amendment was defeated by a narrow margin. The bill itself in its original form passed the House on February 23. The Senate Committee on Immigration reported the bill without amendment on June 22. Rufus C. Holman (R-OR) initially objected, suggesting that the bill should be amended to insert the word \\"voluntarily\\", but Wallace H. White, Jr. (R-ME) pointed out to him that the Nationality Act of 1940 already required that any action specified as causing loss of nationality would only have that effect if it were undertaken voluntarily, and Holman withdrew his objection. White brought the bill up for consideration on June 23, stating that \\"[t]he reason I have asked to have the bill considered at this time is that we are hopeful that a number of Japanese will take advantage of the procedure outlined in the bill so that we may offer them to the Imperial Government of Japan in exchange for American citizens who are now being held\\", and the bill passed that day. After the bill passed the Senate, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed it into law on July 1. World War II renunciations The vast majority of renunciants came from the Tule Lake internment camp (pictured). Biddle and the Department of Justice began implementing procedures under the Act in October 1944. Each internee seeking to renounce citizenship would have to fill out a standard application form identifying him or herself and signing a statement that \\"I fully understand that if permitted to renounce my United States nationality I will divest myself of all rights and privileges thereunto pertaining\\". This application would be followed by an administrative hearing to determine whether or not Biddle should grant approval in his capacity as Attorney General. Each renunciant whose application was successful would receive a \\"Notice of Approval of Renunciation\\" as proof. Many renunciants would later face stigmatization in the Japanese American community, during and after the war, for having made that choice, although at the time they were not certain what their futures held were they to remain American and remain interned. These renunciations of American citizenship have been highly controversial, for a number of reasons. Some apologists for internment have cited the renunciations as evidence that \\"disloyalty\\" or anti-Americanism was well represented among the interned peoples, thereby justifying the internment. Many historians have dismissed the latter argument, for its failure to consider that the small number of individuals in question were in the midst of persecution by their own government at the time of the \\"renunciation\\": > [T]he renunciations had little to do with \\"loyalty\\" or \\"disloyalty\\" to the > United States, but were instead the result of a series of complex conditions > and factors that were beyond the control of those involved. Prior to > discarding citizenship, most or all of the renunciants had experienced the > following misfortunes: forced removal from homes; loss of jobs; government > and public assumption of disloyalty to the land of their birth based on race > alone; and incarceration in a \\"segregation center\\" for \\"disloyal\\" ISSEI or > NISEI... Minoru Kiyota, who was among those who renounced his citizenship and swiftly came to regret the decision, has stated that he wanted only \\"to express my fury toward the government of the United States,\\" for his internment and for the mental and physical duress, as well as the intimidation, he was made to face. > [M]y renunciation had been an expression of momentary emotional defiance in > reaction to years of persecution suffered by myself and other Japanese > Americans and, in particular, to the degrading interrogation by the FBI > agent at Topaz and being terrorized by the guards and gangs at Tule Lake. San Francisco attorney Wayne M. Collins helped many people who had renounced citizenship under the provisions of the 1944 Act to have the government's recognition of their renunciations reversed. On Independence Day in 1967, the Department of Justice promulgated regulations which would make it unnecessary for renunciants to resort to the courts; they could instead fill out a standard form to request an administrative determination of the validity of their earlier renunciations., \\"Japanese renunciation of nationality\\". However, not all renunciants sought to regain their citizenship; Joseph Kurihara, for example, chose instead to accept repatriation to Japan, and lived out the rest of his life there. Later case law =Definition of \\"state of war\\"= Later case law on the Renunciation Act of 1944 focused on the meaning of the term \\"state of war\\". Congress passed a joint resolution that July 25, 1947, \\"shall be deemed to be the date of the termination of any state of war heretofore declared by the Congress and of the national emergencies proclaimed by the President on September 8, 1939, and on May 27, 1941\\", in the interpretation of a large number of statutes, including the Renunciation Act of 1944.; Public Law 80-219; et seq. The Renunciation Act of 1944 is specifically listed in Section 3 of the joint resolution, at . The executive branch interpreted \\"state of war\\" to exclude the Vietnam War. The Immigration and Naturalization Service wrote that \\"It has also been determined that, for purposes of current section 349(a)(7), the United States has not been in a state war during the period of the Viet Nam hostilities, and is not now in a state of war by reason of that conflict. Accordingly, any attempt to renounce citizenship within the United States under the current provision, based upon the Viet Nam conflict, should be regarded as ineffectual.\\" In an obiter dictum in a 1970 Board of Immigration Appeals decision on the deportation case against Thomas Jolley, a North Carolina man who renounced U.S. citizenship in Toronto but later returned to the United States, Anthony Montaquila noted that \\"[t]he Immigration and Naturalization Service receives communications from persons in the United States imprisoned for crime who wish to renounce their citizenship, and those who wish to avoid military service. ... However, there are no procedures in the present laws as was the case involving Japanese renunciants during World War II.\\" In 2004, James Kaufman, a Wisconsin prisoner, attempted to use the Renunciation Act of 1944 to renounce his U.S. citizenship. When his application was ignored, he filed a pro se suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which ruled against him. Kaufman's legal battles would go on for several years, and in 2008 he made another attempt to renounce his citizenship under the same law. He appealed to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where Judges Judith W. Rogers, A. Raymond Randolph and Harry T. Edwards remanded Kaufman's case to the District Court for another hearing, writing that \\"we do not understand the government to suggest that a congressionally created right can be nullified by government inaction\\". In 2010, Judge Richard W. Roberts ruled that the U.S. was indeed in a state of war in both 2004 and 2008, rejecting assertions by the Department of Justice that the law was ambiguous and that the DOJ should be permitted to interpret the term \\"state of war\\" as it saw fit in administering the statute. The DOJ appealed Roberts' ruling to the D.C. Circuit Court. However, attorneys for the Department of Justice abandoned the appeal in August 2010, while declining to make public comment on their reasons for that decision. =Requirement to renounce in person= In various instances in 2011, other U.S. citizens serving prison sentences enquired with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) about renouncing their U.S. citizenship under the Renunciation Act of 1944. USCIS responded that they would have to appear in person at a designated USCIS office for an interview, a requirement which they could not fulfill due to their imprisonment, and that until the interview USCIS would hold their applications in abeyance. Two filed separate suits in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Sluss v. USCIS One pro se case, Sluss v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, came before Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle in 2012. Plaintiff Matthew David Sluss argued that the requirement to appear at a USCIS office in person violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because that requirement did not appear anywhere in the text of the Renunciation Act of 1944. Huvelle disagreed, writing in her memorandum opinion that \\"the statute requires the agency to assess the voluntariness of an applicant‚Äôs renouncement without stating how such an assessment should occur\\", and thus found that no APA violation had occurred. Schnitzler v. United States In another case, Schnitzler v. United States, plaintiff Aaron Schnitzler first appeared pro se, but later gained representation. In the initial District Court case, Judge Reggie Walton construed Schnitzler's filing as a motion for a writ of mandamus against USCIS compelling them to process his application for renunciation, as well as a declaration that the Renunciation Act of 1944 was unconstitutional. Walton declined to grant relief, writing in his memorandum opinion that Schnitzler lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute and that USCIS had already acted on his application; with regards to Schnitzler's right to renounce his citizenship, Walton quoted the Supreme Court case Hewitt v. Helms, where it was stated that \\"[l]awful incarceration brings about the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal system.\\" Represented by students in Georgetown University Law Center's Appellate Litigation Program, in 2014 Schnitzler challenged Walton's decision in the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, before Chief Judge Merrick B. Garland and Circuit Judges Robert L. Wilkins and Douglas H. Ginsburg. The ruling first disagreed that Schnitzler lacked standing to challenge the renunciation statutes, stating that as he remained a citizen against his wishes, he had grounds to seek redress against what he viewed as an injury. The ruling further criticized the lower court for construing Schnitzler's filings as a motion for a writ of mandamus and concluding that USCIS' response meant he had obtained the relief he sought, and for stating that Schnitzler had no standing to challenge USCIS' policy either. Garland noted that the government \\"offered a blizzard of constantly changing explanations for why it could not process [Schnitzler]'s request\\", and in the end USCIS did not actually inform Schnitzler of the in- person interview policy before he filed his initial challenge in the District Court (a letter informing Schnitlzer of the policy did not get mailed out). Schnitzler's case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings. =Requirement to depart from the United States after renunciation= In a separate instance in 2012, Alan Horowitz, a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, also inquired with USCIS about renouncing U.S. citizenship under the Renunciation Act of 1944. USCIS responded that he must attend an interview at a USCIS office and demonstrate that he met all of the legal requirements to renounce his citizenship, in particular that he had the \\"ability and intention to depart the [United States] immediately upon having [his] renunciation request granted.\\" Horowitz had just been released from a New York state prison, but the New York Attorney General directed, pursuant to the state's Mental Hygiene Law, that Horowitz either remain in custody of the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) pending further proceedings or be committed to a custodial treatment facility. The New York Supreme Court granted Horowitz' motion for an order directing DOCCS to produce him at a USCIS office for the in-person interview. However, he failed to actually secure the right to depart from the United States: the court rejected his argument that differing treatment of alien and dual-citizen offenders ‚Äî in particular, the fact that an alien in his circumstances would be deported after completion of sentence, whereas citizens faced barriers to leaving ‚Äî violated his right to equal protection and substantive due process. Horowitz appealed, but in 2014 the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's ruling.

Companies are urged to be aware when dealing with extensive red tape when obtaining licenses and permits, especially construction related permits, and that the demand for and supply of bribes are commonplace in this process. The 2010 Anti-Corruption Law provides no protection to whistleblowers, and whistleblowers can be jailed for up to 6 months if they report corruption that cannot be proven.  Extent  Human trafficking in Cambodia and sex trafficking in Cambodia are significant problems. The anti human trafficking unit in Phnom Penh is the epitome of that. Bribes to arrest innocent people have been accepted and sexual favors from prostitutes have been demanded and recorded by NGOs. Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 161st place out of 180 countries.  Anti-corruption efforts  The Cambodian government has made developments in their fight against corruption. In January 2012, the National Assembly passed Cambodia's first law on public procurement in a bid to fight endemic corruption in the public sector. In 2010, the government established the National Arbitration Center, Cambodia's first alternative dispute resolution mechanism, to enable companies to resolve commercial disputes more quickly and inexpensively than through the court system. Official operation of the center was delayed until early 2012. The Cambodian government passed the Anti-Corruption Law in March 2010. Under the new law, any official found guilty of corruption can face up to 15 years in prison. Under Cambodia's Anti-Corruption Law, people who resort to facilitation payments to obtain government services will now face harsh penalties; this also applies to government officials on the receiving end.

The group is based in Jutland, and most of their investigations center on locations in Jutland. They do, however, occasionally investigate locations on other parts of Denmark. In 2013, Ghosthunting.dk, along with another group called Dansk Parapsykologisk Aspekt, became the main subject of the reality show Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne. Structure and methods Ghosthunting.dk is led by Thomas Andersen who supervises all activities by the group's ordinary members. One ordinary member holds the title of 'researcher' and is responsible for gathering information on the locations investigated prior to the investigation. That role was held by Harriet Wraa, whose exit from the group was depicted in an episode of Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne. The group makes use of methods typically associated with ghost hunting such as EMF meters, digital camera surveillance, EVP-recorders, and ghost boxes, as well as attempts at interacting with paranormal phenomena. Ghosthunting.dk typically make available recorded material from their investigations on their homepage - typically longer video clips and interesting audio recordings - offering their analyses and inviting the readers to make their own interpretations. Media coverage The group has been covered in various Danish media including national and local TV networks, national and local radio networks, and regional and national newspapers and magazines. The group gained national fame when they became the main subject of the reality show Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne, which was aired on Kanal 5 in 2013, which depicted both aspects of the group's investigations and the private lives of the individual members. Famously, the group's researcher Harriet Wraa was dismissed from the group in the fifth episode. On their Facebook page, several members of Ghosthunting.dk have expressed their dissatisfaction with the editing of Sp√∏gelsesj√¶gerne, arguing that a lot of important information is left out and that there is too much focus on the members' private lives and too little focus on the ghost hunting itself in the series.

Mukundan. According to the author, the novel is an attempt to re-define nostalgia which is thought to be the essence of life of non-resident Malayalis and to pay respect to hundreds of thousands of Malayalis living as non-resident Keralites in different parts of the world. It is a novel that travels through generations. It depicts a clear picture of the life stories of various persons living in various parts of the world as non-resident Keralites. It explains us about the different kinds of feelings of various kinds of people who had left their homeland for various reasons. These reasons include the emigration for the sake of seeking a better profession, for studies, for getting a better class of living and so on. But almost all of them dreams of returning to their homeland one day and enjoying the homeliness. One of the issues the books addresses is the question of cultural identity of the Malayali.\\"'Pravasam' is an attempt to redefine nostalgia, says M. Mukundan\\". The Hindu. 18 August 2008. Retrieved 2 July 2013. A notable fact about the novel is that renowned Malayalam author S. K. Pottekkatt is a major character in the narrative. In the beginning, the narration is given such that, story is told by Pottekkatt and after his death, it was completed by Mukundan. Even, the narrator, himself is a non-resident Keralite and has many experiences to share with the readers. Whatever amenities the emigration life had provided them, each one of them, deep in their mind had a strong desire to come back to their native land one day. This uncontrolled emotions and sentiments of Malayalis towards their homeland is clearly illustrated in the story.

Three slightly different prototypes were built but there was no series production. Design and development LFG Roland D.IX second prototype Late in 1917 new, more powerful rotary engines were appearing and the Idflieg encouraged aircraft manufacturers to incorporate them into fighters. The D.IX was LFG Roland's response. Apart from its engine it had much in common with the earlier D.VI, D.VII and D.VIII designs. It was a two bay biplane, with straight wings of constant chord and blunt tips. The upper plane was a little larger in both span and chord, so the two interplane struts on each side diverged slightly upwards and leant gently outwards. Bracing was assisted by flying and landing wires. There were ailerons on the upper wing only, the first and third prototypes using the overhung, balanced type and the second with unbalanced ones ending at the wing tip. The D.IX had a fuselage of the Klinkerrumpf (clinker-built fuselage) type, roughly circular in cross section and built from overlapping longitudinal strips of spruce over a light, wooden frame, pioneered by LFG on the D.IV and used on the D.VI, D.VII and D.VIII. Because of the shortness and large diameter of the Siemens-Halske Sh.III geared rotary of the first prototype, the nose of the new fighter was short and blunt compared with those of the earlier aircraft, which had all used liquid cooled V engines. Nonetheless, the metal oil deflecting cowling was carefully blended into the wooden fuselage. The rotary engine drove a four blade propeller, an unusual feature at this time and only fitted to one other LFG fighter, the later D.XVI. The tailplane of the fighter was straight edged with blunt tips and slightly rounded, split elevators. Its vertical tail repeated the small ventral fin of the D.VI and later Rolands and the rudder was similarly deep and rounded, but the tail surfaces of the second prototype were much enlarged and the rudder of the third horn balanced. The D.IX's conventional undercarriage was of the single axle type, mounted on V-struts to the lower fuselage and with a tailskid attached to the ventral fin. As well the ailerons and empennage revisions of the later prototypes, both were powered by the newer, Siemens-Halske Sh.IIIa rotary. Operational history The first prototype flew in the first D type competition, held in January 1918, and performed well but was lost soon after in an accident in which the pilot's seat collapsed, followed by an inadvertent loop with g-forces that expelled him through the fuselage bottom. The armed second prototype continued development and took part in the second D type competition held in May. There it was judged not worthy of series production.

Hamzah's best-praised work, readings have generally focused on religious themes - mainly from an Islamic perspective, although Christian influences have been suggested.  Writing  \\"Padamu Jua\\" was written by Amir Hamzah, a Langkat-born Malay writer who studied in Dutch schools. The poem is not dated (indeed, none of Hamzah's works are) Poet Laurens Koster Bohang considers \\"Padamu Jua\\" to have been written between 1933 and 1937, while Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw dates it to 1936/1937. The time was one of great emotional turmoil for Hamzah, who was required to marry the daughter of the Sultan of Langkat, who had funded his studies in Java. At the time Hamzah had reportedly fallen in love with a Javanese woman while studying, and was forced to leave her.  Structure  The 28-line poem consists of 84 words. It is dominated by the vowels a and u, which are often repeated either as the diphthong au or the hiatus ua; such combinations occur in 35 per cent of the words and 64 per cent of the lines. Consonants are often repeated, emphasising the interconnection between different words in a line.  Analysis  Indonesian literary critic Zuber Usman writes that the poem describes a meeting between Amir Hamzah and God, depicted either as a meeting between lovers or between a servant and his Lord. He writes that the first two lines depict Hamzah's feelings after he was told that he was to be married, how all his hopes for the future were destroyed by the announcement. The next couplet depicts a return to God and Islam, a religion which Hamzah had followed devoutly as a child. The following four lines Usman reads as depicting the light of God, an answer to the emptiness which Hamzah faces. Hamzah diverts his physical love and disappointment over worldly issues, but soon feels disappointed, as if God is toying with him, as if in a fit of jealousy God will not allow him to have his true love. Ultimately he is unable to abandon God, and returns, surrendering himself to a God who hovers \\"between clarity and fogginess\\" However, he must wait ‚Äì alone ‚Äì for God to return. Australian critic of Indonesian literature Keith Foulcher gives a similar reading, while Jassin reads the poem as a statement that Hamzah would like to meet God. Documentarian HB Jassin writes that critics, such as Bakri Siregar, have seen an influence of the Christian God, as depicted in the Bible. He indicates several aspects of the poem that would seem to support such a view, including the depiction of an anthropomorphic God (not allowed in orthodox Islam) and the idea of a jealous God. He writes that the concept of a jealous God is not found in Islam, but is in the Bible, citing and . Jassin, however, attributes this to artistic license, while Foulcher attributes it to a dynamic and unstable God.  Publication and reception  \\"Padamu Jua\\" was first published in the November 1937 issue of Poedjangga Baroe, a literary magazine which Hamzah had helped establish, together with the rest of Nyanyi Sunyi. It was later published as the first titled poem in a standalone book; the collection had seen its third printing by 1949. An English translation by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, Sabina Thornton, and Burton Raffel was published in 1967. \\"Padamu Jua\\" has been used in several school books for teaching Indonesian at senior high school levels. \\"Padamu Jua\\" is Hamzah's best-praised work. Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw described the poem as most valuable, with \\"the most direct, most powerful, most exact, and most period-appropriate formulation of the relationship between God and humans\\".

He was evidently an influential person: his unnamed son had family ties to Andronikos III, and George himself is attested as speaking first in imperial councils, even before Andronikos III's close friend and aide, the megas domestikos John Kantakouzenos.Guilland (1967), pp. 240‚Äì241 In 1339, he is also attested as head (kephalatikeuon) of one of the districts of Constantinople. In the civil war of 1341‚Äì1347 he remained loyal to Andronikos III's under-age son, John V Palaiologos, and opposed Kantakouzenos; as a reward, he was raised to the post of megas stratopedarches on the occasion of John V's coronation on 19 November 1341.Guilland (1967), pp. 241, 503, 508 One of his nieces even became the second wife of one of the chief leaders of John V's regency council, Alexios Apokaukos, but in late 1342 Choumnos fell out with Apokaukos when he pleaded in favour of making peace with Kantakouzenos, and was placed under house arrest.Guilland (1967), pp. 241, 508 He is possibly to be identified with a monk named Gerasimos Choumnos, which would indicate that at some point soon after he was forced to retire to a monastery.Guilland (1967), p. 508  References  Sources  Category:13th-century births Category:14th- century deaths Category:14th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine governors of Thessalonica Category:Byzantine officials Category:Byzantine prisoners and detainees George Category:Megaloi stratopedarchai ","title":"George Choumnos"},{"id":"39838091","text":"The Huar√≥n mine is a large polymetallic (Zn-Pb-Ag-Cu) located in the center of Peru in Pasco Region.

It was commissioned by the Swedish Radio and Rikskonserter and was eventually finished in 1991. It is dedicated to Swedish trombonist Christian Lindberg.  Composition  Christian Lindberg traveled to Paris to meet Xenakis for the first time and audition for him. Xenakis told him he didn't have more time, so he asked Xenakis if he could write a trombone concerto for Lindberg. Xenakis declined the proposition and Lindberg went back home. However, he received a composition for solo trombone, Keren, a few years later, in 1985. It required very high skills to be played, so he manage to work on all the difficult passages and sent a recording of the piece to Xenakis. Xenakis replied to him with great satisfaction that he could finish a trombone concerto for him on June 1991. When Lindberg received Troorkh, he considered it to be \\"practically unplayable\\", with 56 high Fs and 2 F-sharps. However, he was ready to premiere it in 1993, in which he received a standing ovation. Subsequently, Xenakis sent him 28 red roses, half a rose each high F, and stated that, in his opinion, Lindberg was the best trombone player at that time. This composition is his last composition for a solo instrument and orchestra.  Analysis  The title of this composition comes from \\"trombone\\" and \\"orchestra\\", taking into consideration that the sound of \\"kh\\" comes from Ancient Greek. This is a single movement composition and takes 16‚Äì20 minutes to perform. Several analysis methods have been proposed for this composition. As Anders Jall√©n states, Xenakis treats the orchestra in a dense and opaque way, turning it into only one instruments and not treating it as a combination of instruments. Glissandi and pizzicati, which were his trademarks in early works, are not as present in these late works. The composition starts with a tritone played by the winds. Then, the strings join in playing clusters of music which are further developed afterwards. The composition also features \\"arborescences\\", a composition technique developed by Xenakis which consists of \\"branchings that come off of a rooted tree\\".

There are ten rental properties on the estate as well as an equestrian center with outdoor and indoor riding arenas. Denmark's biggest gold hoard from the Migration Period was found at Broholm. History In 1326 the estate was owned by Absalon Jonsen Ulfeldt. From 1641, it was inherited by the Skeel and Sehested families for whom it was the seat from 1759 to 1930. The main wing with its round tower was built for Otte Skeel in 1644. In 1839, it was renovated in the Neo-Gothic style by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch. The corner tower was added in 1895 and the south wing in 1905. Substantial renovation and adaptation work was carried out in the 1920s and the 1950s.\\"Broholm\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 2 July 2013. Part of the premises has now been converted into a hotel. There is also a museum of antiquities on the estate. Archaeological finds One of the archaeological open-air themes recorded is of an antiquary of a log cabin built with flint axes. N.F.B. Sehested, a nobleman of Danish descent, collected flint axes between 1878 and 1881. With these archaeological finds he built a log cabin by using them as tools by handling and sharing them. The cabin was completed in 1887. This cabin was made initially in the Broholm estate where it has been restored. The Museum of North Antiquities is part of the manor and it has 10,000 antiquaries collected by Sehested, then (1881), owner of the manor. These antiquaries are a collection from an area of around the manor house. These finds are dated to the Stone, Bronze and Iron ages. In addition, some gold ornaments were also found on the estate. Excavations revealed the Broholm gold hoard with an approximate weight of 4.15 kg. Deemed to be the biggest gold hoard of the country from the Migration Period, items include golden bracteates, as well as necklaces and pieces worn on the arm. Broholm dog Broholmer dog The estate is also famous for breeding of Broholmer dogs, of the St. Bernard Dog class of dogs with short hair with links to the pedigree of German Bulldog. These dogs are reported to be a common sight in the Copenhagen neighborhood. It is a national breed and the Copenhagen Kennel Club was charged with breeding them and establishing their pedigree. The Danish dog is also reported to be closely related to the English Mastiff.

Historical evidence may suggest that the plaza is the site where the wooden palisade of Rajah Sulayman, on top of which Fort Santiago was built, was located, and was deliberately allocated by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi as the smaller of two open squares in Intramuros, the other being the larger Plaza Mayor (today's Plaza de Roma). Military barracks and storehouses surrounded the plaza, the ruins of which stand today. Currently, the plaza is an open green area surrounded by trees. At the western side of the plaza is the Rizal Shrine, erected in honor of Jos√© Rizal, who was imprisoned there prior to his execution in 1896, when the building was still being used as military barracks. The Shrine includes a statue of Rizal which was erected at the center of the plaza. To the north is a cross erected in memory of World War II victims who were buried in a mass grave underneath by the Imperial Japanese Army, while the eastern side contains an eighteenth-century building which was converted into the Dulaang Raha Sulayman (Rajah Sulayman Theater), the venue of seasonal performances by the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA).

Hansen (born July 3, 1960) is a bilingual American writer known in Germany for his humorous non-fiction, critical satire and novels.  Life  Eric T. Hansen was born in Bellingham, Washington, and moved with his family to Hawaii when he was six. He was raised a Mormon and served a two-year mission to West Germany from 1980, where he also met his future wife. He then returned to Germany to study at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Munich, where he earned a Masters in the literature of the German Middle Ages in 1989.http://www.wdr.de/tv/hartaberfair/sendungen/2012/0625/hansen.php5 After leaving university, Hansen began a career as a freelance journalist writing about German politics, media and culture for American and British publications including The European, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter (where he was German Bureau Chief), The Washington Post.http://kreuzer-leipzig.de/2007/11/28/ein- ami-blickt-auf-germany/ In 2001/2002 he took a one-year trip through Germany in a VW Bus in search of the Middle Ages and turned his experiences into the travel book Die Nibelungenreise (The Nibelung Trip), which was published only in German. His second book, Planet Germany, about Germany through the eyes of an American and written in German, was a bestseller. Since then, he has continued writing books in German as well as articles for German publications including Cicero, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, GEO and, currently, a political column for the online edition of the leading weekly German newspaper, Die Zeit. Starting with Planet Germany, Hansen has written all his books entirely in German with his co-writer and companion Astrid Ule, who had translated Nibelungenreise from English, and with whom Hansen writes thrillers under the pseudonym \\"Ule Hansen\\". Hansen also occasionally appears in German television and has written and spoken a satirical weekly radio column about Berlin for the local station RadioEins. Hansen is divorced and is no longer a member of the LDS Church; he currently lives with Astrid Ule in Berlin.  \\"The Hansen method\\"  Hansen‚Äôs books tend to combine journalistic research with political analysis and humor or even sarcasm and gravitate toward themes that question popular German attitudes. For example, while many Germans tend to think of themselves as \\"americanized\\" and as \\"critical thinkers\\", Hansen goes out of his way to prove that \\"americanization\\" is a mythhttp://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/heimatbuch-planet-germany-die- deutschen-schwedenselig-verzagt-und-beinbehaart-a-464663.html and that \\"critical thinking\\" is often no more than a sophisticated way of complaining.http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/digitaz/artikel/?ressort=ku&dig;=2010%2F10%2F26%2Fa0101&cHash;=5b36ad9091 While many Germans tend to perceive American conservatives in a negative light, Hansen in various articles during the 2012 US-presidential election explained the rationale behind the sometimes extreme positions of both parties and criticized the often one-sided perspective in the German press. The critic Henryk M. Broder in the newsweekly Der Spiegel has noted Hansen's fervor for attacking sacred cows and identified \\"the Hansen method\\" as forcing readers to view themselves from an unfamiliar and uncomfortable perspective.  Hula Ink  In 2015 Hansen launched a micropublisher named Hula Ink, specializing in literary fiction and non-fiction, mostly short e-books. In 2017, Hula Ink published its first print edition, Hansen's book-length essay \\"Losing My Religion.\\"  Ule Hansen  In 2016, Hansen and Ule launched a series of thrillers under the pseudonym \\"Ule Hansen,\\" starting with Neunt√∂ter, the first in the announced Emma Carow trilogy, set in Berlin.
